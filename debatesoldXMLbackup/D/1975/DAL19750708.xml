    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 34:</P>
    <P>In page 47, to delete subparagraph (3), and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) (a) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) a company incurs expenditure on the construction of any building, structure or works, being expenditure allowable as a deduction under subparagraph (1) in computing a gain accruing to the company on the disposal of the building, structure or works, or any asset comprising it,</P>
    <P>(ii) that expenditure was defrayed out of borrowed money, and</P>
    <P>(iii) the company charged to capital all or any part of the interest on that borrowed money referable to a period ending on or before the disposal,</P>
    <P>the sums so allowable under the said subparagraph (1) shall include the amount of that interest charged to capital except in so far as such <Col N="776" /> interest has been taken into account for the purposes of relief under the Income Tax Acts, or could have been so taken into account but for an insufficiency of income or profits or gains.</P>
    <P>(b) Subject to clause (a), no payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Finance.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out that the Minister's amendment goes part of the way we sought he should go in so far as it is allowing interest as an expense for deduction, like other expenses allowed in the Bill, in the computation of capital gains.  The Bill as drafted had a specific prohibition on the allowance of interest.  We pointed out on Second Stage, and on Committee Stage, that this was wrong especially having regard to the fact that the Bill provided for the allowance of deduction of costs of architectural fees and other expenses, and, in certain circumstances, advertising and matters of that kind.  Interest is an expense; it is the cost of money.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone some of the way in so far as he now proposes to allow interest as a deduction in the case of companies only where the expenditure has been incurred on the construction of any building, structure or works.  In so far as the amendment goes in allowing interest to be deducted in the case of companies that, since it is only in respect of expenditure on the construction of any building, structure or works, will not apply in many cases where it should be allowed.  Its principal value&mdash;not its only value&mdash;would be in the case of companies which are property developers. I say not its only value because other companies can engage in and undertake expenditure on construction of buildings, structures or works but other companies will also undertake expenditure of other kinds in respect of which they will incur a liability for interest.  As I read this amendment that interest will not be allowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out on Committee Stage that it was necessary that interest <Col N="777" /> should be allowed also in the case of individuals.  The moving of this amendment by the Minister indicates that he accepts clearly the obligation to allow interest but he does not allow it in the case of individuals primarily, as I understand it from what the Minister has said, because he would find it difficult to police this.  He feels that the accounts in respect of companies are such that he could police it but in the case of individuals he feels he cannot.  I understand the difficulties the Minister has in mind but I do not think they are sufficient to justify the Minister in not allowing it in the case of individuals.  The allowance of interest is so fundamental that the onus is on the Minister to ensure that this can be done. Heretofore in effect under the law in the case of individuals we have not been concerned with a division between capital and current expenditure but, in the case of capital gains, we have to be concerned with such. Therefore, I submit that the onus is on the Minister to devise a structure which will enable that to be done.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that it is not sufficient for the Minister simply to say that that is too difficult and he will not allow interest to be deducted in the case of individuals.  I suggest that is trying to make the individual conform to the system instead of making the system conform to the requirements of the individual.  I should like to know whether the non-allowance of interest is not repugnant to the Constitution. Where an individual has genuinely incurred interest related only to the cost of acquisition of the asset and has subsequently sold the asset the non-allowance of interest as a deduction will result in taxation on a profit which was never made. It is worse than the non-allowance for inflation which can also result in taxation on an apparent profit which is a real loss but at least in that case it is an apparent profit.  In the case of the non-allowance of interest it is not even an apparent profit.  In certain circumstances it can be clearly a loss but because of the non-allowance of interest the Bill will deem the individual concerned to have made a profit. It will deem the individual to have <Col N="778" /> made a gain and to apply capital gains tax to it.  I suggest that the taxation of a gain or profit which the individual did not make is likely to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it should be understood that the non-allowance of interest, except in so far as the Minister now proposes to allow it in this amendment, is not confined to what we might call private transactions but covers all trading transactions.  In the case of such trading transactions no allowance will be made in respect of interest except in the circumstances outlined in this amendment, that is where the taxpayer is a company and where the expenditure incurred was on the construction of any building, structure or works. Therefore, in the case of business or trade there is a very wide range of activities in respect of which interest is normally incurred in which interest will not be allowed as a deduction and in which, in consequence, tax will be applied where there is a real loss or it will be applied to a gain which is substantially higher than the real gain. That being so, I do not think one can say this amendment, although it is on the right lines, goes nearly as far as it should go.</P>
    <P>It was pointed out in discussion on this matter on Committee Stage that there are circumstances in which it may not suit an individual to form a limited liability company.  Deputy Paddy Belton was one of those who pointed this out.  It was also pointed out that in many cases even where there is a limited liability company the bank concerned, if it is a bank which is advancing the money on which the interest arises, will require the personal guarantee of the individual and that effectively it is the individual who is obtaining the loan and incurring the liability for the interest.  The Minister has indicated that he considers that the cost of the formation of a limited liability company is relatively so small that it is easy enough for an individual to conform with the requirements of the Bill by forming a limited liability company.  Of course, that does not cover the case in which a liability for capital gains tax has arisen and in which interest is not going to be allowed because it is the case of an <Col N="779" /> individual prior to the passing of this Bill and the liability, of course, goes back quite some distance so that the Minister's suggestion about the formation of a limited liability company does not cover that situation at all.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out also that even as far as cases in the future are concerned it does not always suit the individual to do his business by way of a limited liability company and even if it did there is no good reason why he should be compelled, for the sake of the administrative convenience of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners, to do his business in this way.  Heretofore, I have always understood that the question of whether business would be done by an individual or by a limited liability company is a matter of individual choice but effectively what the Minister is saying here is that if you want to do any business and get any benefit by way of deduction of interest in assessment of capital gains tax then you will form a limited liability company and if you do not you will get no such benefit.  I do not think the Minister is entitled to approach the matter in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say, of course, in relation to the non-allowance of interest in respect of trading assets other than those covered in this amendment that such assets get rollover relief but I have repeatedly pointed out to the Minister and, in effect, he has acknowledged this, that this is merely a postponement or deferment of liability for tax, that it is not relief from tax.  Therefore, if interest is not allowed as a deduction in respect of expenses incurred in the case of trading assets ultimately the capital gains tax will have to be paid on what is either an imaginary gain or a gain which is artificially increased because there is no allowance for deduction in respect of interest.</P>
    <P>There was another aspect that was referred to on this matter on Committee Stage.  Deputy O'Malley is reported in the Official Report of 28th May, 1975, at column 1173 as follows:</P>
    <P>It strengthens the point I am <Col N="780" /> making, that no purchaser willingly involves himself in that kind of situation, where he may have to pay a rate of interest as high as that on delay in closing the sale. Therefore, with the very high rates current nowadays no purchaser willingly delays the closing any longer than he need, or beyond the closing date specified in the contract. The delay may be due to problems of title or a variety of other matters but, if that interest does become payable, certainly it should be allowable as a deduction so far as capital gains are concerned because it is an expense of purchase in the same way as are the various forms of fees, stamp duty, Land Registry fees or anything else.</P>
    <P>Therefore in making the amendment he proposes on Report Stage the Minister should bear in mind that that type of interest, as opposed to the other, which is the cost of money borrowed, should certainly be allowable in full as a deduction.  It is a capital form of interest in the sense that it is a once-and-for-all capital payment on the closing of the purchase rather than an interest which will continue to run for as long as the money is borrowed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>It raises an interesting point.  I shall look at it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was, of course, referring to the payment of interest on outstanding purchase money calculated on apportionment account in an ordinary closing of a sale.  He pointed out that nowadays very high rates of interest are charged in this regard, sometimes perhaps 18 per cent, which is certainly a penal rate of interest and if a purchaser is compelled to pay this interest why should he not be allowed this as an expense because it clearly is an expense which he incurred in the acquisition of the asset?</P>
    <P>This amendment goes part of the way it should go.  The original provision in the Bill was totally wrong in our view, and we said so, because the non-allowance of interest as an expense, while allowing all sorts of other expenses, is illogical and inequitable. <Col N="781" /> The Minister's amendment goes some of the way in so far as it proposes to allow the deduction in respect of interest where (a) it is incurred by a company and (b) it is in respect of expenditure by the company on the construction of any building, structure or works.  That is going part of the way but since it covers only companies and only that kind of expenditure the result is that it will be of limited benefit and it will be of primary benefit to companies which are engaged in construction and property development.</P>
    <P>It will not benefit a wide range of commercial activities conducted by companies and it will not benefit any commercial or private activites conducted by an individual.  I suggest that may well be unconstitutional in so far as it clearly involves the taxation of an alleged gain or profit which does not exist.  I suggest also that if the Minister finds difficulty in administering a relief of this kind in the case of an individual the onus is on him to find a way around it.  It is not an answer to say that the individual must form a limited liability company and do his business in that way.  I do not think the Minister is entitled to try to force the individual into that mould for the sake of administrative convenience.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out that there are other ways in which liability for interest may arise as in the case of interest charged on the balance of purchase money in an apportionment account on the closing of a sale and that no provision is being made for that in this amendment.  While the amendment is acceptable in so far as it gives an allowance in respect of interest in the limited circumstances prescribed in it, in my view it does not go nearly far enough for the requirements of justice or the proper administration of a capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The moving of this amendment by the Minister is an acknowledgement by him, and one I do not think he could avoid, that the allowance of interest is necessary and is merely justice but since he has so circumscribed it in this amendment he is not going nearly far enough to achieve, in my view at any rate, justice or a fair <Col N="782" /> prospect of administration of this Bill on a reasonable basis.  I urge him, even at this stage, to think again about the manner in which he is circumscribing the allowance of interest as a deduction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that before he concludes on this amendment he should take another look at subsection (b) which states:</P>
      <P>Subject to clause (a), no payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph.</P>
      <P>I suggest that it is not equitable to charge capital gain against any gain and not allow any legitimate charge against that gain.  There is one good thing here.  The effect of the Capital Gains Tax Bill is to bring under a tax code all individuals who may be engaging in profitable business in private transactions.  It is not a bad thing to bring in the fairly wide section of people not involved in companies who may be making personal gains for themselves.  Although this side of the House do not agree with the flat rate of 26 per cent we agree with the principle that people engaged in business in their own interest who make a profit or a gain should have to pay their fair share of taxation.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley has pointed out, the principle is there that an individual should be entitled to claim just as a company will be entitled to claim. The object of the Minister's amendment is to ensure that a company can claim any expenditure incurred, which would include interest charged on a loan.  The individual should not be put at a disadvantage against the company.  It does not make any sense. In the Finance Bill last year the Minister introduced a maximum allowable interest charged for private individuals in connection with insurance policies.  If an individual has to pay a substantial figure&mdash;26 per cent of any gain is a fairly substantial amount&mdash; and he has a fairly substantial mortgage interest payment to meet in connection with the land or property there will be a grievance if the Minister is not prepared to allow that mortgage interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should avoid creating <Col N="783" /> a sense of grievance.  It is not difficult to create a sense of grievance on any of us over the tax we have to pay but the Minister should avoid creating a genuine sense of grievance that one person is enabled to do it legally and charge against a tax and another cannot. That is the effect of the Minister's amendment that one individual or group of individuals in the shape of a company can charge interest against a capital gains tax bill presented by the inspectors and a private individual cannot do so.  That will create a genuine grievance because however much we may dislike taxation all taxation should be seen to be just.  It should be seen to be levelled equally on everybody.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's amendment in respect of subsection (a).  It is right that any company should be able to charge against his tax any expenditure on the construction of any building, and so on.  The Minister and his advisers should take a look at the problem of policing.  I cannot see, having studied the new return of capital, property and wealth which all people have to return now, any major problem in policing.</P>
    <P>If an individual has purchased property, buildings, or land and has had to go to the bank or to some lending society to raise the money for it, it should appear in the ordinary way in the return; the property would have to be returned under the wealth section and the interest would be paid or payable by him.  There probably are ways of getting around the introduction of interest charges that may not apply to an individual, but I do not see this happening in the ordinary case.  The ordinary cases are a matter for the investigating side of the Revenue Commissioners, and so I do not see the objection based on the difficulty of policing this as being a valid one.  I would recommend the Minister to take a second look at this whole area, because not alone, I believe, will the Minister be making a mistake but he will be bringing our taxation system into a greater degree of disrepute with the private individual <Col N="784" /> who complains enough already about the tax he or she has to pay.</P>

It is interesting to note that a predecessor of mine in office bearing the same name but from the Opposition party, the late Dr. James Ryan, said in this House that the export tax relief could not be given to individuals but only to companies.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In January, 1974, we put a limit on the exercise of that privilege by private individuals because the exercise had become a scandal, where people in the top rates of tax were deliberately borrowing vast sums of money because they could set off 80 per cent of the cost against the general body of taxpayers and in many cases were using the money so borrowed at the expense of the taxpayers for reinvestment abroad where they made a tax-free profit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason why it is not possible to allow this <Col N="785" /> concession to individuals; if we did, it would negative the restriction which we have very properly, in the public interest, put upon the amount of interest an individual may set-off against his income tax liability.  That limit is £2,000 worth of interest per annum.  If we were to make this concession available to private individuals, they would then use up to £2,000 as a set-off against their income tax liability and claim the rest against the capital gain.  By so doing they could make a laugh of the restriction which we introduced in the public interest to discourage people from borrowing large sums of money any more because the principal cost of so doing was borne by the general body of taxpayers who had to make good the income to the Exchequer which was lost as a consequence of that practice.</P>
      <P>The Companies Act has very strict obligations imposed upon companies to produce their accounts in a certain form.  Audited accounts must be furnished, and the audited accounts must show very clearly what are income items and what are capital items.  It is by virtue of the obligation on companies under the Companies Act that it is possible to give this concession to companies, because the capital element can be properly identified.  It is for that reason also that the export tax relief is made available to companies and not to individuals, and as my predecessor, Dr. Ryan, said, it is not a great burden on anybody who wants to avail of the interest set-off to form a company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like any reasonable lawyer the Deputy has no doubt given advice in this area to his clients, and he is well aware that people form companies or discretionary trusts.  There have been various arrangements made where it suited people to do so for tax or other purposes, and no doubt that will continue to be the practice of prudent people.  Nobody complains it is wrong to do it.  If the law permits a person to get a certain exemption by <Col N="786" /> arranging his affairs in a certain way, it is prudent for a person so to arrange his affairs, and as the incorporation of a business into a company can confer upon a person the opportunity of setting off the interest as part of the cost of the acquisition in computing a gain no doubt it is something that people will do.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners have difficulty in policing an activity, a difficulty so serious as to render the operation of the law ineffective, then clearly the Legislature has an obligation not to impose such an arrangement upon the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot accept that there is any hardship involved in incorporating a business. Most of the operations which have been described by the Opposition are, in fact, carried on by companies.  They will have the facility available to them and thus have an easy way of setting up machinery to give this concession to themselves.</P>

      <P>I am sure they will consult a solicitor, and they will be able to put their affairs in order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am saying that if we are to get down to deep constitutional arguments, all tax involves an element of confiscation, whether it is of a person's income or a person's capital.  The courts have already considered that argument and found it unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the cost of making the gain is so critical to the making of the gain that it must be allowed as Deputy Colley suggests, then I would put to him this argument, that the law should also allow to every income earner the cost of getting to and from his place of employment because if he did not get to his place of employment he would not make the income, but the law never accepted that principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  The cost of getting to one's place of earning income is surely similar to the interest which a person may pay in order to make a gain.  Each is part of the cost of making the profit.  One is an earned profit and the other one is a capital profit but they are similar in so far as it is part of the cost of generating the profit.  Of course, I know that many unconstitutional things have remained on the books for years and remained unconstitutional until they are proved to be otherwise but the argument is a pretty thin one, indeed, and would not stand up at all.</P>

We have given consideration to what was said on Committee Stage and we have tabled an amendment which goes a long, long way, indeed, to meet the points which were raised and so far as anybody who is left outside the ambit of the amendment is concerned there is a comparatively cheap way of coming within the ambit of it so as to get the full value of the concession granted.</P>

      <P>I referred to this matter on Committee Stage and, perhaps, the best thing I could do is to quote the Official Report, although there was some very lengthy discussion on it.  There is one portion of the report which very well summarises what is involved in this and the following amendments.  On 4th June, 1975, in the Official Report, at column 1537, I am reported as follows:</P>
      <P>Is this principle right?  Perhaps I am misinterpreting it, but it seems to me to be saying that if the amount of income tax you have to pay is such that if deducted in full it would reduce your liability for capital gains tax or even create a loss&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It says in the report, &ldquo;you will be allowed&rdquo;.  I think it should be &ldquo;you will not be allowed&rdquo;</P>
      <P>to do that.  Is that right in principle, if in fact, this consequence arises because you have paid income tax?</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is very complicated.</P>
      <P>I then went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it over-simplifying it to say that because you paid income tax, if that were allowed in full and were to create a loss situation, you are not to be allowed to claim a loss situation?  If that is so, it seems to me to be wrong in principle. Incidentally, there is exactly the <Col N="789" /> same provision at the end of the next subparagraph, subparagraph (3).</P>
    <P>That is the end of that quotation but in column 1538 the following occurs: The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the intention is to provide that sums which have been brought into charge to income tax will not be liable to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>That is true only in so far as it does not produce either converted gains into losses or increase losses. I am not clear as to why that should be so.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I will look at the point the Deputy raises.</P>
    <P>There are provisions referred to in these two amendments which seem to have the effect of saying that if you have paid income tax in respect of certain gains you may omit the items in respect of which income tax was paid from the computation of the consideration for the purpose of assessing a capital gain but that you are not allowed to do that if the effect of it is to convert a gain into a loss or to increase any loss.  That being so, it seems to me that the principle which the Minister enunciated and to which I referred and to which he has referred a number of times, that generally speaking the intention is to provide that sums involved in income tax will not be liable to capital gains tax&mdash;that that principle is being breached here so as to prevent the conversion of a gain into a loss or the increasing of a loss.</P>
    <P>I did ask on Committee Stage what was the reasoning behind this and I do not think I got a satisfactory answer and it is not a satisfactory answer for the Minister to go on and point out that there is another subparagraph which works in reverse, in other words to say that if the thing is working the other way it will not be allowed to operate to convert a loss into a gain or to increase any gain.  That is merely conforming with the provision that I am trying to amend here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="790" /> What I am primarily concerned with is to try to establish as I tried to establish on Committee Stage what is the principle behind this.  Why breach the principle which was enunciated by the Minister on the occasion that I quoted and on a number of other occasions that sums which have been brought into charge to income tax will not be liable to capital gains tax?  I have not been able to ascertain the thinking behind the provision which says, &ldquo;That is true but we are going to limit it in so far as if it were to enable you to convert a gain into a loss or to increase a loss then you are going to pay capital gains tax on a sum in respect of which you have already paid income tax&rdquo;.  It is not at all clear to me why this should be done especially having regard to the fact that the principle generally accepted is that on one gain you will pay income tax or capital tax but not both or, alternatively, on one loss you can claim against income tax or capital gains tax but not both.  There are qualifications on that because the Minister has provided that in certain circumstances you can claim a loss in respect of income tax or be entitled to claim it but in no circumstances be allowed to claim it against capital gains tax. That is merely a qualification.  The basic principle seems to be pretty well established that on a gain if you pay income tax you will not pay capital gains tax and on a loss if you are allowed to claim it against one you are not entitled to claim it against the other.  This principle appears to be thoroughly breached in the provisions I am seeking to amend here and my primary purpose in putting down these amendments was to get the Minister to spell out the principle on which he is going which I think he omitted to do on Committee Stage in relation to these provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is that there is not to be an overlap between the charge to income tax and the charge to capital gains tax.  The income tax charge is to prevail and if it is greater than the capital gains tax charge, the charge to the capital <Col N="791" /> gains is cancelled and, therefore, there is no question of overlap.</P>
      <P>If the creation of a loss on capital account were allowed to take place, this would mean effectively that the income tax charge is too great and there would be a clawback in favour of the taxpayer through the medium of the capital gains tax.  The income tax charge introduced by the Finance Act, 1963, was designed to impose a proper charge on recipients of rent from and premiums on short leases. Its charge is an equitable one and, quite clearly, there should not be any watering down merely because the capital gains tax comes into operation. To do so would mean that the larger of the two charges, income tax or capital gains tax, should be cancelled. The most that should be done is to eliminate any double charge and there is provision to do this.  The situation would be that if the capital gains tax charged was £3,000 and the income tax charged was £3,250, £3,250 tax would be collected and the capital gains tax of £3,000 would be cancelled.  Thus we ensure no double taxation and we also ensure that the greater tax sum would be collected. That is as it should be because if we did not so arrange, it would mean that we would be replacing an existing tax liability by a new tax liability which would be less than the old one. That is not intended at a time when we are introducing a capital gains tax in addition to whatever income tax liability may already exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle enunciated by the Minister that there should not be a double charge both to capital gains tax and to income tax is acceptable and the principle that it is the higher charge which should be applied is also acceptable.  However, it does not seem to me that the provision here &ldquo;but not so as to convert the gain into a loss or to increase any loss&rdquo; is quite the same thing.  However, the Minister seems to believe that is how it will operate.  Even if it were to operate that way it would be far better to express the provision as the Minister has expressed it now and say there will not be a double <Col N="792" /> charge and where there is an overlap the income tax will prevail.  That would be far more satisfactory than providing, as it does here, that even though you would be applying the normal capital gains tax rules you would not be allowed, because you were claiming in respect of income tax paid, to convert a gain into a loss or to increase any loss.  That immediately raises the spectre that you are preventing the taxpayer from claiming what he would normally be entitled to claim, whereas the provision as stated by the Minister, if it works in the same way, seems far more acceptable, that is, to eliminate the liability to double charge but provide that where that can arise it is the income tax charge that will prevail.</P>
      <P>I have no objection to either of those propositions but it seems to me that the words used in the Bill do not convey that and may not operate in that way.  But if the Minister believes they do operate in that way I have no objection to the principle which we have now got the Minister to enunciate and which we did not succeed in getting him to enunciate on Committee Stage.  At this point there is nothing to be gained by trying to argue with the Minister as to the effect of the words sought to be deleted: if he is satisfied that they will achieve the operation of the principle which he has now enunciated, I shall have no objection to that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34 (c):</P>
      <P>In page 68, in subparagraph (2) of paragraph 8, after &ldquo;determined by notice given by the lessor&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;otherwise than for breach of covenant&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Again, this matter was referred to on Committee Stage.  I referred the Minister to the original report, the Official Report of 4th June, 1975 at column 1553 where I referred to this matter. I said then:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer the Minister to paragraph 8 dealing with <Col N="793" /> the duration of leases, particularly to subparagraph (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>I then quoted the subparagraph.  I went on to say:</P>
    <P>Should there not be added to that, unless it can be shown that it is implied, &ldquo;notice given by the lessor otherwise than for breach of covenant&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Major de Valera: Every lease normally has a notice for determination on certain contingencies, breach of covenant being one of them, and quite common.  There is nothing easier than to put in some clause of determination by notice.  We should look carefully at the paragraph.</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Ryan: Perhaps I could anticipate the Deputy by saying that I think Deputy Colley has made the point well and I think he is right.</P>
    <P>Mr. Colley: It also applies to subparagraph (4).</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister has changed his mind since, I think this amendment should be in.  It appears to me on the face of it that unless the amendment I am moving is accepted the position will be that it does not matter what the term of a lease may be on its face, that since it could be deemed that notice could be given to terminate it on the very first day of its existence, all leases would be deemed to be short leases unless a provision like this was put in.  The provision in subparagraph (2) of paragraph 8 reads:</P>
    <P>Where the terms of the lease include provision for the determination of the lease by notice given by the lessor, the lease shall not be treated as granted for a term longer than one ending at the earliest date on which it could be determined by notice given by the lessor.</P>
    <P>In other words, it will be treated as being, despite what it says on the face of it as being only for such term as would run up to the date of determination by notice given by the lessor. But I assume that what is intended is that it would provide for notice after a certain number of years, notice that could be given by the lessor or, perhaps, by the lessee.  However, at any time, the lessor can give notice <Col N="794" /> for breach of covenant.  Therefore, unless we provide for that in the way I have suggested in the amendment, we are simply providing that the lessor may give notice for breach of covenant on the day or the day after the lease commences.  Effectively, then, all leases could be deemed to be short leases.  It may be that there has been an oversight in this regard or that the Minister has had second thoughts and will throw further light on it but as it appears to me now, and as it appeared to me on Committee Stage, this amendment is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has recalled, I expressed sympathy for this point of view on Committee Stage but since then I have examined the matter further and, on reflection, I do not consider the amendment to be justified.  I fear that its introduction might create ambiguity and difficulties which it might be better to avoid.  The rules of duration included in the paragraph are very similar to those of section 83 of the Finance Act, 1963 and, with some variations, are similar to those in section 19 of this year's Finance Act.  The words in parentheses &ldquo;whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter&rdquo; are in section 83 of the Finance Act, 1963.  They are included there mainly to deal with the possibility of forfeiture being forced on a tenant by the imposition of onerous conditions. The words &ldquo;render it unlikely&rdquo; were in that section also.  Perhaps I might illustrate the matter: let us take a lease which is granted for 60 years on the life of a person who is 60 years old at that time.  It would be highly unlikely that the lease would continue for more than 50 years.  It could be said that the provision would render it unlikely that the lease could continue for more than 50 years.  In such circumstances the lease would be treated as being a short lease but as has been pointed out, there has not been any difficulty in practice from the use of the two phrases mentioned and on that account no amendment is proposed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I was amalgamating the two.  Regarding the words &ldquo;otherwise than for breach of covenant&rdquo; it is considered that in a genuine case of breach of covenant the duration of the lease would be what was fixed under the ordinary rules.  The insertion of such phrase would not affect the interpretation of what would be the duration of the lease.  On the contrary, it might open the way for the insertion in a lease of artificial terms.  Substantially, the rules are those which have been used for income tax purposes.  No problems have arisen in relation to their use in that context.  In the light of experience and because no difficulty has arisen in the past the best course would be to rely on what is known rather than to introduce something which might well lead to a number of new devices which could be beyond our control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the manner in which the insertion of these words might lead to opening up a loophole for somebody to create an artificial situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be imposed some covenant which was not in any way onerous but the breach of which might be adequate to terminate a lease and where, by connivance between the parties, such breach could take place in order to affect the duration of the lease.  The duration is that which is set out in the lease and is interpreted under the ordinary rules. I fear that to allow the period to be altered by some convenient breach or forfeiture would open a very uncertain and possibly mischievous area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that something like that could happen, regardless of whether this provision is included, but I would remind the Minister that, in general, the Revenue Commissioners would prefer to treat leases as short leases rather than long ones.  If the words sought to be added in this amendment are not added, the position would be that it could be <Col N="796" /> argued that every lease is a short lease, a situation which is not favourable to the Revenue.  Apart from that, it would not conform with reality.  If a lease can be treated as running for a term which ends on the day on which notice can be given for breach of covenant, what the Minister was talking about&mdash;the introduction of some non-onerous covenant and the creation of an artificial situation&mdash;can arise. Therefore, the lease could be treated easily as a short lease.  The way is wide open for that.  If this has not happened before, it is all to the good but it may happen in the future.  However, it is not my obligation to go to the stake in order to close these loopholes.  I have moved an amendment which I believe would prevent that situation but if the Minister does not wish to accept the amendment, that is his business.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 34d:</P>
      <P>In page 68 to delete subparagraph (3) of paragraph 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I will refer the Minister <Col N="797" /> to the report of the proceedings in this House on 4th June last at columns 1623 and 1624 of Volume 281 of the Official Report.  The extract to which I am about to refer followed quite a lengthy discussion on this subparagraph, and the portion I am about to quote summarises reasonably well what has gone before.  I said:</P>
    <P>I think the Minister by now must accept that this subparagraph as drafted is uncertain, may even be void for uncertainty, that it is unsatisfactory because of the uncertainty attaching, and that at least the drafting of it should be changed, apart from the matter already mentioned about forfeiture, and possibly the thinking behind it should be changed.  I do not want to delay on this, but one could develop the question of what happens if one determines a particular lease to be a short lease, what happens in practice to the lessor and the lessee and their claims for allowances against capital gains.  However, I am asking the Minister to have another look at this.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied: &ldquo;I certainly will.&rdquo;  There was a passing reference to forfeiture there and that is why I am asking that it be treated separately because there is another case on that.  What I have just read summarises what was being said on this side by a number of Deputies in relation to this subparagraph.  That was that the subparagraph was very uncertain and very unsatisfactory, unsatisfactory largely because of its uncertainty, and this uncertainty related to its general drafting and, in particular, to its reliance on the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo;.  Subsection (3) provides:</P>
    <P>Where any of the terms of the lease (whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter) or any other circumstances render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date falling...</P>
    <P>There are other aspects but my primary purpose in putting down the amendment was to remind the Minister of the arguments made and the lack of satisfaction expressed with regard to the subparagraph and thus <Col N="798" /> give the Minister an opportunity of putting on the record his attitude in the light of the arguments advanced on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main factors in this subparagraph relating to the duration of a lease.  The first one is that there may be terms or other conditions which make it unlikely that the lease could go beyond a particular date.  Where this is so the duration of the lease is deemed not to go beyond that date.  This part of the subparagraph from the beginning to the words &ldquo;ending on that date&rdquo; is an exact replica of section 80 (2) (b) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The provision is substantially the same as section 19 (2) (a), paragraph (i) of the Finance Act, 1975, and is exactly the same as lines 13 to 18, together with lines 22 to 24 of that subsection.  The provisions thus appear in the 1967 Act, in the Finance Act, 1963, and now imported into the 1975 Finance Act.  It can certainly be said of them that they have stood the test of time and, because of that, there is a great deal to be said for sticking to them.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the second part of the subparagraph provides for a break by the lessee in the event of onerous conditions coming into operation, such as an increase in rent or greater obligations, and the conditions are such that the lease will be unlikely to last beyond the time of the imposition of these onerous conditions.  Provision for a break by the lessee is included in section 80 (2) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Provision for unlikelihood is included in section 19 (2) (a), paragraph (i) of the Finance Act, 1975.  For these reasons it is considered that the provision in subparagraph (3) is a necessary ingredient in determining the proper duration of a lease and, having stood the test of time, we think it is better to rely on the success that has been achieved during that time in the use of these words, and we believe deletion of the subparagraph would lead to problems in the kind of situation it is designed to cover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>As I indicated, this amendment was tabled to enable the <Col N="799" /> Minister to put on the record his considered response to the arguments put forward on this side of the House on the Committee Stage.  The Minister has done so.  It was not seriously contended that the subparagraph could in fact be deleted.  This was merely a device to enable the Minister to put his considered view on the record.  I know now what his considered view is.  There is a great deal of substance in it.  In so far as such provisions have operated since the 1967 Income Tax Act, and operated satisfactorily, one ought not change them.  That is certainly a reasonable argument.</P>
      <P>I wonder to what extent have they been tested and to what extent has the implication of the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; been tested.  We do not know that.  The Minister has force of argument on his side when he says the provision has withstood the test of time and we should not, therefore, change it.  I must accept that argument, but unless the implications of the word &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date&rdquo; have been tested there really may not be as much force in the Minister's argument as at first sight there might appear to be.  No doubt, if and when this phrase is tested, and the result is unsatisfactory, the Minister will be in fairly fast to amend, not only this provision but the other provisions also to which he refers. In the absence of any information on that particular aspect, I accept the Minister's argument that it is better to let the subparagraph stand as it is.  The purpose of my amendment has been achieved in so far as the Minister has now placed on the record his considered response to the arguments put forward by this side on the Committee Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to remove from subparagraph (3) the words in brackets &ldquo;whether relating to forfeiture <Col N="800" /> or to any other matter&rdquo;.  This was referred to on Committee Stage. As reported at column 1616 of the Official Report of 4th June, 1975, in response to arguments put forward the Minister said:</P>
    <P>One might responsibly argue that the words in brackets are, perhaps, unnecessary because they say &ldquo;whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter&rdquo; but forfeiture involves a termination so I suppose to that extent the draftsman considered it would not be inappropriate to put in the word &ldquo;forfeiture&rdquo;. I agree it is difficult to give an illustration of specific circumstances.</P>
    <P>I said:</P>
    <P>I am wondering why it was mentioned at all.  As the Minister says, it is specifically mentioned as distinct from anything else.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we went into this matter in some detail and pointed out the apparent consequences of leaving in this phrase.  I do not want to go back over that ground again. We drew attention to it and that quotation from what the Minister said would indicate that the Minister thought at that time that the words should be removed as we are suggesting. Therefore, I thought it best that I should put down an amendment which would enable the Minister to give the view he now has in relation to the use or otherwise of the words in brackets which we suggested and the Minister seemed to accept on Committee Stage were better out than in.</P>

The words &ldquo;whether relating to forfeiture or to any other matter&rdquo; are in section 83 of the Finance Act, 1963.

      <P>Take the case of a man of 60 years of age who is granted a lease for 60 years on his life.  That would be a highly unlikely lease.  It would be unlikely that the lease would continue for more than 50 years.  It could happen.  I accept that, but it would be rare, particularly in these days of great pressures, for a person to live for 110 years.  We can certainly say it is highly unlikely that the lease would continue for more than 50 years.  It could be said that the provision would render it unlikely that the lease could continue for more than 50 years.  In such circumstances the lease would be treated as a short lease.</P>
      <P>In practice there has not been any difficulty from the use of these expressions. They have worked satisfactorily. Deputy Colley made the point earlier that perhaps some of them had not been put to the test.  They have been put to the test in ordinary every day affairs.  They may not have been challenged in courts.  I cannot say of my own personal knowledge whether that has occured.  I have no doubt that if they gave rise to disputes they would have been tested in court.  That has not occured and I think it would be safer to rely on previous experience.</P>

      <P>In this case the force of the argument that the phrasing has been used in earlier legislation is less than it was in the previous case particularly because, on the face of it, the wording is ridiculous whether or not it was in the 1963 Act.  What this provision is saying is that where any of the terms of the lease render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a certain date, the lease will be treated as a short lease.  I am summarising it, of course.  &ldquo;Where any of the terms of the lease... render it unlikely...&rdquo;  Then it says that included in the terms of the lease are &ldquo;relating to forfeiture or to any other matter&rdquo;.  In effect it is saying that where any of the terms of the lease in relation to forfeiture render it unlikely <Col N="802" /> that the lease will continue beyond a certain date.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that does not really make any sense at all unless you are assuming at the beginning that the lease will be forfeited. If you make that assumption you could make it from the first day of the term and you should automatically treat all leases as short leases with the consequences flowing from that.  I do not think the inclusion of those words in earlier legislation or in this legislation makes them right.  The words are wrong on their face.  It may be that they have not led to difficulties so far but, if they have not, it is very possible that they will in the future.  They do not really make any sense when you analyse what they mean.  That being so, some difficulty will almost certainly arise in the future.  However, we drew attention to this matter on Committee Stage. We have drawn attention to it again now.  We have given the Minister an opportunity to consider it carefully and place on record his view of the situation.  He has done that.  I am not very satisfied with that view but I do not feel it is not a matter on which we should spend too much time.  Attention has been drawn to it and we cannot do any more than that.</P>

I am sure the Chair will recall and be familiar with the fact that a similar amendment to this has been moved from this side of the House in relation to other Bills.  Furthermore, in the case, say of Finance Bills there seems to be no great difficulty for someone on the Opposition side of the <Col N="803" /> House moving an amendment which has the effect of relieving the taxpayer and, therefore, of increasing the charge on the public, which is the basis on which this amendment has been ruled out of order.

      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment makes provision for the payment by the Revenue Commissioners of simple interest at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month in any circumstances in which capital gains tax falls to be repaid to the taxpayer. There is provision for the repayment of capital gains tax, with interest, in certain specified cases, under Table 69 of the Bill.  This amendment would impose a further charge on revenue. Under Standing Order 119 (3), the amendment may not be moved.</P>

What I am trying to do is to reconcile that ruling with the ruling which has enabled a similar amendment to this to be moved in other cases; for instance, the one which, on a Finance Bill enables an Opposition Deputy to move an amendment designed to reduce the liability to tax of an individual taxpayer.  That, I think, would clearly impose an additional charge on Revenue.  Nevertheless, it is possible to do so.  I am trying to reconcile the two positions.</P>

I appreciate&mdash;as Deputy Colley says&mdash; the point that arises if there is a charge, even a technical one.

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 70, in subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3, after &ldquo;some other person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;for whom the person who receives the notice is required to make a return under section 170 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as so applied by this paragraph&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Concern was expressed during Committee Stage that the words &ldquo;or if the notice relates to income or chargeable gains of some other person,&rdquo; implied that the Revenue Commissioners were being given wide powers to require the furnishing of information about persons other than the taxpayer himself. Of course, this was never intended, and the amendment makes it clear that the subparagraph cannot be interpreted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that, on this side of the House, we spent a considerable amount of time on subparagraph (3) of Schedule 4 and pointed out its consequences, as drafted.  On Committee Stage the Minister seemed to be resisting the interpretation <Col N="805" /> we were giving the subparagraph, as drafted.  He will recall also that we were suspicious, not alone because of the powers the paragraph gave, that as drafted it appeared simply to be transferring the powers existing already under the income tax code to the capital gains tax code, suitably adapted, but that, in fact, it was adding very substantially to those powers.  It introduced the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; in a way that extended the powers to the income tax code.  I am sure the Minister will agree that we spoke about this at considerable length on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record the fact that the Minister, in this amendment, has conceded the validity of the argument we were making, which was, that the subparagraph, as drafted, was open to that interpretation.  The amendment the Minister has now introduced overcomes the difficulty because it confines the obligation to give information to the Revenue Commissioners, to a person who receives a notice in respect of somebody for whom he is responsible already, not merely to his neighbour, friends or anybody else, as it was drafted.  As far as I can see, the amendment appears suitably to confine the obligation here and relate it also to the existing provisions under the income tax code.  For that reason I do not object to the inclusion of the word &ldquo;income&rdquo; to which we had objected.  Therefore, I am satisfied the amendment appears to do what we sought to have done.</P>
      <P>But I want again to place on the record of the House that the moving of this amendment, whilst welcomed, is confirmation of the doubts and fears we expressed on Committee Stage with regard to the provisions of this subparagraph and the obligations it imposed on persons to provide information to the Revenue Commissioners in regard to their friends, neighbours and those in respect of whom they had no legal responsibility heretofore.  This amendment obviates that danger and, to that extent, is very welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" />&ldquo;11.&mdash;(1)  This paragraph shall apply to assets that are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  land in the State;</P>
    <P>(b)  minerals in the State or any rights, interests or other assets in relation to mining or minerals or the searching for minerals;</P>
    <P>(c)  exploration or exploitation rights in a designated area;</P>
    <P>(d)  shares in a company deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from assets specified in clause (a), (b) or (c); and</P>
    <P>(e) goodwill of a trade carried on in the State.</P>
    <P>(2) Upon payment of the consideration for acquiring an asset to which this paragraph applies, the person by or through whom any such payment is made shall deduct thereout a sum representing an amount of capital gains tax on one-half of the said payment at the rate of such tax in force at the time the payment is made and the person to whom the payment is made shall allow such deduction upon receipt of the residue of the payment and the person making the deduction shall be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that sum had been actually paid:</P>
    <P>Provided that where the person disposing of the asset produces to the person acquiring the asset a certificate issued under subparagraph (6) in relation to the disposal, no such deduction shall be made.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where any such payment as aforesaid is made by or on behalf of any person, that person shall forthwith deliver to the Revenue Commissioners an account of the payment, and of the amount deducted therefrom, and the inspector shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which the payment was made on an amount equal to one-half of the payment at the rate specified in section 3 (3).</P>
    <P>(4) The inspector may, where, in <Col N="808" /> relation to any such payment as aforesaid, any person has made default in delivering an account required by this paragraph, or where he is not satisfied with the account, estimate the amount of the payment to the best of his judgment and, notwithstanding section 5 (1), assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which the payment was made on an amount equal to one-half of the amount so estimated at the rate specified in section 3 (3).</P>
    <P>(5)  Where the amount of capital gains tax assessed and charged under subparagraph (3) or (4) is paid, appropriate relief shall, on a claim being made in that behalf, be given to the person chargeable in respect of the gain on the disposal, whether by discharge or repayment or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(6)  A person chargeable to capital gains tax on the disposal of any asset to which this paragraph applies may apply to the inspector for a certificate that tax should not be deducted from the consideration for the disposal of the asset and, if the inspector is satisfied that the person making the application is the person making the disposal and that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  he is ordinarily resident in the State, or</P>
    <P>(b)  no amount of capital gains tax is payable in respect of the disposal, or</P>
    <P>(c)  the capital gains tax chargeable for the year of assessment for which he is chargeable in respect of the disposal of the asset and the tax chargeable on any gain accruing in any earlier year of assessment (not being a year ending earlier than the 6th day of April, 1974) on a previous disposal of the asset has been paid,</P>
    <P>the inspector shall issue the certificate.</P>
    <P>(7)  This paragraph shall not apply where the consideration on a disposal does not exceed the sum of fifty thousand pounds:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="809" /> Provided that if an asset owned at one time by one person, being an asset to which this paragraph would, but for this subparagraph, apply, is disposed of by that person in parts&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to the same person, or</P>
    <P>(b)  to persons who are acting in concert or who are in the terms of section 33 connected persons,</P>
    <P>whether on the same or different occasions, the several disposals shall for the purposes of this subparagraph but not for any other purpose be treated as a single disposal.</P>
    <P>(8)  In this paragraph &lsquo;exploration and exploitation rights&rsquo;, &lsquo;designated area&rsquo; and &lsquo;shares&rsquo; have the same meanings as in section 4 (8).</P>
    <P>(9)  this paragraph shall apply only in relation to disposals and acquisitions occurring after the passing of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The main difficulty has been with identification of assets on which the non-resident vendor is chargeable, and this paragraph provides the machinery to deal with a possible problem in the collection of capital gains tax where land or minerals or business assets in the State, or rights situated on the Continental Shelf, are disposed of by a non-resident, and the goodwill of the trade carried on in the State.  The second point of the difficulty in regard to the obligation to tax is that the vendor will be able to get payment in full if he gets a clearance certificate from Revenue which will be given if he is ordinarily resident in the State, if he is not liable to capital gains tax on the transaction or has paid all capital gains tax due by him.  Where the amount has been deducted from him he will be given appropriate credit against capital gains tax chargeable on him.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) specifies that the assets to which the scheme of deduction on purchase is to apply are: (a) land in the State; (b) minerals in the State or any rights, interests or other assets in relation to mining or minerals or the searching for minerals; (c) exploration <Col N="810" /> or exploitation rights in a designated area; (d) shares in a company deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from assets specified in clause (a), (b) or (c); and (e) goodwill of a trade carried on in the State.  These are the classes of assets in respect of which non-residents may be liable to capital gains tax.  It should therefore be clear to a purchaser whether the transaction is of a nature where he may have to hold back tax from the purchase money.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (d) quoted shares, to correspond to section 4 (8) (a), deriving their value from land <i>et cetera</i> are not excluded.  This is done to make identification easy for the purchaser. He does not have to differentiate between quoted and unquoted stocks.  If the stocks are quoted there is no charge on the non-resident and the certificate will be given.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (2) provides that when the purchaser is making payment, he or his agent is to hold back a sum for capital gains tax calculated as to 26 per cent, the rate in force under the Bill, on one-half of the payment. The vendor must permit this deduction to be made and the purchaser is acquitted of the amount deducted as if it had been paid over to the vendor as part of the purchase money.  The provision is thus set out in general terms and does not require the purchaser to establish the residence status of the vendor.  The proviso to the subparagraph sets out that the vendor may be able to avoid the deduction being made by getting a clearance certificate from his inspector of taxes, under the conditions set out in subparagraph (6).  Any person ordinarily resident in the State will get the certificate and the burden of establishing residence or non-residence is not thrown on the purchaser.  There is also an incentive to non-residents to clear up their liability quickly if they wish to avoid an excessive deduction.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) requires any person who has made a deduction under paragraph 11 to deliver an account of it to the Revenue.  The inspector of taxes will make an assessment on the amount.  The assessment may be made <Col N="811" /> before the end of the year of assessment and no deduction is given for the first £500 of gains under section 16 and the alternative charge under section 6 will not apply.  These conditions as to the making of the assessment are ensured by specifying that the inspector may assess and charge &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of this Act&rdquo;.  The assessment thus made on the purchaser, or his agent, is a separate and distinct assessment from any assessment on his own capital gain.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (4) enables the inspector of taxes to make an estimated assessment to the best of his judgment where the purchaser fails to deliver an account or where an account is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (5) gives the vendor the right to claim the appropriate relief against his correct liability on the transaction for the tax deducted from the purchase money.  The relief is to be given by discharge of tax, repayment or otherwise.  Thus if the vendor owes capital gains tax, the Revenue may set off the amount accounted for by the purchaser against the tax outstanding and repay the balances or if there is no liability outstanding they may repay the whole amount.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (6) permits a person who has disposed of an asset to apply to the inspector of taxes for a certificate of clearance.  The inspector if he is satisfied that the conditions are fulfilled must issue the required certificate to the effect that tax should not be deducted by the purchaser from the purchase money.  A certificate will be issued to the vendor if the inspector is satisfied that any one of the following conditions is fulfilled: (a) the vendor is ordinarily resident in the State, or (b) no amount of capital gains tax is payable in respect of the disposal, or (c) the capital gains tax chargeable for the year of assessment for which he is chargeable in respect of the disposal of the asset and the tax chargeable on any gain accruing in any earlier year of assessment (not being a year ending earlier than the 6th day of April, 1974) on a previous disposal of the asset has been paid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> Subparagraph (7) limits the application of the scheme of deduction to transactions involving amounts of £50,000 or more.  The proviso is designed to prevent abuse of the limit by artifical arrangements such as sales in lots to the same person or persons acting in concert or to persons connected with one another.  To counter such devices the amounts for all such transactions are to be aggregated as a single disposal to test whether they are over or below the limit.  This treatment as a single disposal is for the purpose of this subparagraph only and would not, for instance, affect the time at which the vendor is to be assessed on the disposal of his property in parts.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (8) imports into paragraph 11 the definitions of &ldquo;exploration and exploitation rights&rdquo;, &ldquo;designated area&rdquo; and &ldquo;shares&rdquo; from section 4 (8).  Subparagraph (9) provides that the scheme of deduction at purchase is to apply only from the time of passing of the Act.  The arrangement now provided differs in certain details from what was in the Bill when it was first initiated and persons who had made purchases before now were not in a position to do what is now being provided for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is now drafted in such a way that it applies equally to residents and non-residents, and it includes land.  It would seem to provide that in future in the case of the sale of any land or property standing on land for which the consideration is £50,000 or more the provisions of this paragraph will apply whether the parties are resident or not.  Those provisions will include that the purchaser, instead of paying over the purchase money when closing the sale, will deduct from it a sum equal to, as things stand at present, 26 per cent of half the purchase money.  He will not pay that to the vendor at all and the vendor will not be entitled to claim it from him.  Instead, in theory, he will pay that money over to the Revenue Commissioners and the vendor will go to the Revenue Commissioners and get the balance due to him, the Revenue Commissioners having deducted the amount of tax.</P>
      <P>There are a number of serious implications in this, and I do not know if the Minister has considered them. Does the Minister accept that these provisions are designed to apply even if both the parties to the transaction on the sale of land are resident in Ireland?  Does he accept that that is so?</P>

      <P>It will do a lot more than that.  I propose to demonstrate that to the Minister as we go through this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that he was urging me to provide some anti-avoidance devices to make sure that capital gains would be collected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do not want to see non-residents getting away with taking their gains and not paying their capital gains tax.  í should like to make it clear to the Minister, as I did in respect of other provisions the Minister has brought in, that while I do not want to see people avoiding or evading tax I am not prepared to trample on the rights of Irish citizens in order to ensure that.  The obligation is on the Minister to devise a workable system that will prevent avoidance, but not at the cost of interfering with the whole system of operation of sales of land or property here between Irish people. That is what the Minister is doing in this.  He is affecting every sale here for a sum in excess of £50,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the vendor is Irish he will get a certificate for the asking of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How can a vendor do that?  Let us assume that the vendor is selling property worth £100,000 and that he will make a gain on that of £30,000.  That vendor will be liable for 26 per cent of £30,000 as capital gains tax.  How can the vendor get a certificate until he has paid that, and how can he pay it until he is paid for the property?  It is not true to say that the Irish citizen who is a vendor will get a certificate for the asking. He will not.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (6) states that the person chargeable to <Col N="815" /> capital gains tax on the disposal of any asset to which this paragraph applies may apply to the inspector for a certificate that the tax shall not be deducted from the consideration for the disposal of the asset.  If the inspector is satisfied that the person making the application is the person making the disposal and that he is ordinarily resident or comes under any of the other paragraphs the inspector shall issue the certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, if he satisfies the inspector that he is ordinarily resident here the inspector will give him a certificate irrespective of whether he owes any tax or not? Will that certificate apply to that transaction only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It would not be a certificate saying that the person is not liable to pay capital gains tax but a certificate that the purchaser shall not deduct it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that while that imposes obligations on persons here engaged in sales and purchases of property nevertheless it provides a way around the difficulty for them.  However, it imposes this obligation for which many Irish people will not be aware and I suppose the Revenue Commissioners will not be too concerned as long as they are resident here.  If this practice is not followed on every sale&mdash;I cannot see it being followed on every sale&mdash;I can see people being caught out if they happen to be dealing with a non-resident and then being told they should have done this.  As far as the transaction between two Irish residents is concerned what is envisaged here is that the vendor would apply to the Revenue Commissioners and get the certificate to which the Minister has referred.  If he gets the certificate then the ordinary procedure that has always been followed on sales would be followed.  If he does not get it then the procedure to be followed would be that the purchaser would deduct the amount specified here, the capital gains tax on 50 per cent of the consideration, and would then pay it over to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if we assume in any case <Col N="816" /> in which a certificate has not been got, whether the vendor is resident or non-resident, let us see what develops under the procedure envisaged in this amendment.  Firstly, if the purchaser has deducted this money in accordance with this amendment but does not pay it over to the Revenue Commissioners what will be the position as far as the vendor is concerned?  The vendor would apply to the Revenue Commissioners expecting to get back from the Revenue Commissioners the money paid over by the purchaser less the amount of the capital gains tax.  If the Revenue Commissioners have not received any money from the purchaser will they pay any money to the vendor?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot repay what they have not got, so surely the vendor should obtain satisfactory proof that the purchaser has paid the Revenue Commissioners or should take steps to ensure that the purchaser will pay the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>How does he do that? Remember this provides that he has an automatic right.  In the absence of the vendor producing this certificate, this specifically provides a release and discharge for the purchaser in respect of that money, so how does the vendor ensure that the purchaser will pay the money to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>By inspecting a receipt from the Revenue Commissioners or by receiving at the time of the closing of the sale a cheque or some satisfactory means of payment to the Revenue Commissioners and ensuring that it is sent to the Revenue Commissioners at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister considered the practicality of this. Is the Minister suggesting that at the closing the vendor insists that the purchaser produces a cheque payable to the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the amount being deducted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Minister visualises that the purchaser would hand over this cheque to the vendor, it being payable to the Revenue <Col N="817" /> Commissioners, and then the vendor could ensure that it was paid to the Revenue Commissioners because it would be in his possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the purchaser would have the obligation of paying the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am coming to.  The purchaser does have the obligation, so how does the vendor protect himself in those circumstances? The Minister will agree that it is not an outrageous conception that the purchaser, having deducted this amount of money from the purchase money, would not pay it to the Revenue Commissioners?  The Minister will agree that that is likely to happen in some cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the legal profession will ensure that this, like many other undertakings, will be honoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as it looks, if only for the reason that the obligation imposed here is going to take some time to percolate through, even to the legal profession.  I am concerned at the consequences that can flow from the obligations imposed here on the purchaser to pay over the money, his failure to do so and then the efforts of the vendor and where the vendor is left in trying to recover the money that is due to him.  I do not know if the Minister has considered precisely how the vendor can make certain that this money is paid to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister has indicated already that until it is paid to the Revenue Commissioners by the purchaser the vendor will not get his money back so it is important to ensure that the vendor is not put at the mercy of a situation that he cannot control, one in which he cannot get the money that is due to him because another party does not pay the Revenue Commissioners.  It is important to provide machinery which the vendor, who is the one to get the money back from the Revenue Commissioners, can control to the extent of ensuring that the money is paid to the Revenue Commissioners. That is the vested interest of the Revenue Commissioners, it is the vested <Col N="818" /> interest of the vendor, but it is not the vested interest of the purchaser, who is the one who has the money. Therefore the Minister ought to examine the machinery to see that it will operate in such a way that the money will be paid to the Revenue Commissioners and that, if it is not, there is something the vendor can do about it in order to ensure that he gets his money back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not anticipate that there will be any difficulty in practice.  There are different ways in which either party may protect himself. The purchaser could, for instance, once the closing of the sale has been arranged and agreed between the parties, pay the Revenue Commissioners and bring a receipt to the closing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has he a vested interest in doing that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, he has, because he is under a legal obligation to do it in the absence of a certificate from the vendor that he need not do it.  He must discharge his obligation to make the deduction, so he equips himself by doing so and produces to the vendor what is equivalent to part of the purchase money&mdash;26 per cent of 50 per cent of the proceeds and says: &ldquo;There is that, and here is a bank draft for the balance&rdquo; or, by agreement between the parties, I suppose he could bring the money to the closing and there and then, on the vendor being satisfied that the money, cheque, bank draft or whatever it may be, is the correct amount could have it put in an envelope and posted to the Revenue Commissioners as part of the actual procedure of closing the sale.  I am sure the legal profession will have no difficulty in settling procedures which will be mutually satisfactory to both vendor and purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the position in which the vendor can find himself if the money is not paid over seems to me to be very unsatisfactory.  Because of the failure of another party, the purchaser, to discharge what will be his statutory obligation, the vendor will be out of his money and may indeed be subject to interest payments <Col N="819" /> on that money to his bank, but I do not think there is any provision for paying interest to him by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of the money outstanding.  It seems to me that the vendor in this case is in certain circumstances going to be placed in a most indivious position.  Furthermore it should be generally realised that the Minister is here legislating for all the sales in the country whether between residents or nonresidents if the consideration is £50,000 or more, and that in all such cases it will be necessary to apply for the certificate that the Minister mentioned or alternatively to make deductions from the purchase money with the consequences that flow from that that we have been discussing.</P>
      <P>The first two lines of subparagraph (2) read:</P>
      <P>Upon payment of the consideration for acquiring an asset to which this paragraph applies, the person by or through whom &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Would the phrase &ldquo;by or through whom&rdquo; include a bank, if the money were paid through a bank?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, unless the bank were an agent or one of the parties in the transaction, but it would not apply to a bank acting in the ordinary process of banking and being no more than a conduit pipe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is visualised here is presumably somebody like a solicitor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context may I refer the Minister to the provisions of subparagraph (7) which is designed to combat the breaking up of an asset into smaller portions so as to avoid liability.  If we think of the person through whom the money is paid as a solicitor is it not conceivable that a person like a solicitor might not know that the provisions of paragraph 7 were in fact occurring?  In other words, he might not know that this was a breaking-up of the asset and that the particular transaction with which he was dealing was in fact one <Col N="820" /> of a series to the same person or to a connected person.  If he does not know is he not in fact obliged all the same, by virtue of subparagraph (2), to make the deduction specified there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking at the moment of a solicitor acting for the purchaser.  The solicitor, presumably, would ascertain from his client, if not from the vendor, if he had previously acquired part of the same property or if he was acting in consort with persons who had previously acquired part of the same property so as to bring the transaction proviso within the subparagraph (7).  I visualise what the Deputy is contemplating, that is where an innocent solicitor could find himself acting for a person who had already acquired assets from the same vendor in a series of transactions and the solicitor would be put in peril by virtue of the obligation which lay on him to make the appropriate deduction. It is unlikely, and I think the Deputy will agree with me, that such circumstances would arise.  I suppose people planning such an operation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am getting at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could move around from solicitor to solicitor.  I accept that the solicitor would have the need to protect himself by satisfying himself that there had not been such a series of transactions or such connected transactions.  When you look at the assets that are involved here, land, minerals, exploration or exploitation rights, shares in companies related to those activities, there would be records in existence which would enlighten a solicitor as to whether or not there had been previous transactions in many of these activities and if so between whom such transactions took place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but that does not necessarily make it clear that people were acting in consort, which is one of the provisions of subparagraph (7). Unless the solicitor asks his own client: &ldquo;Were you acting in consort with anybody who acquired any of this property before?&rdquo;  It seems to me he is in danger.  Even if he does <Col N="821" /> answer he might still be in danger, but it is not the kind of question I am sure the Minister will agree that a solicitor would not normally be asking his own client.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Solicitors presume their own clients are honest and not engaged in defrauding the Revenue, I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an obligation imposed here that is going further than is reasonable in the case of a solicitor or other agent acting for a purchaser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if circumstances such as those Deputy Colley outlines will arise, but I can at present understand the anxiety which he has in mind and I will certainly be prepared to watch the situation.  I anticipate that if any attorney or agent was to be put in the embarrassing position which Deputy Colley has in mind the law would not be unfair to such a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter I wish to raise in regard to the question of deduction.  Again visualising the normal kind of sale conducted in regard to land, if there is interest being charged on the balance of the purchase money outstanding in the apportionment account, due as it would be by the purchaser to the vendor, would the Minister say what he thinks should happen in the event of the deduction by the purchaser of £X in the purchase money and payment of that to the Revenue Commissioners in due course, maybe with some delay? Would the vendor not be claiming that since he was entitled to interest on the full balance of the purchase money he is entitled to interest on the amount that had been deducted until payment?  On the other hand, would the purchaser not reasonably claim that when he paid over that portion of the purchase money to the Revenue Commissioners that ended his obligation and that the Revenue Commissioners should be liable for the interest on the purchase money?  Does the Minister see the point here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do, but the vendor <Col N="822" /> has it within his own field of operations to provide the Revenue Commissioners with the information necessary to make an assessment.  If the vendor for any reason fails to furnish the necessary information then it is not inappropriate that he should carry whatever loss arises out of failure on his part to furnish the information.  As soon as the necessary information to assess the gain is furnished the assessment will be made and a refund made if an excess deduction has been made.  That is reasonable, and clearly the obligation lying with the vendor to furnish the information the vendor should carry any disadvantage which may arise out of his own lassitude in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners require the information but they also require the money.  The vendor may be very prompt in furnishing the necessary information but the purchaser may be anything but prompt in furnishing the money.  We will leave out this provision for the moment.  Let us assume that the situation was that on the closing of the sale it included the payment of a sum of money by the purchaser to the vendor by way of interest on the purchase money for the balance of the purchase money outstanding, which is not an uncommon situation.  If that were the situation in the normal way that interest would have to be paid on the closing day with the balance of the purchase money.  This new provision intervenes, and instead of paying the balance of the purchase money the purchaser pays portion of it and he is liable to pay the other portion of it to the Revenue Commissioners. In the normal way, as far as he is concerned, his liability for interest on the purchase money should cease on the closing date.  Theoretically, he should pay over immediately to the Revenue Commissioners, and that would leave no doubt at all that that was the end of the purchaser's liability to interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He may not in fact do that, but any purchaser would argue that his liability ceased on the closing day.  From the point of view of the vendor he will claim he is entitled to interest on the purchase money until he receives <Col N="823" /> it.  In so far as he receives portion of the purchase money on the closing date that is all right.  He gets his interest on it and that is the end of the matter.  But the other portion of his purchase money has theoretically been paid to the Revenue Commissioners. In fact it may be delayed by the purchaser and in the meantime the vendor is not only without the balance of the purchase money but is also without interest on it to which he was entitled under the contract.  The Revenue Commissioners, as things stand at present, are accepting no liability for paying him any interest on the money they will eventually pay him back.  Because of the procedure laid down in this amendment there is introduced an area in which there can be considerable argument and doubt between the vendor, the purchaser and the Revenue Commissioners, but the net effect would appear to be that the vendor, the man who was entitled to interest on the purchase money, is the one who will lose.  It is difficult to say to what extent he will lose, for how long or how much&mdash;it depends on how long&mdash;but it seems clear that where he is entitled to interest on his purchase money he will not get interest on the portion of that money paid to the Revenue Commissioners by the purchaser from the date of closing of the sale and he will not get it from the Revenue Commissioners when they ultimately repay him.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that they will pay him back quickly if he gives the information quickly as they have the money from the purchaser.  That may be the intention, and the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister, speaking on their behalf here, may have the best intentions&mdash;as they have had in the past&mdash;but it does not always work out that payments of this kind are made promptly as intended.  Where everything goes smoothly that is the position, but there is also the distinct possibility that in some circumstances the purchaser may either not pay over the money at all to the Revenue Commissioners and skip the country&mdash; another possibility&mdash;or he may delay payment to the Revenue Commissioners, and in such circumstances <Col N="824" /> it seems the vendor must lose.  He cannot, I think, get interest on the purchase money from the purchaser and he cannot get it from the Revenue Commissioners, and yet in practice there is nothing he can do that will really control this situation.  I think there is a hiatus there which can work to the deteriment of the vendor and should not so work.  He should not be put at a loss if the purchaser fails to discharge what will be his statutory obligation to pay over the money.  Why should the vendor be at a loss in that case?</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister has adverted sufficiently to that.  I think he tends to rely too much to overcome that difficulty on the good sense of the legal profession in working out arrangements that will comply with this.  That goes a little too far: it does not follow that in all cases of transactions dealing with all the kinds of assets envisaged here members of the legal profession will be involved.  Nor does it follow that if they are involved the Administration is entitled to rely on them exclusively to ensure that the necessary arrangements are made to carry out the obligations of the parties.</P>
    <P>If the purchaser fails to carry out the obligations imposed on him here the vendor will lose substantially: he will lose the benefit of part of his purchase money and he may well lose interest on that to which he was otherwise entitled and, apparently, will not be entitled to interest from the Revenue Commissioners on that money whether he is entitled to it from the purchaser or not.  When you are imposing a statutory obligation of this kind on the purchaser and when so much from the vendor's point of view depends on the discharge of that obligation by the purchaser it is not enough to rely on the members of the legal profession to work out suitable arrangements to ensure that the matter works out smoothly.  The vendor who can suffer by this is entitled to expect from the Minister something more positive than reliance on the goodwill and good sense of members of the legal profession, who may not be involved in some of these transactions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there are reasons for genuine fears of difficulty in the operation of this provision. <Col N="825" /> If a vendor is anxious to avoid being without a substantial part of his purchase money he may actively pursue the question of having his capital gains liability assessed and he may have that done before the transaction is closed. He could pay the amount on the same day as the closure if he wishes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Please do not say that I am now spelling out precisely how the system will operate. I am simply giving a pragmatic interpretation of it and it will be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners to particularise the operation eventually. Let us say the vendor furnishes evidence to the Revenue Commissioners that he is about to dispose of a property for £X, that he bought it at some stage for £Y.  The Revenue Commissioners may then say the assessable gain is therefore £X&mdash;Y. The vendor may pay his tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a possibility of evasion here and that the Revenue Commissioners perhaps will not go as far as the Minister thinks, because if they made an assessment in advance, when it came to the actual payment of tax they would require confirmation that the facts of the situation worked out in accordance with the theoretical expectation on which they had made their assessment.  They would not just make an assessment in advance, collect the money and say: &ldquo;Now you are free&rdquo;.  They will have to make sure that the basis on which they assess will conform with the facts as these actually emerge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the ultimate transfer deed would correspond with the provisions of the contract and on that basis the tax would be paid.  The Deputy's point is that there could be a variation between the contract and the transfer deed.  That would be a fraud on the Revenue, and such frauds could be <Col N="826" /> committed any day in relation to any tax, but I do not think we can entirely close out such eventualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming back to a point I have repeatedly made on a number of sections.  What I feel on this section comes down to this: if you are too specific and try to spell out everything you may be giving power to the Revenue Commissioners but you are also tying their hands.  The ideal in legislation of this nature is to try to give the necessary power to the Revenue Commissioners, but also to leave the discretion there to deal with the case fairly, because of the multiplicity of cases that can arise.  Deputy Colley says the exceptional case can occur, and I would add that the exceptional today can be commonplace tomorrow.  It was, for instance, very exceptional years ago when the device of the private company was used to defeat the revenue. It became almost a commonplace.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be getting the rights and the powers and he may be covering the case, but in so doing he may be shackling the Revenue Commissioners in cases where they would wish to escape.  In subsection (6) of this section there is provision that would let a person out under certain conditions, but that is so specific in its nature that it does not capture other cases such as Deputy Colley is talking about, and while it is quite right we should go into the details of the section, we should not lose sight of the principle I am advocating here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it from the administrative point of view, an officer of the Revenue Commissioners, an inspector in particular, might like to feel that his job is being done for him, that it is simple, in black and white, but if he stops to think for a moment he may be glad, when he meets black and white, to have some discretion.  Applying that to the two points Deputy Colley has made here, you may assume in law and in the House that everything is <i>rite esse acta,</i> but in practice it very often is not, and indeed it is the cases where it is not that raise the trouble and where there will be legal complications and loss of revenue in <Col N="827" /> paying for costs that can accrue to the Revenue Commissioners in the long run.  I have a certain sympathy with the Minister that he cannot close every gap or provide for every eventuality and that when he does provide for one eventuality he leaves room for another.  The Minister has ample experience of Ministers coming into the House and trying to meet points that have been raised and, as it turns out, it might have been as well if the Minister concerned had not been so accommodating.  Therefore, I do not want to fault the Minister on coming in with amendments and trying to perfect this Bill.</P>
    <P>We do not accept the principle of this Bill, but that is for Second Stage and can again be commented upon on Fifth Stage.  However, we are in Committee now and on Report, and within the terms of that I wonder if the Minister is wise in seeking to amend what was already a complicated provision in his original draft as it came before the House on Committee Stage and which is now before us in Committee. It would be unkind of me to say the amendment makes confusion more confounded; it does not, but, while it seeks to meet the points raised on all sides in Committee Stage, I still feel that the fundamental law is in this paragraph, and in those circumstances I would recommend to the Minister that, as this Bill leaves the House for another place, he would reexamine this matter.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister purporting to do in this section?  He wants to deal with the case where assets are within the territory of the State.  To that extent he has a hold on them, but he wants to provide for a contingency where, shall I say, consequences can follow from the mobility of people in the modern world.  I am trying to put this in as general a way as possible to try to get at the principle.  The Minister knows that because he has the assets in his hands there is a sanction. If these assets were elsewhere the Minister could throw his hat at it.  Because he has the assets here he proceeds to deal with them.</P>
    <P>This is either an anti-avoidance provision or else it is to ensure that <Col N="828" /> what rules within the jurisdiction will be the ruling factor in all cases and that opportunities of playing with the jurisdiction will not confer benefits or particular rights or create anomalies as measured against the standard of everything being transacted within the jurisdiction.  Therefore, the section might best be approached by asking the simple question: What powers do we want to give the Revenue Commissioners to ensure the observance of that normality, that all transactions can be measured as if everything was within the jurisdiction?  The first requirement is to empower them to do this.</P>
    <P>The second question is: What potentiality is there for tax avoidance here?  Empower them to guard against it, but then give them discretion, as a number of Deputies said we should do.  In a sense the Minister is trying to provide for that discretion in the conditions for exemption for which he is providing in the subparagraph.</P>
    <P>Would it not be much simpler if once the Revenue Commissioners had the power to cope they were left free to cope knowing from everybody's experience in very hard cases under the death duty code and so on that there is always a sympathetic ear, if possible?  It was that the law tied the Revenue Commissioners, not that the Revenue Commissioners were ogres. Approaching it in that spirit the Minister might further simplify and clarify the amendment that he has brought in, but I fear that will have to be in another House now.</P>
    <P>My last comment would be, if through the Minister I might address it to those who would have to implement this kind of thing: there is, of course, a temptation to wish to have everything cut and dried.  It does save personal trouble.  But, if one stops to think of the type of case one is dealing with, which is with the imposition of taxation, the trouble will be taken anyway.  Possibly the more frequent case is where one would like to take the trouble if one was free but where one cannot take the trouble because one is barred by a statutory provision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been expressing some concern about the possible illeffect <Col N="829" /> on a vendor in cases of this kind where the purchaser pays to carry out the statutory duty being imposed on him under this amendment. The Minister, I think I can fairly say, has tended to minimise these difficulties by relying on the good sense of the legal profession to ensure that the system works smoothly.  I have pointed out that in some of these transactions members of the legal profession may not be involved.  I have also pointed out that it is not really good enough to rely on members of the legal profession where the failure to carry out a statutory obligation by the purchaser can result in considerable loss to the vendor.</P>
      <P>I should like further to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister does not completely rule out the possibility of things happening in the way I envisaged.  Not alone does he not rule it out but he makes specific provision for what is to happen in that event in so far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned. He makes that provision in subparagraph (4) where it is provided:</P>
      <P>The inspector may, where, in relation to any such payment as aforesaid, any person has made default in delivering an account required by this paragraph...</P>
      <P>That visualises default in delivering an account.  That default would be on the part of the purchaser or a person through whom the money was paid. It goes on:</P>
      <P>or where he is not satisfied with the account, estimate the amount of the payment to the best of his judgement and, notwithstanding section 5 (1), assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which the payment was made on an amount equal to one-half of the amount so estimated at the rate specified in section 3 (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, this subparagraph (4) clearly envisages default by the purchaser in one of two ways.  The first way is that he does not hand over the <Col N="830" /> money that he gets and deliver details of the transaction.  The second is where he does hand over the money and delivers details of the transaction but the inspector has reason to believe that the details furnished are inaccurate, in other words, that the amount of the consideration and, in particular, the gain disclosed is too small.</P>
    <P>In either of those cases the subparagraph provides that the inspector may then step in, make his own estimate, assess the purchaser for a particular liability based on the inspector's own estimate and then go after him with all the powers available under the Bill to recover it.</P>
    <P>That is a wise and adequate precaution on the part of the Minister to protect the revenue in a case of the kind we envisaged here, but what I want to know is where is there a similar prudent, wise and reasonable precaution to protect the vendor in precisely the same circumstances, that is, where the purchaser fails to discharge his statutory obligation to pay over the money to the Revenue Commissioners, or pays it late or does not pay the full amount?  In any of these cases the vendor is going to suffer but there is no provision that I can see here that enables the vendor in such circumstances to do anything that is going to protect him, to do anything that will get his money back, or to do anything that will get him interest on that money even if, in fact, the purchaser was liable to pay him interest on that money under their contract. There is no provision that I can see in this amendment which would protect the vendor in such circumstances in any way although, as I say, there is provision in subparagraph (4) as to what the inspector on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners may do in such circumstances to recover the money involved and to get the machinery moving.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the Minister is clearly visualising default of the kind I was visualising.  Otherwise, there would not be the provisions of subparagraph (4).  But I am also saying that where such default occurs it is not just the Revenue Commissioners who lose, it is the vendor, and I am <Col N="831" /> asking what provision is being made to protect the interests of the vendor where such default occurs.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners to say, &ldquo;we have not got the money and therefore we will go after the purchaser&rdquo;.  That is really no consolation to the vendor.  I do think that if the Minister is going to prescribe a statutory deduction of this kind there is an obligation on him in such circumstances to be responsible for what happens to that money when it is deducted until it is handed over to the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to me that he is excluding that possibility at the moment, that he is not accepting that responsibility, but I do not think he can avoid that responsibility.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is sufficient answer for the Minister to say that the vendor can overcome this difficulty by going along to the Revenue Commissioners in advance and having his liability assessed and paying it.  I do not think that is reasonable because, first, there may be difficulty in getting the assessment in advance, but even supposing he can overcome that, what about the payment in advance?  That is open only to somebody who not alone is wealthy but is in a sufficiently good liquidity position to enable him to discharge what could be a substantial liability for capital gains tax in advance of receiving the purchase money.  Admittedly, if somebody is in a position to do that, he can produce his certificate and the purchaser is not entitled to deduct anything.  One proceeds then in the way one would proceed in respect of an ordinary sale.  I agree that the vendor is not running any risk there, but I suggest to the Minister that, perhaps, that would be a fairly unusual case and that there will be at least as many, and probably very many more, cases in which it will not be possible for the vendor to have the capital gains tax assessed in advance and, in particular, that it will not be possible for him to pay the capital gains tax in advance of receiving the purchase money.  Where that happens, the vendor has no certificates in which circumstances the purchaser has the statutory obligation to deduct an <Col N="832" /> amount equivalent to capital gains tax on half of the purchase money and he has the obligation to pay that money to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>This takes us back to my point in relation to subparagraph (4) which, clearly, is the clause put in to enable the Revenue Commissioners in the event of a default by the purchaser in carrying out his obligation, to move in, make their own assessment and put in action the machinery to recover the money due to them.  It is right and proper that they should do this, but let us think for a moment of the position of a vendor in such circumstances.  He had not been in a position to pay the capital gains tax in advance of receiving the purchase money.  So far as he is concerned the purchaser, on foot of subparagraph (2) has a clear, statutory obligation to deduct the money.  He must accept that as part of the purchase money.  He finds then that the purchaser should have paid the money to the Revenue Commissioners but did not do so.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners are thinking of going after the purchaser for recovery of the money.  They may be a bit slow because they have a lot of other work to do, but in the meantime there is the vendor from whom money was deducted by statutory authority, money which in all probability, is in excess of his tax liability, but there is nothing he can do to recover it because the money is due, not to him, but to the Revenue Commissioners. Also, if there is interest due on the money, the vendor foregoes it.  I do not see how he could recover it from the purchaser and the Minister has made it clear that the vendor will not recover it from the Revenue Commissioners. In such case the position of the vendor is anything but enviable. While the Minister has given power, and rightly so, to the Commissioners in a case of this kind, he has not given any thought to the position of the vendor for whom it is necessary to provide some protection.  I find it difficult to produce a complete answer to this problem, but that is not my obligation.  The obligation to do so lies entirely with the Minister, since he is bringing in the legislation, but <Col N="833" /> something that suggests itself immediately is that where there has been a default by the purchaser in complying with the statutory obligation, the Revenue Commissioners, who are the ones standing to benefit from the carrying out of that obligation, should stand in the shoes of the purchaser <i>vis-á-vis</i> the vendor in such circumstances and should at least be responsible for interest on the money outstanding, money which the vendor cannot recover even by legal action against either the Revenue Commissioners or the purchaser because at that point neither owes him any money.  So far as I can see, in the event of such default, the only persons who can give any assistance or protection to the position of the vendor are the Revenue Commismissioners. Therefore, I suggest that some provision be incorporated to ensure that, at the very least, the Revenue Commissioners will pay interest on the money they owe to the vendor from the date on which the necessary information is furnished to enable them to assess the tax until the date on which they pay him the money due to him.  While more might be required, that is the very minimum to which a vendor in the circumstances I have described should be entitled to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me that the more precautions I would build into this in response to pleas from Deputy Colley, the more I would be tying people to one arrangement, and people might not thank us for building in these restrictions.  For instance, I could provide that the purchaser might not only deduct the money but should deliver it to the Revenue Commissioners and I could provide that the vendor later should allow such deductions on receipt of confirmation of receipt of the money.  That would not only lead to a situation in which the purchaser would have to pay the sum deducted prior to the closing of a sale and then produce a receipt but a person who did that in good faith might find that simultaneously, the vendor acting independently, having had tax assessed, had paid it.  There are so many different situations and arrangements that could <Col N="834" /> arise that it is far better to leave it to the parties concerned to decide how, respectively, they should discharge the legal obligations which arise for the payment of capital gains tax by the vendor.  It would seem best to leave people some area of manoeuverability, some discretion as to whether the purchaser or the vendor would pay, and when and whether it should be paid before or after the transaction. For a variety of reasons it might suit one vendor to allow the tax to be deducted afterwards while another might wish to have it all determined beforehand.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley's point that a vendor may not have the money necessary to pay the tax beforehand is one with which I agree.  However, under the old estate duty code that sort of situation arose often but personal representatives made arrangements with banks to pay advances pending realisation of the assets in the administration of the estate.  I would not contemplate that many vendors would have difficulty in obtaining accommodation from the bank in payment of capital gains tax against lodgement with the bank of the proceeds of the sale as soon as the transaction is closed.</P>

      <P>On Friday last in the few minutes at my disposal I had begun to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister for Finance, the Minister who is, in the ultimate the manager of the financial <Col N="835" /> affairs of the country, had presented to us in respect of this year a situation where, if we divide the year up into what is fashionable now, namely, the five day week, the Minister is short to the extent of £1 million per day. That is what the Minister told us he is short in respect of the current budget. Now £1 million per day over a five day week approximates to £250 million per year.  If we want to draw the attention of the House and the attention of the people to the appalling position this figure must be repeated over and over again.  It will not be necessary, however, to repeat it much longer, because the inevitability of this disastrous approach to budgeting must befall the country before much longer.</P>
      <P>I return now to my deficit of £1 million per day presented to this House by the Minister for Finance. I draw the attention of the House to the enormity of the amount.  We have become theoretically, at least, quite familiar with dealing in millions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no conundrum. It is a fact and it should not be tolerated. We cannot continue at that level.  The same Minister for Finance has looked for and got quite an amount of backing from some of his own party in respect of his wealth tax. He understands that the amount of money he will get from it may realise, according to the experts, £2 million or £3 million a year.  Apparently the Minister is not concerned with the fact that he is spending £1 million per day more than he has.  Again, apparently, he was aware to some extent of his mismanagement and lack of husbandry because we were being advised earlier on by some of the more responsible members in the Government that the day for tightening our belts had come.  Before this budget, through what one assumes were leaks from the GIS, we were told to get ready for a tough budget. In the circumstances one would have expected a responsible budget. What do we find the Minister doing? Notwithstanding the unholy financial mess in which the Minister already is he proceeds in his budget to hand out goodies.  He is prepared to cod the public into thinking the position is so healthy he can distribute goodies from a fund he knows is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Years ago, when I was in my late 'teens or early twenties.  I remember a certain amount of criticism of a Member of this House who was advocating what he called a monetary reform policy.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan in his less enlightened days made so bold as to advocate the Government in office printing money. Naturally enough, people who did not have money were attracted to that type of financial philosophy.  Eventually Deputy Flanagan and others realised that, if money were to have any real value it could not just be printed.  The collateral had to be there.  The backing had to be there. What the monetary unit represented had to exist.  Otherwise it would be <Col N="837" /> paper money and have no value.  That was 25 or 30 years ago and the idea of monetary reform in the fashion advocated by Deputy Flanagan died a natural death.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the Government who have the backing of Deputy Flanagan and who, apparently, could not contain in the Front Bench a man of the calibre of Deputy Flanagan, are now carrying out that type of financial policy.  They are unashamedly printing a certain amount of money which has not got the appropriate backing at home or abroad.  Two or three years ago, if a man left home with £10 in his pocket he could be reasonably sure that with that £10 he could purchase the services and goods of his fellow man.  He would purchase very little now for £10.  When his wife goes to the supermarket he is quickly reminded of how little £10 will purchase. This is due to the fact that the Government ran away from their responsibilities and are endeavouring to pander to the popular and to the ephemeral.  In their 14-point programme they told the electorate that if they were elected people would get money without effort and there would be reward without effort.</P>
    <P>I want to quote what I said in April, 1972, in an endeavour to vindicate my own position.  I suppose a Member of the House need not necessarily be accused of vanity if he quotes what he said himself when his own Government were in office.  I referred to my philosophy of life in the debate on the Financial Resolution in April, 1972. Those were the good days.  Those were the days when there was full and good employment, when we had a strong and secure Government who were prepared to do the correct thing, which was not always the popular thing.  They had the ability and the courage to govern in a fashion which led to the general well being of the people.</P>

      <P>Sin ceist eile.  Beidh lá eile ag na daoine agus ceartóidh siad é sin.  It is given to every generation to make one mistake.  Perhaps it <Col N="838" /> is only by such mistakes that the people have an opportunity of weighing the alternative against the factual and learning the lesson.</P>
      <P>As reported at column 1000, Volume 260 of the Official Report for 26th April, 1972, I said:</P>
      <P>There is another thing I should like to say and here, again, I am expounding my own philosophy.  If there is anything of lasting pleasure to be got in this world it can only be achieved by effort, hard work and self-sacrifice.</P>
      <P>That excludes the Irish Hospitals Sweepstakes and bingo.  I went on:</P>
      <P>One can enjoy an occasional ephemeral pleasure or satisfaction by adopting a policy contrary to what I suggest but in the long term the best and only worthwhile system is one in which effort is compensated by reward.  However desirable it might be for some people, you cannot have the lasting worthwhile situation based on the idea that reward can be gained without effort.</P>
      <P>In 1972 I saw signs on the wall which did not appeal to me.  I said elsewhere that I thought people were, perhaps, spending in excess of what they were producing and that was a dangerous long-term policy.  As reported at column 1001 of the same Volume the then Deputy Donegan, now Minister for Defence, said:</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney's rather grim suggestion that the only pleasure obtainable in this valley of tears is through hard work, effort and sacrifice places him with the good priest in the Cistercian monasteries and the good nuns in the most stringent orders and places all the rest of us in the modern situation which he is right to criticise but which exists, and not only in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain inarticulation about that quotation and a certain amount of ambiguity.  I think we can take it that Deputy Donegan was preaching that there was some other road to enjoyment and satisfaction of a permanent nature and that there was some easy way in which you could create and maintain a standard of living other than that which I indicated.  I might say in passing that if Deputy <Col N="839" /> Donegan has been listening over the past six months to the Taoiseach, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and indeed to himself, he must realise I was nearer to the correct position then than he was.  Deputy Donegan, now Minister for Defence, indeed, a senior Minister of this Government, said then&mdash;and it is appropriate that I repeat his views and relate them to what the Minister for Finance is doing&mdash;he did not believe in budgeting for a deficit.  It is well to repeat that, as did Deputy Donegan on that occasion. Invariably, repetition occurs when a speaker is so sure of his point he has some doubts that the listener did not get its full impact.  Deputy Donegan, speaking in this House in April, 1972&mdash;three years ago&mdash;said he did not believe in budgeting for a deficit. I wonder how does Deputy Donegan feel about budgeting for a deficit of £1 million per day?  Is he happy with that situation?  I do not believe he is.  The sooner Deputy Donegan, now Minister for Defence, convinces the other members of the Cabinet that deficit budgeting to the extent we have now can have only catastrophic consequences and already has had the better.  Even at this late stage when the country is financially prostrate there might be some hope yet that the Government would tackle the situation and govern the country as a country should and is entitled to be governed.  If they are not prepared to do that I say to them in all sincerity&mdash;not that I am in any way envious of what is described as the power of office, but from a genuine and sincere interest I have in my fellowman, of a concern I have for my family, relations, friends and neighbours&mdash;for heaven's sake and, for the sake of the people, get out and hand over to an alternative government prepared to govern the country as it should be governed.</P>
    <P>Obviously one has not sufficient time in one hour to make what might be regarded as a comprehensive statement but, as a reminder of the attitude of the Government to many things&mdash;and I accept readily there are competitive elements for the available money&mdash;I want to refer to the situation <Col N="840" /> which has arisen and the attitudes the Government have adopted in regard to education.  Throughout the years many worth-while strides were made towards creating a situation in which every boy and girl would have education available to him or her.  It may have different interpretations in the minds of many people.  I shall not delve into that here beyond saying there was general acceptance that it was an entitlement of every young person.  The Constitution lays down that primary education shall be free. Indeed, that requirement was acknowledged until the advent of this Government.  For the first time ever this Government have introduced a fee in respect of primary education; a Government which, on the one hand, is over-spending to the extent of £1 million per day and, on the other hand, cannot provide for the under 12s free education which is their constitutional entitlement. Under the guise of democratisation and the setting up of school management boards, we are told that every school where there is a management board prepared to extract £1.50 per student per annum, there will be paid a capitation grant of £6 per student.  But, in the schools where that has not been done no capitation grant will be paid.  In effect, that means there will not be adequate finances available for heating, lighting or cleaning.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the situation obtaining already in the matter of school building, again a matter I consider to be unconstitutional.  In my constituency, and indeed in others, local people are obliged to pay, or to collect any way they like, £5,000, £6,000, £7,000 or £8,000 for a school site.  I suggest that is entirely wrong.  It is not fair to those people but, most important of all, is contrary to the Constitution. I hear many people expressing concern about matters I would regard as not being as important as those of constitutional rights.  Those same people are very quiet on this new proposal of the Government to withdraw from our children their constitutional right to free primary education. Arising from that we have a situation now in which the church or chapel&mdash;<Col N="841" /> which formerly was, and should be, a house of prayer&mdash;has become a taxgathering house.  Every Sunday boxes are sent around to collect money in order that people may have their entitlement in respect of primary education. It is an appalling situation.  I suggest it is a subterfuge to get the taxpayer to contribute once, twice or three times to what he has contributed already in respect of education.  Later I may refer to the position in regard to secondary education.</P>
    <P>For the moment I am attempting to direct the attention of the House to this most undesirable development in regard to post-primary education. I do not blame the Minister for Education for this but the Minister for Finance who has failed to make moneys available to give needed services to primary schools.  Surely the priest or the person or the other religious engaged in primary education have enough to do to look after matters appropriate to their domain without having to make appeals Sunday after Sunday for funds to provide lighting, heating and cleaning for primary schools?  They have to tell their parishioners that if they do not get £1.50 per pupil they will not get the capitation grant.  Ancillary to that we have the situation where the local school principal is at his wits' end from Monday to Friday to try to fulfil his duties as secretary to the board of management.  He has to introduce subterfuges to get the children to bring in money so that he can continue to operate his school.</P>
    <P>In so far as the constitutional position is concerned, much the same is happening in respect of the second level education where, because of inadequate finance the religious orders and the good people who are managing the schools are forced to introduce all sorts of airy-fairy schemes because they do not want to be accused of taking fees from students in respect of what is described as free education.  In the general collection of taxes, moneys are directed to the Exchequer to provide free second level education but this is not being done, while at the same time we have the Minister for Finance spending £1 <Col N="842" /> million pounds per day more than he should in respect of other things. Time does not permit me to develop that aspect.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the position in regard to employment.  I know there are people who for one reason or another have lost the urge to work.  I readily concede there is a duty on us to rehabilitate those people as best we can.  I will therefore not refer to the 100,000 unemployed because that figure includes many of those I have just referred to, but each morning there are 50,000 people who because of the inefficiency of the Government cannot avail of their right to the employment in which they wish to engage.  In 1972 the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at column 1532 of the Official Report is reported as saying that in 1968 half of those offered posts as administrative officers did not take them.  We had a situation where junior administrative and junior executive officer posts, which by any standards are not inferior positions, were not applied for.  Indeed many of those who had been in those jobs did not stay in them because there was more remunerative employment elsewhere.</P>
    <P>As Hamlet said: &ldquo;Look you now what follow&rdquo;.  We have people with second and third level educational qualifications who would be happy to take jobs on the lowest rungs of the civil service, the messenger service or the paper-keeping service, at any grade.  In 1968 the situation was the reverse and I remember in 1969 and 1970, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, hearing accounting officers telling us the difficulty they had in recruiting people to jobs suitable for second level education people. What has become of all the marvellous changes promised to us in 1973, notwithstanding all the efforts of the intellectuals who are now shown to be the ineffectuals?  Notwithstanding the great Government promises and the thousands of jobs to be enjoyed by everybody, the position is worsening day by day.  We have the Minister for Labour, who is so adept and efficient that if he wants to solve a CIE problem he thinks he can do it by <Col N="843" /> taking a temporary residence in Australia. That was what he thought of his position as Minister for Labour on that occasion.  During a CIE strike the Member of this Government who should have been at home endeavouring to find some settlement and to restore sanity and correct order decides to go on what was described by the gentlemen of the Government Information Services, those great propagandists, as a mission looking for industry in Australia, a country which, at the time, had an unemployment position which, relatively speaking, was as bad as our own.  He was in Australia trying to bring industry to Ireland.  I have not read since from the gentlemen of the Government Information Services details of how successful the Minister's visit was.  Perhaps it would be no harm when he is making his contribution in this debate, if the Minister for Labour would indicate his position and how he is going to handle matters relevant to his Department.  I am referring here to the wage agreement and when the crucial talks will take place.  I know he will say he is not directly involved but when the good offices of the Department of Labour are sought a few months hence if the Minister is required will he have to be searched for in some Oriental country, will he be at home or will he be on one of his fishing holidays?</P>
    <P>On the matter of employment in education reference must be made to the thousands of young people who are stepping on to the labour platform at present and who are so disappointed. We will have to look into other areas and perhaps not be as cautious as people on these benches in the past have been.  There are matters which must be referred to in the current emergency.  Some years ago when Fianna Fáil were in office in their desire and their concern to make the best possible educational service available and at a time when there were not sufficient trained teachers coming on the market a decision was made that married ladies could be recruited to the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>Married teachers were recalled and the Fianna Fáil Government of the <Col N="844" /> day were very happy that this helped to reduce the student-teacher ratio and helped to improve the service already in existence.  An appalling situation exists at present.  Hundreds of BA and H. Dip. students have been unable to get employment in second level education and are prepared to take employment, if they can get it, in primary school level.  Perhaps we should now look at the advisability not of asking existing married ladies to relinquish their employment but of not recruiting any more married teachers for the moment.  I know that in this women's year people will point a finger at Deputy Tunney and say that he is not being fair to the ladies.  I would not like to be accused of that.  I am concerned about young ladies who are leaving universities and who are leaving the training colleges and who cannot get jobs, even sweeping factory floors.  Perhaps this is one of the perks of power.  Perhaps all the friends of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance have succeeded in getting employment appropriate to their qualifications.  I am only speaking for my own friends and acquaintances. There are literally hundreds of them who are qualified and who cannot get one hour's teaching.  We should retain those who have shouldered the burden over the years and here too I would make a case for the untrained teachers who have been removed.  I think the Minister was wrong to reject those 238 teachers who helped over many years.  On the other hand, we should look at the question of continuing to recruit married ladies to the teaching profession while there are so many unmarried ladies who have as yet not had any opportunity of tasting employment. The time has come to look at the position and if necessary to redress it.</P>
    <P>The subject on which I propose to finish is one for which I have some responsibility in this House.  I refer to the Land Commission and the new legislation, legislation which would not have gone through as readily if I had been present.  I was indisposed for two months.</P>
    <P>I referred to the situation where the Government, who have so little to back them at this moment, are approaching <Col N="845" /> the good farming community, the people who are not of the old absentee landlord type, people who were peasants and some years ago inherited or acquired land.  They are now being approached by the Land Commission, who are concocting one reason or another for acquiring that property. Instead of paying the people from whom they are acquiring the property in money they are paying them in this Oliver J. Flanagan money to which I referred earlier on.  The Government are confiscating the land of Ireland. They are not acquiring it in the spirit of the Land Acts, which have been there since the latter end of the last century.</P>
    <P>When the last Land Act was introduced here I directed the attention of the House to the fact that the land bonds and the 16 per cent interest that was being paid would be at a discount in a very short time and that it was nonsense to say that we were paying these people.  I am talking about the Irish farmer with from 50 to 70 acres whose land is being taken from him. The only compensation he gets is a barrow full of land bonds which, as far as I am concerned, are as useless as the Government whose idea they are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I use the word &ldquo;budget&rdquo; in connection with this debate in its very loosest term because the budget statement of the Minister for Finance was only a loose definition of the word &ldquo;budget&rdquo;.  It was only a very slight attempt to tackle the three main evils facing the Irish economy and the people in general&mdash; the problems of unemployment, inflation and our balance of payments deficit.  If there was any attempt made to cure those three problems it would bring the Irish economy back to the very healthy state it was in when the present Government took over slightly over two years ago.  If the Minister made any effort at all he could have put the country back on the road to steady progress in which he found it when he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did the Minister do?  He introduced some very minor subsidies, to, as described by one of the political <Col N="846" /> correspondents, give somebody a Rennie when he was suffering from cancer.  Major surgery and major decisions were needed but all we got was a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  This comes back to the problem facing the country at the moment, that of a Coalition Government, a Government divided within itself. There are two parties standing on directly opposite sides of the political divide.  Many members of one are ultra-right and many members of the other are ultra-left.  How can they possibly make the decisions which are necessary for the good of the country? They were incapable of making the decisions in the first place and this resulted in us getting into the troubles we are in at the moment.  Now they find themselves unable to make the decisions to get us out of our troubles.</P>
    <P>Inflation is running, according to the Government figures, at between 25 and 30 per cent.  In the budget the Minister said that the measures taken will perhaps reduce it by about four points.  It will still be more than double what is now the average throughout the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.  We have been told that a lot of our problems stem from the days of the oil crisis, the importation of oil and the increased oil charges at the time of the Arab-Israeli war.  Other countries have been able to adjust to this difficulty.  This régime keep falling back on the old catch cry: &ldquo;It is all because of the Arabs. If they did not increase the price of oil everything would have been fine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What have the Government done about the unemployment situation? There are over 100,000 people on the live register.  If you take the number of people who left school last year who still have not got jobs and add to that the 50,000 who left school this year without having any place to go the figure would be heading rapidly towards 150,000 if we were given the true figures.  I am not accusing anybody of falsifying figures, but I say that the system at present in use does not reflect the situation on the ground. The 50,000 people leaving school this year have practically no place to find work.  They cannot go to the semiState bodies because we know they are <Col N="847" /> not recruiting.  They cannot go to one of the major banks, who normally took on quite a proportion of school leavers, because they have advertised that they are not taking anybody on. There have been enough quotations during this debate already, and I do not intend to give any.  We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary, in answer to a question, that there are still vacancies within the civil service, but only a small proportion of those unemployed will find employment there because employment in the civil service is not anything like it was.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus was the main employer for young people leaving school in my constituency in North County Dublin, although I know they employed many people throughout the country.  This year there is a complete stop on recruitment.  The story is the same in relation to many factories in that area.  The Government must be aware of this situation because they have the advisers and they have the figures.  They must know how grim the situation is.  What major decisions are made?  There is nothing except this package in the budget of 2p here and 1p there and, in order to make the situation worse, an increase in income tax.  On the night before this so-called budget was introduced the Fianna Fáil Party had before the House a Private Members' motion relating to the building industry. Although I said I would not quote I think it is appropriate to quote this.  The motion, as recorded at column 1751 of the Official Report of 25th June, 1975, was as follows:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Local Government to increase substantially financial investment in the building industry, with special provision for the private house-building sector, in view of the serious decline in the numbers employed in the industry over the past twelve months and the urgent need to create jobs to cope with the high level of general unemployment in the country.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did not lightly put down that motion.  It was seriously considered that if the Government accepted <Col N="848" /> that motion the action proposed in it would go a long way towards solving the three main ills of inflation, unemployment and the balance of payments. In March, 1975, there were 19,887 building workers unemployed despite the Government telling us that things were never better in the industry. The building industry can do more than any other sector of the economy to help in regard to inflation, unemployment and balance of payments.  It can help directly and indirectly in regard to employment.  It is the easiest industry to get going because the infrastructure is already there and it is only a matter of starting projects and starting building.  It can also assist the suppliers and manufacturers of materials used in building, and over 80 per cent of those materials are manufactured within the State.  This would help the balance of payments deficit because most of the equipment and material used would not have to be imported and the balance of payments problem would not be further exacerbated.</P>
    <P>The Minister did make some contribution, and said he would get the banks to make available £40 million over two years, £20 million per year. How will that money be allocated? How effective will it be in getting the industry going again?  The morning after the budget statement, in a radio interview, the banks' representative spoke of loans being available on a 20-year term at an interest rate of probably 12½ per cent.  I suggest that not very many people will be in a position to take up loans on these terms.  I think that if the Minister got this money from the banks it would have been better to increase the money in the SDA loan fund with a view to raising the SDA loan from £4,500 to £6,000 and the income limit from £2,350 up to £3,000.  In that way the £20 million per year could have given an increased incentive to young couples to buy houses; it would have made more money available to them and would have brought many more within the SDA loan scheme.  We could have had an immediate increase in employment in the building industry with a spin-off effect on ancillary industries.  In its present form, while <Col N="849" /> the £20 million is a help, it does not go far enough and the money is being allocated in the wrong way.</P>
    <P>A sum of £20 million per year between two main banking groups represents presumably £10 million each, and assuming there are about 750 branches of each group and that the average loan runs to about £8,000, there will be less than two loans in every branch.  How can this help on a national basis when what is required is a massive injection of capital?</P>
    <P>I may be asked, why increase the income limit from £2,350 to £3,000? The answer is that it has not been increased since May, 1973 and we know the building industry has suffered a greater rate of inflation than most industries.  Even on the Government's figures, inflation has been running at about 25 per cent but the £2,350 has been static&mdash;no increase.  The average three-bedroom house now costs about £7,500 and the maximum loan available is £4,500, which leaves a gap of £3,000.  To be eligible for the £4,500 loan you must be earning less than £2,350 a year.  It is practically impossible to save a deposit of £3,000 on that figure of earning.</P>
    <P>The solution to the problems of the private building sector should have been the injection of capital into the SDA loan fund, but this was not done. On the contrary, the Minister in his budget speech on 26th June, 1975 said:</P>
    <P>As from today, therefore, interest on new advances from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for these loans will be increased from 10 per cent to 11 per cent and the repayment period will be reduced from 35 to 30 years.</P>
    <P>He says this would mean that the normal rate of interest charged to individual borrowers on new loans would be increased from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent.  So, instead of helping this section of the community that I am discussing, those that are anxious to buy houses at the lower end of the market, this Government have further exacerbated the situation by increasing the interest rate by 1 per cent, and reducing the number of years available for the loan.  This is <Col N="850" /> the Government who tell us the building industry is going very well. I would ask for some sincerity from the other side of the House with regard to these figures.</P>
    <P>Another way the Government could have helped would have been by an injection of capital into the infrastructure required&mdash;the making of roads, the laying of sewers and so on.  There is not much hope of an improvement in the building industry proper, but the creation of the infrastructure would provide employment. Pipes would have to be laid and roads built and the factories manufacturing the requisities for this sort of work would be fully engaged.  Wavin felt so strongly about the problems that they took a full page advertisment in <i>The Sunday Press</i> on 9th February last in which they said:</P>
    <P>Ireland's building industry has only two options&mdash;drawing bricks or drawing the dole.  There is no doubt about the country's desperate need for more housing.  Let us get building going again.</P>
    <P>That was issued jointly by Wavin Pipes Ltd. and Wavin Pipes Workers' Council.  The Workers' Council in Wavin did not take that decision lightly.  We have a good idea what a full page spread costs but they were prepared to meet that cost because they were so worried about the industry and the effect the recession would have on their jobs.  Up to 100 workers were laid off.  If the Government were to put money into the infrastructure factories like Wavin would not be in the position they are.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  The engineers in Dublin County Council&mdash;I know this from personal experience&mdash;asked for £6 million to carry out what they considered was the necessary programme of expansion this year in the provision of sewerage, roads, water, <i>et cetera</i>.  They got approval from the Government for exactly half that amount.  The engineers did not come to that decision lightly.  They set out exactly what the programme would be, what pipes they would need, what quantity of cement, how many trucks and men they would require, and so <Col N="851" /> on.  They asked for £6 million and they got exactly half, £3 million. Obviously only half the work proposed can be done.  That will mean men laid off, machines not properly used and supply factories employing fewer men.  The spin-off effect goes right across the board.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Government that everything in the garden is rosy and things could not be better.  We have one glaring example of the effect of the balance of payments deficit on employment.  We have spoken about the shoe industry on many occasions. We have tabled many motions asking the Government to protect the workers in this industry.  According to the pink sheet again boots and shoes are reduced to zero rating from 1st July, 1975.  What help will that be to our footwear factories?  Imports are also free from VAT as from 1st July. I suggested that the Government should put a 50 per cent cash levy on imports from outside the EEC and 25 per cent on imports from within the EEC, the money to be held for six months and then refunded.  This is an emergency measure, but we are in an emergency situation.  If this were done on imports to the value of £1,000 the supplier would have to lodge 50 per cent or 25 per cent of that amount with the Irish Government for a period of six months.  That would slow down importation, help our balance of payments and direct purchasers towards Irish made goods.</P>
    <P>I may be told that this would be breaking EEC regulations.  The British have been known to carry out similar measures.  The Italians have been known to do likewise.  The French have taken steps where lamb imports are concerned.  It is my personal view&mdash;I emphasise it is a personal view&mdash;that we should put this 50 per cent or 25 per cent deposit barrier on imports.  It is not a tariff. It is merely a cash deposit to be held for six months and then refunded. Such a deposit would make a major contribution towards helping our balance of payments deficit, which is running at the colossal figure of £200 million a year.  That is a great deal of money.  The deposit would <Col N="852" /> also help our employment situation, because it would reduce imports and it would improve the chances of Irish people buying Irish goods.</P>
    <P>In the short time available it is not possible for me to go into detail on all aspects of the budget.  I should like to refer to motor vehicle duties and payments to the Road Fund.  Irish motorists are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  They are one of the most overburdened sections of the community. The sooner there is a general rethink at Government level on the role of the motorist in Irish life the better.  The vast majority of cars on the roads are there for business purposes. People have to use them to get to their jobs and to get home.  People such as commercial travellers and so on use them in their jobs.  How could a politician get around his constituency without a motor car?  People have to have cars.  This does not seem to be realised at Government level. They cling to the old idea that the motor car is a luxury and they tax cars and petrol and provide inadequate roads.  Recently the Minister introduced a further harassment of the motoring public by extending the role of the traffic wardens.</P>
    <P>In the budget various items were excluded from VAT, or zero rated, with the exception of road fuels. Petrol is now costing about 15/- per gallon.  Surely some incentive could have been given to the motorist and some clawback taken away by the Minister.  This would have been of assistance to the car assembly industry. It is pointed out that under motor vehicle duties about £28.7 million is coming in and about £19.1 million going out to the road fund.  Of the nearly £30 million coming in from motor vehicle taxation only twothirds is going to the road fund.  Some of our main roads are little better than dirt tracks.  Travelling from any part of the country to the major cities the traffic delays and the problems are appalling.  How can you have a strong economy if you have not got the basic necessity of a proper road structure between the cities?  How can you talk about moving factories to the west if you have not got a proper road structure from the main ports to the west? <Col N="853" /> I would appeal to the Government to rethink this whole situation, even leaving aside the plight of the motorist and thinking of sound economics.  We must have a proper road structure which will allow for the free movement of commercial goods from area to area.  This will help our economy to expand in no small way.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry has been suffering for a considerable time.  There is no benefit in the budget of 26th June for that industry.  The Minister could have made provision for petrol at a reduced rate for tourists.  This could be done, as the Italians do it, by handing the tourist a certain number of slips as he comes into the country which he would hand in when purchasing petrol.  This would encourage tourists instead of discouraging them. Instead of having to pay 15/- a gallon for petrol it should be available to tourists at 10/- or 7/6 a gallon. There is no encouragement in the budget for tourism.  The Government should consider the plight of the industry at the moment.  We are all aware of the number of hotels up for sale throughout the country.  People are selling out literally for a song to get out of the industry.  This is an industry which was built up under Fianna Fáil administration with grants and encouragement and, now, people who went into it with high hopes a few short years ago, find themselves with their backs to the wall because of the strain and stress caused by this regime.</P>
    <P>We do not have to go any further than the national airline to realise the problems in the industry and the effect they are having.  The situation at Dublin Airport at the moment is appalling. Within the next week or fortnight it will be without a restaurant to provide proper facilities for our tourists.  One of the attractions of the airport was the standard of food and service in the restaurant.  It built up an international reputation.  It got a four-star rating in 1962 and now it has to close down because of economic factors.  What did the Government do in this budget to help premises like that to remain in business? No assistance whatsoever was given.  I appeal to the Minister for Transport <Col N="854" /> and Power to approach the Aer Rianta authorities with a view to having the decision to close the airport restaurant reconsidered.  From a national point of view it would be a pity if this facility which was widely used and widely commented upon were to close down.</P>
    <P>In this debate I wanted to deal with inflation, unemployment and the balance of payments deficit, the three main problems facing the country.</P>

This proposal was accepted and the Council decided that aid should be made available from the European Social Fund for specific operations likely to facilitate the geographical and vocational mobility of young people under 25 years of age who are unemployed or seeking employment, on the understanding that priority would be given to young people seeking employment for the first time.  The formal regulation implementing this decision will be made in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration is at present being given to measures which would enable this country to benefit from the recent decision of the Council.  Under the existing regulations of the European <Col N="856" /> Social Fund, various schemes which cover the training of young people in Ireland already qualify for aid from the fund.</P>
    <P>A good deal of the training organised by AnCo and CERT, particularly for craft occupations, is directed towards young people and the scale of such training is being expanded as far as possible within available resources. The National Manpower Service of my Department is also doing everything possible to help school leavers to secure employment.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if his Government have considered, as other European Governments have done, the introduction of employment premiums to assist the employment of young people, in view of the Government's responsibility for the huge number of school leavers that are unemployed at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have not considered that.  As the Deputy is aware, we have the premium employment programme, but this relates primarily to those on the unemployed register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that this is probably one of the greatest problems that has ever faced this country, that of the 52,500 school leavers who are now seeking employment and who, for the most part, have no opportunity whatever of getting employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>While employment is a serious problem, it is not as serious among the young as it is among other categories.  The report available for 1974 suggests that there was a far higher number of young people who managed to get employment in that period of difficulty than we would have thought.  We have a similar survey for 1975.  The result of the figures available is that, in fact, <Col N="857" /> the young have, even in the conditions of extraordinary difficulty that there are at present, managed to get more jobs than we would have thought possible.</P>

      <P>In the 1974 survey we did a sample of 37,733 out of a total number of 44,000 school leavers in that year and the proportion who did not manage to get employment was quite satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the possibility of introducing a voluntary early retirement scheme for people who are 60 years of age plus so as to make way for some of the thousands of young people who are now leaving vocational and secondary schools and even universities, who cannot get employment and whose morale will be shattered by having to join the 100,000 or more people who are unemployed today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, if any <Col N="858" /> such scheme were to be a success it would have to have the support of employer and union organisations, since it would affect those already at work.  If any such scheme is put forward we shall consider it very carefully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I have indicated, we have not taken any initiative in this matter.  If there was any support there for it I am sure we would have heard about it.  The back of unemployment will be broken only when conditions of general recovery come about.  In the meantime, we must ensure that as many jobs as possible are saved, and as an Administration we are attempting to do this.</P>

The amount of money mentioned in that is £20 million.  As the Deputy knows, there is an inner debate going on about savings within the Social Fund.  In general, we are not in favour of savings from within the fund.  We wish to see the fund expanded.  There is some difference of opinion between the applicant countries in this, between <Col N="861" /> the Germans and some member countries who see any extra financial outlay by the Community coming from savings within existing funds and those who like Ireland, Italy and Britain, would hope to see the fund extended and expanded.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume what is really there is the application spreading from one year to the next.  There is a lag in the time in which the member country takes up the amount of money and presumably this in any one year's account can appear as a surplus in that year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That could not be the explanation.  It is implicit in all these statements which are emanating from Brussels about the use of this fund to alleviate the unemployment situation that the money can be made available from past resources of the fund which have not been taken up, and this is very disquieting.</P>

      <P>As it relates to the Irish position at any rate, we have taken up and we are satisfied that we have taken up to the maximum what is available, what is possible for this country to take up; but the Deputy is right in saying that there has been comment emanating from certain circles in Brussels to suggest that there are more moneys which could be tapped from this source for development purposes in this country.  The main argument is made about a conflict between the Industrial Development Act, 1969 and the regulations of the fund itself, and the suggestion has been made that if here at home we alter that legislation many more firms could seek aid from the fund. <Col N="862" /> We had this discussion last week. That legislation comes under the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We are satisfied that the country, under existing legislation, gets its fair share from the European Social Fund and perhaps that is what the Deputy means when he refers to that commentary which certainly has appeared in the Press about a conflict&mdash;apparent conflict&mdash;more apparent than real&mdash;between that legislation and the regulations under the fund.</P>

How many of these have already been interviewed by the National Manpower Service, how many have been listed for retraining, have any of them already been placed in training courses, and when can we hope that a reasonable number of people will be given employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment to amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>After subparagraph (7) of paragraph 11 to insert a new subparagraph (8) as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) Notwithstanding section 5 (2), where an amount of capital gains tax is assessed and charged pursuant to this paragraph, such amount shall be due and payable on the day next after the day on which the assessment is made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have given some consideration to the points raised in regard to difficulty for a purchaser who might be tardy in making payment to the Revenue Commissioners and I think the position might be met by making this small amendment which will provide that the tax will be payable once assessed, in which case the Revenue Commissioners can proceed to the immediate collection of the tax and, by reason of their collecting the tax, the vendor would then, of course, be in a position to recover whatever unpaid balance would be due to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister visualise the assessment being made?  We are dealing with a case where the purchaser withholds the payment he should make to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person is under an obligation to furnish information about any transaction.  Remember, the purchaser alone may not be in possession of all the information necessary to make an assessment.  The vendor will also have a contribution to make in relation to information, particularly as to the price he originally paid and so forth.  Once the information is available to the inspector the inspector will make the assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But, if the purchaser makes no return and does not give either information or money to the Revenue Commissioners, the Revenue Commissioners would presumably not then be in a position to make the assessment visualised in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="886" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course they will. The vendor would have the information necessary to allow the assessment to be made and the vendor, being an interested party, would provide the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this the position the Minister visualises? The sale is closed and the purchaser deducts in accordance with sub-paragraph (2) the appropriate amount which, in almost every case, will exceed the amount of tax for which the vendor is liable; then the purchaser fails to make a return to the Revenue Commissioners and the vendor, in seeking his money, applies to the Revenue Commissioners for it and is told they have no account of it.  The vendor then furnishes the Revenue Commissioners with such information as to enable them to make an assessment and, if they make that assessment, under this amendment to amendment No.39 the amount of the capital gains tax presumably the amount of the deduction under sub-paragraph (2) is what is intended by &ldquo;an amount of capital gains tax assessed pursuant to this paragraph&rdquo;, is that the intention or would it be the actual tax payable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the actual tax we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us pursue that for a moment.  If the vendor furnishes the relevant information the Revenue Commissioners will make an assessment and the following day the tax would be due and payable.  That is the intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right in a sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This then depends on the vendor furnishing the information to the Revenue Commissioners and the assessment they would make would be only in respect of the actual tax payable by the vendor and not in respect of the amount of the deduction made.  That is as I understand the position.  To illustrate this: if we take it the amount of the deduction was £30,000 and the amount of the actual tax was £15,000 it would seem to me that what would happen then would be <Col N="887" /> that on the day following the assessment the Revenue Commissioners would proceed to try to collect £15,000 from the purchaser but there would be another £15,000 due to the vendor.  The vendor's position would appear to be that he could not sue the Revenue Commissioners for it. That is clear.  He would not have any legal right to do so and they would not have the money.  Secondly, under subparagraph (2) he could not sue the purchaser because &ldquo;the person making the deduction shall be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that sum had been actually paid&rdquo;.  It seems to me that the vendor would in this way be deprived of any legal right to recover that £15,000 from the purchaser or from the Revenue Commissioners and that can hardly be a satisfactory position or, indeed, one to which we could subscribe. I am sure it is not what the Minister intended, but that appears to be the position arising.  I know the Minister's amendment is intended to go in the right direction but, apart from the difficulty I have already pointed out, there may be another difficulty.  It is this.  The money may be due and payable the day after the assessment but it does not follow that it will be recovered on the day after assessment.  As the Minister well knows, a very long time might elapse before it was actually recovered by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During all that interval until it is so recovered by the Revenue Commissioners, the amount of the actual tax would be outstanding as far as the vendor is concerned.  He would be out of his money and he would have no right to recover interest on it from the Revenue Commissioners or from the purchaser.  Even if, up to the date of closing of the sale, he had a right of recovery of interest on the outstanding purchase money from the purchaser, I think that right would disappear on the closing of the sale, having regard to the wording of subparagraph (2).  The vendor's position seems to me to be thoroughly unprotected.  Whereas at best he only has a legal right to recover the amount <Col N="888" /> of the tax, he may be out of that money for a very considerable time. He has no right to interest on it, and he has no legal right whatever to recover the difference between the amount of the deduction and the amount of the tax, which could be very substantial.  While the Minister's additional amendment is intended to improve the position, I do not think it really gets us very far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has graciously acknowledged that it moves in the right direction, but we come back to what I said originally. There are many ways and means in which both parties can protect themselves through the ordinary processes of checking on certificates, on receipts, ensuring delivery to the Revenue Commissioners.  One could also possibly visualise placing money on joint deposit.  There are several ways in which, no doubt, prudent people will ensure that the obligations of the Act are met.  If I tried to provide only one watertight way in which to do this, it would probably cause more inconvenience than by leaving it to the ingenuity of people to ensure that the obligations of the Act are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley </NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that he is looking at the wrong part of the transaction when he is thinking in terms of laying down the procedure that must be followed on the closing of the sale.  I would agree with him that the more flexible that can be left the better. I do not think that that is where the problem arises.  The problem arises because the Revenue Commissioners are placing a statutory obligation, under this amendment on the green sheet, on the purchaser to deduct a sum of money.  It is with what happens to that money and where it goes, and what happens to the vendor's position when that happens, that we should concern ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While they would not be a total answer to the problem, I could make two suggestions to the Minister that would improve the position considerably. The first one is that the amount of tax to be assessed and charged in pursuance of the new subparagraph <Col N="889" /> (8) should be an amount equivalent to the deduction, not the actual tax. In other words, the Revenue Commissioners should accept the responsibility of recovering the amount of the deduction, since the provision here is placing a statutory obligation on the purchaser to make such a deduction. If that were done, one could at least hope that eventually the Revenue Commissioners would recover the amount of the deduction, take from that the amount of tax due to them, and refund to the vendor the amount due to him.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion is that, having regard to what is being done and why it is being done, the Revenue Commissioners should accept the responsibility from the date the deduction is made in accordance with the statutory requirement until the date of payment to the vendor of whatever money is due to him by the Revenue Commissioners, and pay him interest on the money due to him.  That is not a total answer to the problem but at least it is going in the right direction and showing some regard for somebody who is being put in a position in which we are depriving him of any legal right to recover money lawfully due to him.  I do not think it is the total answer at all but at least it is giving him some protection and recognising the fact that, if he is out of his money because of the provisions of the statute, the Revenue Commissioners doing this in order to recover the tax due, accept responsibility for the consequences and pay him interest on the money due to him.  It is the least that can be done if he is to be deprived of the legal right to recover that money from anybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out that under subparagraph (3) the amount of tax to be charged on the purchaser will be an amount equal to tax on one half the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought originally when I saw this amendment. I asked the Minister whether it was the actual tax or the amount of the deduction, and he said the actual tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> One half of what payment? <Col N="890" /> When do you assess it?  Before you assess the tax, is it?  One half of the tax?  How would the Revenue Commissioners know that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the information given about the consideration on the transaction.  If the purchaser fails to give the information, the information will nevertheless come to the Revenue Commissioners when the document relating to the transaction is presented for stamping.  Even apart from what purchasers may or may not give, or vendors may or may not give, the Revenue Commissioners will still have available to them other sources of information from the documents which have to come to their notice in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister sure of that?  It says: &ldquo;...assess and charge that person to capital gains tax for the year of assessment in which payment was made on an amount equal to ...&rdquo; That is capital gains tax on an amount equal to one half of the payment. I agree on the face of it that appears to be the amount of the deduction. That is the intention, is it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Personally I do not agree at all with the principle to hold the purchaser responsible for another man's capital gains tax.  I can see the Minister's point but fundamentally I believe it is wrong to place any such obligation on the purchaser.  It should be the duty of the State to design a Bill whereby the vendor would pay the capital gains tax.  I know that this section applies to a particular section of the community but even so, as Deputy Colley has been explaining, I doubt very much that a statutory regulation should be made whereby an obligation would be transferred to the purchaser to deduct a certain sum of money from the vendor.  A man who sells his property may not be liable to this amount of capital gains tax at all when all the assessments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not always be possible for the vendor to be in a financial position to pay the capital gains tax and get his certificates before transferring his property and getting the total amount of money from the purchaser.  We know what takes place in a property purchase.  The party goes to the solicitor's office on the final day and the transfer of money takes place then and the legal documents are signed.  It is not always possible for the vendor to place his hands on a sufficient amount of money to get the certificate in time for the final transfer of the property. It should be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to devise some scheme whereby the purchaser would be exonerated.  He is not liable to capital gains tax on this transaction at all.  We are legislating here to catch the vendor in respect of the capital gain.  I am not sure that it is right to transfer the statutory obligation and make it obligatory for the purchaser to go through this formality.  Many people, if they thought they had to go through this formality, may not bother at all with it.  The purchaser is placed in the very invidious situation of having to <Col N="893" /> say to the vendor: &ldquo;I am compelled to deduct so much from you and forward it to the Revenue Commissioners.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, where capital gains are concerned, should say to the vendor: &ldquo;That property is not transferred,&rdquo; by some means or device. Whether by stamp duty&mdash;or some other means&mdash;I do not know how you do it.  They should be in a position under this Bill to say to the vendor: &ldquo;There is no legal transfer of that property until such time as we assess it and give you a certificate.  It cannot be transferred.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not sure that some system could not be devised whereby he would have got his money in some way; the purchaser would definitely be in a position to hold the contract.  There should be some gap whereby the vendor would be placed in the position to pass to the Revenue Commissioners the amount of capital gains tax due. That is not the case in this Bill.  Here we are placing an obligation on the purchaser to say to him that he, the purchaser, has an obligation to deduct a certain sum from the total amount. I realise it is all in relation to the assessments.  Even so, I do not like the principle.  I am not going into the finer points of it.  I do not like the principle of placing an obligation on a purchaser. If he goes to any auction, he is quite innocent of this transaction.  He wants no part in it.  He has his own capital gains tax to deal with on his property if he sells it.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that it is a good Bill that places this obligation on a man who goes into an auction completely <i>bona fide</i>.  He finds himself at the conclusion of the sale in this situation. Who will point it out to him?  I do not know or at what stage or how he will know that the vendor has a liability to capital gains.  There are many auctions where nobody has any idea as to who owns the property.  If I go into an auction in the morning in Dublin, I do not know if it is owned by a national or not.  If it is, well and good, it is protected here by the amendments.  I am not sure whether I would be in a position to know whether the property is owned <Col N="894" /> by a foreigner or not.  I do not want any dealings with this type of thing if it is owned by a foreigner.  I do not want to go through this type of procedure as regards deducting so much money and forwarding it to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is where I disagree with this section, that the Revenue Commissioners should have designed it in such a way to go after the man who owns the money, in this case the vendor.</P>
    <P>Now we have a situation that even when money is deducted and forwarded by the purchaser he may, after a long drawn-out dispute, not be liable to pay that amount at all. The Minister is making no effort to compensate him as regards paying interest on his money which they could hold for a considerable length of time.  I do not know why the Minister omitted from this Bill any reference to interest on over-payments and various other matters.  In other sections of income tax&mdash;of PAYE and various other matters&mdash;interest is payable.  The Bill is cumbersome. It will certainly present many difficulties both to the legal profession and people purchasing property.  I would have much preferred if the Revenue Commissioners could have designed provisions whereby the obligation would be placed where it should be&mdash; on the vendor without bringing in another group, the purchaser&mdash;and placing the statutory obligation on him to forward this money to the Revenue Commissioners.  He should not be brought into this Bill.  He is not benefiting by the sale, good, bad or indifferent, as regards capital gains.  He is purchasing on market value.</P>

      <P>With respect, I think Deputy Fitzpatrick misunderstands the position.  The purpose of my amendment is to come to the relief of the purchaser who is no longer under an obligation to ascertain the residence position of the vendor.  The vendor will be under an obligation either to pay his tax in advance of the sale or suffer this deduction which will be made by the purchaser and transferred by the purchaser to the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="895" /> A vendor who would want to avoid the delay and inconvenience of that has the option either of paying his tax prior to the closure of the sale&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It has been done and still can be done by any people who have to pay death duties before administration of estates.  They pay tax before they are in a position to pay it by reason of having access to the funds of the deceased person.  To pay income tax in advance is not an unusual or unknown thing, but Deputy Fitzpatrick is right in thinking that a purchaser ought to get what one might call a clean title, to know that from the moment he goes into possession he is not carrying any liability of the vendor.  This amendment to the Bill gives the purchaser that entitlement and allows it to happen without the sale being held up.</P>

      <P>All he has to do is to provide the purchase money, let 74 per cent of it go to the vendor and 26 per cent of it go to the Revenue Commissioners.  The vendor can collect it from the Revenue Commissioners later.  It is wrong to contemplate only circumstances in which you would have fees or the amount of tax deducted which would be greater than the liability of the vendor.  It is not possible to say whether there would be more or less tax paid by the vendor, but it can be said with confidence that there will be cases where the amount deducted will be less than the liability of the vendor.  It will all depend upon the percentage of gain in the transaction.  If the percentage of gain is considerable, then charging capital gains tax on only half of the consideration might mean the sum of money is much less than the tax which is liable to be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that we can provide and have <Col N="896" /> provided is a reasonable assurance that in respect of non-resident vendors the Revenue Commissioners will get a sizable amount of the tax which will be paid by the vendor.  We have gone a long way to meet the points that have been raised, and I appreciate the points.  We have been able to improve the section, but I cannot see if it is, at this stage, possible to alter this in any further way which would not, I think, operate to the disadvantage of both vendor and purchaser, as Deputy Colley said.  There are great advantages in having a flexible system rather than to put everybody in a strait-jacket which is bound to cause inconvenience to some.  As long as we leave it flexible one can feel fairly confident that the ingenuity of the parties and their advisers will work out some arrangement whereby neither party will be put in peril by the operation of the paragraph.</P>
    <P>I am sorry, I seem to have taken the wrong percentages.  I overlooked that the 87 per cent of the consideration goes to the vendor and 13 per cent, <i>pro tem,</i> to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The best I can say about this amendment is that it is considerably better than what it amends, but it is very far from satisfactory nonetheless.  Paragraph 11, which is on page 74 of the Bill as amended on Committee was itself a fairly major amendment of the corresponding provisions that were in the Bill as originally introduced.  This amendment in the Minister's name to which yet another amendment, or subamendment has been circulated, is the third attempt to get this matter right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose most of use here have someone who has some experience of what their difficulties will be in practice in trying to cope with the situation which is created by the provisions of paragraph 11.  The delays for which solicitors have been blamed up to now will be greater and both longer and more frequent than they have been up to now.  This, even in its amended form, is a most unusual and most onerous provision.  The <Col N="897" /> Minister speaks about the deduction by the purchaser of 13 per cent of the purchase money under circumstances which mean that the vendor has no further rights to that money.</P>
    <P>When that situation arises, as I see it, a vendor will refuse to close a sale, and not unreasonably.  He would be better off to agree with the purchaser to break a bargain and go away and try to make another bargain subsequently.  He is put in a position that he is liable to be out of 13 per cent of his money, and for a lengthy period, and if the purchaser, who is compelled by statute to deduct the money, decides to do away with it there is nothing the vendor can do about it.  While one could see the vendor would still, presumably, be liable to the Revenue Commissioners if they failed to recover it from the purchaser, this is grossly unfair.  It is a situation in which a practical solicitor advising a vendor in this situation would have to tell him that more often than not, if he is able to get a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners before the closing of the sale, probably for his own selfprotection he would be better off not to close it.</P>
    <P>This will create a difficulty that people have not foreseen and could not reasonably expect.  For Friday and Saturday of this week, the Law Society have organised a seminar in either Dublin or Cork, having one in Dublin and one in Cork the following week, for the purpose of explaining the conveyancing consequences of the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  They may be aware of what was in the original Bill or perhaps even in the Bill as amended in Committee, but they certainly are not aware of what is being discussed here now and they are unlikely to get a final copy of the Bill between now and Friday morning at 9 a.m. when the seminar begins.</P>
    <P>The difficulties that will be created for solicitors, who are only a minor part of it but whose number of clients will be enormous, will be that there are many transactions that could otherwise be completed which I am afraid will not be completed.  While I acknowledge what was said from this <Col N="898" /> side of the House by Deputy Colley and others on the last two Stages of this Bill in relation to this particular provision has resulted in a considerable improvement in what was there, it is still extremely messy, to say the least of it, and to my mind it will give rise to a huge number of problems of which the ordinary public are not aware at all.  The majority of people do not believe that, perhaps, the gains tax applies in this way to sales or gifts as is proposed here and, certainly, if they were aware of the provisions of this paragraph 11 which makes it obligatory on the purchaser to deduct 13 per cent of purchase money and hold it, many vendors who are not in a position to obtain that certificate which is referred to in subparagraph (6) will just not be willing to go on with the transaction.  Contracts&mdash;and most contracts now are standard contracts drawn up by the Incorporated Law Society&mdash;will have to be considerably amended to meet this point.  It will be very interesting to see whether or not the normal provision will be that the vendor, if he is stuck in this position, will be entitled to rescind.  I think he will be because the contract is normally drawn by the vendor and from his point of view. Therefore, I would see that the standard form of contract will be one to the effect that if the vendor is unable, within a reasonable period, to get a certificate under subparagraph (6) of paragraph 11 that he will have the right to rescind and return the purchaser his deposit.  Otherwise the vendor is put in an impossible position because he may have to close the sale on payment of 87 per cent of the purchase money to him, and will have no guarantee that he will ever get any more whether he is liable for capital gains tax or not.  Thirteen per cent of the purchase money is equivalent to the tax on a gain which is equal to half the consideration.  In practice, is the taxable gain going to be equal to half the consideration very often? Unless the inflation we have seen in the last two years is to continue&mdash;the signs are that it will&mdash;it would only be in a very rare case that the chargeable gain in any transaction would be equal <Col N="899" /> to half the consideration.  That is the amount that paragraph 11 is compelling the purchaser to withhold.</P>
    <P>I would feel happier about this if the compulsion on the part of the purchaser was not simply just to withhold 13 per cent of the purchase money from the vendor but if it was to pay 87 per cent of the purchase money to the vendor and to pay the other 13 per cent to the Revenue Commissioners, and to give a right of recovery to the vendor against the Revenue Commissioners on the expiration of a period of, say, two months, the Revenue Commissioners paying interest at the going rate for the Revenue Commissioners of 18 per cent per annum on whatever part of the 13 per cent that was paid to them was found not to be capital gains tax properly chargeable.</P>
    <P>Since I think this amendment we have here has been recommitted to a committee of the House, as opposed to being reported to the whole House, I should like to ask the Minister if there can be&mdash;I do not know if there can be&mdash;a Report Stage in respect of this recommitted amendment, if he would consider that.  It is not making the Revenue any worse off.  In fact, it is making the Revenue a good deal better off.  They are getting the money straight in.  I object to the principle of that anyway, but if we have to live with that principle what I object to is that some potentially chancy purchaser may hold on to 13 per cent of the purchase money in a transaction which he may never pay either to the vendor or to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>If that happens there is nothing, as Deputy Colley has pointed out, that a vendor can do about it, because at the end of page 5 of the green sheets, the end of subparagraph (2) says:</P>
    <P>shall allow such deduction upon receipt of the residue of the payment and the person making the deduction, shall be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that sum had been actually paid.</P>
    <P>I would say to the Minister, are not those words too sweeping, and do they <Col N="900" /> not exonerate a purchaser who is given this privileged position of holding on to 13 per cent of the purchase money even though he is closing the sale?  They appear to have the effect, so far as one can judge, of completely letting him off the hook, certainly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the vendor.  I am not clear from this amendment whether the proposal is that if a purchaser in those circumstances did not pay up&mdash; there will probably be cases of this&mdash; the vendor is still liable.  Will the Revenue go after him?  If the purchaser absconds with the 13 per cent is capital gains tax in these circumstances going to be a charge on the property? There are a number of alternative ways of approaching the problem.  I am not convinced that the way the Minister is approaching it now is the best way although I should like to say, in fairness, that as a result of all that was said on the last Stage, this new proposal is a great improvement on what was there before.  Nonetheless, from what Deputy Colley, Deputy Fitzpatrick and I have said, it is very unsatisfactory.  It is likely to give rise to a tremendous number of problems.</P>
    <P>If it were found, for example, that out of the 13 per cent withheld by the purchaser the total capital gains tax properly payable amounts to only 1 per cent of the purchase money and even if that is paid over and there is a long interval when the vendor is trying to get back his other 12 per cent, and even if he gets it after, say a year or two, how does he stand with regard to interest? I can see no provision here with regard to interest. There is no provision here to compensate him in any way or to compel the purchaser to compensate him.  He is put in a very awkward position.</P>
    <P>If this is passed in this form major changes will have to be made in the standard conditions of sale, one of them being the reserving of a right by the vendor to rescind the contract if within, say, three or four weeks of signing the contract he has been unable to get a certificate from the Revenue or from the Inspector of Taxes under subparagraph (6) of this paragraph.  If that is so a lot of sales which would not otherwise fall through <Col N="901" /> will fall through, and it is is not in anyone's interest that they should.  The sale might suit both the vendor and the purchaser, but they are being put in the position that there is nothing they can do.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has plenty of experience of trying to get certificates of discharge from death duties, for example, from the Revenue Commissioners. When he was on this side of the House, he frequently put down Parliamentary Questions about the delays.  The certificate referred to in subparagraph (6) is not dissimilar.  If there are going to be delays in the obtaining of those certificates, which I suppose one could reasonably expect there will be, the length of time it currently takes to close a sale is going to be increased, perhaps significantly in some cases.  The Minister must be aware of the frequent complaints there are nowadays&mdash;I suppose there always have been&mdash;about delays in legal transactions. Here is yet another enormous complication that is put on the parties to a sale and their solicitors.  One had hoped that as a result of all this new taxation things were going to be simplified. In fact, one finds the very opposite is the case.  If the general public realised the effect of an amendment like this basically being to create difficulties and delays where they do not already exist, they would not be pleased about it.  As I already said, the only good thing I can see about this is that&mdash;as bad as it is&mdash;it is a great deal better than what it replaces.</P>
    <P>My final appeal to the Minister would be that whether he does it now or does it on whatever form of Report Stage there is in respect of a recommitted amendment that he would consider at least doing this for the protection of vendors ensuring that the 13 per cent which is not paid over to the vendor shall be paid to the Revenue Commissioners and that they shall make up their minds within four or six weeks or whatever the case is, deduct the tax and refund the balance immediately to the vendor, paying him interest on whatever balance there is for him at the going rate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has touched on one that might get closer to the reality of the situation but I <Col N="903" /> do not think that the amendment covers it, that is where the purchaser would say on the day of closing the sale: &ldquo;pay over the 13 per cent to the Revenue Commissioners and get a receipt.&rdquo;  The certificate referred to in paragraph (6) would not apply to that as it stands.  All he would get is a receipt for a particular amount of money.  It may be that the provision in this, which would envisage the purchaser doing just that and getting a certificate specifically relating to this transaction, would cover to some extent the difficulty that we see.  I do not think the certificate under section 6 fits into this.</P>

      <P>The certificate under subparagraph (6) which is produced by the vendor is given where the vendor is ordinarily resident in the State; in which case the purchaser does not make a deduction.

      <P>No.  If the purchaser is discharging his obligation, if he has paid it, the vendor is then satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners have the money.  You are overcoming the fear expressed by Deputy Colley earlier of dealing with a purchaser who having made a deduction is not going to hand it over to the Revenue Commissioners.  If the vendor has evidence that the Revenue Commissioners are already in possession of the money he has not to worry about the purchaser in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  I think that is getting much closer to the reality of <Col N="904" /> the situation now.  I am suggesting to the Minister that it might be necessary or at the very least advisable that there should be a subparagraph here which would specifically cover the situation in which the purchaser pays over to the Revenue Commissioners the 13 per cent and gets in return not merely a receipt for the amount of money but a certificate from the Revenue Commissioners that would incorporate a receipt, of course, but that at least would set out that it purported to be 13 per cent of the purchase money on a particular transaction. I am just troubled about the possibility where the purchaser might be paying the Revenue Commissioners money on account of something else and the mere production of a receipt for that amount would not be conclusive as far as the vendor is concerned.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which are matters for administration by the Revenue Commissioners and not matters for a Bill as to what form a receipt should take.  It is a matter for the parties themselves in any particular transaction to satisfy themselves that the obligations to the law are complied with or will be complied with.  Once they are assured that they have been or will be complied with then they can complete their transaction with peace of mind.  Doubtless the Revenue Commissioners will be in consultation with the relevant professional bodies to ensure the smooth operation of the Act and of all workings under it.  It seems to me that what we are discussing here are matters of detail.  I would anticipate that a receipt in respect of a payment, such as we are talking about here, would identify the purpose for which the payment is made.  It might not just be a receipt for the sum of £X from Mr. Y but could designate the purpose for which the payment was made and for which it was received. This is a matter of getting the most <Col N="905" /> appropriate form of receipt for issuing in cases of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be more satisfactory, both from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners and of the vendor, that there should actually be a statutory obligation on the purchaser to pay the 13 per cent to the Revenue Commissioners and that, if possible, it should be so arranged that it would be paid at or before the time of the closing of the sale.  I am most concerned about the provision in subparagraph (2) which gives a total acquittal and discharge to the purchaser in respect of the deduction made and thereby deprives the vendor of the legal right to recover the money even though it might not have been paid over to the Revenue Commissioners.  I think that is a situation that we should try to avoid.  I am suggesting that something on the lines of what the Minister was describing if incorporated in this would obviate it.  At least it would provide the machinery whereby the vendor could insist that the money had actually been paid to the Revenue Commissioners before it was.  That would be satisfactory from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners. They would get their money faster instead of having to wait for an account to be submitted and so on. It would actually give a vested interest to the party to think the money was paid to the Revenue Commissioners rapidly.  It would also ensure that the vendor had a foolproof statutory way of getting his money without being in the position I have described of finding the money was not paid to the Revenue Commissioners and that he was without any legal right of recovery against the purchaser or the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Indeed, it might have to be done out of money which might be advanced on foot of a mortgage of the property and, therefore, it might have to be done simultaneously.  Part of the money might have to be in the form of a bankers' order, in favour of the Revenue Commissioners. I sincerely believe that it is better to leave it in the way in which we now have it and to allow people to provide their own arrangements to ensure that the obligations of the Act are fulfilled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. First of all, if you are imposing this obligation on the purchaser&mdash;and I accept there is an obligation on the purchaser; it is an obligation he will exercise in his own interests&mdash;it is not a very onerous one anyway, no worse than the obligation that appears to lie on payers of ground rents to pay the Schedule A tax, which was the landlord's tax. This would happen only on rare occasions on which a person was making a capital purchase.  If we impose that obligation, it is important that the purchaser gets it discharged.  Once the transaction is complete the purchaser should not be under any further obligation in relation to the vendor's tax. We would not have half this trouble if we made the property subject to capital gains tax if it were outstanding but we have deliberately sheered off that and I think rightly so.  We do not want to impose that cumbersome lien on properties, or the difficulties of doing so would certainly generate. We, therefore, must give an acquittal to the person who makes the deduction.</P>

There could be some cases under this section which might not have solicitors involved at all but even where there are solicitors involved it can go wrong.  What worries me is that where it does go wrong, under this provision, we are putting a vendor in a position where we have deprived him of his legal right to recover the money.  If the Minister thinks about this for a moment&mdash; admittedly, it is when things go wrong this happens&mdash;but if it happens that it does go wrong and the vendor finds himself having 13 per cent of the purchase money deducted, not paid to the Revenue Commissioners, perhaps dissipated or taken abroad or something like that, and he has no legal right of recovery because of the Statute which we are passing here, I do not think that is a satisfactory position.

That applies to income tax and to death duties.  They get no interest on it, even though if they owe the Revenue Commissioners anything, as the Minister well knows under his recent dispensations, they will pay 18 per cent interest to the Revenue Commissioners.  Would the Minister consider a provision whereby if repayment to the vendor was not made within four weeks, interest would then run at 18 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>With due deference to the Minister and to the Revenue Commissioners, I want to tell him that in all good faith when I was in his position I gave an assurance to this House that special arrangements were being made&mdash;and they were made&mdash;for the refund of tax within&mdash;I forget the precise time, but I announced it in the House in connection with the legislation which I introduced aimed at lumping and which provided for large scale deductions and then the assessment of tax by the Revenue Commissioners and the refund of the difference.  I have recently come across at least one case and earlier I came across others, where that time limit was far exceeded.  The undertaking was given in good faith by me and the Revenue Commissioners advised me of it in good faith.  I accept that fully and I accept that the Minister is acting in good faith when he says what he has just said but practical experience shows us that this cannot be relied on ultimately.  As pressures of one sort or another build up as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, they cannot ensure that <Col N="910" /> repayments will be made speedily or within a particular time.</P>
      <P>Here we are dealing with a case where the money belonging to the vendor is compulsorily deducted and paid over.  The vendor must wait then until the Revenue Commissioners have assessed the tax due and then they make a refund.  In almost every case there will be a refund due to the vendor.  It is difficult to visualise a case in which there would not be a repayment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, to have a gain of that kind arising in most cases will require a continuation of inflation at the rate it is going at present.</P>
      <P>Where there is a refund due and where it arises because the money was compulsorily deducted and paid to the Revenue Commissioners, is it not reasonable to provide that there should be a time limit within which it should be refunded and that in the absence of such a time limit being complied with at that stage interest should be payable? In principle, interest should be payable on it anyway but I would be at least partially mollified in my concern if there was a reasonable time limit laid down and thereafter, if it were not complied with by the Revenue Commissioners, interest would be paid. Surely, the Minister cannot regard that as an unreasonable argument?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister in support of what Deputy Colley says that in fact the amount that will be deducted in each case will be the tax that would be payable where the chargeable capital gain is equal to 100 per cent.  In other words, 13 per cent of the consideration equals the tax on a chargeable gain that arises when something is sold for double what it cost and the whole gain is chargeable.  Twenty-six per cent of the consideration is equal to 13 per cent <Col N="911" /> of half of it.  In other words, it is equal to the tax on the whole lot.  It is not just the gain alone; it is the chargeable gain, which could be a very different matter.  Therefore, it must at least be 100 per cent.  Unless inflation becomes worse&mdash;I said earlier it would have to remain at its present level&mdash; the number of times when that part of a chargeable gain will arise will be very few.  I am not talking about a case where a man bought something for £1,000 in 1940 and is selling it for £10,000 now because the chargeable gain in that case is not £9,000.  I am talking about a case where the chargeable gain is such that it is a 100 per cent gain on the base figure.  Then the amount which the Minister is proposing under this section to compel the purchaser to deduct and now, happily, to pay over to the Revenue Commissioners, will surely&mdash;95 times out of 100&mdash;not just be more than the chargeable tax but will be substantially more in most cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, for example, should bear in mind a point which he may not have adverted to in relation to this matter, that subparagraph (6) refers to the capital gains tax chargeable for the year of assessment for which he is chargeable and the tax chargeable on any gain accruing in any earlier years. That takes into account chargeable losses or allowable losses on other capital transactions which the vendor may have had in that particular year. For example, the vendor might sell two properties, on one of which he is making a good capital gain but on the other he is making a capital loss.  The property which he sells subject to a capital loss is allowable against the gain, even though there might be a reasonable capital gain on the property sold at a gain there might be no tax chargeable.  You still have a situation that 13 per cent of the purchase money is withheld.  We have made this much progress, that it is now being withheld by the Revenue Commissioners and not by the purchaser where, from the vendor's point of view the money was at some risk.  Nonetheless, it can be effectually withheld by the Revenue Commissioners and there is no provision for repayment within a <Col N="912" /> reasonable time.  It could take, as we know too well, a very long time.  Even when the Revenue Commissioners repay, there is no provision for repayment with interest.  The amount involved could be a very large one and affect a man's whole business.  He might want the money for reinvestment but it is not available to him.  If he goes to a bank and borrows it on a short-term basis he may pay 18 or 19 per cent interest, if he is able to get it.  The Minister's proposals suffer very seriously from this defect as well as all the other defects we pointed out. They fail to take into account the overall liability in the year of assessment of the vendor for capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>If he has accrued to him a series of losses in that year and if, for example, he sold a lot of shares within the past 12 months at a very heavy capital loss, as most people who sold shares would have incurred&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He might gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some gains in the case of those who were lucky enough to buy them a year ago at a lower price but we will leave the details out of the argument. Assume that at some future time there is a slump compared with what we have seen in the past year and that a particular person has to sell a lot of shares at a heavy capital loss. He has accruing to his credit capital losses which may be carried forward and set off either in that year or in some future year against capital gains. Assume that the only capital gain that he made around that period, is a substantial gain on a farm or whatever he sells&mdash;he is clearly not liable for tax because he is carrying forward capital losses.  Why should he have to suffer the deduction of 13 per cent if the Minister says he can apply for a certificate? In those circumstances it is not just the straightforward certificate that he is ordinarily resident in the State.  Surely the Minister knows this and it is not good enough to come in and say that the man will get it straightaway.  The Minister knows the man will have to wait months.  As things stand, it appears that the inspector of taxes, rather <Col N="913" /> than the people in the old death duty office who will deal with these certificates. The Minister knows the extent to which they are snowed under with work.  They are talking about strike action because they are completely overburdened with work, and every time some change is made in legislation it creates an enormous number of difficulties for them.  The Minister must know, irrespective of what he publicly says here, that there are considerable delays because of understaffing of the offices of Inspectors of Taxes throughout the country. They will have all this additional work put on them now and there must be delays in getting these certificates.  The Minister should take account, therefore, of the situation in which a man is faced with the 13 per cent of the purchase money to which he is entitled, which is withheld from him over a lengthy period, and he will get no compensation for that withholding. He might not be liable for any tax at all, but he might not be able to show a purchaser he is not liable because he has accumulated capital losses greater than the capital gain he makes on the particular sale; yet, he is caught for the whole 13 per cent. Could the Minister not try to make the matter more flexible even if it were only to the extent of giving the Revenue Commissioners some discretion about these things?</P>
      <P>I cannot for the life of me see why, if tax in arreas will be charged by the Revenue Commissioners at 18 per cent, in a position like this where they will get in large sums of money over and above the tax that will ultimately be found due, they should add on 18 per cent for the use of it.  If they have it for some time, I would say: &ldquo;Fair enough.  Leave it to them for a couple of weeks and, if they repay it, then forget about the interest.&rdquo; But, if it goes more than a few weeks, there is no reason in justice and equity why they should not pay for it if it is worth that much to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should also consider whether the deduction of 13 per cent of the purchase money referred to here is not, in fact, too great.  As I pointed out earlier, 13 per cent of the <Col N="914" /> purchase money represents the full tax at 26 per cent on a chargeable gain of 100 per cent.  You will not often have a chargeable gain of 100 per cent. Perhaps, if, in five years' time, inflation continues at 25 to 30 per cent, you will be getting it then; but, as of now, the number of chargeable gains of 100 per cent, except in short-term transactions like mining shares and so on which are not covered by this anyway, is negligible.  There is no land worth 100 per cent more today than it was worth on 5th April, 1974, except maybe in some very isolated instance where some special factor arises to increase its value very greatly.  The figure of 13 per cent, because it represents the full tax on a chargeable gain of 100 per cent, is unnecessarily high.  The Revenue would be at no risk if that figure were half or even less than is provided for here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to be snide or patronising.  The Deputy has delivered himself of an argument in which I assumed he believed.  It was to the effect that the tax charged here was in normal cases very small and, because he believed that, he considered it wrong to have a deduction of 13 per cent in respect of the special position that arises where sales have been made by nonresidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> We are not dealing here with the normal run of disposals.  We are not dealing with the majority of sales.  We are dealing only with sales by non-residents where the consideration exceeds £50,000.  Some of Deputy O'Malley's colleagues have accepted that there is a need to protect the Revenue by ensuring that the proceeds of a sale in such cases, or a sufficient proportion thereof as is necessary, remain in the country to ensure that liability to capital gains tax is met. I cannot accept that any lower figure would be reasonable.  We have struck a balance here to ensure that, while there will be no undue loss to the Revenue, at the same time we are not imposing too severe a restriction upon vendors.  As I have said repeatedly, it is open to a vendor who wants to avoid this deduction to secure a certificate beforehand by furnishing appropriate information.  I accept that this may not be possible in all cases if a taxpayer is contemplating acquisition and disposal of other assets.  When, however, you come to consider the number of non-residents who may have several different holdings of property and contemplate actual disposals within a particular year, you find you are dealing with a very limited number of people and I am reasonably content that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to deal fairly expeditiously with such cases.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of cases which will come under paragraph 11 will be cases that will be capable of being dealt with instantly and have appropriate certificates issued instantly.  If a liability to tax arises, if they are residents the matter will not be dealt with under paragraph 11 but rather under section 5.</P>
    <P>I am arranging to have copied an amendment to subparagraph (2) which we were discussing earlier on the lines I have already indicated, but strengthening it for the benefit of the vendor as well as the purchaser.  It will provide that the person making the deduction shall, on proof of payment to the Revenue Commissioners of the amount so deducted, be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that <Col N="916" /> sum had been actually paid to the person making the disposal.  That will adequately cover the position, and I hope Deputy Colley will accept that it will.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Surely a long time can elapse before the refund takes place. I can visualise a sale where the purchaser has to deduct 13 per cent of my money.  I want to purchase another property.  I have to get an overdraft to purchase the property and put down a deposit on which I pay 15 per cent or 18 per cent. according to the Minister, I would be paying 18 per cent.  There are reasonable banks who charge a lower rate than 18 per cent which the Revenue Commissioners would charge me if I owed them income tax.</P>
      <P>It is quite possible that a person can be in a position where he has purchased another property and he requires this money.  It is quite possible he may not be liable at all to the 13 per cent which has been deducted. When the assessments have gone through and the final researches have taken place, there might be no capital gains tax due.  I have purchased another property and I have to borrow money, although the Revenue Commissioners have some money belonging to me.  I have to pay the bank or the financial institution. I will certainly have to pay 15 per cent or 16 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners hold a certain amount of money belonging to me which, in the final analysis, I do not owe them at all.  It is only reasonable in a situation like that that the Revenue Commissioners should pay interest. I do not think that is an unreasonable demand from any vendor on the Revenue Commissioners.  We all <Col N="919" /> know the amount of work the Revenue Commissioners have on hand at the moment.  When they get the three Bills before the House now, the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill, the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill, I can visualise what it will be like in the first few years before they are properly staffed to deal effectively with this type of legislation.  There must be considerable delay.  If there is a refund&mdash;and this will happen in the majority of cases&mdash;it will not amount to 13 per cent capital gains on that figure.  An ordinary business man who purchased another property would have to go to his bank or an institution for money and pay 15 per cent on money that he would not have to raise if he had the money the Revenue Commissioners hold belonging to him.</P>
    <P>That is a straightforward case which can arise.  It is not unreasonable in a situation like that to expect the Revenue Commissioners to pay at least 10 per cent or 12 per cent.  They would have to pay 18 per cent going by their own charges.  It would not be unreasonable to ask them to pay at least what I would be paying for the same lending rates on money which they hold belonging to me.  It is a straightforward demand, any business man would view it in that light.  As Deputy Colley and other speakers have said, in this day and age when money is so costly the Revenue Commissioners should not hold money for 24 hours longer than necessary.  We all know what servicing a loan costs today.  We all know the Minister had to put in 18 per cent here to get his money in as quickly and as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>If I found myself in that situation I would be at the door of the Revenue Commissioners very quickly to get my money back.  The businessman has to be a foreigner but we all think the same about this type of transaction. This can run to maybe £10,000 or £20,000, or £100,000, but in the final analysis I might owe only £10,000. Over a period of two or three months £10,000 or £20,000 held by the Revenue Commissioners can be quite substantial if you have to borrow from another institution and service <Col N="920" /> it at 14 per cent or 15 per cent or, indeed, 18 per cent in some institutions. This is the kind of situation business people will find themselves in if the Minister does not compensate them for money held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera </NameTxt>
      <P>I made a case on the section before this semi-technical debate had arisen about doing the fair and equitable thing.  Taking up the point made, is it fair and equitable that the State should have money belonging to somebody else, even if it is, so to speak, as a security for moneys owing to them, and then having hung on to the money as a precaution not to pay interest on the part that is not due to them? Is this not doing a little bit of the big bully on the part of the State, whether you are resident or non-resident?</P>
      <P>I have listened for more than an hour to the aspects of the debate and have heard the Minister talk about the efficiency which lawyers have, no doubt.  But when all is said and done it is a question of fairness and equity here.  If we are going to do this, let us say publicly what we are going to do. We are going to take money from non-residents as a precaution and, as Deputy O'Malley and others have pointed out, the boomerang may easily reach the residents here.  I understand the Minister's motivation because what the Minister is afraid of is that the money will not be paid at all and that somebody will get scot free and there will be no sanction and, as I pointed out before lunch, it applies where the assets are within the jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I am now raising the point that even if it is a non-resident&mdash;it could be a foreigner, a citizen of another country &mdash;is it equitable to take money in that way and then, if there has been an overpayment, not to repay what is compulsorily withheld with interest? Deputy Fitzpatrick has gone a good deal of the road by suggesting that the interest should be at the going rate, whatever it is, and that is fair enough. At an earlier stage in the debate Deputy Colley, Deputy O'Malley and others suggested that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander and that the 18 per cent should apply in reverse.  That principle was completely rejected by the Minister on the reasonable enough grounds, perhaps, on specific cases anyway, that it would turn the whole thing around, that it would be a way of raising money.  The Minister's own reverse arguments might be worth reexamining now in light of this case. Here, to try to make a specific case, you are going to have 50 per cent of the consideration taxable and the capital gains in the last analysis may be a lot less.  Is it asking too much, therefore, either to provide what Deputy Fitzpatrick says, a refund with a reasonable rate of interest, or a reasonable assessment that would enable a more realistic sum to be withheld? After all, we have another Bill in which there was not a death duties code, there were provisional assessments and so on.  That is the way I would put the matter to the Minister in the last analysis.  Is it fair to a noncitizen? Is it not going just a little bit far with administrative convenience? When all is said and done, is there so much involved for the State that the State cannot share the rest with the other parties by going some of the road as has been suggested by various Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House generally accepts that the reason why the Exchequer charges interest on arrears of tax is not to collect a profit but to discourage people from withholding tax.  The State would much prefer the payment of tax promptly than to have to collect interest on anything at all.  It would be <Col N="922" /> a great day for Ireland if no interest was collected, because it would mean that all tax would be promptly paid. In respect of the arguments we are now having, and I am not making a strong point of this, I emphasise that we are going dangerously near to discussing an amendment which was ruled out of order because it could involve a charge.  In case this argument goes too far I will rely upon that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make the comment in passing that if the absence of the opportunity to gain interest on over-paid tax acts as an encouragement to people to furnish the information which is necessary to allow the Revenue Commissioners to make a proper assessment and charge, then it is working in precisely the same way as the imposition of interest on arrears of income tax is intended to operate and that is to encourage people to discharge their obligations and requiring the potential taxpayer to furnish the information necessary to allow the proper assessment to be made, and if a refund is due the refund will be made. Therefore, it is better in the interest of the taxpayer at a certain stage not to provide in this case what the Deputies are seeking because that will operate, or could operate, to let people leave in abeyance the furnishing of the correct information to enable the assessment to be accurately made.</P>

If they have not done it by that time, it would be a reasonable time thereafter, but I cannot visualise there would be any delay where people furnish the necessary information.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite right when he refers to tax due, barring, of course, the rate of interest he is imposing on tax that is due.  If that is the argument he is putting on the other side, it can be turned slightly the other way.  It might be, if interest were to be due by the Commissioners to the vendor, that if such a tax to be refunded were at such a high rate as 18 per cent, the vendor might be quite happy to leave it there for a while.  The rate being charged on arrears is a bit punitive.  In those circumstances, could the Minister not compromise to some degree and agree that where a vendor has applied for a refund of tax, the Minister could set a time limit of, say, two weeks or a month after which interest would be chargeable on the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been deeply concerned about this aspect of the Bill.  Deputy Colley mentioned sauce for the goose.  An 18 per cent interest rate might be a little encouragement but the fact that they are going to get no interest is not right.  Everybody knows the high cost of borrowing money at the present moment.  It does not seem fair.  Many people have been looking at this Bill and I have been approached by people who told me that the Revenue Commissioners should pay some interest anyway, perhaps not an 18 per cent rate of interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person has money paid over and above what is due to the Revenue <Col N="924" /> Commissioners the Revenue Commissioners may be a bit slow in sending it back.  If they had to pay interest on it, as Deputy Brugha said, the assessment would be done quickly and the money would be sent back quickly and it would appear fairer to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera </NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister I am very proud to be a former Auditor.  The point is that this debate has more serious consequences than the debates we had in that place.  The Minister made a point about charging. I demur when he says it only applies to non-residents because the circumstance can arise when it can apply to a resident and the circumstance can arise where a certificate is not immediately available.  I do not want to appear to disagree with my friend Deputy Callanan or any other Deputy but I believe that the Revenue Commissioners delay only for two reasons. One is that they have not the information, that they are not in a position <Col N="925" /> to discharge and that they cannot finalise something.  The other is that they can become so over-burdened with work, and I fear this has happened, that they cannot reach it.  If we can overcome the latter I am still prepared to give the complete discretion and if the Minister&mdash;and I took his point&mdash;says that the suggestion about interest is a charge that is all right.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister then consider instead&mdash;I am not abandoning either my colleagues or my point but I do think, within the rules of order, if the Minister wishes to be technical he may plead that case&mdash;within the terms of subparagraph (4) introduce a discretion here, subparagraph (4) really deals with a case where there is a failure of a certain sort.  While giving the inspector the power to meet the appropriate case would the Minister not also consider introducing a discretionary power so that where it is quite clear that the vendor was in an equitable position the inspector could exercise a discretion in his favour by issuing a certificate or in some other way, preventing the deduction? I am back to my point about giving the inspector enough time.  Could a complementary power of relief not be included and the necessary discretion to exercise it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all visualising a doomsday situation.  You would think that the machine had collapsed or there was reason to believe it would collapse.  The number of transactions involved here is going to be comparatively few.  It must be a consideration of over £50,000.  That is the first requirement before this comes into operation at all.  Then when that is in operation the vast majority will be able to obtain, on application, certificates as ordinarily resident.  The number of cases where actual assessment will have to be made will be very few. Inspectors of taxes will be instructed to give priority to cases of this kind. There could be significant sums involved <Col N="926" /> here and it could be inequitable that there should be any delay in making these assessments.  I do not tolerate any delay or say that any delay is sufferable but there could be very substantial sums involved here, sums which as often as not are reinvested in the acquisition of some other property.  It would be unfair to put a taxpayer in the position of having to borrow from some other party because the State was holding on to portion of the proceeds of the disposal of an asset which had been disposed of.  I do not anticipate that these occasions are going to arise.</P>
      <P>I believe the majority of non-residents will dischage their tax before completion of the transaction.  The majority of such persons are not people of limited means.  I do not want to make any sweeping generalisations, but I think I am making a reasonable assessment of the situation when I say that the kind of people it would really concern are non-resident companies disposing of properties.  They are people with the sophistication and means of making the necessary financial arrangements to discharge their tax liability and to obtain 100 per cent of the purchase money on the disposal of an asset.  If any difficulties come to light you can be sure that the Revenue Commissioners will do everything in their power to overcome them and if they require a Ministerial intervention by reason of the need to amend the law, I am certain there will be Members of this House only too anxious to ensure that the law be amended and if necessary that the relief be given retrospectively.</P>

    <P>The very fact the matter has got such wide coverage both in the Press, on television and elsewhere is a clear indication of the seriousness of this motion.  I would like to quote from a leading article in the <i>Anglo-Celt</i> of 4th July.  It states:</P>
    <P>One Fine Gael member of the present Government seems to have learnt the lesson of arrogance well. The Minister for Defence, Mr. Patrick Donegan, TD, recently altered the Defence Force regulations in a manner which permitted him as Minister for Defence to make Army promotions without seeking the approval of the Army Command.</P>
    <P>The selection of officers for promotion was formerly a function reserved for the Chief of Staff, who submitted recommendations for the Minister's approval after consultation with the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General. Under his new regulations Mr. Donegan has made appointments without such consultation.  Whether the individuals involved were worthy of these promotions is beside the point.  The Minister has altered the regulations so as to make challenge to such promotion within the Army tantamount to mutiny.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that:</P>
    <P>Any good Minister for Defence would know that a high morale was the <i>sine qua non</i> of an effective Army.  His first duty, therefore, must be the establishment and maintenance of morale.  Mr. Donegan's altering of the promotion regulations destroys all sense of justice in promotions and robs those promoted of the confidence building knowledge that they have been judged and found worthy by their superior officers.</P>
    <P>This is a clear indication of the type of comment that has percolated through the community and the seriousness with which the matter is being examined and analysed.  I would like to know why the Minister sought to amend the regulations.  I <Col N="929" /> have no desire to reflect on the good name, character or efficiency of any officer promoted in the past or recently by the Minister.  Those who served the nation under arms in difficult times over the years have won the respect of people at home and abroad.  Many of these men have now been victimised by virtue of the fact that the Minister has taken unto himself dictatorial powers in relation to the promotion of officers and the serious security situation that has developed where confidence has been completely undermined by the irresponsible action of the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>This action has generated and will generate long term unrest throughout the forces.  It has affected the morale of the forces.  This is evident in the various comments made in the newspapers and in correspondence received by many Deputies since the Minister took this power on to himself. It has shattered the hopes of career officers who have joined the forces.  These are all-important.  Why is the Minister taking on these dictatorial powers?  It has led to a weakening of the authority of the general staff, an authority that is necessary and desirable among the high ranking officers of the forces.  It is necessary that the confidence of the personnel from the bottom to the top is maintained and they are assured that they have at the top men of knowledge and understanding of their problems, men who will make decisions on their behalf, men who will recommend them for promotion. All that is gone.</P>
    <P>The effect on the morale of officers who joined the Army as a career is now one of great dimension.  I hope that before this debate concludes we may have some indication from the Minister that he is prepared to rectify this grievous wrong which has been done by him in the recent past.  I believe it is necessary to restore the confidence of the general staff in the Minister and in the Government. The Minister alone is not to blame for this.  I am positive a major decision of this nature could not be made without the consent of the <Col N="930" /> Taoiseach and other members of the Government.  Each member of the Government, where there is an area of collective responsibility is equally responsible for this irresponsible act that has been committed by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>The primary matter in relation to promotions is ability.  Everyone agrees that officers must be promoted on the basis of ability.  Nevertheless, all other things being equal, the question of seniority has always been and will always be the deciding factor.  Now we have the decisions that have been made by the Minister and his comments to <i>The Irish Independent</i> and other newspapers on record and we will examine them as this debate proceeds.  I hoped before this debate took place that we would have had a clear indication from the Taoiseach or the Minister for Defence as to the reason for this extraordinary measure. We know now that the career structure has been demolished.  The uncertainty of promotion in the future has caused great dissatisfaction among those who are in line on the basis of seniority and ability and have now been passed over by ministerial order.  Their confidence is gone.  They now await a clear statement from the Minister and the Government on their future, if they have a future, or if the Minister will in future make all the appointments.  How far will the Minister accept in future the word of the Chief of Staff or the word of the general staff, the word of battalion commanders or indeed of other personnel who may report in relation to officers? Will there be a proper assessment in the future or will the Minister make the appointments after horse-trading elsewhere?</P>
    <P>In relation to the appointments that have been made, we would like to know if in fact the Chief of Staff's recommendations were over-ruled. The Minister is on record as indicating in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 29th June, 1975, that it was a personal decision: that there had been consultation with the three most senior officers in regard to recent promotions. He admitted that contrary to their recommendations he promoted <Col N="931" /> two officers to the rank of colonel. He went on to say that these were not the two referred to as being supporters of Fianna Fáil.  The Minister said his reason for promoting them was that they were near retirement age and that he wished to give them two additional years service and increase their pension rights.  Many people have pension rights in the Army.  If we are to disregard the rights of people with efficiency, people with ability and people in line for promotion, we have indeed a fairly serious situation.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister consider the problems of the officers who have been passed over, the injustices which have been done to them? Has he considered the question of the remuneration, in incomes and in pensions, of the officers who have been passed over? These are all matters that need consideration.  It is obvious that the Minister did not give them consideration.  He stated in <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 29th June, 1975, that at least two of the men promoted to the rank of colonel were Fianna Fáil supporters, which is a further indication of the complete irresponsibility of the present Minister, in judging the merits of their promotion on the basis of their politics.  We hope that that day has gone and we look forward to the future when men will be judged on their ability and not on their political past.  The Minister is on record as indicating that this was done in the case of at least two of the promotions. Why would the Minister inquire into the background and the political beliefs of individuals due for promotion? Was there a special reason or was he satisfied that two posts out of a quota were sufficient for supporters of Fianna Fáil?  It is obvious that he has carried out an assessment of the political outlook of officers seeking promotion and that he has, in fact, done a much wider assessment in the entire field of serving Army officers as to their political outlook.  Shame on the Minister that he would judge promotions on that basis. There is another question that the <Col N="932" /> Minister must answer.  We hope that the Minister will indicate to us clearly the procedure and the method by which the recommendations were made.  Did he receive from the Chief of Staff recommendations?  Did he, in turn, make additional recommendations, having reviewed the recommendations of the Chief of Staff and did he indulge in horse-trading in relation to promotions by asking that compromises be accepted? There can be no compromise or horse-trading in relation to the promotion of officers over officers who have been recommended on the basis of ability. Taking into consideration the fact that they have the ability, then the question of seniority must be a factor, but the Minister has disregarded this important aspect.</P>
    <P>The Minister's record is a very chequered one in his handling of some Defence matters.  There was the <i>Claudia</i> and many others.  They are typical examples of the irresponsibility of the Minister when important decisions have to be made.  His efforts now to take power away from the Chief of Staff in relation to Army promotions is a further indication of his power-crazy ambition.  I would say to the Minister that if he wants to become Chief of Staff then he should join the Army.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to know that he cannot be both Minister for Defence and Chief of Staff.  It is important that the Minister should know, not how I feel, but how many people feel about his tactics and attitudes in relation to the Armed Forces.  I would like to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of February 10th, 1975 and from an article by a Dublin barrister-at-law, Brian Doolin, where he said:</P>
      <P>One could be forgiven if one thought that the Army was the private plaything of the present Minister for Defence, Mr. Donegan. He is rarely photographed in the media but when he is, he is usually bowler-hatted, inspecting or addressing soldiers or dressed up in an Army tunic with a machinegun in his hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="933" /> That is not my viewpoint but the viewpoint of a barrister-at-law.  I have already quoted from the <i>Anglo-Celt,</i> which gave a further indication of the arrogance and the attitude that the Minister has in regard to matters of great importance.  Now that the Minister has taken upon himself this dangerous mantle of power politics in political appointments in the armed services, we ask is the Minister ready now? If one quotes further from the barrister-at-law who made that statement, one could very well, at the particular stage when that article appeared, say the man was crazy.  But having followed closely the trend of events since, one would say there is much sense in what Mr. Doolin stated at that time.  He went on to state that it might be used to seize or abuse power.  Is the Minister setting up a military junta? Is the Minister trying to set up an officer corps of his own? What is the idea behind the Minister's actions? Why does he want, at this stage, to take this power upon himself? In our present security situation it should be everybody's aim to boost the morale of and instil confidence into the Defence Forces.  With so much discontent and uncertainty existing now within the Defence Forces, one wonders how much irreparable damage has been caused by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hoped that the Taoiseach would have been available to listen to this Motion.  He should fully understand how I and many others feel in relation to the attitude of the present Minister for Defence.  I do not wish to divert attention from the real reason behind this particular Motion, the change in the regulations by which the Minister has sought to give power to himself.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment in the Press and elsewhere on the powers exercised now by the Minister and the promotions which he has made particularly in relation to the Army School of Equitation and the promotions which spring from it.  This School has no military value whatsoever, and if there is to be an inordinate influence in relation to promotions to senior rank from this particular establishment, upsetting the <Col N="934" /> morale of the Forces, we must have another look at the role that the Army School of Equitation is to play in the future.  The Department of Defence is not the Equitation School. The Department must be able to do its own job, and I am positive that it can do it efficiently.</P>
    <P>Under various sections of the Defence Forces Act a number of people have power to promote.  Under section 26 of the Act the power is vested in the Minister to make regulations subject to the Fourth Schedule of the Act, which gives him the authority to make regulations altering the Defence Force regulations and paragraph 7 is the one that has been altered.  This gives the Minister that power.  He also has power to promote under section 45.  It is under this section that he produced this documentation. The Minister has changed the regulations to suit himself.  Subject to the provisions of the Defence Force Regulations, 1974, the Minister may, having considered such recommendations as may be made by the Chief of Staff, promote an officer from one rank to the next higher rank.  The Minister has taken away power previously vested in the Chief of Staff. He also altered subparagraph (2) which provides that in recommending an officer for promotion under subparagraph (1) the Chief of Staff shall also have regard to certain factors. In the past, there had to be certification by the Chief of Staff.  The Chief of Staff was the person who made the recommendation to the Minister but now we have the serious situation where the Minister has absolute power.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a bad job of it.  Under section 26 he has certain powers.  He has power to amend the regulations in accordance with Schedule IV of the Defence Act, 1954.  He has amended the regulation under section 45 of the Defence Act, 1954.  It must be clear to the Minister, and to those who read the Act, that the Minister has altered the regulations under the wrong section. In fact, the officers concerned have not been promoted.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister, even at <Col N="935" /> this stage, to seek the advice of the Attorney General in order to clarify the situation in relation to section 26 and section 45.  Section 26 is the section which gives the Minister the authority to amend the Defence Forces Regulations.  The Minister has amended these regulations under section 45.  I want to quote from the paragraph which the Minister has amended.  It provided that an officer may, on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, be promoted by the Minister from one substantive rank to the next higher rank.  The Minister has changed that in order to give himself absolute power but he has done a bad job.  I submit that the Minister has altered the regulations under the wrong section.  It should have been section 26.  An investigation by his legal assistants will show clearly that the Minister has made a mess of the whole affair.  He must bear the responsibility for any money spent, any salaries given to officers wrongly promoted.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the Minister would mend his hand.  There are many ways in which he can do this. He can promote the officers he wishes to promote and, at the same time, and without interfering with the promotions of those entitled to them, he can rectify the situation.  Morale must be restored throughout the service and in the higher ranks of the Army who have lost confidence in the Minister because of his dictatorial attitude and approach.  I have pointed out to the Minister that he amended the regulations under the wrong section and it is now in the Minister's court to rectify the position.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in the next day or so we will have a responsible statement from the Minister in relation to these promotions and future promotions, in relation to the prospects of officers who want to make a career in the Army and in relation to those who wish to apply for membership of the cadet school.  I hope we will revert to the situation which existed before 17th June, 1975.</P>
    <P>One heartening fact which has <Col N="936" /> emerged is that we have a Chief of Staff, a man of courage, who will not allow himself to be intimidated by the Minister for Defence or any other politician.  It is desirable that we should have a man at the head of our defence forces who has the moral courage to stand up to an irresponsible Minister.  The Army should be grateful for having such a man.  We know also that under section 114 of the Act the redress of wrongs percolates to the Minister, who adjudicates on them.</P>
    <P>Now we have the Minister making appointments.  If an officer feels aggrieved by being passed over despite the fact that he has all the qualifications and is fully equipped to take up a particular post, he must make a complaint to the Minister who will adjudicate on the complaint.  How will a man make a complaint in future if the Minister has this responsibility and it is not the responsibility of some army officer?  Surely this is of importance to officers who wish to redress wrongs.  How will the Minister make a decision on an appointment he has made?  What chance has somebody who has been passed over for promotion of getting justice when he has been trampled on by an irresponsible Minister, a Minister who has undermined his morale and shattered his prospects of promotion?  Will the Minister now give an indication that he is prepared to mend his ways and act responsibly in future?  Officers who have served the nation well, at home and abroad deserve consideration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the system applied in relation to promotions under section 7 is not the best possible system and, if it is not, it should be changed.  Do we require a promotions board?  Is such a board an answer to the problem of assessing fully and factually over a wide area the ability and efficiency the people in line for promotion?  If that is a more sensible approach, then I have no objection to the Minister amending the regulations to introduce such a board.  The Minister must show clearly that he is prepared to take deliberate action to ease tension and restore morale.  That can only be done <Col N="937" /> by reverting to what was the existing position.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that this is history repeating itself, but this decision was made by the Minister, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach and Members of the Government.  I hope that before the debate ends we will have a clear statement, may be not from the Minister but from the Taoiseach who has a large responsibility here.  He cannot wash his hands of his responsibility.  I am sure the Minister would be unable to make such an amendment without the consent of the Taoiseach.  If the Minister made this irresponsible amendment without the consent of the Taoiseach then the Taoiseach should take the appropriate action to deal with the Minister and let it be known throughout the Defence Forces that the Minister erred, that he was over-enthusiastic in his removal of certain people and certain elements.  For the Taoiseach to speak of integrity in the future when so many people have been trampled on, people who were entitled to their rightful place in the armed services, is no answer.  I have the priority lists of the people who have been passed over and disregarded, people who have given long and valuable service.  Will the Minister indicate that there will be a correction of this serious situation?</P>
    <P>The effect of some of the promotions will mean that officers of ability will be denied promotional prospects for 15 years.  There will be a promotion block in certain centres for up to 15 years.  This is a serious situation. One of the problems Ministers have battled with over the years is the question of promotional humps which developed during the emergency period, after it, and in other periods as well.  Various efforts were made from time to time to relieve the situation and ensure that officers could obtain promotion to a reasonably high rank in a reasonably short time. It must be the desire of every responsible Minister for Defence to ensure that young men entering the Defence Forces will have the opportunity of gaining the highest awards at a very early age.  The system must be <Col N="938" /> worked.  We must not in that process disregard those who have given long and loyal service, under contract to serve the nation.  They must serve out that contract and, when their turn comes, they must be duly rewarded providing they have the necessary ability and meet the requirements laid down.</P>
    <P>I would call on the Minister to make available to us&mdash;and this is the only way that the public will be satisfied&mdash; the documents exchanged between the Chief of Staff and the Minister prior to the Minister's so-called amendment. This amendment can and may be challenged in the courts.  We hope the matter will be rectified before this House rises.</P>
    <P>In last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent</i> we had the poison pen of some anonymous reporter trying to stir up civil war hatred by an article on matters he knew nothing about.  It was a completely erroneous description of events relating to other Ministers for Defence, trying to cause confusion and inject into the discussion a bitterness that is neither necessary nor desirable.  I have no desire to examine into the previous political outlook or forecast the future political outlook of any individual. The Minister has done that.  He is on record as doing it.  Then we have the poison pen of an anonymous scribe, a scribe who fails to put his name to paper, and casts reflections on people to dishonour them.  Some of the suggestions were no doubt an effort to cover up the irresponsible attitude of the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan.  I am not going to judge further on this erroneous article or the poison pen tactics of the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, but I would suggest to the editor that he should look this man up, tell him he does not know what he is writing about, and ask him to check out if what he has written is factually correct.  I say it is not.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that men were promoted by Presidents, which they had the authority to do under section 42 of the Act.  They have power to appoint just as the Minister has power to promote under section 45, but he has not power to amend <Col N="939" /> regulations.  I would impress upon the Minister the necessity and desirability of examining the provision under which the amendment was made, Schedule 4 of the Act, and read the small print on top; he will then know what his powers are under section 26. It is about time the Minister realised what his powers are under the various sections of the Act.</P>
    <P>He has acted irresponsibly on this occasion, not merely by amending a regulation under the wrong section but by promoting officers without the necessary authority under the amended regulation which, in fact, is not amended at all.  I would ask the Minister to consider this and not just to give his interpretation because the alleged amendment of this particular regulation will be challenged in due course.</P>
    <P>How far is the Minister prepared to go?  How many people will he promote? Who will it be in the future? We have seen now that there is absolutely no regard for efficiency, ability or the seniority list.  Where does the Minister go from here?  He can pick up who he likes along the way.  Will we arrive at the stage when only the Minister's pals will be promoted?</P>
    <P>In an earlier debate I indicated how irresponsible the Minister was in relation to promotions within the FCA.  They were promoted on paper, serving in Dublin, promoted in Cork and taken back on paper the same day.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an explanation on that point which was not satisfactory to me: he said they were recommended by the Chief of Staff.  I said that the Chief of Staff was then responsible if he wanted to pursue the matter further.  We had the irresponsible action before.  He did it in the FCA and he is now tampering with promotions within the Army. We hope that the situation will terminate now.  We hope that common sense will prevail.  We hope the Minister will give a clear indication to the personnel who are due for promotion that he will revert to the position as it was before 17th June when he signed this famous document <Col N="940" /> that never was.  If he proceeds on the basis he is proceeding with we can have quite a number of officers promoted. To quote General Sir John Hackett&mdash;one-time BOAC executive, in relation to officers: &ldquo;It is possible that there are men who will follow these officers anywhere out of curiosity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not want that situation to develop.  We want men of standing and ability and men who are entitled to their promotions, men whom the Chief of Staff and indeed the Army can be proud of, not just friends of the Minister.  Friends of the Minister are percolating to many places nowadays, and this can very well be the ruination of the Minister and can further undermine the morale of the service.</P>
    <P>I will not detain the House longer, but I hope the Minister will give us the facts in relation to the so-called regulations amendment that has taken place, the reason why he believes that his knowledge is superior to that of the Chief of Staff and the general staff, the reason why he thinks his knowledge is superior to that of the commanders, the reason why the confidential reports and other reports of officers are disregarded, the reason why the seniority list is being disregarded and why he has promoted certain people.  I have nothing against any officer who is promoted provided he is promoted on his ability and that there is no injustice done.  Justice must be the keynote, and I do not want to reflect in any way on any man who is so promoted.  I would be the last one to reflect on any man.  I wish them well in their new posts and I hope that in the next group of promotions, which will take place in September, the same type of situation will not operate as was operated on the 17th June.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Dowling thinks that if you keep saying something often enough and loudly enough everybody will believe it is true, then perhaps he could justify this debate. What I have got are strictly the facts. They will disprove 90 per cent of what he has been saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> Firstly he posed the question of how could I adjudicate on redressing wrongs in the case of an officer who had been passed over when in fact it was I who promoted that officer.  I want to tell Deputy Dowling that in the case of one of these promotions &mdash;I am not going to name anybody and in no circumstances will I indicate which one it is&mdash;he sent me two redressive wrongs in the last year-and-a-half when he had not been promoted, having been passed over.  I made inquiries from his commanding officer, and the other members of the General Staff.  Two of them would have promoted him; the Chief of Staff and two more would not. Having ruled on redressive wrongs twice, I felt&mdash;that is what I said in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> when asked about it&mdash;that the man who was second in seniority in his corps on the basis of his commanding officers and his OC command should be promoted. That is one of the promotions where I disagreed with the Chief of Staff.  Surely you can see my position. I bear a heavy responsibility and I must use that to the best of my ability.  If I find myself in disagreement with the Chief of Staff, then I have got to decide if I have the strength and courage and the guts to make a change in the regulations, or do I sit down and do nothing and allow that particular officer not to be promoted when in my heart I feel he is worthy of promotion and when the commanding officer and his OC command feel it as well, even though the other three officers were against him? Should that be allowed to stop him in what was his last chance of promotion? That disposes of one matter, but whether I can deal with redressive wrongs against myself, I have doubts.</P>
    <P>I should now like to give the promoted officers' positions in seniority in their posts.  They were second, seventh, sixth, fifth, 31st and twelfth. In the case of the man who was 31st, he was promoted by a previous Minister for Defence and he passed over 156 others.  I have to bear the responsibility of placing these positions.  I regret that responsibility but I do it honestly and fairly and I will take all <Col N="942" /> the abuse that Deputy Dowling likes to hurl at me because I can disprove him.  Every Minister for Defence has to face up to the responsibility of promotions.  It lies on his desk and it is his pen that signs them, and whatever recommendations or systems were used and allowed to go through, the Minister, under section 45 of the Act, is the man who makes the promotion and it is his responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is symptomatic of the 1954 Defence Act, put through by the late Oscar Traynor, which I regard as one of the best Acts of Parliament that ever came through this House, that under it the Irish Army are related directly to Government and to Parliament and to nobody else.  That is the reason why it is the Minister for Defence who has to judge on redressive wrongs.  That is why the Minister for Defence is the bulwark between situations where an Army man might be passed over and might be badly treated in his rights to have a redressive wrong.  That is the thinking and that is the way be have dealt with it.</P>
    <P>I have given the seniority positions of those promoted.  I will not bother my head going back to give seniority positions of people in the past, but if anyone wants them they can have them. I would not dream of making comparisons. This is a serious matter. Since 1969 1,200 people have been killed and heavy responsibilities lie on my shoulders and on the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to go through the history of promotions.  In 1924 the Minister for Defence made Order No. 7 which simply said that &ldquo;No promotion shall be made without the authority of the Minister&rdquo;.  In 1928 another regulation was made, Regulation No. 10/1928.  It states:</P>
    <P>All promotion of commissioned officers of the forces will be made by the Minister for Defence on the recommendations of the Council of Defence.</P>
    <P>That position continued until 1949. The provision then regarding recommendations from the Council of Defence was deleted and a further order was made.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The Minister may promote any <Col N="943" /> officer to a higher standing rank or to a higher acting rank.</P>
    <P>As an administrative practice the fact was that the recommendations of the Council of Defence were taken into consideration by the Minister until the 1954 Act.  In 1955&mdash;it was either General Seán MacEoin or the late Oscar Traynor who signed it but it was the thinking of Oscar Traynor at that time&mdash;the regulation was changed as follows:</P>
    <P>An officer may, on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff, be promoted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The effect of that change was to completely vitiate the responsibility of the Minister and the powers of the Minister in this regard.  I have given an indication where I made a decision against the Chief of Staff in respect of one officer.  I have given an indication of the seniority position of those promoted.</P>
    <P>My responsibility comes into it too. I must have regard for my men.  That is my position.  I am between the Chief of Staff and the men and I have to have regard for them and try to be as fair and honest as I can.</P>
    <P>The effect from 1st January, 1955, was that the whole thing was in the hands of the Chief of Staff, but I operated this myself for the last two-and-a-half years.  What happens is, and it happened on this occasion too, that the Chief of Staff sends down recommendations.  He comes down and discusses them with you.  You say: &ldquo;Well, now, you passed over so-and-so the last time.  Are you being fair to him?&rdquo;  He goes away and makes another suggestion, comes back, and this goes on in the most friendly fashion.  Indeed, I am on the most friendly terms with the Chief of Staff at this moment in time.  It goes on in the most friendly fashion over a period of weeks and, perhaps, even a couple of months.  At the point in time when these promotions are to be made, they are made and that is all there is to it.  On this occasion the Chief of Staff found himself sincerely and honestly in disagreement with me. I took my responsibilities in my hands and I changed the regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="944" /> In relation to the change of regulations some barrack room lawyer is instructing Deputy Dowling but he is instructing him wrongly, because I checked with the Attorney General's office and they advised that regulations regarding promotions can be made under either section 45 or section 26.  Previous examples of citations of section 45 are, and I would like to put them on the record of the House, amendment No.68 made on 30th December, 1964, by the late Gerald Bartley, Lord rest him, as Minister for Defence, and amendment No. 71 of 31st January, 1966, by Mr. Michael Hilliard, then Minister for Defence.  The Attorney General's office have already advised me that I am correct in what I have done and within the law.</P>
    <P>The effect of the order of 17th June, 1975, puts the whole thing in its proper perspective.  I promote.  In this motion I am accused of ignoring and I quote:</P>
    <P>... so as to enable him to ignore the recommendations of the Chief of Staff ...</P>
    <P>This is not so.  I have on my file here two separate sets of recommendations from the Chief of Staff in regard to the present promotions during a dialogue that went on between the Chief of Staff and myself for at least six weeks.  Most of those promotions, let me say, do not come into effect until the 2nd September anyway.</P>
    <P>I then would like to deny, of course, what was said in the newspaper report that the amendment was back-dated three days.  It was not so back-dated.  It was made on the 17th June and the promotions were announced on the 20th and signed on the 20th.</P>
    <P>The factors now regarding promotions. You must take a lot of things into account.  You have got to take command and staff courses, courses abroad, seniority positions and men's administrative ability itself. I do not, for a moment, profess to be the person who goes out and walks through some place like the Curragh Camp and says: &ldquo;Oh, that is a great commanding officer&rdquo; or walks <Col N="945" /> through some barracks and says: &ldquo;That is a very well run barracks&rdquo;. I do not.  That is not the way it happens, as ex-Ministers for Defence in this House know.  Reports of all kinds come and you must balance one against the other.</P>
    <P>As regards the rather politically stupid&mdash;I would not like to use the word &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; without putting the word &ldquo;politically&rdquo; before it&mdash;suggestion by Deputy Dowling that I could promote everybody who has been put up for promotion as well as those I promote myself, he should know that the matter is one of establishment and that there were only six positions for six colonels.  At the moment I am arguing very vigorously with the United Nations to try to get my seventh colonel.  There is somebody, whoever he is, waiting out there in the Army.  If I can get it in the next week or fortnight he will get it.  Somebody must get that colonelship. Everybody knows it is on establishment. Everybody knows that you cannot say; &ldquo;We will have 16 colonels instead of six.&rdquo;  It just shows how little Deputy Dowling knows about the matter when he suggests that in this House.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that the manner in which promotions were made was the best I could do in the circumstances.  I had the responsibility of seeing people there who I felt were being passed over and I had not enough places to promote everybody who would like to be promoted. It was the greatest number of promotions available at the top ranks ever in the Army.  The situation was that there had to be many great expectations and many great disappointments. If I had only one or two colonelships to give out there would be very few thinking about it, but when there was one in this corps and one in the other, a total of six, then the position was, of course, that there <Col N="946" /> had to be great expectations and great disappointments.</P>
      <P>Let me now point to the two Government appointments, that of Adjutant General and Quartermaster General, and tell you that the normal term of appointment is five years. Neither of those two gentlemen will complete five years.  They will be retired on grounds of age before they have completed the five years.  So, it may be taken that within the top senior men in the Army, these two gentlemen were very senior indeed. Most of the promotions that were made by previous administrations had far more than the five years to run. In fact, there have been instances where people were able to get a second five years in the job.  It may be taken that such Government promotions were of senior men with less than five years to run.</P>
      <P>I should like to discuss the matter of the equitation team.  People fastened on to the question of the Army Equitation Team and suggested that, perhaps, people who were there got accelerated promotion and that there was a sort of preference for it. The position is that the Irish horse must be advertised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish horse must be advertised and the only agent that has got the organisation to do the job is the Army jumping team.  The position in relation to the Army jumping team is simply this: a person was promoted from the equitation team to a more senior appointment.  The Chief of Staff's recommendation a year ago for that appointment was for a gentleman&mdash;and a very decent man, I know him very well&mdash;who was one place on the seniority list above the man now promoted and when it came to this time he did not put him up at all.  He put a different fellow up.  There I am now, if I wanted to talk about that position, with three possible names and I only have one job and as regards seniority one place below, one place above and I do not know where the third man was.  When there is only one job one must do one's best.  I want to indicate that I have the <Col N="947" /> greatest belief in the people who were promoted and I think they will do well.</P>
      <P>If you are looking for doctors you promote doctors to do doctoring.  If you are looking for engineers you promote engineers to do engineering.  A fellow who is promoted in the equitation team has no handle to his name at all.  He is just a horseman and, therefore, you could say: &ldquo;It is unfair. Why was he taken and brought up?&rdquo;  The truth is that he must be a specialist.  He is just a specialist without the letters after his name.  Within the equitation team that is the answer to it.  You have got to pick the best man for the job.  There is not much point in coming in with the place half broken down; spending £300,000 and then picking somebody who is a good man at radio.  Maybe that is what the Opposition would like but that is not what we would do.</P>
      <P>There has never been, within the Irish Army at the top, an absolute insistence that there shall be seniority all the time in promotions.  I will give you what previous Governments did in relation to Chiefs of Staff.  I will give no names.  The first man on the list passed over 16 to become Chief of Staff.  The second man passed over 27.  The third passed over nine.  There was a politician who took, as Taoiseach, an Aide de Camp and his proper rank for that appointment was Commandant.  Without any establishment appointment, he made him lieutenant colonel.  When he became President he promoted this individual to colonel.  He was entitled to one commandant.  He took two commandants and made them lieutenantcolonels and he kept the colonel who was 68½ years of age, thereby depriva colonel of an appointment for eight and a half years.  If you want this sort of stuff you can have it.  But I go back to my promotions and read them out to you again.  First to the seniority, second, second, sixth, fifth, thirty-first and twelfth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to be associated with this motion and I feel that we should read it very carefully as I believe that every word and <Col N="948" /> phrase of it is true.  I intend, during the few minutes at my disposal, to give examples of the frightful wrong that the Minister has perpetrated on the Army.  When we read this motion and when we look at the regulation we see that a regulation that was good enough for years for every other Minister, was not good enough for this Minister.  The sequence of events that led up to this unprecedented action by the Minister is that a list of promotions was prepared by the Chief of Staff after consultation with the Army Council. That was presented to the Minister.  He examined the list and he saw that it did not meet the requirements of his leader, prominent members of his own party and other Ministers and he made out his own list and presented it to the Chief of Staff.  That list contained so many wrong promotions that the Chief of Staff would not agree with it and then it was necessary for the Minister to change the Defence Force regulations as they existed.  I believe a compromise of three for you and three for our side was offered by the Minister but rejected by the Chief of Staff.  This is the type of horse trading that Deputy Dowling has mentioned and the term &ldquo;horse trading&rdquo; was never more applicable than in this sordid case.  Then the Minister decided in his arrogance&mdash; we have seen here tonight an example of how arrogant the Minister is&mdash;that he was going to have his own way and that he was going to change the regulations to suit himself.  The Minister may, having considered such recommendations as may be made by the Chief of Staff, promote an officer from one rank to the next highest rank.  In other words, that is the new regulation and the Minister can, in future, ignore what the Chief of Staff says and promote anyone he likes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other minor points mentioned, that the Chief of Staff is supposed to take cognisance of, but they will not affect the issue in the least because we have no safeguard now over the actions of the Minister.  It would be hard for any Chief of Staff to pick out a commandant, a colonel or a <Col N="949" /> lieutenant-colonel and say: &ldquo;That man is not fit for a higher rank&rdquo;. That is not the same thing as saying that if the Chief of Staff was left to himself he would recommend that particular man and that he would compare his qualifications with those of others in the field and decide that he should get that rank.  The position now is that the Minister can do what he wants.  We have a situation now where the Minister has reduced the general staff and the Chief of Staff to the ignominious position of being mere rubber stamps.  His attitude tonight is that of one who has assumed the role of complete dictator, as far as the Army is concerned.</P>
    <P>It must be said that some of the promotions, and he was pleased to mention these, are deserved but others are ridiculous.  From my knowledge, I can say that three of those people who were promoted&mdash;I come from a constituency where there is a tradition of Army life&mdash;would never have been promoted if any sane person had a look at their AF 457.  They would not be promoted if they lived to the age of Methuselah.  I can also say that the omission of some from the list, cannot be explained.  I know men in that list who are real soldiers, who have given a lifetime to soldiering, who have a 100 per cent clear record and have done all the command and staff courses and every other course available. It would be very hard for the Minister or anybody else to explain how that could have happened.  I am confident that those people figured on the Chief of Staff's list but I know that they were culled by the Minister. We have, in Messrs Carroll, Byrne and Sullivan, three very sound men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>We have in the general staff people to whom I would have no hesitation in trusting promotions. They are sound men.  I am not sure of their political leaning.  May be if I had the ear of the Minister he could tell me that two out of those three were Fianna Fáil.  We do not know and we do not want to know what they are.  The fact that the Minister <Col N="950" /> was so ready to explain that two of those who were promoted were Fianna Fáil, is a clear indication that the political leaning was subject to very close scrutiny by the Minister before anyone was promoted.  I would depend on those people.  I would depend my life on their sound judgment. The Minister rejected their opinion and he upset a balance that has always existed between the Minister and the Army.  If the Minister was inclined to stray off the line, as this Minister has done, the opinion of the Chief of Staff was always there to act as a counterbalance.</P>
      <P>Can anybody seriously believe that the Minister in charge of our Defence Forces at the moment should have the final say in a serious matter such as this?  Does the Government side of the House believe this is a man who can be trusted in an emergency situation? Has it not been proved that when the Minister is subjected to pressure he is not capable of making proper decisions?  When he cast himself in the leading role in the <i>Claudia</i> affair did his performance inspire confidence on that occasion?  In this and in previous incidents the Minister has proved that he has a weakness of character that demands curbing rather than not having any restraint at all placed on it.  I read today in the book that is placed under the flag that John F. Kennedy presented to us, regarding the Battle of Fredericksburg that a reporter, referring to that battle, said:</P>
      <P>It can hardly be in human nature for men to show more valour or generals to manifest less judgment than were perceptible on our side that day.</P>
      <P>In this case it could hardly be in human nature for a Chief of Staff to show more judgment and a Minister to manifest such a lack of it as has been shown in this particular case in the promotions and in changing the Army regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every element of panic is to be seen here in the Minister's action.  He reminds me of the biblical character who realised that he saw the writing on the wall and realised that very <Col N="951" /> soon he would be steward no longer and he went around to his friends and told them to take their pens and write fifty&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister is obviously looking for personal powers.  This is the first hole in the dam.  He can appoint anyone he wishes now.  He can, under section 41, allow an alien into the Army.  For example, he could appoint a Russian and then with the newly acquired powers that he has he could promote him step by step to any rank he wished.  There are many who would think that if that Russian were a Cossack he would have much more hope of accelerated promotion in the present case.</P>
      <P>Under section 45 the President has power to appoint an officer to any position for any length of time.  I presume that is to enable him to have an <i>aide de camp</i> of his own choice. Deputy Donegan referred to this tonight and also referred to the different matters that were done but it would appear now that Deputy Donegan is anxious to assume presidential powers to himself, but without the safeguard of impeachment we would have in presidential cases.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment must be cancelled now.  The Minister is faced anyhow with an amendment that does not stand up in law.  It was no barrackroom lawyer who told us this.  I am confident that if the Minister pursues his madness it will be proved at great cost to him and the State in the court that this has been made under a wrong section.  We will stand over that and the party that I represent are prepared to pursue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the best legal opinion that this hurriedly executed amendment has a technical error in it.  Section 45 gives power to make a promotion but section 26 is the regulation under <Col N="952" /> which to make promotions and when the Minister is changing that section he must refer to that section.  The Minister should have made the changes under section 26 and subsequently the promotions under section 45.  The amendment is illegal and <i>ultra vires</i> and therefore the appointments are not legal.  Unless the Minister relents anyone can contest this in a court and his action will succeed. If the Minister wishes to pursue these mad promotions he has made he will have to make them again.  We all know he was a fool once and we hope he will not be a fool twice.  To judge by what has happened today it will be done again.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to make the case that this was what former Ministers such as Ministers Hilliard and Bartley did and that because they did it and the legal experts and the Attorney General told the Minister that it was right for him to do it, it was in fact right.  It is quite possible that they were wrong and we believe they were wrong.  I am confident that it will be proved that your action was wrong and illegal.  All through your contribution here tonight it was quite obvious that you have a very false opinion of the role of the Minister for Defence.  You have taken on yourself the role and the functions of the Army.  Your very expressions lend weight to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that himself.  He said: &ldquo;I am doing my best with the United Nations to get my seventh colonel.&rdquo;  It was not &ldquo;our seventh colonel&rdquo;, it was his particular seventh colonel.  That shows the mind of the Minister.  He mentions that after 1969 with 1,200 dead a heavy responsibility lies on his shoulders.  If those are the shoulders that the heavy responsibility lies on.  God help Ireland.  Then he tells us that he was the man with the guts and the courage to make these promotions.  The promotions are political patronage, and everyone with an eye in his head recognises <Col N="953" /> that.  The only man with guts and courage in this sordid affair was the Chief of Staff who refused to be party to it.  Who knows best how to make promotions?  Is it the Minister of the day&mdash;let him be there for long or short&mdash;or the Chief of Staff who has proved his worth?</P>
      <P>The Minister has no idea of his own limitations.  Up to now the loyalty of this Army has been traditional: it has never been in doubt. The Taoiseach has always expressed a pride in the setting up of the Army. Surely he can now see that aided and abetted by the Minister he has changed the entire role of the Army and politics have now come first in the Army.  It would appear that the best advice one could give Army officers now hoping for promotion is to join a political party.  That is what your action amounts to.  We abhor the setting up in another part of this country of a group to which we refer as the B Specials, but now the Minister has his own D Specials down here.</P>
      <P>Army morale is at a very low ebb indeed as a consequence of the action of the Minister.  The Minister, to give him his due, had gained a reputation of genuine interest in the Army during his two years in office. But the Minister has lost that by this particular action.  We now have a Minister who can never again hope to have the trust of the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to answer quite a number of questions.  These are questions that soldiers and other people are putting to me.  They want to hear the answers to them.  To know that the guillotine is coming down tomorrow will not satisfy them.  They want to know did the General Staff object to these promotions and, if so, on whose recommendations were the promotions and the appointments made.  Why was it necessary to amend the regulations and on whose advice was this done?  Was the Cabinet consulted or was it not?  Previously the Minister said that eventually they would come to some compromise.  But this time they could not be brought together.  He did not accept the judgment of the Chief of Staff.  Does he <Col N="954" /> now propose to retain the services of the Chief of Staff, seeing that he had not the trust that he should place in him on that occasion, or does he propose to dismiss him?  Is the Minister prepared to place his selections and the justifications for them before a committee of this House together with the recommendations of the General Staff, with particulars of their careers, qualifications, confidential reports, and compare the Minister's selection with the team set up by the Chief of Staff and see who was right and who was wrong?  That might help to explain how a person who never did a day's training in supply and transport can now be placed in charge of supplying transport in September.  He may be an expert in one field&mdash;possibly he is.  The officer, I am sure, is an expert in the equitation field.  He probably deserves his promotion.  Why was he not promoted as colonel in his own equestrian school and left there?  Why was it necessary to move him out of that, or was it so necessary to find room for the most favoured son of all that he had to move aside and move on and let another take his place.</P>
    <P>The courses that officers do can now be ignored.  Why should the captains in the Curragh who are now doing their courses bother completing the courses? Has the Minister any indication that there were murmurs and rumblings among them to their OC, that they felt that there was no point in their doing these courses which up to now had been a forerunner to promotion, when they see that others who do not do these courses get accelerated promotion? Did the present officers doing this command and staff course object to completing their courses?  I would like to know if the Minister has any knowledge of that.</P>
    <P>In many of the cases that have been mentioned tonight promotions are merited and good: in some cases the promotions have upset the career structure of that particular corps completely. Some officers who were in line for promotion can now see that for 15 years there will be no promotion in that particular corps.  Not alone will this be felt at the top but it will have an effect on all the positions <Col N="955" /> down to the bottom as well.  The situation that did apply up to now when the stress was on suitability and seniority was not too bad when, as Deputy Dowling said, it gave us the Chief of Staff who would not be bent as the Minister would like him to bend.  That is the only redeeming feature of this nasty affair, the integrity of the Chief of Staff.  Do we realise that under the regulations as they exist, in section 56, under the new powers that the Minister has, he could set up his own private Army and make his own private corps and that the present Minister has the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; to set up a corps of D Specials that could present us here with a Portuguese situation.</P>
    <P>My first suggestion to the Minister tonight is a serious and very necessary suggestion, that to help a return of faith and morale and any sense of decency to the Army and to restore credibility in the eyes of the officer body, the present occupant of the seat of Minister for Defence must resign. To show that in future politics will be taken out of officers' promotions, I say what I am going to say now in the full confidence that the next Minister for Defence will be a Fianna Fáil Minister.  I say that the selection of a future General Staff will be by a Defence Committee or a committee of this House, including members of the Government and the main Opposition parties, if you will, and that promotions to colonel and lieutenantcolonel will be on the recommendations of the committee composed of the Chief of Staff, the AG and the QMG and the Command OCs and, if you like, one member from each of the main political parties &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that promotions up to the rank of commandant be made on the selection of the General Staff.  The Minister attempted to answer a question tonight as to whom officers should go with a grievance.  The Army has no representative body such as the Garda have.  Their only representative body is the General Staff. <Col N="956" /> If a member of the Army wishes to have redress he may go to his OC and if he is not satisfied with his OC he can appeal to the Minister.  In this case the Minister has wronged the Army by denying some of deserved promotion.  To whom do they now appeal?  Obviously, not to the wrongdoer. Can they appeal to the President?</P>
      <P>It would appear from tonight's remarks and a childish attempt to justify the promotions from the Equitation School that Dean Swift could well make a return to this country.  In one of his lighter moments he wrote a book in which he referred to a country he called &ldquo;Brobdinag&rdquo; where horses took precedence over human beings.  We are fast approaching a similar situation, and I say that coming from a constituency where we love horses.</P>
      <P>The case made by the Minister was a very flimsy one indeed.  The Minister has proved that he is not fit to be a Minister.  He is either too weak or too easily swayed by others or&mdash; and I am inclined to favour the latter after listening to him here tonight&mdash; he is too arrogant, or else he is prepared to trample on people in order to have his own way.  The action of the Minister has done untold harm, and the only way he can help to undo that harm is by listening to the loudly expressed views and wishes of hundreds of Army men to whom I have spoken.  I know them, I represent them, and they have asked me to say to the Minister that the Army calls on him to withdraw this amendment and then resign.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that one of the first things Fianna Fáil will do, when they resume office, is to change this regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One has listened to a great many words and a great deal of noise, and it appears to me that the objection of the Opposition is that the Minister is prepared to accept responsibility. Prior to 17th June of this year he was merely a rubber stamp under the previous regulation.  The Minister for Defence is answerable to this House for what happens in the <Col N="957" /> armed forces and for all matters appertaining to the armed forces.  I do not think any Member of this House would have it otherwise.  We are the elected representatives of the people.  We have to have somebody who is answerable to us in this House but, apparently, that is not what the Opposition want.</P>
      <P>This change in the regulations by the Minister puts the matter right and puts it back in the pre-1955 situation. So that we may properly understand the situation, under the regulations, prior to the Minister's recent amendment, the Minister would have had to act on the recommendations of the Chief of Staff.  The position now is that the Minister, having considered the recommendations of the Chief of Staff, takes the responsibility, as it should rightly be taken in this matter; it should be a matter for which the Minister is responsible to this House. If he is merely a rubber stamp how can he be answerable to any Member of this House? How can he answer questions about the Army or about promotions in the Army? It is quite clear that under section 45 of the Defence Act, 1954, it is the duty and the function of the Minister to take responsibility for promotions.  This Minister is not prepared to shirk his responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy, up to now in this debate Members have been allowed to speak without interruption.  I am insisting on the Member in possession being given that opportunity.  Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Wilson must cease interrupting. There are only a few minutes left.  Deputy Esmonde is in possession and, if Deputy O'Kennedy persists in interrupting.  I will ask him to leave the House.  I am asking that the Deputy in possession, from an ingrained sense of fair play, be allowed to utilise the two minutes remaining to him.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the statement made by Deputy Power when he said: &ldquo;When the Minister was put under pressure, he showed weakness of character.&rdquo;  In other words, Deputy Power was indicting the Minister in his office as Minister for Defence for what he has done up to date. Deputy Fitzgerald is inclined to be irrelevant.  Possibly Deputy Fitzgerald was not in the House when the point was being made.  I should like to put the matter in perspective for the benefit of those who have not been doing enough thinking during this debate. Words like &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;political patronage&rdquo; have been used.  This is the type of language it is easy to use. It is a peculiar thing that whenever we have a debate appertaining to anything in regard to law and order or any of <Col N="959" /> the agencies that deal with law and order, a great deal of noise and disorder comes from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Anything of that nature is anathema to Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Wilson and others do not appear to have read section 45 of the Defence Act, 1974.</P>

      <P>I do not think they know what is in the section.  Possibly the Deputies will read it tomorrow, perhaps even when they leave this Chamber, and will then stop flying off the handle.  Deputies on the other side of the House cannot accept the situation.  No Minister for Defence can derogate his responsibility under an Act of Parliament.  Prior to 17th June of this year that responsibility was derogated to the Chief of Staff. The section is plain.  It is No. 18 of 1954, page 199, for Deputy O'Kennedy's information.</P>
      <P>Statements have been made which show a definite element of panic in this case.  Deputy Power tends to speak as if he had the authority of the majority in the Irish Parliament. Where he gets that authority I do not know; where he gets his information I am not too certain about either. Just because the Curragh happens to be in his constituency Deputy Power might think he is speaking with an authority he has not actually got, or an authority of knowledge he has not got.  To make a statement that three people promoted would never have been promoted if they had lived to the age of Methuselah&mdash;a limited number of people have been promoted&mdash;is language which is very much to be deprecated in the House.  It is identifying people, bringing it down to a very small number.  I do not know what Deputy Power's ability may be to judge who should be promoted but as far as I am concerned &mdash;and every Deputy on this side of the House&mdash;the one person who has that responsibility is the Minister for Defence.</P>

It has been hinted at; it has been left there.  It is a dirty, murky page in the history of our armed forces in relation to promotion.  It is better that we do not go into those past cases.

      <P>We are discussing a Fianna Fáil motion.  We put down this motion because, as various speakers have said, the Minister has assumed dictatorial powers.  It is our view that this Government have been guilty of wicked patronage, and this is further patronage.  In a plausible manner the Minister said here a short while ago that he and the Chief of Staff discussed this and that, and that they are great friends, but why did he change the Act?  Why did the Act not work for him when it worked for every other Minister for Defence since 1954? Deputy Esmonde referred to things that happened in the past, and I shall refer to that later.  I will not dig up things which happened in the past. Names should never be mentioned in the House.  It was possible to identify people from what the Minister said, and that is a very bad approach.  I would ask the Minister to come into the House tomorrow and state clearly why had he to change the Act when he and the Chief of Staff were great friends.</P>

      <P>I move an amendment to amendment No. 39:</P>
      <P>In subparagraph (2) of paragraph 11 to delete &ldquo;be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that sum had been actually paid&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;on proof of payment to the Revenue Commissioners of the amount so deducted, be acquitted and discharged of so much money as is represented by the deduction as if that sum had been actually paid to the person making the disposal&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment meets the major points we were making in so far as it has the effect that the vendor will not now be deprived of his legal rights to recover money compulsorily deducted from him as was the case under the amendment before us.  The suggestion for this amendment was made across the floor of the House from this side.  I should like to pay tribute to the Minister for his acceptance of the idea and the incorporation of it in this amendment.  It is very important that this should have been done because it was a very serious and major defect in the proposed paragraph 11 as it stood.  This amendment goes a long way to meeting the point.  Therefore, so far as this amendment is concerned, we support it.  I am agreeing to an amendment to amendment No. 39.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point on the other one.  The first point is this: the effect of this amendment is to provide that where capital gains tax is assessed and charged either on the vendor or the purchaser, then the tax becomes due and payable on the following day.  In the case of the purchaser, first, where he has paid the money to the Revenue Commissioners as envisaged in the previous amendment, presumable this question will not arise, so there is no problem there.  Where he has not paid the money to the Revenue Commissioners, this amendment is the correct approach.  In the case of the purchaser holding on to the money, he should be liable to pay it over immediately.  In regard to the vendor, I am not quite sure if the position is the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy allow me to explain the case?  There is no question of charging the vendor under paragraph 11.  This charge is on the purchaser.  The purchaser will pay the charge.  If the payment is an excess payment the vendor may apply for a repayment but the actual charge here is a charge upon the purchaser and the amount of the charge is 26 per cent of one half of the consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the appropriate relief to be given to the person chargeable in respect of the gain on the disposal, that is the vendor.  Subparagraph (5) deals with the appropriate relief.  It is where the amount paid under subparagraph 5 (3) and (4) that is, paid by the purchaser, the appropriate relief shall be given to the person chargeable in respect of the gain on the disposal, that is the vendor.</P>

Assuming that the amount of tax is assessed and charged&mdash;I am not quite sure what that phrase means&mdash;in what way is that communicated to the person liable?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;under subparagraph (3).  Then the Revenue Commissioners say what the appropriate amount should be.  That is the charging process.  Then the obligation to pay arises by virtue of amendment No. 39.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I refer the Minister back to the occasion when this amendment we are discussing was first circulated?  When I inquired about the phrase &ldquo;where an amount of capital gains tax is assessed and charged pursuant to this paragraph&rdquo; the Minister <Col N="964" /> was in some difficulty, I thought, because he said it could include either the purchaser under subparagraph (3) or the vendor under subparagraph (5). Perhaps I misunderstood the Minister but I thought that was what he said, and that he had some difficulty in regard to a suggestion I was making at the time which may not be relevant now.  I am trying to be quite clear on the fact, as the Minister now says that this applies only in the case of the purchaser who has, in fact, deducted the money and not paid it to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position. In the normal case of a disposal the liability would arise under section 5. The provision under paragraph 11 deals with the obligation which lies on the purchaser to deduct and pay tax which is equal to 26 per cent on one-half of the consideration.  This does not impose an obligation on the vendor to pay.  That is in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that the phrase &ldquo;amount of capital gains tax&rdquo; includes the total deduction which, as the Minister knows, consists of tax plus an amount which in many cases will be refunded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because we specifically say what that capital gains tax is in subparagraph 3&mdash;the last three lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that covers it.  I have the Minister's assurance then that the phrase &ldquo;assessed and charged&rdquo; includes the process of notification so that a person could not become liable for the tax on the day following assessment even though he had not been notified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would visualise that in most cases the assessment, charge and payment might be made on the one occasion.  There is no difficult calculation here.  It is simply taking 26 per cent of half of the consideration, which any person could do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My only concern is to make sure that the person who becomes liable, as the Minister will <Col N="965" /> appreciate, can become liable for interest too within a certain time, that at least he will be notified before his liability commences.  There is one other matter I want to raise on the paragraph itself.  I would refer the Minister to subparagraph (5).  It provides that:</P>
      <P>...relief shall be given on a claim being made in that behalf to, in effect, the vendor&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whether by discharge or repayment or otherwise.</P>
      <P>Discharge presumably means discharge of the assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a credit or a set-off against other tax liabilities.

      <P>41. In page 77, before paragraph 18, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>
        <i>&ldquo;Gifts: recovery of tax from donee.</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>18.&mdash;(1)  If in any year of assessment a chargeable gain accrues to any person on the disposal of an asset by way of gift and any amount of capital gains tax assessed on that person for that year of assessment is not paid within twelve months from the date when the tax becomes payable, the donee may, by an assessment made not later than two years from the date when the tax became payable, be assessed and charged (in the <Col N="967" /> name of the donor) to capital gains tax on an amount not exceeding the amount of the chargeable gain so accruing, and not exceeding such an amount of chargeable gains as would, if charged at the rate provided in section 3 (3), result in liability to an amount of capital gains tax equal to the said amount of capital gains tax which was not paid by the donor.</P>
    <P>(2) Where the gift consists of a new asset, the donee may, in addition to being assessed and charged under subparagraph (1) in respect of the new asset, be assessed and charged as if the chargeable gain on the disposal of the old asset were a chargeable gain on the disposal of the new asset the capital gains tax in respect of which was not paid within twelve months from the date when the tax had become payable.</P>
    <P>(3) (a) Where a person on whom capital gains tax is assessed and charged in respect of the disposal of an asset transfers directly or indirectly by way of gift to a donee the whole of the proceeds of the disposal, or, where the asset is a new asset acquired by the use of the proceeds of the disposal of an old asset, the whole of the proceeds of the disposal of the new asset, subparagraphs (1) and (2) shall apply to the amount of capital gains tax so assessed and charged.</P>
    <P>(b) Where a person on whom capital gains tax is assessed and charged in respect of the disposal of an asset transfers directly or indirectly by way of gift to a donee part of the proceeds of the disposal, or, where the asset is a new asset acquired by the use of the proceeds of the disposal of an old asset, part of the proceeds of the disposal of the new asset, subparagraphs (1) and (2) shall apply to such part of the amount of capital gains tax so assessed and charged as bears to the whole of such tax the same proportion that the part aforesaid of the proceeds aforesaid bear to the whole of those proceeds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> (4) The donee of a gift paying any amount of tax in pursuance of this paragraph shall, subject to any terms or conditions of the gifts, be entitled to recover a sum of that amount from the donor of the gift as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(5) References in this paragraph to a donor include, in the case of an individual who has died, references to his personal representatives.</P>
    <P>(6) In this paragraph references to a gift include references to any transactions otherwise than by way of a bargain made at arm's length so far as money or money's worth passes under the transaction without full consideration in money or money's worth, and &lsquo;donor&rsquo; and &lsquo;donee&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly; and this paragraph shall apply in relation to a gift made to two or more donees with any necessary modifications and subject to the proviso that each such donee shall be liable to be assessed and charged in respect only of such part of the amount of capital gains tax payable by the donees by virtue of this paragraph as bears to the whole of such tax the same proportion as the part of the gift made to that donee bears to the whole of the gift.</P>
    <P>(7) In this paragraph &lsquo;old asset&rsquo; and &rsquo;new asset&rsquo; have the same meanings as in section 28&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to enable the Revenue to deal with the situation where a person who has given many assets in gifts or given away in gifts the proceeds from the sale of an asset and has left capital gains tax unpaid.  It could, obviously happen that the donor of the gifts could leave himself without any assets or funds against which the Revenue could proceed for recovery of the tax.  In such a situation the donee could have received a greater benefit than he would have if the donor had paid the capital gains tax due in respect of the disposal of the asset of which the gift consisted. Where this happens it is only right that <Col N="969" /> there should be power to recover from the donee the additional benefit which has accrued to him because of the default in payment of the tax by the donor.  The same applies where the donor was liable on gains which were rolled over into other assets.  The manner in which the tax will be recouped is by charging the amount of capital gains tax left unpaid on the donee in the name of the donor.  The charge will therefore be separate and distinct from any charge on the donee in respect of his own capital gains and the donee will be entitled to claim from the donor any amount of capital gains tax which he has to pay on behalf of the donor.  Where the gift is subject to payment of the tax by the donee he will be debarred from recovering the tax from the donor.  The provisions in the new paragraph which is being added to Schedule 4 are also being extended to cases where an asset passes to a person at less than its true market value.  The reason for this is that the person who disposed of the asset might not have obtained sufficient money to pay the tax as adjusted by reference to the real value of the transaction and the person who acquired the asset will have benefited to the extent of the difference between the consideration he gave and the true market value.  It is therefore equitable that he should be asked to pay any tax left unpaid on the transaction by the person who made the disposal.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (1) deals with the situation where a person who is charged to capital gains tax on the chargeable gains which accrue on the disposal of an asset by gift leaves any amount of capital gains tax unpaid 12 months after the tax was due. Where this occurs the recipient of the gift may be assessed and charged for the tax in the name of the donor of the gift.  Any assessment so made must be made not later than two years after the date the tax charged on the donor became due and payable.  It is considered that it is fair to expect the donee to be able to pay but that after a lapse of more than two years he could have parted with the asset and might not have the means of paying the tax.  (It will be recalled that a similar two years exclusion is provided <Col N="970" /> in subsection (6) of section 6 in the calculation of the relief in respect of the alternative charge for gains on an asset acquired from a connected person.) To ensure that the provision is equitable it is laid down that the donee cannot be charged any more than the tax on the amount of the gain on the disposal by gift or the amount of the tax which remains unpaid.  Only the smaller of either of these sums will be chargeable on the donee.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (2) deals with a situation where the gift consists of an asset which replaces another asset and which was purchased out of the proceeds of the asset replaced.  In addition to the charge in respect of the gain on the asset given by gift the donee may also be charged to capital gains tax in respect of the gain applicable to the asset replaced and which was deferred under a claim under section 28.  This again is fair as the donee has also benefited from the fact that no capital gains tax was paid by the donee on the asset replaced and has greater value than would be the case if the capital gains tax had been paid in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) deals with the situation created where the asset is sold and the proceeds are given by gift to another person.  There are two positions.  In (a) the position is dealt with where the whole of the proceeds of sale of an asset, or, in the case of a replacement, the proceeds of the sale of the new assets, are given by gift to a donee, then the donee may be assessed and charged under subparagraphs (1) and (2) for the amounts assessed and charged on the donor but left unpaid by him.</P>
    <P>In (b) the same conditions as in (a) are postulated but instead of the whole of the proceeds being transferred the donee gets only part.  In this case the donee is to be assessed and charged for the appropriate proportion of the total charge of the donor.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (4) gives the donee the right to recover any capital gains tax charged on him by virtue of subparagraph (1) from the donor.  This, however, is subject to any term or condition of the gift so that if the donor <Col N="971" /> gives the gift on condition that the donee will pay the tax, the donee cannot recover the tax if he has to pay it. Recovery by the donee in another case is to be in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (5) ensures that the provisions of the paragraph are to apply to the personal representatives of a deceased person as they apply to a donor.  Thus the death of a donor will not prevent the Revenue from recovering from the donee capital gains tax which the deceased left unpaid and the donee in turn may recover any sums paid by him in respect of the donor's liability from the personal representatives of the deceased donor. Likewise if a donee is charged after the death of the donor he has the right of recovery from the deceased donor's personal representatives.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (6) extends the provisions of the paragraph to transactions other than gifts where market value would be substituted for the actual consideration received.  For the purposes of the paragraph, therefore, references to a gift are specified to include cases where the asset passed by way of a bargain which was not at arm's length and for the purpose of the paragraph the person who disposed of the asset would be treated in the same way as if he were a donor of a gift in subparagraph (5) and likewise the person who acquired the asset would be treated in the same way as the donee of a gift.  Thus a person who acquired an asset by way of bargain not at arm's length could be charged for tax left unpaid by the person who disposed of the asset to him in the same way as the donee may be charged on the tax due by the donor of the gift given to him. The situation where this subparagraph will apply arises only when money or money's worth passes under a transaction at an amount or value less than it would be if the bargain were on a commercial basis and at arm's length.  The paragraph therefore cannot apply to normal commercial transactions.  Thus where full consideration actually passes from the person acquiring the asset to the person <Col N="972" /> who transferred it to him the former cannot be charged in the event of the vendor leaving unpaid any or all of the capital gains tax charged on the transaction.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in this subparagraph to secure that where gifts are made to or for donees the rules in the paragraph are to apply with appropriate modifications and subject to any necessary apportionments. In such circumstances separate charges may be made on each donee in respect of any tax left unpaid by the donor.  For this purpose the tax attaching to the asset is to be apportioned between the donees on the basis of their respective proportions of the gift.  The use of these terms &ldquo;necessary modifications&rdquo; means that where throughout the paragraph there is need to refer to a donee being assessed in the name of a donor the reference may be read as relating to a donee in respect of his joint share of the tax unpaid.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (7) establishes that the terms &ldquo;old asset&rdquo; and &ldquo;new asset&rdquo; as used in this paragraph have the same meanings as in section 28 in the sense that an old asset is one which is replaced and the capital gains tax on which is deferred under the roll-over provisions and a new asset is the asset acquired to replace the old one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I should have mentioned that this is substantially in response to a point which Deputy Colley very properly raised on Report Stage on an earlier section where he raised the question of the possibility in the event of a roll-over situation or a gift situation the persons liable to the tax putting themselves in such a situation that they would not have the means to pay the tax, whenever the tax was assessed.  On that count, we want to ensure that if a donor deprives himself of an asset or the proceeds of an asset the Revenue Commissioners may collect his tax liability from the person who receives the assets or the proceeds of the assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice to know that the Minister pays such attention to my remarks that he, at this late stage, produces such a substantial amendment. Since we have been engaged on this all day and this was circulated only today I did not have an opportunity to make a detailed examination of the amendment and anything I am about to say now is subject to that. It may be that in the course of the discussion certain things will emerge in regard to the content of the amendment which I may want to question or oppose, but at the moment I want to speak merely in regard to the general proposition involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as that general proposition is concerned, I certainly do not, and nobody on this side of the House, <Col N="974" /> wants to see a situation in which there is a loophole for avoidance or, indeed, evasion by a taxpayer.  To the extent that this amendment may close a loophole we certainly would not oppose it, but there are implications in this which should be brought out and brought, particularly, to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that in the course of discussion on this Bill at various stages, we drew his attention to the fact that contrary to what was stated in the Government's White Paper he was making provision here for the application of capital gains tax to a transaction which would also be subject to gift tax although it had been specifically stated in the White Paper that this would not happen.</P>
    <P>The reason that the Minister gave for doing this was that if he failed to do it there would be a loophole left for avoidance.  I had an amendment on an earlier portion of the Bill, on the Report Stage, which sought to provide that where both capital gains tax and gift tax arose on the one transaction only one of them would be chargeable, that one being the one giving the greatest return to the Exchequer.  I suggested that in that case there could not really be a loophole because the liability was maintained and since the liability was whichever was the greater there was not a loophole being provided for people to use this in order to be made liable for a smaller tax than a higher tax.  The Minister, however, rejected this argument and relied largely in his rejection on the fact that gift tax was payable by the donee whereas the capital acquisitions tax was payable by the donor.  There would be two different persons liable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, with this amendment, thrown that argument out the door because what he is providing is that in certain circumstances the same person can be liable is respect of the same transaction for both capital gains tax and gift tax. These were precisely the grounds on which the Minister rejected the amendments we put forward. This amendment is now proposing <Col N="975" /> to apply both taxes in certain circumstances to the one person in respect of the one transaction.  That being so, surely it is not reasonable of the Minister to say still that both taxes should be applied?</P>
    <P>Surely there is now every reason for him to say: &ldquo;We can now adhere to what we said in the White Paper and we can apply one of them&rdquo;. He can even go further and accept the proposition that I put forward on the Report Stage, that the one to be payable was the bigger tax, the one that would give the greatest yield to the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Minister feels that this amendment is justified then I suggest that he should feel that the amendment that I put forward and which he rejected before was justified, and that the argument that we were dealing with two different parties no longer applies since he proposes now under this amendment to make the same person liable on the same transaction for both taxes.</P>
    <P>Subject, therefore, to the details of the amendment, which we will deal with in a moment, I want to put to the Minister the general proposition that if he considers this amendment justified, he should reconsider the amendment we put forward before.  He should not now have any difficulty in adhering to what the Government said it would do in the White Paper, that is to apply one or other of the taxes but not both. We have now pointed out to him a method by which no loophole will be provided and a method by which he can ensure that the larger tax will be paid.  Consequently, in the light of the principle involved in this amendment, I am asking the Minister, even at this stage, to reconsider the proposition that we put to him before on this and to implement now the statement made by the Government in the White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has made a very interesting observation on matters which are not pertinent to this particular amendment but to some issue which has already been determined by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But they were determined <Col N="976" /> in the absence of this amendment which the Minister will agree would have made quite a difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We are not imposing a tax upon the donee.  What we are doing is to make good the default of the donor who has passed on an asset <i>in toto</i> without paying capital gains tax on it.  Perhaps the donor, if he had to pay the tax, might not have passed on the asset <i>in toto</i>.  I will call the asset X, and the capital gains tax Y.  We are saying that if he passes on X <i>in toto</i> and fails to pay the capital gains tax, it is appropriate that the recipient should receive only X minus Y.  Therefore, if the tax is not paid within twelve months from the date the tax becomes payable&mdash;that is a long time in which the donor and donee can sort out their affairs&mdash;the donee may then be assessed up to two years from the date the tax became payable. But the assessment is charged in the name of the donor: it is the donor's tax; it is not the donee's tax.  The donee does not become liable.  It is the donor's tax <i>via</i> the donee who will have a right under subparagraph (4) to recover the money so paid by him from the donor.  It is a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>That is the reasonable answer to the reasonable observations of Deputy Colley.  I cannot contemplate any other way in which we can meet the point Deputy Colley previously made about the importance of ensuring that the person liable for capital gains tax does not avoid his liability by divesting himself of the means to pay the tax, by, for instance, disposing of the property to somebody else. If he does that he is committing, to use the phrase which may seem an emotive one, a fraud upon the Revenue. It would be wrong that such could occur and obviously it would be wrong also for the Legislature to create liability and fail to take a reasonable step to ensure that that liability will be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential part of the capital gains tax code is that the liability to pay the tax arises where the means to pay it is available and the means to pay the tax arises on the disposal of the property.  There may be several cases <Col N="977" /> I would imagine where gifts by the donor may specifically impose upon the donee the obligation to pay the donor's tax.  That is why subparagraph (4) reads the way it does, that the donee may recover the tax from the donor provided it is not one of the terms or conditions of the gift, that the donee should pay the tax.  If it were a term or condition of the gift, obviously it is only equitable that the donee should discharge that obligation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment that the Minister has put down is a formidable one in terms of length and complexity.  It is no harm to point out to the House what the effect of it is in practice.  If you take the most common sort of substantial gift that is made in this country, that is, the transfer by a father to a son of a farm, instead of being subject to no taxes of any kind on a transaction of that kind, the true position, as a result of this amendment and these two Bills is that a transaction of that kind, provided it is of a certain size, is subject to gift tax.  The son pays <Col N="978" /> gift tax provided it is beyond the threshold limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>£150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Leave a farm out of it.  In addition to paying that gift tax, even though no money of any description passes, the father, on giving the gift, becomes liable for tax at 26 per cent on whatever the gain is from the time he acquired the asset or 5th April, 1974, up to the time he disposes of it and that applies irrespective of the size unless the gain is under £500.  In addition, the son will pay stamp duty at 1 per cent which on a sizeable farm can be a very sizeable amount of money, which is often overlooked, and he has various other expenses in relation to a transfer of property which he has to meet.  On top of all those, as if that was not enough, we now have the position that if, in those circumstances, the father or whoever the donor might be, does not pay the capital gains tax on a gain which he made only on paper&mdash;in fact, which he did not even make on paper a purely imaginary gain&mdash;the person who took the gift is now liable for that tax in addition to the other taxes.  If the situation up to the present time could have been regarded by some people as complicated, it was only a fraction of the complication there will now be.  No donee is going to know how he stands until at least two years have elapsed from the time he got the gift.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one fortunate aspect of this particular tax is that it appears the tax is not a charge on the asset and therefore the donee could presumably deal with the property without proving payment of capital gains tax.  I hope that is so because, if he could not, it means property like this is tied up for at least two years from the time of the gift.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, the whole principle set out in relation to these capital taxes in the White Paper was that, on a gift, you paid gift tax but you did not pay capital gains tax.  The two were mutually exclusive, and rightly so. That was fair enough.  Whatever objection you might or might not have to the taxes themselves, in principle it was certainly vital that they <Col N="979" /> were mutually exclusive because, if they were not, you could and would have a very unfair situation.  Unfortunately, that was changed when the actual legislation was published a year, or thereabouts, after the White Paper. Gifts were made subject to capital gains tax.  The ordinary members of the public do not realise that.  If a farmer or anyone else gives a gift of some size to his son, or nephew, and it is a genuine outright gift, and no money at all passes on the transfer of that asset and you tell the donor he has to pay tax consisting of 26 per cent of what the Revenue Commissioners consider the asset increased in value either from the time he bought it, or acquired it, or from 5th April, 1974, to the date of disposal, he will look at you and say: &ldquo;That is mad; you could not be expected to pay that&rdquo;.  That is the attitude.  I have patiently tried to explain to people that by making certain transfers they were making themselves potentially liable for capital gains tax even though they had no capital gain.  This amendment not alone makes them liable for the capital gains tax but also makes the donee liable if the donor does not pay which will make donees think twice about whether or not they will accept particular gifts.  The donees in the short term about whom I would be particularly concerned are those who acquired a gift either since 28th February, 1974, when the capital acquisitions tax comes into operation, or since 5th April, 1974, when the capital gains tax comes into operation. I am sure there are hundreds of donees who in all good faith accepted gifts from that date and, remember, they accepted them on the basis of what was set out in the White Paper.  They were told specifically that they could be liable for only one tax or the other and could not be liable for both.  Now look at the position they are in.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments that the Minister put forward on earlier Stages of this Bill in relation to this point was that it was not really unfair to charge capital gains tax as well as gift tax because the donee paid the gift tax and the donor paid the capital gains tax.  He now comes along with this <Col N="980" /> last amendment of all to say that the donee shall be liable also for the capital gains tax.  Can people believe anything emanating from this Government? One can well excuse them for believing that they cannot.  They could not have been told more specifically in this famous White Paper, which took so long to get out and which was produced with such ceremony, that these two taxes were mutually exclusive.  That was breached 12 months later.  Now it is breached yet again.  The same man is now made liable for both taxes.  The joke of it all is in subparagraph (4) that the donee shall have the right to recover from the donor as a simple contract of comparable jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point that the reason they are bringing this in is because the man might have given everything away.  What good is sub-section (4) to the unfortunate donee who has taken the gift without ever seeing himself liable for this?  The Minister wants to ensure that donors do not divest themselves of all their assets to the detriment of the Revenue. He comes along and puts the liability for the tax on the donee and he gives the donee a right to recover from the donor in circumstances in which, on his own admission, the donee has no hope of recovering anything. If there were ever double standards we have an example of them here.  The whole thing is manipulated in such a way that the revenue can never lose.  No matter what happens the Revenue will get their pound of flesh but the unfortunate donee who has taken a gift, take particularly post 28th February, 1974, in all good faith because of what he saw written in black and white in a Government White Paper, now finds himself in the impossible position of being liable for capital gains tax even though he was very specifically told he would not be. He has no way of recovering from the person primarily liable and the proof that he has no way of recovering is in the fact that the Minister uses, as his excuse or pretext for bringing in this amendment, the fact that the donor has nothing to pay or to gain.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legal aspect of trying to sue a man who has nothing, <Col N="981" /> look at it from the human and family point of view.  Most donors are either fathers or uncles of the donees.  If a father or an uncle gives a son or nephew some substantial gift of property for nothing and finds himself in the position that he is unable to pay capital gains tax, which he considers totally unjust because he did not get a brass farthing in return, and he is expected to pay perhaps thousands of pounds because he made a gift for which he got no consideration at all, and he cannot pay that tax and the son, or nephew, or whoever is the donee pays it, does the Minister seriously suggest that that son or nephew should go along and sue, as it is put, in a court of competent jurisdiction his father or his uncle? Does the Minister not realise what the reaction of a father or an uncle who has just been a very generous donor will be to that kind of situation?  The first thing he will do is go in to his solicitor to see if he can break the gift and get back his property because he will regard the son, or nephew, or whoever it is, who sues him for this money as an ungrateful little so-and-so and he would be entitled to regard him as that.</P>
    <P>The issues do not seem to strike the Minister.  This lengthy amendment we are on now does not take account of the realities of human relationships. It is regrettable that we should have again here another example of this sort of double standard.  As long as the Revenue end of things is fixed up, and the Revenue can have a go at anyone and everyone, the others do not matter: let them do the best they can for themselves, but we will do nothing to help them.</P>
    <P>We had an example of it in the second last amendment we discussed here this evening, on the question of interest where the Revenue Commissioners, by virtue of the provisions of paragraph 11, as amended, of this Schedule, are entitled now to collect 13 per cent of the purchase price of certain properties, even though they may be aware that the capital gains tax, if any, involved may be only a fraction of that.  They may hold that money, as we pointed out earlier, for <Col N="982" /> quite a long time, perhaps six to 12 months and then repay the balance to the vendor concerned, but he gets no interest.  On the other hand, if the money was due to the Revenue Commissioners, that man, as well as having to pay it, would have to pay 18 per cent per annum interest on it.  Surely that is a double standard.  Here we have it again in quite an extraordinary fashion.  The principle of capital taxation in other countries, as I understand it, is that you cannot have double taxation of this kind and that gifts, as set out in the White Paper, very properly, are not subjected to capital gains tax for the very reason that there is no gain.</P>
    <P>We discussed earlier in this Bill the question of illusory gains, paper gains, on sales as a result of inflation but at least, even if there was no real gain, there was cash there to pay the tax. The people of this country do not realise that, if you give a gift now to someone, you are liable to pay capital gains tax on it, even though you did not get one brass halfpenny for it. Above all, what they do not realise in relation to this amendment, which was circulated only today, is that the donee of the gift, as well as paying gift tax, is now liable for capital gains tax and, presumably, will have to pay it.  In most cases of the sort of gifts that are involved here, when the gift is given, the donor divests himself to all intents and purposes of all his property.  That is the usual practice in Ireland.  He may retain a small house or something of that kind, but the usual practice is that to all intents and purposes he divests himself of all his property.</P>
    <P>To charge tax on a gift is bad enough, but to charge the donee with it is indefensible, when he is already subjected to gift tax.  We are told this today on 8th July, 1975, when on 28th February, 1974, with great ceremony the whole country was told most specifically that in no circumstances would these two taxes be payable at the same time on the same property.  Perhaps the Minister for Defence was right after all when he came into this House with one of his usual blustering outbursts and informed the House and country that the White Paper, which he waved <Col N="983" /> above his head, was not the Government's thinking at all; that it was something that was got out by civil servants; and that people were going around to Fianna Fáil cumann meetings telling the public that it had something to do with the Government when, in fact, everyone knew it had not, and that a crowd of civil servants got it up.  Perhaps he was right after all.</P>
    <P>One thinks he might be right because now, 16 months after the publication of that White Paper, we have things being done which totally fly in the face of the principles set out in that White Paper.  In particular I have in mind, not the people who will make their gifts as and from tomorrow morning, if they become aware of the provisions of amendment No. 41, which they probably will not, anyway, for quite some time, but people who have made gifts and accepted gifts since 28th February, 1974, in all good faith, because something was set out in a Government White Paper in black and white.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister or anyone else be seriously surprised that the word of this Government is doubted?  Surely this is the experience which foreign industrialists have been suffering over the past year or two being translated to our own people.  I am sure that people who are so unfairly caught as a result of all these changes of mind by the Government can only conclude that any future statements by the Government are as unworthy of belief as the statements contained in the White Paper of 28th February, 1974.</P>
    <P>So far as the details of this very long paragraph are concerned, it strikes me that the word &ldquo;securing&rdquo; in the fourth last line of subparagraph (1) is wrong, and that it should be &ldquo;accruing&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;securing&rdquo; because I do not think it makes sense otherwise.  In subparagraph (2) there seems to be an indication&mdash;it is not easy to follow the precise meaning of the subparagraph&mdash; that there could be a double charge on the donee's capital gains tax because it says that the donee may in addition to being assessed and charged under subparagraph (1) in respect of the new asset, <Col N="984" /> be assessed and charged as if the chargeable gain on the disposal of the old asset were a chargeable gain on the disposal of a new asset, the capital gains tax in respect of which was not paid within 12 months from the date on which the tax had become payable.</P>
    <P>That is ambiguous.  It can be read either way.  I do not necessarily say that there is a double charge but many people on first reading it, would regard it as a double charge.  Also it is not subject to the proviso in subparagraph (1) that the assessment must be made on the donee within two years from the date on which the tax became payable.  Why that is left out of subparagraph (2) even though it is in subparagraph (1), I am not clear. There may be an explanation for it. There are a number of other details I will come back to on the later sub-paragraphs. For the time being I will confine myself to those points.</P>

      <P>This amendment strikes one as not only being extraordinarily late but almost having the appearance of being an emergency addition.  It is also, peculiarly, a purple patch, if you like, or peculiarly different in its purpose from the remainder of the Bill.  Having a curious mind, I wondered what was happening.  I would like to ask the Minister is he bringing in this amendment at this late stage because he is not pressing the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, and between the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill tax not being passed and the Capital Gains Tax Bill being passed, there may be a loophole for spurious gifts that would not be caught anyway. I am asking that question because a great deal of consideration was given to this Bill on Report Stage, and amendments were made.  We have frequently complimented the Minister on meeting points which were made. Indeed, there are some points here which were raised on Committee Stage.  I am puzzled as to why the amendment is late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me back to something which I did not plead before the Minister.  When the Minister for Lands was deputising for him on <Col N="985" /> the Wealth Tax Bill, I made the case which I do not intend to repeat&mdash; it is on the record&mdash;that these acts were <i>in pari materia</i>.  If I wanted anything to substantiate that argument it is the peculiar wording and the way in which this amendment appears.  If, for instance, the Minister had wished to confine the substance of this amendment&mdash;and this is without prejudice to the point made by Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley&mdash;to the case where gifts were given in order to avoid capital gains, then he could have phrased it by relating it to market value.  He could have called it a gift by another name, a device well known to draftsmen when they wish to keep things separate.</P>
    <P>The Minister uses the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; here and he must have regard in this amendment to the fact that there is a Bill before the House which, admittedly, has not reached its Committee Stage, in which gifts are specifically dealt with and which purports to charge gifts with a tax in the hands of the donee.  That much the Minister accepted in his opening statement, that gifts will be taxable.  I want to stress this amendment in its legal background as distinct from its moral, social, political and, generally, equitable background, in which my colleagues have stressed it, which, of course, should be the primary concern of Parliament.  Here we have two Bills in Parliament, one on capital gains tax and one imposing a gift tax.  If there was any substance in what the Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, said in trying to keep them apart, the Minister&mdash;if I may make a pun&mdash;has given me a gift in this amendment for the purpose of raising my pulse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In that situation <Col N="986" />&mdash;I am looking at it again from the legal point of view, whereas Deputy O'Malley is quite technical in his grasp from the legal point of view, that it does not tax the assets.  It does because, nicely tucked away, not only does it cover a gift but it effectively covers an inheritance.  Subparagraph 5 states:</P>
      <P>References in this paragraph to a donor include, in the case of an individual who has died, references to his personal representatives.</P>
      <P>Here we have an amendment in the Capital Gains Bill cutting across and linking up with the Capital Acquisitions Bill which is also before the House.  This clearly seems to be the case that, if any gift is made <i>inter vivos</i> or by devolution, or what is equivalent to a gift, that is, a disposition, a testamentary in succession, in any of those cases it will now be considered, subject to the thresholds which I shall come to in a moment, that the donee, testator or deceased generally&mdash;as the case may be&mdash;is on the one hand taxable for capital gains.  Whether the donee of a gift <i>inter vivos</i> or, as the successor indicates a disposal on death&mdash;in the hands of the personal representative &mdash;the legatee on a devolution, they are liable for inheritance tax or gift tax.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, these are exactly in the same way as they were formerly indicated in the old death duties. Under the law before the Finance Act, death duties were payable in respect of gifts given within a certain length of time.  Now, whether it is a gift or whether it is a legacy that is a succession&mdash;voluntarily under a will or involuntarily in the due process of law&mdash;these will be subject to a gift tax.  This will be modified essentially only by the thresholds.  On the other hand, the donor, whether he is the donor giving away <i>inter vivos</i> or whether he is the testator or the person dying intestate whose property passes, will be liable for capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the first contradiction with the White Paper which Deputy O'Malley has rightly emphasised. <Col N="987" /> There you have a double taxation on the one gift.  Now the Minister comes in and says that that double taxation on the gift will attach to the donee. He does not say it straight out &ldquo;in the following assets&rdquo;, but he might as well have said so, thereby doing away with the last vestige of reality in his repeal of death duties in the Finance Act.</P>
    <P>If the liability is to follow in that way, there is not only the double taxation but there is a double taxation on the donee, because in the case of a genuine gift, the whole of the interest is passed to the donee&mdash;that is what makes it a gift.  The same applies in a testamentary or intestate concession. Here we have the case, whether it is the donee or the legatee who will carry two taxes, even though nominally&mdash;in contemplation of law, as Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out &mdash;this reference in paragraph 4 is a sham in such cases.</P>
    <P>Let us take an example to illustrate the point.  I do not regard a farm in the same way as Deputy O'Malley, who quoted it because it is a bad example from the point of view of showing what can happen.  I am not going to appeal only to the argument of inflation though this will come into it.  The Minister should have regard to social consequences when the policy in Europe has been towards larger units so that they will be economically viable.  In those circumstances, it is not difficult to conceive of a farm of land which would be well above the threshold of £150,000 without taking inflation into account.  If you take inflation into account, a suburban house will soon be beyond the limit unless a person is actually dwelling in it and exempted <i>per se</i>.  Only today I was speaking to somebody who apprehended that this kind of thing could happen in regard to capital gains.  He did not foresee that the linking with the capital acquisitions and the gift tax would come under this amendment.</P>
    <P>The case I am referring to is the case of a man who acquired a fairly substantial acreage of pretty poor land and who had invested a life-time in <Col N="988" /> the improvement of that land.  I know there will be other factors that will minimise my argument but the essential point is that he improves the land. The same argument can apply to items other than land as Deputy O'Malley pointed out.  The people will understand it if it is put simply in terms of land, always admitting the particular qualifications that occur in the two Acts in regard to agricultural land.  But, for the purposes of argument, we will say that the actual improvement of the asset has enhanced it.  Couple that with inflation and it may well mean that there is a substantial tax in the category of capital gains to be accounted for if such a tax is to attach.  The rate will be 26 per cent on the gain.</P>
    <P>On the other side, there is the tax in the hands of the recipient&mdash;the donee or the legatee.  Under the next Bill a tax will be paid there, again accepting the thresholds.  The net result is a double taxation in the hands of the donee because he will be liable; you are going to tax the asset.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether that is altogether fair.  As Deputy Colley said&mdash; I want to enter this <i>caveat</i> in the argument I am advancing&mdash;we have not had an opportunity of doing a detailed comparison with the two Bills on this amendment.  I am prepared to find unforeseen or unexpected points we have not made allowances for.  It does not get away from the basic point that the donee will be carrying the double tax in the last analysis in all cases of a genuine gift or succession. It appears to me that included in the case of an individual who has died is reference to his personal representative. The thing can quite possibly, because of that, get in on the legatee as I have said.</P>
    <P>The question of how far it can catch a testator and a legatee directly I leave open.  We are now on the question of tying up these two assets. Paragraph 5 refers to the donor and his personal representative only.  However, in essence, capital gains which would accrue in respect of the donor in any way would be carried on by this and I should like the Minister to reassure me that the legatee in the <Col N="989" /> case of a testamentary disposition or in the case of an intestacy is not in any way affected by this.  If he assures me of that, then he has not covered himself for capital gains in a case that would be equitably in the same boat.  May I ask the Minister why if I am wrong in thinking that possibly not only is a gift <i>inter vivos</i> taken in this way with double taxation and the donee accountable, if that is so, why should it be possible to avoid that situation by a testamentary disposition if it does not capture a testamentary disposition?  If that is the situation, what about your social policy we heard all the talk about, about encouraging gifts.</P>
    <P>We have a provision in one of the Acts about retiring at 55.  I make these points in order to show the confusion which it appears to me can come out of this amendment.  The Minister might have been quite right to accuse me of contradiction or to accuse me of being under a mistaken interpretation about paragraph (5) when, for the simplicity of my argument, I bracketed testamentary disposition and devolution on death generally with gifts <i>inter vivos</i> which are captured by this amendment.  If I am wrong I can see very well that that argument could be thrown back at me on the face of these Bills.  I would not accept the arguments without a very detailed examination, which we have not had the opportunity of making.  If that is thrown back on me then I say to the Minister: &ldquo;What about the loopholes?  If you are going to avoid capital gains by testamentary disposition, what will the social effects of that be and how does that fit in with the protestations made earlier?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am not saying these things in order to score points or to be unhelpful. In a nutshell what I want to ask the Minister is what is the reason for this late addition?  Why the tie-up in phraseology about the word &ldquo;gift&rdquo;? If there was ever doubt about two Bills being <i>in pari materia</i> this section goes a long way to copperfasten the arugment of the people who say they are <i>in pari materia</i>.  The Minister for Lands ably argued that that was something <Col N="990" /> not to be desired from his point of view and presumably from the Minister's point of view.  He fought strenuously to reject it.</P>
    <P>Why does this come in at this late hour?  As I said in the beginning I could only see it as an emergency measure to block the possibility of a loophole arising from the fact that the Capital Gains Tax Bill will be passed&mdash;we have been promised that tonight&mdash;and will become law long before the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill which the Minister has not ordered.  There is a hiatus here.  If this is intended to provide for that I would sympathise with the Minister in what he is doing but I would also point out that it will lead to possible anomalies. It certainly will lead to a situation of disquiet and resentment for two reasons.  I do not want to labour again the point of the White Paper but we must remember the Government and the Minister's credibility hangs to some extent on such points.</P>
    <P>I am not thinking about the substantial sums that the Revenue Commissioners may get or may lose on this transaction.  I am thinking of the transactions that may even be within the threshold and may involve only trivial payments or no payments at all because of their triviality but which, because of the administrative complications and annoyance being brought in by this type of legislation will further stir social unrest amongst the agricultural and small property community.  That is not good for our national morale.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister a simple question.  Why does he have to bring in this?  He talked about the equity of it.  He talked about the gifts being <i>pro tanto</i> enhanced by the capital gains not being paid on it.  He made that point a couple of times and he said it would be equitable so to do it in the hands of the donee.</P>
    <P>That raises a further complication. If you take that argument of the Minister's you immediately ask yourself the question: &ldquo;What is the value of the gift?&rdquo;  Is the gift to be assessed on what I might call its gross value or is it to be assessed on its value less <Col N="991" /> the capital gains?  What is the Minister's argument here?  The Minister argues, if I understand him rightly, that it would be, as a result of capital gains not being paid by the donor, who divested himself of the asset, that the asset would have been less <i>pro tanto</i> if the capital gains had been paid.</P>
    <P>I assume that I am right but I may be wrong.  If that is so what is the value of the gift?  Is the Minister going to tax the gift in the hands of the donee for gift tax on the basis of the gross value of the asset without deduction of the capital gains?  Is the Minister going to tax it on the deduction of the capital gains?  If he takes the gift and values the gift tax on the gross value and takes the capital gains on the gain, taking the gross as presumably the market value, then not only has he double taxation in it but he is taxing both at the highest level.  The Minister's argument that it is equitable to charge the donee falls to the ground unless he provides that the value of the gift, for the purposes of gift tax, will be the value less the capital gains.</P>
    <P>We can see the morass into which the Minister is now plunging himself with this amendment.  Is it a case, as I suspect, that it is a last minute effort to close a loophole that would occur through the accident of business passing through the House?  I would join the Minister in closing loopholes of that nature, let there be no doubt about that.  We do not want to see loopholes. We want to help the Minister here.  Is this not something that is plunging us not only into a morass but which will bedevil the approach to the other Bill, which the Minister has now patently accepted as part of the same code?  I think that any court would accept it <i>in pari materia.</i></P>

I doubt if ever in the long history of parliamentary democracy so much time was ever involved in attempts to preserve the tax-free privileges of the few.  The discussion on this last amendment on Report Stage is a perfect illustration of this.  Whom are we talking about? We are talking about people who may be giving gifts and not paying tax at the time of disposal.  If a farmer or businessman of 55 years or upwards <Col N="993" /> is giving his farm or business worth £150,000 to his son there is no question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of a capital gains tax.  If it is worth more than £150,000 then the capital gains tax may be levied to half the excess.  Such people are comparatively few.  If there is to be a liability to capital gains tax it must surely be paid by somebody, preferably by those best able to pay.</P>

      <P>The bigger the property the better is a person able to pay.  The liability to pay the tax lies on the donor not on the donee.  The person who held the asset and who, during the period of holding it has made a capital gain is liable.  We seek to have the payment made by that person, not by any other.  There is no question of a double liability to capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax on one person.</P>
      <P>Let us go outside the farm or the business which is covered by sections 26 and 27 of this Bill and contemplate a gift of any kind by a father to one of his children.  Under capital acquisitions tax such gift can be of a value up to £150,000 per child. Many a person would think we were stone mad to even call a system of not taxing gifts of that size to a child, a capital acquisitions tax.  It is generous by any measure that you would apply and if there has been criticism of a capital acquisitions tax of any volume it has come mainly from people who are concerned about the very high levels of exemption which have been granted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can talk about social justice and we can deal very clearly with the social justice of this amendment.  This amendment was tabled because Deputy Colley was concerned that if there was a capital gains tax, there would be no easy means of avoiding the tax by any person liable to it, by divesting himself of the means with which to pay the tax.  I am sure Deputy Colley has not changed his attitude on that vital matter since we discussed this matter last Thursday.  If Deputy Colley is of that view he must, at least, agree to the objective of this amendment which is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which is to pursue-I hope people will not take offence at that word; I do not mean it in any offensive way-the person who has received the means with which the person liable for the tax ought to have paid the tax.  It seems a reasonable thing to do. It seems to be the proper thing to do, the socially just thing to do.  I cannot think of any better thing to do.  That does not say there is anything defective about this; it seems, by any approach to the objective the only sensible and fair way in which to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the donor retains the means to pay the tax then there would be no pursuit of the donee; the tax would have been recovered from the donor. But, if within 12 months of the donor becoming liable for the tax the donor has not paid then the Revenue Commissioners will have the right&mdash;and it is only correct that they should have &mdash;to make an assessment in the name <Col N="995" /> of the donor on the donee.  Then the donee would be obliged to pay the donor's tax and he will have the right to recover it from the donor.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley makes the point: what use is that right if the donor has divested himself of the means with which to pay it?  That is the only reason why the Revenue Commissioners pursue the donee&mdash;because the donor has divested himself of the means.  Yes, that is true.  But where are the means?  The means are with the donee.  The donee has received the means from the donor who ought to have used those means in order to pay the tax.  Surely the proper thing to do is to go to the person who has been conferred with the assets to pay this tax by reason of receipt of the gift from the donor.  Deputy de Valera said that a gift would be reduced by the amount of tax liability.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it is relevant and does affect the issue here.  If a donor makes a gift to a donee and makes the donee liable for payment of the tax, then the value of the gift will be gift less tax.  If, however, a donor makes a gift, failing to pay the tax and failing to make the donee liable to pay the tax, we will have to resort to the legislation proposed in amendment No. 41 and then the gift will be the gross gift.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the case of a person who has failed to discharge tax liability and, by reason of his failure, somebody else has got to pay.  It is clear that somebody else has a greater gift.  If the only asset the donor has is given away in full, obviously somebody else has received a greater gift by reason of the donor not paying the tax.  Nobody can dispute that.  There is a perfectly easy way of ensuring that the tax liability is met by the donor providing that the donee will pay the tax.  It would be wrong to provide that the donee should be relieved, as it were, as a consequence of the incidence of the two taxes.  The two taxes are payable by different people.</P>

That would be equitable.  Have I made the point clear?</P>

Now he should have paid gift tax on only £450,000.  Could the difference be set off?  Should he get credit?

We have allowed the freest possible debate.  I value the contribution which Parliament can make to the improvement of legislation.

It raises the dignity and the value of the House to accept the value of such debate.

      <P>I am not implying any criticism of the Chair but we have often strayed from the specifics to generalities.  I want to emphasise that there is no question of a liability to capital gains tax on death: death is not an occasion of charge to capital gains tax.  What we are dealing with in this particular paragraph is the right of a donee who has to pay the donor's capital gains tax arising out of an inter vivos gift to collect from the personal representative of the donor, if the donor has died, but it is not a question of endeavouring to recover capital gains tax from an inheritance.  I can understand how reference to death and personal representatives in this particular paragraph could have led Deputies into thinking inheritance might be involved but, on a closer reading of the paragraph, they will see that is not visualised.</P>

      <P>I should like to say to the Minister, and naturally with some vehemence, that I think we have improved the Bill.  I accept what the Minister says but I also admit I was suspicious enough to seek for a motive for bringing in this amendment.  I accept what the Minister says his purpose was in this matter.  Nevertheless I should like him to consider the two points I made. One was about the valuation of the <Col N="999" /> gift and I do not think it is quite as simple as the Minister dismissed it as being.</P>
      <P>I made my case originally to bring out the homogenity of policy here.  If it is not so, then it seems to me that in charging capital gains tax on a gift <i>inter vivos</i> and not charging it on a disposition, seeing that the value of the asset is the same in both cases, shows a lack of logic, and while I cannot say how it would make a tax loophole, it would certainly discourage gifts <i>inter vivos</i>.  The Minister may be right as regards the few who are concerned.  My last point was that the nuisance value of it might be small and affect a certain class of person.  I am not talking about the rich.  The Minister likes to tax us with protecting the rich.  It is hardly fair but in the thrust of politics it is a comment I can understand the Minister making.  The nuisance value of this, the administrative cost to the community, the social disturbance to a class where you want stability, have also to be taken into account.</P>

      <P>When this Bill was first introduced, I asked the Minister at what stage would capital gains become chargeable and he said on disposal of assets.  I was simple enough to conclude that this meant you had to sell an asset before a capital gain could arise.  I agree with the amendment if its purpose is to corner anybody who is trying to evade a just and legitimate tax.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  He said that tax is not chargeable in the case of an individual, be he a farmer or businessman, up to a threshold of £150,000 if that individual has reached the age of 55 years.  Suppose he had not reached that age.  Suppose a farmer wants to transfer his farm to his son.  That becomes a disposal of an asset and a taxable gain is chargeable on the difference between the original value and the value at the time of the transfer.  Is that not correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>As I assess that, it is a totally different situation and that <Col N="1000" /> is why I asked the Minister to talk not about generosity or concessions but about social justice.  Suppose a farmer has a farm which was valued originally at £10,000 and he decides, for one reason or another, before he reaches the age of 55 years to transfer it to his son.  The value of the farm at that stage is £40,000.  The capital gains tax is at 26 per cent on the difference which is £30,000.  That boils down to a tax of £7,800.  The donor, who is the farmer, is responsible for paying that £7,800.  He may not have it.  The donee, the son, is authorised under this amendment to sue the father for the £7,800.</P>
      <P>The Minister is talking about the small number of people involved and I agree with him.  Everybody on this side of the House has agreed with the principle of getting after tax evasion, of dealing with the situation where individuals are very wealthy.  I have said before that the Minister, in approaching these problems, is obsessed with the evaders, the tax dodgers but he is overlooking what amount to fundamental principles in relation to people.  We on this side of the House are not talking about great wealth.  We are talking about the means of livelihood.  The Minister is acting against good social interests, unless he is prepared to amend his amendment to his amendment.</P>
      <P>A farmer may be ill.  A businessman may have run into ill-health from overworking as many people running small industries do and, perhaps, having to pay income tax, and so on, and it may be necessary to make a transfer.  It may be necessary to unload what can amount in some cases to a liability. The Minister has provided no means whereby that can be done.  I agree with the earlier change the Minister brought in of allowing an individual to be not chargeable for capital gains if he is 55 years or over.  There are situations where the Revenue Commissioners must go after the tax which are not in line with good social principles. This is where some of us on this side differ from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned earlier that the Opposition would not agree to take the Bills in Select Committee.  It is <Col N="1001" /> a good thing that the Opposition will not agree to take Bills like this in Committee.  People should know what the objects of tax Bills may be.  I wonder, if these Bills were being taken in Committee, whether the Minister might have been able to listen more seriously to reasonable arguments.  Perhaps outside the glare of the publicity of this House he might have been.  With some exceptions he has not displayed any great desire to listen to fundamental arguments which have to do with what is concerning most of us on this side of the House, that is, that in this community we must encourage industry, enterprise, initiative and energy.  If we discourage effort amongst those who are energetic, the community suffers because wealth will not be created. If a community fails to encourage those who have drive, the energy, initiative and the confidence to create wealth, then you have a poorer community.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment, which presumably is to prevent some wealthy person who may use the device of transferring property as a means of avoiding capital gains tax, can be a good one, but it can also be a law which is being operated against the general interests of the type of community we have where we want to encourage industry, we want to encourage people to create wealth.  We want to discourage the attitude which some of us maintain that some of these Bills will encourage, that is, that you say: &ldquo;What is the use?  Flog your assets.  Spend all you can and enjoy yourself, because if you do not, they are going to take it from you.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the feelings that are being created among our people.  What is being said is that the danger in these tax Bills is that home industry will be discouraged; that people will conclude it is better to be working for some international cartel which will not, in effect, be subject to these kinds of taxes or to many of them, anyway.</P>
    <P>In connection with the farm side of it, if this amendment is applied in the way I have described, then it can only have the effect of driving people off the land.  Remember, the Minister and <Col N="1002" /> other members of the Government 29 or 30 months ago said there would be no more death duties.  Once the members of the present Coalition were elected they promised that death duties would be at an end.</P>
    <P>What is this capital gains tax measure in the kind of example I have given except a tax on a disposable asset, once it has been transferred? It has not been sold; it can be passed to a son or a daughter by a farmer or by a businessman.  It becomes taxable at 26 per cent of the notional capital gain, including an inflationary gain.  That is an example of what I mean when I talk about having a social concept in legislation.</P>

      <P>We have just had from Deputy Brugha&mdash;I am sure he will not mind me saying this&mdash;an excellent Second Stage speech.  I might even call it a Fifth Stage speech because he is talking about some things that are not in the Bill. He has cut the discussion on the amendment comparatively short.  I had hoped that contributions could be related to it.  If anybody has any worries about it I should be only too happy to answer them.</P>
      <P>I would again remind the House that all we are doing here is ensuring a method by which a donor will not avoid paying tax to which he is liable by denuding himself&mdash;to use Deputy Colley's words&mdash;of the means of paying it.  That is all, and I do not think the Opposition are challenging that, but they may query the way in which it is being done.  I would be interested to know if they have any better way of collecting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am frequently amused at the line the Minister takes on a thing like this.  He said something, when he spoke before on this amendment, which he had said earlier in this debate.  He said specifically in relation to this amendment that one had seen here a demonstration from this side of the House of tremendous concern to protect the interests of the wealthy few.  They are the words he used.  He used this phrase before in relation to the very <Col N="1003" /> point we are raising on this amendment, completely oblivious of the fact that he and his colleagues issued a white paper which proposed that there would be, in a case such as we are dealing with here, only one tax&mdash; not capital gains tax and a capital acquisitions tax.  That is what the Minister and his colleagues proposed in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>I wonder were they then trying to protect the interests of the wealthy few.  I wonder even more about that when I find that subsequent to that, as the Minister says, they introduced various other concessions and advantages. For whom?  The wealthy few, according to the Minister.  We have reached the stage in this debate when the Minister should give up that nonsense and let us recognise the fact that what we are trying to do here is to get as effective and workable a Bill on capital gains tax as we can.</P>
      <P>In regard to this amendment, the Minister points out, rightly I believe, that there is a possible loophole which I pointed out as confirmation of the fact that on this side of the House we have been anxious to try to ensure an effective and workable capital gains tax.  We are anxious as far as possible to close loopholes, not at the cost of riding roughshod over the rights of all the citizens of this country but at the cost of using a great deal of thought and ingenuity in ensuring that loopholes were closed without riding roughshod over the rights of individual citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore the objective of this amendment is not only acceptable to us but, as the Minister says, was suggested by us.  That is one thing.  It is another thing to say that because of that we have a responsibility for the full content of the Minister's amendment. Of course we have not got that. Even more important&mdash;and I raised this point at the beginning and I am going to conclude on it&mdash;is that we sought very hard to get the Government to implement what they said they would do in the White Paper; that they would not apply to the one transaction both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.  We sought to do that not just because the Government <Col N="1004" /> said they would not, but because we believe it is right.  We tried various amendments and the Minister rejected them, first of all because he said there would be a loophole created if he did not do this.  Then we pointed out a way by which the loophole could be closed and one could still do what the Government said they would do, and what we believed is right.  The Minister did not accept that one because he said there were two parties involved, the donor and the donee.  Now we have an amendment which, however laudable its purpose, effectively in certain circumstances makes the one party liable for the two taxes on the one transaction.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the donee is simply being made to pay the donor's tax but so far as he is concerned he is being made liable to pay two taxes on the one transaction.  That is the reality of the situation.  In those circumstances, in our view, there is no excuse for the Minister persisting, as he has done, in refusing to do what the Government said they would do in the White Paper, and which we have consistently urged the Government to do.</P>
    <P>As evidence of the manner in which the Minister is prepared to change the argument around to suit himself, he argued in favour of this amendment that equity required it because if somebody received a gift on which capital gains tax which should have been paid was not paid, he was presumed to have received more than he would have received if capital gains tax had been paid.  But when that argument was reversed and when Deputy de Valera put the question to him regarding the treatment of such a matter under capital acquisition he said: &ldquo;No, no, in that case we look at it the other way.  We will say: No, no, it is worth the gross amount and we will tax it on that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned the object of this amendment is acceptable but the consequences that flow from it are clear in our view and oblige the Minister to accept the approach we have put to him consistently through the Bill on this question of subjecting one transaction to two <Col N="1005" /> forms of tax.  The Minister has refused to do that.  The consequences are clear and for that reason, in order to record our consistent adherence to this principle, which the Government enunciated in the White Paper, we do not propose to support the amendment.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Capital Gains Tax, Bill, 1974: Fifth Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to observe that Dáil Éireann is now being asked to pass a taxation Bill of very great significance, perhaps the most significant taxation Bill the House has ever been asked to consider. It is one which, for the first time in our history, will be bringing capital gains within the taxation system.  It will, as a consequence, confer a very significant improvement on the equity of the whole taxation system and will also prevent the kind of avoidance which results at present from persons investing in non-income producing assets which have very high expectations of capital gains and have in the past conferred very considerable capital gains which have been totally tax free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the very substantial capital gains which have been made tax free, an immense sense of frustration and impatience has developed amongst the general body of <Col N="1009" /> taxpayers, the majority of whom are obliged to pay income tax because they receive their income in regular instalments.  Such people have understandably found it difficult to understand why people of much greater means should have been able to make substantial profits without payment of tax at all.  The capital gains tax cures that indefensible situation.</P>
    <P>By passing capital gains taxation, by introducing capital gains tax in Ireland we are now in a position to join in the European Community as a society which has an equitable tax system.  Until the Bill becomes law, when it is passed through Seanad Éireann, we alone among the nine member countries of the European Community will not have any capital gains tax.  Surely it must be a matter for serious consideration on our part as to why we have failed to institute what many other countries found to be necessary as an essential part of their taxation system.  Some of the capital gains taxes which exist in Europe have existed since the beginning of this century and it seems to me to have been a serious omission on our part that we did not move before now to introduce a system of capital gains taxation.</P>
    <P>As we are introducing a capital gains taxation system we are also ensuring that Ireland will continue to have an advantage for investors over any other country on the Continent. The rate of capital gains tax which will be applied here, of 26 per cent, is less than the capital gains tax applicable in any of our European Economic Community neighbours.  In several countries the rate of capital gains tax is equivalent to the income tax rate which, of course, can operate at rates much higher than the 26 per cent level applied here.  The Government have chosen these rates and granted exemptions from thresholds and they are unique by comparison with our sister countries in the Community because of a desire to preserve here an edge of advantage for investors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply setting the Bill in its proper context and I think it is relevant to consider it in its international context.  Apart from the countries of the EEC most of the comparable countries in the world have capital gains taxes.  Certainly every comparable country in the Northern Hemisphere has.  The only exceptions I have found are Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is exempting private homes, and that is also a unique exemption. The majority of wealth in our community is in fact represented by the private home, and the private home <Col N="1011" /> represents the majority of wealth.  It represents a significant part of the capital holdings or savings of most people in our community but they are not being called upon to pay because of the Government's desire to encourage the family as an essential unit of our society.  That exemption has been given in respect of the principal private residence.  Very generous exemptions have also been given, which are again unique by any international standards, in respect of the family business or farm because of our conviction that the family income earning unit should be preserved and not broken up as it has so often been in the past by virtue of the operation of estate duties.</P>
    <P>We have also provided that moveable assets of up to £2,000 in value are also exempt.  So are wasting assets. We are not suggesting that is the beall, the beginning and the end-all of all capital taxation.  We anticipate that, in the light of experience, there will be an opportunity to tailor and trim the system to Irish requirements.</P>
    <P>Even if we were to draft a Bill perfect in all respects to meet the requirements of 1975, we would, in humility, be convinced, as we are convinced, that in the changing circumstances of modern society, which changes very rapidly, alterations in the law would be required.  We are satisfied that the Bill was drafted with very great care.  It was debated in very great detail, with care and sincerity by the House.  It is a good Bill; it is bound to ensure that the gains which should be charged in our society will be charged and the gains that are made on modest holdings of property will not be called upon to pay.</P>
    <P>Fundamental to our approach to capital gains tax in every section in the Bill is that liability to pay the tax will not arise unless and until there is a disposal.  There will be no burden on people, as occurred under estate duties for instance, to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
