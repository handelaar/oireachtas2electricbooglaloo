    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was explaining to the House the impact which section 2 of this Bill has had on industry since it was introduced and also the impact which the Bill in general is having and will have. There is no incentive for persons with capital to invest in ailing industries or for persons with money to expand <Col N="228" /> and improve their industries.  Industrialists who might now plan to expand and provide additional or improved plant and equipment in order to meet demands in the home and foreign markets in respect of quality and quantity and to create employment, will be very slow to take such progressive steps because they know that even in lean periods they will be taxed at the rate of 1 per cent on the market value of their assets.</P>
      <P>I believe there are people who, were it not for this wealth tax, would assist the footwear and textile industries and would inject the necessary capital to get these industries back to where they were a few years ago.  We must bear in mind that it is the assets that are taxable.  Whether business is viable or not, functioning or not, whether it shows a profit or not in any year the owner is liable for 1 per cent on the net market value.  There is no guarantee that this 1 per cent will not be increased to 2 per cent by a simple statement from the Minister for Finance.  I could see some sense in a capital gains tax system directed against speculators but none in such a system directed against persons who, by their own initiative, business acumen and hard work have built up assets in an industry, created numerous jobs and generally helped the welfare of the State.  I cannot see why these people should be taxed under a capital gains tax system or under a wealth tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money has been moving rapidly out of the country ever since the Government announced its intention to bring in this Bill, and particularly since the effect of section 2 of this Bill became widely known.  It is paracticaly impossible for people to get bank loans now. The public know this.  The reason for the banks not having money is that it is being taken out of the country by devious means.  Rather than hustling through this Bill the Government would be better employed in devising ways and means of preventing this flow of money from the country.  There is a grave shortage of money for agriculture as well as for housing and sanitary services, for roads and for the development of industrial projects.  Every <Col N="229" /> section of the community will be affected adversely if this section is implemented but none will suffer more than the hotel industry.  A clear picture of their plight is painted on the front page of this morning's <i>Irish Independent.</i> The vast majority of hotels are being operated on a non-profit basis at present.  This is true, in particular, of the family or the ordinary-sized business. In the good years of the sixties the hoteliers ploughed back their profits into the development of their concerns &mdash;into building additional accommodation and improving facilities and amenities.  Now, when they are in serious difficulty the Government are proposing to tax them at a rate of 1 per cent per annum on the value of their hotels and we know that, because of the extra bedrooms and the additional facilities that hoteliers provided during the booming days of tourism, their valuations are high.  One of the prime reasons for the failure of the tourist industry is inflation and the fact that we have priced ourselves out of the tourist market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring merely to convey to the Government the impact which section 2 of this Bill will have on the tourist industry. We know, too, that there is a grave shortage of money for housing. It is very difficult for people building their own homes to get bridging loans.</P>
      <P>This section, too, will result in reduced investment by individuals or companies in the fishing industry.  By 1983 our terms of accession to the EEC must be renegotiated in respect of fishing.  At that time the 50-mile limit will be a matter for discussion, but unless we have the big factory ships and the big fleets to go out and fish to that limit we will have a very poor case at EEC level for retaining that limit.  We might find a situation in which the other EEC countries would be allowed fish right into our estuaries.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to see the relationship between what the Deputy is saying now and the section under discussion.  He must relate his remarks more closely to section 2.  He is ranging far too wide on the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conveying to the Minister that this section, instead of helping our fishing industry, will hinder it greatly because people will be afraid to invest in industry or to increase their assets to a level above the threshold.  We are experiencing a no-growth situation in our economy. Our national wealth may be reducing. There are 103,000 people unemployed. This section of the Bill will do nothing to help provide employment for those people.</P>
      <P>The effects of the section will be marked clearly in so far as the construction industry is concerned.  It is clear that there is a fall off in the industry.  Yesterday we were told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a number of proposed industries were postponed.  I suggest that one of the main reasons for this situation is that the proposers became afraid of the effects of this section of the Wealth Tax Bill especially when there is no guarantee that the rate will remain at 1 per cent per annum.  This measure is being introduced at the wrong time, especially when one considers that 31 per cent of our population are under the age of 14.  This is a very important statistic.  Having regard to the fact that one in three of the population is under the age of 14 years, instead of discouraging investment as this section will undoubtedly do, the Government should use all possible means to encourage home and foreign investment.</P>
      <P>I would invite any member of the Coalition parties to explain in what way the wealth tax will aid economic growth or increase the national wealth.  I would ask any member of the Government parties to spell out clearly how it will help any of the 103,000 at present unemployed to get jobs.  I forecast that the number of unemployed will be increased between now and Christmas unless the Bill is withdrawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening the Minister intervened in the debate to talk about a few matters, including a letter which I read into the record and some comments I made on it.  I was not in the House at the time but I was listening to the Minister on the monitor upstairs.  I want to say one or two things in regard to what the Minister said on that occasion.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister was mistaken in saying that either I or the writer of the letter was under the impression that wealth tax would be payable by a trading company.  If he examines the record he will find that neither the writer of the letter nor I said that. Each of us referred to the position of shareholders, and that is the crucial point.  On that occasion we were referring to shareholders resident in the United States of America.  Of course, the position is the same for a shareholder resident outside the jurisdiction of the State.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that in the case of shareholders resident outside the State if they were shareholders&mdash;the case he took following the letter I quoted was in an American company, which company controlled an Irish trading company&mdash;in that case the American shareholders would not be liable to wealth tax.  In order to establish that that is so&mdash;the Minister did not in fact spell this out but I think he will not disagree with what I am about to say&mdash;it is necessary to interpret the phrase in section 3 (2) &ldquo;of property situate in the State&rdquo; as not meaning the shares which such people own in the circumstances described by the Minister.  In other words, the ownership by, say, American residents of shares in an American company through which assets in this country are owned and controlled is not deemed to be, according to the Minister, property situate in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That interpretation of section 3 subsection (2) is, I would suggest, contrary to the whole line that has been taken by the Minister for Finance in this capital legislation, where the tendency has been to look through transactions of various kinds and get to the actual situation.  However, we are not discussing section 3 <Col N="232" /> at the moment.  When we are discussing it we will tease this matter out further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I am ready to discuss it immediately if the Deputy would like to get to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would probably be more appropriate if we discuss it in detail, but for the moment let us assume that what the Minister says is correct.  I wonder does the Minister realise the implications of what he was saying, because I regard these implications as extremely serious.  The two major implications of what the Minister said are these: first, although we all on this side of the House and many people outside the House knew and said that this Bill discriminated against Irish people and encouraged foreign investment, nobody realised until the Minister expounded his interpretation of section 3 subsection (2) just what gross discrimination against Irish people was intended.  I use the term &ldquo;gross discrimination&rdquo; advisedly because if what the Minister said is true then, quite clearly, a non-resident even though effectively owning and controlling property in this country will not pay wealth tax whereas a resident will pay wealth tax on property owned and controlled not only here but anywhere in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of that are very clearly a direct encouragement and incentive for the foreign take-over of Irish industry, of Irish business, distribution, supermarkets, everything else.  There is a built-in incentive in this Bill, if what the Minister says is true, for foreign takeover.  That is the first implication, but there is another and perhaps from the Minister's point of view almost equally serious implication, and it is this: again if what the Minister said is true, he is providing a coach and four for driving right through the wealth tax because anybody who is going to be liable to any substantial extent for wealth tax can very simply, if the Minister's interpretation is right, have a set-up whereby his control and ownership of property in this country <Col N="233" /> will be deemed not to be property situate in the State and therefore he will not be liable for wealth tax.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister realised or intended the situation to be as I have outlined it, but I do not think he can deny that if what he has said in regard to the position of foreign shareholders is correct, the implications I have just outlined follow. They are serious implications. Until we get to section 3 and discuss in detail the implications and meaning of subsection (2) I do not accept that what the Minister says is correct, but I am saying that if what the Minister says is correct then these serious implications follow.</P>
    <P>Any discussion of section 2 must take place in the light of what the Minister says is the meaning of section 3 and in the belief, until it is proved otherwise, that the implications are that there is a direct incentive for foreign takeover of Irish business and that a coach and four for driving through liability for wealth tax is being provided.  It is only on that basis that we can discuss section 2 until or unless it is shown that section 3 subsection (2) means something other than what the Minister said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which Deputy Colley has referred will allow the Minister to clarify the position when we come to discuss section 3 in detail.  May I offer some comment on section 2?  The section says that there shall be a wealth tax levied as of April of this year.  In effect that decision was taken in February, 1973. The decision that we should have a wealth tax was taken in economic circumstances that might at the time have appeared to justify a wealth tax or a capital gains tax or any other tax, for that matter.  The economic circumstances have changed considerably since that time.  The phrase was coined in the peculiar circumstances of the political attraction it would have in the run into a general election.  The notion was born in the hasty and, I presume, the heated atmosphere of the rooms of this House in the days of the birth of the 14-point programme.  Now <Col N="234" /> those hasty, ill-conceived decisions, plans or promises are the basis of our taxation legislation, apart from being to a considerable extent allegedly the basis of our economic and social planning.</P>
      <P>There may be many aspects in the social area where people have a common concern.  Fianna Fáil acknowledge the need for advancement in the social area but it must be firmly based on secure planning in the overall economic area.  This is what is lacking and what we find extraordinary in the approach to this legislation.  We have a Minister who repeated in the last few days that this is no time for fashioning an overall economic plan. This is not the time and 12 months ago was not the time.  At that time, to quote the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we were &ldquo;living in a tempest of raging international inflation&rdquo;. Six months ago the Central Bank apparently found that the eye of the hurricane was centred somewhat closer to home and the Taoiseach acknowledged that it was here in this country.</P>
      <P>A recent published report from the EEC acknowledged the very serious economic condition of this country but, equally, they acknowledged the control effected on the inflationary tendencies in most of the other member States.  In the face of all of this we are proceeding with taxation packages without knowing where they fit into the structure of an overall economic plan, without even having an overall economic plan.  This is on the admission of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This hardly seems the way to run the affairs of the nation.  We accept that a taxation policy is central to the control and direction of the economy and to the provision of the appropriate services through the various arms of the Executive.  Nevertheless, a government cannot introduce legislation of this kind, particularly as it is in principle a new tax in this and other countries.  We do not have the benefit we usually have of seeing how this proposal has worked, or has failed to work, in the United Kingdom. Even the wording of our taxation and finance provisions for a considerable time have been based on the precedent <Col N="235" /> and experience of the United Kingdom.  That position does not exist here but for some reason the Government are determined to press ahead with this legislation.  Of course they can present the Opposition as irresponsible, preventing them from pressing ahead with what they say is a highly desirable, equitable and necessary piece of taxation.</P>
    <P>Our party are not opposed to the principle of a wealth tax.  We have said that clearly and I repeat it now. However, until such time as our economy and nation have reached a stage of development that will justify the introduction of new taxes of this nature, until taxation proposals of this kind fit into their proper place in our economic planning, we are opposed very firmly to it.  We are particularly opposed to it in the present unplanned, irregular and ill-controlled condition of the economy.</P>
    <P>Very few Ministers have spoken on this Bill.  The attitude taken by Government speakers is that Fianna Fáil are defending the wealthy minority, that only a small number of people will be affected and, obviously, the big business interests have got at Fianna Fáil.  They say that Fianna Fáil Deputies are coming into this House at the behest of these people to protect their interests.  That is a nice presentation to make and, from the Government's point of view, it might seem to have political advantages. Even if such nonsense were true&mdash; which it is not&mdash;the real question is not so much what Fianna Fáil are about but what the Government are about.</P>
    <P>Our response to this or any legislation can only be a response.  It is the Government who initiated this discussion.  They did it at a time when their own Minister said that there is no overall economic plan.  The Government have the National Economic and Social Council to advise them and through the council they can consult with those who are responsible for the various sectors, the trade unions, the Federated Union of Employers and the farming associations.  Apparently the Government are more concerned <Col N="236" /> about appearances than actions and they have instituted a new process of consultation.  There have been new meetings with the trade unions and the employer organisations on a separate basis and with the farming organisations.  Why is it necessary to have this new process in addition to what is already in existence?  It is simply to hide the fact that the Government have neither the capacity, guts nor commitment to see where they want to go and to make decisions. They want to involve others in what they see will be the opprobrium and severe criticism which may follow some of the measures they consider may have to be taken.</P>
    <P>They should learn that this is the responsibility of the Government.  The IFA are responsible to the farmers, the trade unions are responsible to the workers and the Federated Union of Employers to the employers.  They have not been elected by the people to do the job of the Government. There have been consultations and we are waiting for the Government to come up with some clear and firm proposals.  We are told they are monitoring, surveying and projecting.  Certainly they are projecting at a great rate.  There is the activity of constant Cabinet meetings.  This has been going on for the last 12 months&mdash;they are the most over-worked Government in the history of the State.  To what effect?  Each apparently is so concerned with the other person's Department that he has no time to be concerned with his own.  In the light of all this we are asked to accept new taxation of this nature, the yield from which we have not been clearly told by the Minister.  Does that make any sense?  Are we to satisfy the doctrinaire theory without having any idea of where this new tax will fit into our overall economic plan?  If that is it then let us recognise that this is apparently simply an exercise in political theorising, and not just in political theorising but in political manipulation, because a wealth tax, as I said, is one that of its very nature may commend itself to the vast majority of people; it could be a popular idea and go down well since the vast <Col N="237" /> majority would not be concerned.  Was that the idea?  Perhaps when it was first mooted it did go down well.  Perhaps the chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>We are being labelled as irresponsible. How can we approve of this taxation package when we do not know how it will fit into our general investment climate and what effect it will have on employment conditions and job security?  Can the Government prove it will not adversely affect these?  They are the people who have the responsibility.  I have a fair idea that there are Ministers in the Government, particularly the Minister sitting in the House at the moment, a mature, experienced member of the Government, who would not have a hang-up on a doctrinaire position, as so many others seem to have.  He is a Minister who can judge cause and effect.  I have an idea that he and a few others may think differently.  It seems to be the persuaders who are dictating policy.  I know the silent members of the Government recognise that there is such a thing as confidence. No matter how one tries to rationalise, analyse or justify the presence or the absence of confidence, the reality is that, given a certain investment climate and a certain climate of opinion and a certain attitude on the part of the public, particularly where the business sector and agriculture are concerned, where the Government or certain spokesmen in the Government are concerned, one can have a situation in which confidence is undermined.  It is not for us no these benches to say why that is so.  It is for the Government to recognise why it is so.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister for Defence who, some months ago, said this proposal was a civil service idea; that was his statement on the White Paper. Apparently he believed the Government really had no responsibility.  It is no wonder there is a lack of confidence now in the investment and business sector when a senior Minister, like the Minister for Defence, a man of some business and commercial experience himself, who possibly might be personally concerned, which is <Col N="238" /> more than I will ever be, could make a statement like that.  Is it any wonder there was an undermining then of business confidence?</P>
    <P>The Government now accuse the Opposition of doing a national disservice in trying to undermine confidence. The reality is that it is the Government who have done the undermining through their doctrinaire speeches, through the statement of the Minister for Defence and by the silence of the leader of the Government on this particular matter.  Surely, from the point of view of economic planning and of where taxation fits in, we should have a clear statement from the Taoiseach so that we would know where he at least sees the country going, if he sees it going anywhere. We should know what his views are about what the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs are hatching for our economy and for the future of industry. What is the Taoiseach's view?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy.  He has been granted a good deal of latitude on the section but he is now ranging very wide of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The section itself is very wide and I am simply placing this wealth tax innovation, which is what it is, in context and asking that the Government responsible for introducing it would tell us what its place is in the overall national plan, if such a plan exists, and I am particularly asking that the leader of the Government would let us know where he sees these proposals fitting in.  That is what I am asking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We recognise taxation is necessary, but when one comes to new taxation of this nature one is entitled to analyse it.  Fifty years on, or even ten years on, we will be looking back and seeing the effect for good or ill of this proposal on economic developments and not just on individuals who were caught by it.  We will wonder then did we analyse sufficiently what the position would be.  I am simply asking for a clear analysis.  I am simply asking <Col N="239" /> that the Minister responsible for bringing in this tax will tell how much it is expected to yield so that we can strike a reasonable balance in regard to what we are being asked to support and make a reasonable assessment and analysis of what the Government are attempting to do.  We have had nothing so far which would enable us to do that.  We are simply asked to support a commitment given two years ago as part of an overall national economic plan, a plan we do not have.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the officials who will be asked to give effect to this commitment.  I sympathise with the reluctance many of them must have had in accepting this decision of the Government.  But that is not their business.  They must accept it.  I am sure many believe that this is not the time to introduce this tax.  These are the people who will have to implement this legislation.  Revenue is a busy section and a great many experienced people are doing very important work there to maintain the Government's position.  They are also advising people as to their tax liability.  By and large, we all recognise the Revenue Commissioners are a very necessary part of our society; though we may not like meeting up with them too often, we recognise they are doing a very necessary job.  We also appreciate the assistance we get from them.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the personnel complement within the Department of Finance is but I wonder how many of them will now be delegated full-time implementing this particular piece of legislation?  I am sure the Minister for the Public Service can advise the Minister on the number of personnel who were taken off normal duties to deal with a particular piece of legislation some years ago.  How many will now be taken away from dealing with the normal, traditional areas of taxation to deal with this particular element of taxation?  What effect will that have on the overall tax revenue?</P>
    <P>Many people are asking those questions. Will we, for the sake of a principle, lose more than we will gain?  We do not know how much we will gain. A lot of people are afraid they will be <Col N="240" /> involved in this.  The Fianna Fáil Party feel that this has had a significant effect on the investment climate of the country. We do not know what the yield from this tax will be by comparison with the loss which we feel is there and by the fact that so many personnel will be taken from other duties to deal with this tax.</P>
    <P>When indirect taxation was introduced for the first time a major debate took place.  I believe most people now recognise that it was a very necessary tax innovation.  Although it was not very popular when it was introduced the Fianna Fáil Government thought it was necessary.  The experience at the time was, and with VAT subsequently, that those delegated from normal functions to deal with those taxes had to spend a lot of time in those new areas, to the detriment, to a certain extent, of the areas they normally supervised. At least, in those areas they dealt with considerable tax yields from the new proposals, whether it was VAT, turnover tax or wholesale tax, and it was worthwhile.</P>
    <P>We are told that only a small number of people will be affected by this tax.  In determining what that small number will be a lot of people will spend a lot of time in seeing that those people will pay according to the assessments under this legislation.  They will have to spend a lot of time coping with the advisers, which the people who have to pay this tax will employ. I do not know if Deputy Desmond speaks on behalf of the Government but he spoke about a person who had less than £1 million who will pay approximately £2,000 per annum.  Is the purpose of this exercise to get that much tax from a person with less than £1 million?  Will the confidence of the people be undermined for that?  The Minister should tell us that this is true.</P>
    <P>We have rampant inflation at the moment.  Our figure is much higher than many of our European partners. We have turned the tables on them over the last few years.  At this time should we even run the risk of scaring needed capital out of the country, which could be generated domestically or attracted from abroad?  As a consequence of doing that we will be forced to borrow more money from <Col N="241" /> abroad at high interest rates thereby injecting massive doses of inflation into the economy.</P>
    <P>This Bill should play a central part in our overall economic plan.  If we frighten away capital that is already in the country out of it or frighten capital from coming into the country the consequence is that we must get that money from somewhere, which is the money markets abroad at high interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Government do not see this wealth tax related to our inflationary problem and they do not see it any way related to our unemployment situation. They say that when Fianna Fáil say it they are raising scare tactics. During all this time unemployment figures are increasing.  Normally at this time of the year unemployment figures go down, but this year the figures remain the same so that is actually an increase.  The Government do not see that this wealth tax makes Ireland less attractive when a country as developed as France and as economically progressive as she is, having gone through difficulties, does not see the need to have legislation of this nature.</P>
    <P>Are we really interested in development in this country?  It is a strange coincidence that almost every country in Europe was expanding and developing in the fifties while we were going downwards at a very high rate. The Government should acknowledge, without stating specifically, that at a certain stage, from about the late 1950s&mdash;by coincidence Fianna Fáil came back to Government at that stage&mdash;confidence was restored and the Irish economy developed.  At that time we were doing the opposite to every other country and we are now going through the same experience. Inflation has been contained in most other European countries who experienced more severe problems than us.  They have been able to deal with this problem but we find ourselves running against the tide and we are not prepared to acknowledge the obvious.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult to reconcile the views of, for instance, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry <Col N="242" /> and Commerce, because they start from two entirely different bases.  It is difficult to reconcile the views of, for instance, the Minister for Lands and Deputy Barry Desmond because they also start from two different bases.  They thought they reconciled their views when they produced their 14-point plan but these views have not been reconciled.  That is why all this confusion is rampant, why unemployment and inflation are such serious problems, and why we are being asked to vote on a new principle of taxation without having an indication of what it represents in a Government plan.  Until such time as we get such an indication we can only treat this with the ridicule it deserves.  If this country gets back to the point at which we left it&mdash;that will take a few years&mdash;and if we can restore confidence maybe in ten years time when we have reached a similar stage of development as France has, Fianna Fáil may introduce, with effect from 5th April, 1985, a wealth tax. This is not the time to introduce such a tax having regard to the condition of our economy.</P>

      <P>Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>2.  Subject to the provisions of this Act and any regulations thereunder, with effect on and from the 5th day of April, 1975, a tax, to be called wealth tax, shall be charged, levied and paid annually.</P>
      <P>We are of the opinion that this wealth tax should not be charged, levied and paid annually as and from 5th April, 1975.  We are basing our arguments mainly on the effect this has and will have on capital formation to be used for industrial development here.  We are not talking about it in terms of the 1 per cent but in terms of a universal discourse being established backed up by stupid antiquated arguments from Deputies such as Deputy Barry Desmond about wealth and Fianna Fáil being the party of privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We maintain that this tax will create an atmosphere of distrust among people who have capital which can be used for development here.  That kind of person knows that 1 per cent in <Col N="243" /> 1975 can, if we have the particularly vicious type of approach we got from some Government speakers, become 5 per cent within a few years.  This is more our reason for opposing it.  There is a schizophrenia on the Government side of the House about this&mdash;Labour Deputies claiming that it is a marvellous thing, Fine Gael Deputies playing it down and trying to convey the impression that it does not matter very much.</P>
    <P>This indicates the lines of propaganda which suit either party.  Wealthy men have been attracted to live here by many factors.  Because a man has wealth it does not necessarily mean that he has exploited somebody to get it.  This is part of the mythology of the Left.  There has been exploitation in the past but because a man has amassed great wealth does not mean that he has exploited anybody to acquire it.  I know a wealthy person who came to live here because he liked our way of life here.  He did not come here to exploit.  One of the things he claimed took him here was because it was the only country in which he could live without having an armed guard to protect his family lest they be kidnapped.  He took his vast wealth here and that can be used for development. If people start looking at his wealth with envious eyes, if the tax people start getting itchy fingers, that man may find some other country to live in and some other community may be able to develop on the strength of his capital.</P>
    <P>We have had on this section from Deputy Barry Desmond an economic comment in the jargon of yesteryear, in the jargon of the period when capital was too powerful.  We have had an attempt by that Deputy to tie around the necks of Fianna Fáil the millstone that they are in favour of the wealthy and in favour of the exploitation of the weaker sections.  It is time to rebut and reject this thesis.  I challenge Deputy Barry Desmond to come to my constituency and, in his great wisdom as a social scientist, to assess the type of person who sends me, and the vast majority of the Fianna Fáil Party, to this House.  He <Col N="244" /> will then be disillusioned in his fond belief that we, in opposing the tax imposed by section 2, are supporting the people of privilege in our community. Far more of the fat cats of society in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown support him than support me in my constituency.  The trade unions, generally, are far more sophisticated in their approach than the maidenauntish approach of Deputy Barry Desmond and others like him.  Industrial development needs technology, time and capital, and capital is very important.  If capital is used now the fruits will not be available for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>In our society the most powerful system ever devised is used to persuade people to consume.  People are being assaulted day and night in all the media with pleas to consume.  The average man puts a very small input into the capital that can be used for industrial development.  He is seen primarily as a consumer and by consuming he keeps factories and industries going.  A certain small percentage of his earnings would be saved by way of pension schemes and so on, but he is fulfilling his role in society by being a consumer, and judging by our few years of affluence he has fulfilled that role very willingly.  As you know, consumer spending has been very high over the few years of affluence we had until this disastrous Administration put the economy on the wrong track, disastrous because I do not think they can make up their mind between right and left, between grabbing all the capital for the Exchequer and leaving something for industrial development, grabbing all the money in such a way that those who have money abroad are scared away and those who have money in this country are trying to get it out as quickly as they can.</P>
    <P>Industries and companies in this country should not be scared of forming their own capital by reserving a substantial percentage of their profits for capital formation in their company. If the kind of taxation that is envisaged here and the other taxation we have been dealing with since Christmas is proceeded with, companies <Col N="245" /> will have no incentive to do this and consequently development will suffer.</P>
    <P>I made the point that the ordinary, average man will not supply a significant percentage of the money through his personal savings for development of industries and companies.  It will have to be done within the company. That is the imperative of modern industrial and commercial development. However much we would like to think we encourage savings, the erosion caused by inflation is shaking people in this regard and, at its best, it is an insignificant percentage of the total money that must be available for the development of industry and commercial life.</P>
    <P>I mentioned already the kind of maiden-aunt approach of Deputy Desmond: tut, tut, Fianna Fáil is the party of privilege.  Tut, tut, Fianna Fáil are defending the rich.  Tut, tut, they do not like the wealth tax because they have sold their souls to a few rich men.  His mind boggles and his imagination boggles, and he was in a full state of bogglement for a long time about this side of the House.  He knows damn well that sound economic sense is being talked from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>We may regret that capital formation must be a matter for the corporations and the large companies.  We may regret that man is cast in the role of the consumer.  We do regret it philosophically.  Theorists thought they would be able to handle it by developing a different philosophy.  It does not seem to be on.  We must take the economic facts as we see them, and if section 2 scares people from abroad away from this country where they want to invest, or scares people who came to this country for one reason or another, not to exploit, and who have a lot of money, if it scares them out of the country, then the taxation policy is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is a different system in the controlled economies of the USSR and the countries in Eastern Europe, where capital formation also has to take place for development.  It is done of course <i>in toto</i> by the State.  It was done very <Col N="246" /> severely for a long period.  Consumer spending was curtailed drastically, and they insisted either centrally or at local factory or business level that a large percentage of profits should be retained for development.  So severely was this doctrine applied at one stage that, as you know, in Eastern Europe there was seething unrest, and after the Stalinist period this had to be changed.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he was in Opposition, claiming he had the solution to all the problems.  He could develop in his own particular controlled way.  Now the economic facts of life have been borne in on him since he assumed office.  He knows now that he must be as wily as a serpent in order to have enough capital in order to develop mines, oil, gas or anything else.  He has learned.  An interview he gave to the Editor of the <i>Irish Management Institute Journal</i> indicates that, and it is a good thing that there is somebody in the Government learning as he goes along.  I do not think he or the Government learned early enough.</P>
    <P>We had a great beating of drums and flourish of trumpets when the White Paper on Capital Taxation was announced, and from that time on there have been signs of modification. This section here, with its statement at the end, that 1 per cent would be the rate of taxation would be a hell of a lot different if it were not for the fact that people were forced to listen to other views, that people were forced to consider the damage they might do to the economy if they did not learn the economic facts of life.</P>
    <P>In the west, as it has been developing, commercial companies, manufacturing companies and so on, under the free enterprise system form capital in a certain way.  The taxman's job is to collect tax, but he must not be allowed to concentrate on the collection of tax without keeping an eye on the economy generally.  This, I am afraid, is the kind of thinking that has been emanating from certain quarters of the Government parties and from the Government.  As regards the system in the east&mdash;and I am not one who will say: &ldquo;We have reds here, we have reds there and reds in the other <Col N="247" /> place&rdquo;&mdash;anybody with common sense would assess that system and its feasibility, would assess it as a system which would produce the best results economically for this country.  I think everybody at student level or in his young days, or at any particular time, has done this.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to have a fully formally controlled economy and to develop it in that way?  I do not think it is possible to do it by this kind of legislation which tends to suggest that the panacea is more State control, more absorption of private industries, private concerns.  It suggests that is the only way to run the economy. Where this has been done on the grounds of inefficiency, where there has been interference with individual freedom, the system has not been a success.  I am not foolish enough to believe that an individual as a worker has any great freedom in the system we have but, properly controlled, properly watched, the free enterprise system we have, coupled with a strong trade union movement, can help the country to be developed and confidence can be reasonably placed in the economy and the people who are running it.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that in this administration there is a schizophrenia and an ambivalence about basic things in the economy and the result can be only doubts in the minds of potential investors, fewer new jobs and consequent stagnation in the economy.</P>
    <P>Section 2 lays it down that a wealth tax shall be charged, and the percentage is specified.  If anything I would say here could do damage to the economy, I would not say, but I must say that the type of approach inherent in this legislation can create an atmosphere of doubt in the minds of foreign investors in the matter of investing their money here in property, capital goods, development and so on. Such investors should not have to look over their shoulders at the administration whose duty it is to promote industrial and economic welfare in the country.</P>
    <P>The imperatives of industrialisation <Col N="248" /> are whether in a controlled economy like Eastern Europe or in our type of open economy&mdash;what is called free enterprise economy&mdash;capital will be available.  Of course the incentive to provide capital must be there.  We provide it in a certain way and it is the duty of the administration to see that no legislation interferes with that system, with the process of enticing capital investment from abroad and encouraging individual commercial industrial firms at home to put substantial amounts of money aside for development.</P>
    <P>The old tear-on-the-cheek approach of Deputy Desmond is out of date because in large companies, commercial concerns, the directors and shareholders have very limited powers. Management structures decide they will keep so many thousands of pounds for further development in capital funds and the directors do not have all that much influence in either stopping or encouraging them.  Neither do the shareholders.  Here is Deputy Desmond riding out against the wicked, wealthy, exploiting rich man and here we have Fianna Fáil, go bhfóraidh Dia orainn, the party of the wealthy.</P>
    <P>As I have said, that approach is out of date and no serious person gives it any heed.  The trade unions have their own power and I have a great belief in trade unions, in their far more sophisticated approach than the Labour Party's to a wealth tax and the economy generally.  This is the kind of wisdom I always expected from the trade unions and they showed it when they supported us in the EEC campaign despite the fact that the socalled Labour economists advised them not to do so.  Trade unions and the people with capital are locked into a system where technology is very important.  They have their strengths and their weaknesses: management, investors, boards of directors, the lot, are all locked into a system, and it is incumbent on them to develop the system for the benefit of the economy.</P>
    <P>A wealth tax like this is only a part of the make-up of that development and it is the duty of the Government to watch that system in the interests <Col N="249" /> of workers, of investors, of the development of industry generally.</P>
    <P>A speaker from the opposite side listed a plethora of countries and compared them with us.  If he realised it at all, all those countries, some of them ex-imperial powers, had a huge start on us in capital formation, industrial development, right down from the industrial revolution.  A former Taoiseach and Leader of this party, the late Seán Lemass, always watched the opportunity to attract capital here which could be used for development.  He saw a trend here or there.  He did not encourage hot, in-and-out money.  He tried to create an atmosphere which would attract people and capital to the country for the country's betterment.</P>
    <P>That is the very important duty of any administration.  It is the duty of any administration to produce an atmosphere of confidence.  It is difficult if a tail is wagging the dog for the dog to go in any particular direction, and the present administration will have to make up their minds fairly quickly or the people will make up their minds for them about what they want.  The economy is in a parlous state at the moment.  I submit that the reason for this is this type of legislation.  It confuses people.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I am not excluding the possibility of a totally controlled economy.  In fact, I would back it 100 per cent if I thought it were feasible, efficient or that it would not interfere in any way with people's freedom. The administration will have to decide if that is what they want and go for it.  This is a free enterprise society with a tendency in the Government to aid the less privileged, to watch the orchestra and make sure that each person in the orchestra plays the appropriate well attuned part.</P>
    <P>No tax legislation should be tolerated which would shake the confidence in people who are using capital to develop industry or a commercial concern.  No taxation or no atmosphere of going for the jugular vein of the person with money should discourage capital coming from abroad for investment and the purchase of <Col N="250" /> factories, property, and so on.  It is the taxman's duty to gather tax, but taxation is too important to leave to a man whose sole duty it is to gather tax.  When he does that he is doing his job properly.  There must be somebody watching the economy as a whole and the effect that taxation will have on the economy.  That is why I submit that section 2, which states that wealth tax shall be charged, levied and paid, is damaging.  As Deputy O'Kennedy said, at the moment we are in a period of serious economic troubles.  This is no time to be talking about taxing wealth.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is a Committee Stage debate although I can understand that the Deputy might be confused.</P>
      <P>Earlier this morning Deputy O'Kennedy paid me the compliment of saying that I was regarded as a reasonable man, with a reasonable, common-sense approach to things.  I thank him for that compliment and would like to regard myself as falling into that category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into public life and spent a few years first in the Seanad and subsequently in this Chamber, and with my experience as a practising solicitor for many years, I became concerned about the unjust system of taxation operating here. First, I was struck by how unfair the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax was when it was strictly operated, without any capital gains tax.  A lady clerical worker from the country working in the city of Dublin, living in a flat, earning a modest wage of £20 or £25 a week, had to pay a considerable amount of income tax while people engaging in buying and selling, whether on the stock exchange, the property market or elsewhere, could in any one year make several thousand pounds and be exempt from tax.  I became very worried and concerned about that.  I was concerned about the teacher, the garda, the small businessman in the <Col N="251" /> county, the trade union official, the tradesman and the employee who had their pay packets dealt with to the letter of the law on a Thursday or Friday and the last penny was extracted from him.  Of course, that was right but the people operating in the property market on the stock exchange, even in a legitimate way, not to speak of the speculators, could and did enjoy a very considerable income free of tax.  I did not like that.  I did not think it was fair.  I did not think it could go on indefinitely.  The introduction of the capital gains tax has done something to rectify that scandal and in years to come it will introduce equity into that system of taxation.  Things were not so bad until the pay-as-you-earn system of income tax was introduced because prior to that in many cases people made their own arrangements.</P>
    <P>As a rural solicitor in touch with people, I was also shocked and very concerned at the crippling effect of death duties on private enterprise, on the farming community, on the small and moderate farms, on the business people and on people of property in general&mdash;small, medium or large property owners.  The stage had been reached when people could not sleep at ease at night thinking of what would happen to their wives and families if they were to die.</P>
    <P>As I said previously in this debate, my constituency is not made up of people of considerable property.  It is a constituency of small and medium farmers and small businessmen.  The stage had been reached when, even in Country Cavan, people were showing grave concern about death duties. People who had only reached middle age were very concerned about death duties, and they had a right to be.  I am making this point because the tax being introduced now is to replace death duties.</P>

You can talk away as long as you like so long as you do not come down to earth and talk practical common sense.  On behalf of this party I undertook that death duties would be abolished because people were extremely concerned about them.  Indeed, they had a right to be concerned about them, because they ranged from 4 per cent on £11,000 to 55 per cent over £200,000.  Death duties are gone.  Of course it is necessary to replace them by a system of capital taxation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The promise mentioned a small annual payment, and this is the small annual payment I am talking about.  It has relieved people of the nightmare of death duties.  Death duties were invading the home and breaking up the home.  As we undertook, we have introduced a wealth tax which will collect a modest annual payment from people owning assets worth over £70,000, if they are single, and £100,000 if they are married.</P>
      <P>We should get down to the hard facts and see what is involved in section 2.  A married man who owns assets worth £150,000 will be required to contribute the sum of £500 per year in wealth tax.  If that man had died on 31st March, 1975, his family would have received a bill for estate duties of £67,500.  It may be of interest to learn that, at the rate of £500 per year, it would take that man 135 years to pay the amount his family would be asked to pay in death duties in one sum.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I ask the House to be reasonable and to see what is in the section.  A man owning assets worth £250,000 will be required under this Bill to pay £1,500 per year.  If that man had died in March, 1975, his representatives would have been called upon to pay £137,000 in death duties.  It would take 91 years at the rate of £1,500 a year <Col N="254" /> to pay that amount.  Let us be reasonable and realistic.  A man with £500,000 will be required to pay £4,000 per year in wealth tax.  If he had died in March last the death duties demand would have been £275,000.  It would take 68 years at £4,000 a year to pay that amount. That is the reality of the matter.</P>
      <P>There is no terror in this for people of moderate wealth, or even of great wealth, except the terror which is being driven into them by the Opposition. In arriving at those figures all exemptions are ignored such as agricultural land, hotels, and so on.  A man owning assets worth £2 million will be required to pay £19,000 per year.  That is the stark reality.  What are Fianna Fáil crying about?  What are they worried about?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Belton asked whether a man could possibly be made to pay more than his total income between income tax and death duties?  The answer to that is that, unless he had practically no income, it could not happen.  He would want to have wealth running into £1 million or £2 million and no income for all practical purposes.  I do not think anybody could visualise a man with assets of £2 million bringing in an income of only £40,000.  If there is such a man he must be asleep.  It cannot happen in a genuine case that a man could pay more than his income between income tax and wealth tax.  Those are the realities of the situation.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is an ongoing situation, one might say.  When we began the debate on this section a couple of days ago the Opposition ran their case on the argument that this section would drive foreign capital out of the country or, to be more precise, that this section would prevent foreign capital from coming into the country to establish businesses here.  We have had that argument since the Committee Stage began on Tuesday morning at 10.30.  The spokesman for the Opposition, Deputy Colley, laid it on hot and heavy in saying that this Bill would do just that.  My namesake, Deputy Fitzpatrick, adopted the same line and so did Deputy Brugha. The more orthodox spokesmen of Fianna Fáil on taxation in general&mdash; we had only the filibusterers here yesterday and again today&mdash;Deputy Colley, Deputy Brugha and Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy de Valera, all went on the basis that it was wrong to have a section which would prevent money coming from the US., Germany or Britain to establish factories here.  They were striking terror into Deputy Dowling's members and it was only when Deputy Colley sat down, having been congratulated by all and sundry on his speech and when I drew the attention of the House to the fact that capital introduced into this country by foreign trading companies for the establishment of business here is not subject to wealth tax, that there was a very noticeable silence opposite.  I was asked if I were serious and I said of course I was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha repeated the question yesterday morning and again I assured him that capital introduced here to establish and own trading companies here is not affected.  The Opposition were disturbed but I think it was Deputy G. Collins who went on even to name one company that had been thinking of setting up substantial business here but which changed its plans due to the world economic climate and he said that company was frightened out of this country by section 2 of this Bill.  He was either reckless or playing politics because the company which he named&mdash;but which I shall not name&mdash;was not <Col N="256" /> affected by this Bill.  Further, I am in a position to assure the House that that company knew, having gone to the trouble to find out, that it was not affected.  That is the sort of argument being put up by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>When you set out to keep a debate going pointlessly for a couple of days &mdash;a debate which should conclude in a couple of hours&mdash;and when you must keep on talking it is not surprising that some outrageous and unfounded statements are made.  It would be amusing to listen to such statements if it were not damaging to the country.  But, of course, it is damaging to the country to misrepresent this Bill and I deplore the manner in which the Opposition did so.</P>
    <P>This morning we have them here, having more or less but not completely accepted my interpretation of the Bill as being benign in regard to foreign trading companies who own trading companies here, and now the Opposition are hollering: &ldquo;You are discriminating against Irish people.&rdquo;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Now they have changed their feet. Deputy Colley, the Opposition spokesman on finance, changed his feet this morning and said: &ldquo;You are discriminating against Irishmen.&rdquo;  I am not; and this Bill does no such thing. We have encouraged foreigners to come into this country for many years; we provide large grants and tax free incentives.  While in theory it may be said that this was open to Irish people also, the fact is that for many years we have had open house here for foreigners who want to establish industries here.  We encourage them by substantial grants and by exemption from corporation profits tax at the rate of 50 per cent&mdash;it was over 60 per cent when the Opposition were in office.  We reduced that and saw to it that the former Government reduced it.  No trading company in this <Col N="257" /> country is subject to wealth tax under this Bill.  I have explained how the shareholders in America, no matter what their income is, may be exempt from tax if they are American citizens and shareholders in an American trading company which owns a trading company here.</P>
      <P>Let us come to realities and let us look at the position of Irish people.  I want to repeat, for the purpose of the record and so that section 2 may be clearly understood, that section 2 does not impose a wealth tax on trading companies.  Shares of trading companies in the hands of people who are domiciled or ordinarily resident here will be subject to wealth tax provided that each individual exceeds the threshold which, for a married man, is £100,000.  Many Irish family companies are owned by a father and adult children but if five or six people who are not related can enjoy £100,000 worth of shares without any liability for wealth tax there need be no fear nor terror in this measure for the Irish people or for foreigners coming here.  To listen to the Opposition one would think that up to now the wealth of the country had been invested and hoarded here.  Such information as is available to the Revenue Commissioners does not show that to be the case.  I have been trying to explain why there is no fear in this Bill for foreign companies who may wish to establish subsidiaries here, and that neither is there any fear in it for Irish people.</P>
      <P>Up to March 31 last those individuals who wished to invest large sums of money here would have been liable for death duties at the rate of at least 41 per cent if they had £100,000 worth of shares in this country.  They are now being exempted from that liability.  It will take a lot of annual wealth tax payments at the rate of 1 per cent to catch up with the clobbering that a person would suffer in respect of death duties on assets worth £100,000 or £150,000.  Those are the realities of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power concentrated during his contribution on the farming community. Another Deputy expressed surprise <Col N="258" /> that the IFA were not protesting vigorously about the Bill but, as I pointed out at the time, the farmers' organisations are properly advised. They understand the Bill and know there is nothing in it about which they might be worried.  I could go further and say that since the Bill was published we had consultations with the IFA as we had with any other sector of the economy which wished to be heard.  As a result of those consultations improvements have been made, and further improvements will be made if the Opposition will allow us to get on with the Committee Stage of the Bill.  There are amendments which will render the Bill virtually innocuous.</P>

Before a farmer is liable for tax he must have a farm worth £200,000 when stripped of the dwelling house and of every hoof that treads the land because for the purpose of agriculture, a dwelling house and livestock are excluded. This would mean that in order to become liable for wealth tax he would need to have a farm of about 300 acres, assuming that he had no other hoard of wealth.  On a farm of that size he would be required to pay £350 per annum&mdash;sorry, no tax.</P>

      <Col N="260" /> Inflation has been talked about.  The Minister for Finance has given an undertaking that he will review the situation periodically to ensure that inflation is taken into account, but even within the Bill as drafted there is machinery to look after inflation because a valuation may be made of property as on 5th April of this year or next year and that valuation lasts for three years even if inflation has artificially increased the valuation of the property.  Will the Opposition please note that?</P>
    <P>Deputy John O'Leary from Kerry was very concerned about hotels and fishing boats.  I am sure Deputy John O'Leary knows that hotels in individual ownership are exempt in respect of bedrooms in the hotel up to a value of £100,000 or half the valuation, whichever is the lesser.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I shall deal with them in the next sentence.  Hotels in individual ownership are exempt in respect of bedrooms up to a value of £100,000 or half the valuation, whichever is the lesser.  Surely that means a high percentage of the hotels in the country? Somebody will ask me, and we all have had literature from the hotel organisation, about section 10, why it was not drafted in another way to include hotels owned by companies.  The fact of the matter is that it is just not possible to confer this exemption on companies owning hotels because if that were to be done there would be avoidance devices and nothing could be done about it.  But we have looked after the hotels owned by companies.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have indeed.  There is a reduction in the share value of 30 per cent.  It does not stop at £100,000 or at £200,000; it is right across the board. If I am not careful I will have Deputy Colley in telling me I am treating companies more favourably than hotels owned by individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="261" /> I have dealt with the argument about capital being discouraged from coming into the country for productive purposes.  I hope I have dealt with it fairly and satisfactorily.  There is also the argument that capital will be frightened or chased out of the country. There is no point in a person transferring money or assets out of the country unless he goes with it because if he is an Irish citizen or a person domiciled or ordinarily resident here and he transfers his money out of the country he will still be liable for wealth tax in respect of it.  If he transfers it to the U.K.&mdash;he would need to have his head examined&mdash;death duties would be payable.  That is the point I want to make.</P>
    <P>Capital that is here at the moment and that was here last year was subject to heavy death duties and yet it stayed here.  Why then should we expect that people who stayed here and suffered the risk of payment of death duties will suddenly take flight as a result of this nominal charge of 1 per cent in lieu of death duties?</P>
    <P>All through the debate the emphasis has been on capital and wealth.  Capital and wealth are good things but there does not seem to be any concern about income.  There are some people who have no capital, who have only income.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil are not consistent.  This morning Deputy O'Kennedy, who always makes a reasonable speech, said that Fianna Fáil were not all that much against the principle of a wealth tax.  I was surprised at that because yesterday they were saying that they would not have it, that they did not want it or any part of it.  Deputy O'Kennedy this morning was prepared to consider it but only in a state of affairs when the economy is better off than it is now.  He explained the sense in having a wealth tax in other European countries but not having it here by saying that the countries who operate a wealth tax are much more developed than we are.  That may be so but I want to tell the House and the country when the countries concerned began to operate a wealth tax. It is relevant to this debate because I do not imagine they were always as developed as they are now.  Denmark has operated a wealth tax since 1904, Sweden since 1910, Germany since 1922, The Netherlands since 1892, Norway since 1911 and Luxembourg since 1943.  The fact is that these countries built up their economies, not in spite of wealth tax, but with the aid and help of wealth tax.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Those facts that I have stated have not been taken into consideration.  It is well known that when some countries are in difficulties they impose a tax to get out of the difficulties.  I am not saying that should be done.  I would suggest to the House that the <Col N="264" /> scares being spread about this system of taxation are not well founded.  I believe Deputy Colley was wrong to carry on a correspondence with a responsible representative of industry in America on the basis that this country proposed to impose a wealth tax on American trading companies who establish industries here.  In effect, that is the meaning of the letter Deputy Colley read out to this House yesterday.  He did not contradict that letter, nor did he correct the erroneous impression contained in it.  I say that because the Deputy did not say he did so.  I believe it would be Deputy Colley's patriotic duty to do that, to write to that man who is apparently on friendly terms with him.  He should write a letter on the following lines: &ldquo;Dear Frank, I am afraid you do not correctly understand the proposals.  It is not proposed to tax your companies in America who establish subsidiaries here, and I would be glad if you understood this.  I would also be glad if you would give it widespread publicity in your trade and industrial journals.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>All of us like to score political points but there is one thing about most of us, namely, that when we go abroad we do not run down our country or our Government&mdash;I say this conscious of the fact that we were in Opposition for a considerable time. I believe Deputy Colley did not correctly understand the implications of this complex Bill because I noticed the considerable surprise of Deputies Fitzpatrick, Colley and Ruairí Brugha. If he accepts that the legal position with regard to trading companies here owned by foreign companies is as I am advised it is, I hope he will correct Mr. Frank O'Reilly's erroneous impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning Deputy Colley said we were discriminating against Irish people and I told him that was not so. He then said we would be opening the sluice gates to avoidance if the position was as I described it.  That is not the case.  So far as foreigners are concerned, those people who are prepared to put their money into the country, the position is as I have set out.  It is good for the country that they invest <Col N="265" /> the money here.  Irish people have exemption up to £150,000 when one takes the dwelling house into account. Ireland is the only country of all countries where a wealth tax is in operation which exempts the private residence.</P>
    <P>There is no question of opening the sluice gates to evasion devices.  If Irish people domiciled and ordinarily resident here establish a foreign company and own shares in it the shares will be liable.  If there is a genius around who is able to use avoidance methods under this section, it will be the duty of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance to plug the holes and to nullify the devices.  They do that every year.  It is a case of the tax experts watching Finance Bills and the Department of Finance watching the tax experts.  It is an ongoing situation that is dealt with in every Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the ominous presence of Deputy Dowling, I would appeal to the House to put an end to the discussion on this section.  Let us get on with the 70 amendments in the name of the Minister for Finance and the Opposition.  I do not believe the country has anything to fear from this Bill.  Furthermore, I do not believe the people are taking the Opposition seriously in this filibuster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like some clarification of this Bill.  Some time ago a Minister dismissed this Bill as &ldquo;civil service waffle&rdquo;.  We would like to know if that is the Government's approach to this Bill.  Judging by the remarks of the Minister for Lands and the questioning of Deputy Moore some time ago, it appears it is civil service waffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands indicated that certain countries have had a wealth tax for a considerable number of years and he mentioned Denmark.  I do not know what he was trying to prove, because Denmark has the worst unemployment figures in the EEC. Between 1974 and 1975 the increase in unemployment was in the region of 236 per cent.  This is one of the nations the Minister quotes as having a wealth tax and one would assume, from the argument made, that a wealth tax can save a <Col N="266" /> country.  Denmark, the country specifically referred to, has had an increase in unemployment between 1974 and 1975 of the order of 236 per cent while our figure for the same period is 35 per cent.  Denmark has an appalling unemployment situation, far worse than ours.  I have the figures here produced by the Commission.  In 1975 the total number of persons unemployed as against those registered for unemployment insurance was 12.2 per cent while here is was only 8.4 per cent. I do not know why the Minister picked on this example.  What was he trying to imply?  Was he trying to imply that a wealth tax can save a nation?  The figures I have here do not indicate that.  They indicate the opposite. Denmark has the worst unemployment problem in Western Europe.  Why did the Minister quote these countries that have had wealth taxes since 1890, since 1904 and since 1911?  The figures in the book that I have here presumably give the correct figures and, if the implication is that a wealth tax can save a country, then the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>Between 1974 and 1975 unemployment here increased by 35 per cent. Compare that with 236 per cent in Denmark, the country quoted by the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase was 75,700 in that particular year.  The figure is based on the register for unemployment insurance and corresponds with our live register.  In Germany, another country mentioned as having a wealth tax, unemployment <Col N="267" /> increased by 98 per cent in 1975 as against 1974.  The Minister's argument is not logical.  The countries with a wealth tax are in a worse situation than we are as far as unemployment is concerned.  We have the figures supplied to the EEC in March, 1975.  There is an odd discrepancy; the figure supplied is 94,606 while the Central Statistics Office here for the same period to 28th March gives a figure of 103,256. One can see that there must be some fiddling with figures by the Government. The difference between the two figures is 8,650.  What was the reason for the falsification or is there a reason?  Why the difference in the two sets of figures?</P>
      <P>Unless we were familiar with wealth tax legislation in all the countries mentioned by the Minister we could not make a realistic comparison. Is this particular measure identical with wealth tax legislation in these other countries, Luxembourg, Denmark and all the rest of them?</P>

      <P>It seems to me the Minister is unable to back up his argument because he has not told us the difference between the systems operating in Europe and the proposed system here.  Does he know what benefits have flowed from these systems?  A wealth tax does not appear to have improved the employment situation.  There is no need for me to go any further.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech was just a bit of upholstery. It was a prop.  We now find that those countries which have no wealth tax are far better off from the point of view of unemployment.  One wonders why the Minister presented these examples, if one could so describe them, at all.  This Bill could be drafted in any form.  It could be drafted in 150 different ways and it <Col N="268" /> could bear no relation at all to the legislation in the countries to which the Minister referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Minister and I am completely mystified.  The Minister has not convinced me and I doubt if he has convinced anyone else.  We have exposed the fraud and neither the public nor the Press will be taken in.</P>
      <P>I can understand the comments of the Minister for Defence that the white paper was just civil service waffle.  The Minister for Lands has failed to make any good argument at all for this and the facts controvert all the suggestions made by the Minister in regard to the beneficial results of the tax.  The Minister has not given me the reassurance that the other measures are identical with these and that we can make as reliable comparison.  There is no point in presenting statistics here or trying to make comparisons, as has frequently happened in this House, with other European countries unless it is on the basis of like with like.  I want to question the presentation of unemployment figures to the European Community in March, 1975 as 94,606, 8.4 per cent of the working population unemployed, when the figure was in fact 103,256 as presented to the Deputies of the House.  Which information was false?  We would like the Minister to tell us this.  We would then know on what basis to assess the arguments from the members of the Government.  We must have reliable statistics on which to base arguments. I am sure the Minister will agree that this is logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Which set of figures are we to use? I always understood the figures to use were those submitted by the Central Statistics Office, the number on the live register of those unemployed in the various categories.  Is there a reason for this deception?  This was dismissed by the Minister for Defence as civil service waffle and it has been <Col N="269" /> consolidated by the speech of the Minister for Lands, who told Deputy Moore that the Bill was innocuous. There is, therefore, no necessity to bring in this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>I believe the tax structure in this country and others needs constant updating. There must be a realistic assessment of the situation in relation to wealth and in relation to all other forms of taxation.  I am not against taxing the rich but we must have a realistic basis on which to work.  The position has not been clarified.  We got erroneous figures and we got comparisons from the Minister but the figures prove that they are a smokescreen. This Bill has been presented to the House as a smokescreen because Ministers have condemned it as waffle, and innocuous.  Supporters of the Government have labelled it in other ways.</P>
    <P>This is very like the Contraception Bill which we had some time ago.  I hope there will be the same consistency when it comes to voting on this Wealth Tax Bill so that people who have a conscience will back up the views they hold.  The Labour Party, no doubt, threatened to withdraw from the Government if a Bill of this nature was not introduced.  The Government have yielded and we have various projections of assessment of the Bill by a number of Ministers.  We know that the Labour Party have threatened to withdraw from the Government if this Bill is not put through.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, told them a number of measures would come before the Dáil and they were to keep putting the fires out.  By that he meant a dampening down of the situation in relation to unemployment, the building industry and the construction industry. He told them there was no further money available and there would be no further taxation or social welfare increases.  Nevertheless, they were not to panic.  He told them to hold their political nerve.  This is a common term used by that Minister.  Now we see the reason for the Bill and the assessment of it by two Minister.  We see the political pressures that have been <Col N="270" /> applied to maintain office and also those that have been exercised from outside.  The Minister has dealt with some of the pressures.  The Government have tried to create erroneous impressions by the hand-outs from the Government Information Services.  The national Press seem to be very gullible in accepting Press releases from the Government Information Services.</P>

They will take into consideration the statistics given by the Minister and examine them in relation to the general trend in European countries.  As I said, I am not against taxing the rich nor am I against a fair and just tax system.  I also believe that the taxation system must be updated to meet current problems and demands in a realistic way.  There have been erroneous impressions created that this is a wonderful country and nothing is wrong but very soon there is a rush to meet the captains of industry and other people. Yesterday we saw in the paper a headline: &ldquo;A secret plan to beat inflation&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair knows well that the capital gains tax and wealth tax are the main cause of our <Col N="271" /> problems and that this has generated through industry to the workers' pay packets.  Free enterprise is also affected.  The Minister gave some figures in relation to other European countries but, in fact, those countries have been described as &ldquo;Europe's paupers&rdquo;.  I have already dealt with the smokescreen and the pressures being applied to the Fine Gael members by the members of the Labour Party but we also had the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party to damp out all the fires and not to lose their nerve in the present situation.</P>
      <P>We all realise that the tax rate will start at 1 per cent but we should remember that only last week a Bill was introduced in the House to increase a levy by 50 per cent.  The fact that 1 per cent is mentioned in this Bill does not mean that in a year or two we could not have an escalation of the percentage.  We have all seen how other percentages have been increased viciously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not been given any guarantee to that effect. Other types of taxation have been increased at an enormous rate since this Government took office.  The people also had to pay extra for such things as television licences.  There is no doubt but that the Government are broke and bankrupt and that they have now to go to the pawnbroker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we restore confidence in our economy.  This Bill does not help in that regard.  It does not encourage industrialists or those anxious to invest money in development to do anything.  Confidence is seriously disturbed in our depressed economy.  There is an air of mistrust here because of the conflicting statements by Ministers.  However, it is fortunate that the Government can only depress the people for another <Col N="272" /> two years because then they must face the electorate in a general election.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that in that time they can do irreparable damage to our economy.  On the last occasion we had a Coalition Government they robbed the widows' and orphans' pension fund and used the money for other purposes.  They had their hand in the till all the time.  On this occasion they have come up with new schemes. I accept that the tax system needs to be up-dated but the Government must take into consideration our economic situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands has failed miserably in his efforts to put up a valid argument in favour of wealth tax.  I am sure he feels miserable having presented statistics about other European countries which have proved to be unreliable. The people can feel confident that when Fianna Fáil return to power they will restore confidence in the economy and generate employment.  My hope is that in the meantime the sell-out is not completed.  It is possible that some members of the Government want that. I am not defending the wealthy people but if it is a question of examining the entire tax structure it must be done in a realistic way.  Comparisons made should compare like with like. Recently we heard of the secret Government plan, but if such a plan exists one would expect the Government to present it to all members for consideration. Two or three papers yesterday carried the story.  Could we be told what is the Government's secret plan for saving the nation?  Does it involve the wealth tax?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday that this part of the Bill was necessary to get more finance into racing. No matter how one looks at this amendment it is an unreasonable proposal, because the Racing Board must get the consent of the Minister for Finance.  That has always been the case in the past when the maximum levy was 5 per cent.  The Racing Board, whenever they wanted to change it, had to get the sanction of the Minister for Finance, and that sanction could be given without reference to the Dáil. Under section 9 of the amending Bill, there is an obligation to lay the orders before the House.  If, therefore, the House or any Member wishes to annul the order, they have full control over it, which is a distinct change from what has operated in the past.  I mentioned yesterday that in the case of Bord na gCon, strangely enough, there is no ceiling whatever, and if sanction is given by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the case of Bord na gCon, again there is the requirement that the regulations be laid before the House, so this is precisely on all fours with that with the exception of the limitation.</P>
      <P>I think most Deputies will agree that it would be ridiculous to establish a statutory board such as we have established in this case and every time they wanted to take a decision on matters which they were established to deal with, they had to seek the sanction of the Dáil.  In fact, because of the change in the requirement of laying regulations before the House, it would be unthinkable that the board would proceed to implement a decision in the knowledge that the matter could be questioned and that an annulling order could be put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the proposal to increase the levy is a reasonable one taking into account the fact that all the previous <Col N="274" /> experience indicates that different boards acted in a reasonable way, because originally the levy was 5 per cent and it was subsequently reduced, and then over the years raised again to 5 per cent.  Bearing in mind the change in the value of money and the fact that it is recognised generally that it is essential to increase stakes, I believe the proposal in the Bill is a reasonable one and I cannot accede to Deputy O'Malley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We support Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  It is a very important amendment to the provision empowering the board to increase the levy from 5 to 10 per cent.  As Deputy O'Malley said yesterday, he can see no necessity for this big gap of from 5 to 10 per cent.  The figure in Deputy O'Malley's amendment is already a 20 per cent increase on the existing 5 per cent.  We maintained on Second Stage that any increase in moneys should be diverted towards increased stake money in an effort to improve racing further at provincial tracks.</P>
      <P>The 1 per cent increase would mean £170,000 extra, which would be a sizeable sum if voted for that purpose. However, there is another reason why it is not necessary to increase it from 5 to 10 per cent.  On Second Stage the Taoiseach said that the total sum staked with bookmakers at horse races increased from £11.8 million in 1970 to £18.4 million in 1974.  That is an increase of about 70 per cent in stake money with bookmakers without ever increasing the levy from 5 to 6 per cent.  With increases of that magnitude in the turnover every four years, there seems to be no justification for providing for an increase from 5 to 10 per cent as proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that any proposal for a further increase would be laid before the House, but I understand that this provision is not peculiar to this Bill but is included in many measures that come before the House.  If they needed a drastic increase in future years&mdash;and we do not anticipate they will&mdash;it would only be right and proper that the proposal should come before the House and be debated so that the House <Col N="275" /> could decide as we are deciding now because the racing and bloodstock industry is of great importance to the economy and, apart from that, we are a race-loving people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will support any measure that assists the racing industry generally.  My objection to the 10 per cent is that I would like to see the various stages of development planned by the Racing Board put before the House.  I have in mind principally the position of provincial racetracks. In the south there are a number of such tracks and I am keenly interested to see that any funds being made available to the Racing Board will be distributed equitably to the advantage of provincial racetracks as against the metropolitan tracks.</P>
      <P>We have a track in Mallow which is one of the best in the Twenty-six Counties and I should like to see development there.  Apart from anything else, it is a tourist attraction and it brings many visitors to the country.  I will not oppose measures to make more funds available for the development of provincial tracks subject to what I have already said.  My objection to the Bill is that it gives a more or less free hand to the Racing Board to disburse the additional 5 per cent.  The House should have an opportunity of stage by stage debates on Racing Board developments so as to ensure that moneys collected from levies will be distributed to the advantage of racing generally throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Cronin, I say that any moneys that can be devoted to the improvement of provincial tracks will be well spent. Deputy O'Malley's amendment asks to have the proposed 10 per cent levy reduced to 6 per cent, a very reasonable request in the present economic climate.  If anybody wanted ammunition for an accusation of a breach in price stability this appears to be it, a 100 per cent increase being voted.  We have been told it is only a 20 per cent increase but, strictly speaking, as the Bill stands it is a 100 per cent increase overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> I should like here to make a special case for Cork which has probably one of the largest racegoing communities in the country but which has not, outside Mallow, got a racetrack.  It has trainers, numerous owners and a tremendous number of supporters who travel to tracks all over the country. I would support an increased allocation to the Racing Board without hesitation if they were to acquire and develop a horse racing track around Cork.  It is badly needed and it would be an excellent tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>The amendment recognises that there is a need to allocate increased moneys to the Racing Board but it also recognises that this money cannot be unlimited, that the Racing Board, like similar bodies, must be governed by general price restrictions. At this stage I ask the Taoiseach to convey from the House to the Board that from the increased funds they will have they will give very careful consideration to the Cork area.  Any investment there would be recouped threefold because there will be more people going in and betting with bookmakers, thereby providing greater revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I want to clear one misapprehension: the ceiling is 10 per cent.  The ceiling was 5 per cent in the old days and I repeat that it is not the intention to raise it to 10 per cent.  Unlike the parent Act, any order to increase the levy will now have to be laid on the Table of the Dáil.  There is no ceiling in the Bord na gCon Act and there has been no objection to that.  There is a requirement there that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must make an order agreeing to proposals in the case of Bord na gCon.  In this Bill, the Minister for Finance will do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having had 30 years' experience of the Racing Board, it would be utterly ridiculous when we bring in an amending Act in circumstances of changed money values that we would allow them only 1 per cent, and that they would have the obligation to come back to the House.  When we set up boards of this kind, unless we give them some flexibility it would be <Col N="277" /> impossible to expect them to do their job.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what Deputies Cronin and Crowley said about provincial tracks.  It is what one might call an unsolved racing mystery that there is only one track in Cork, a very large county with quite a number of training establishments.  In Kerry, where there are no, or very few, horses in training they run three successful race meetings.  There are historical reasons for this.  The fact is that they have festival meetings in Kerry which attract a clientele over and above normal race meeting attendances.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the board had a proposal in respect of a grading system but decided not to proceed with it on the basis that the number of runners had increased.  The board consider this matter from time to time.  I have not got figures available, but I understand one of the reasons for that suggested decision or draft plan was that some tracks which required capital expenditure on them were uneconomic from the board's point of view.  It is a known fact that a great deal of revenue comes from relatively few racetracks.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, despite the growth in the size of Dublin in the last quarter of a century, the only track to have closed down was a metropolitan track. It was privately owned and was sold. The number of metropolitan tracks was accordingly reduced from three to two.  Though I appreciate fully what Deputy Crowley said about Cork, speaking from memory I would say it is 50 years since a new racetrack was opened in Ireland.  Naas was the last one to have been opened.  All the other existing tracks were there.  Some smaller tracks, such as Miltown Malbay and Rathkeale were closed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  The same also applies to Ballinrobe.  A number of these small tracks did not. Another change in relatively recent times is that a number of racecourses which had a single or perhaps a two-or three-day meeting began to hold more frequent meetings.  That applies <Col N="278" /> to a great number of places such as Gorey, Punchestown, Fairyhouse and Galway which is a very important case. All these race more frequently and a good deal of the capital development has enabled races to be held more frequently because the tracks have been improved and they can run races on the parts of the track which have the heaviest wear and tear.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, I will have the views of Deputies about provincial racecourses conveyed to the Board and, of course, the Board will have an opportunity of reading the debates.  There is adequate safeguard in the section which requires the orders to be laid on the table of the Dáil, if it deems necessary to put down a motion and have the matter considered. It is true that it could take effect, that anything done between the placing of the motion and the decision and its consideration by the Dáil could take effect, but it is highly unlikely that this will happen.  In any even the Dáil has the same powers in this as amending legislation, except that it is a less cumbersome procedure.  This provides a safeguard that did not exist in the parent Act but exists in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment is the kernel of this matter and the only item of difference between us.  Our recommendation is a possible 6 per cent, but the Taoiseach's is a probable 6 per cent but a possible 10 per cent.  Despite what he said about the rein we can utilise to curb that, my belief is that any increase in the levy must be a deterrent to betting.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, 6 per cent is a good increase.  What was £100,000 will now become £120,000.  My personal attitude is that while I would reluctantly agree to a levy of 6 per cent, I would only agree to that because it was going to a very good purpose. Anything more would be unbearable. I am confident that while an increase of 1 per cent, from 5 to 6 per cent but really a 20 per cent increase in the volume of money collected, might be absorbed by backers, anything more would deter them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that to back one must be a little mad.  But to accept a levy which is twice as much, that <Col N="279" /> means one would have to be twice as mad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am confident we should tie this increase to 6 per cent. It is our duty to make laws or change existing legislation.  We would be foolish to allow any board the right to usurp our authority.  My attitude to the Racing Board&mdash;I have praised them and they have rightly earned that praise&mdash;is that they are all human beings.  Being human they are likely to err.  We are now asked by the Government to give them a free hand.  If one feels that one could get a little more money, it is only natural that one would look for the greater percentage. It must be remembered that if business is good and the Racing Board can attract more betting, the percentage they get will also bring more money to them.  If they are doing their work well they might never have to increase their percentages.</P>
      <P>As I said, it is our duty to exercise control.  In my view, 6 per cent is the maximum we should allow.  If they wanted a further increase, it would have to be laid before the House and the best way to deal with this would be to tie it to the 6 per cent.  If, in the course of time&mdash;and I hope it will be for many years before we hear about it again&mdash; we have to increase or even decrease the levy, that matter should come before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Taoiseach said but I am afraid we, on this side of the House, cannot agree with him.  Any increase in the levy of 5 per cent is something to be wary about.  We have agreed to 6 per cent&mdash; a 20 per cent increase&mdash;only on the basis that the prize money is being increased.  I think the increases have been in force since the 1st June, presumably on the basis of this Bill being passed and in the belief, as I understand from the Racing Board, that the further grants will be given to courses &mdash;particularly provincial courses&mdash; some of which are in difficulties at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The Taoiseach's argument seems to be based on the misapprehension that betting is fairly static.  It is not.  Over the past four years, from 1970 to 1974, there was an increase of something over 70 per cent, an average of nearly 20 per cent per annum.  With inflation running at its present rate, one could expect an increase in betting and, accordingly, in the levy of 20 per cent per annum in future years.  In his reply to the Second Stage debate last week the Taoiseach made a statement at column 1944, Volume 281 of the Official Report to the effect that 10 per cent in present day values is less than 5 per cent was in 1945.  By any standards that statement is not mathematically or otherwise correct.</P>
    <P>This year, without any increase in the rate of the levy, the Racing Board could reasonably expect to get 20 per cent more than they did last year.  I do not know what the up-to-date figures for bookmakers' turnover are but one can see every day the up-to-date figures for the tote turnover because they are published.  On average there is an increase of 10 to 15 per cent in tote turnover.  That would be fully reflected, I have no doubt, in bookmakers' turnover as well.</P>
    <P>Betting is extremely buoyant.  It is one of the few things in the country at the present time which is buoyant, because virtually nothing else is.  It seems a pity that when we have something that is buoyant and is more than holding its own, the Racing Board should be seeking to take more out of it, when its very buoyancy is increasing each year the yield the Board gets from it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is provision in this Bill for the laying of these orders on the table of each House.  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that that does not mean a great deal in practice.  If the Government are adamant about allowing it, it will be allowed anyway.  The only time I can remember when an order of this nature was laid on the table of the House and disallowed, was about four years ago when I disallowed one in relation to solicitors' remuneration <Col N="281" /> which had been made by the Incorporated Law Society.  In practice, this means that if a Government approve of it, it will get through anyway.  If it happened that either the Dáil or the Seanad decided to disallow such an order, it is not normally done until the 20th or 21st sitting day after it is tabled.  The 20th or 21st sitting day could, if the summer recess intervened, cover a period of three or possibly four months from the time it was originally made and laid on the table.  You would then have the very incongruous situation that a higher rate of levy would have been in force for possibly as long as three or four months and then they would have to go back to a lower rate.</P>
    <P>In view of inflation and in view of the fact that, happily, there is an excellent buoyancy in betting both with bookmakers and on the tote, the maximum we should allow is an increase of 20 per cent as set out in the amendment, and not 100 per cent as suggested in the Bill.  Once again I urge that point of view on the Taoiseach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally 5 per cent is less than 10 per cent.  The point I was making was that, allowing for the changed circumstances and the drop in the value of money, it is reasonable, after so long, to provide for an increase of this nature.  As I said, in the past the board originally had a rate of 5 per cent.  Within the first couple of years that was cut down to 2½ per cent.  It was brought up later.  The safeguard of laying it on the table of the House is adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that betting has been buoyant, it is equally a fact, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, that although the total shows an increase over last year it is less than the rate of inflation.  The other factor is that <Col N="282" /> nowadays racegoers also expect much better facilities.  In addition, the board spent a great deal of money on improving tracks both from the point of view of safety and the quality of the tracks, and so on.  A great deal of capital work has been undertaken in improving stands, accommodation, catering, and so on. One of the complaints commonly made in many places is that the standards provided are not good enough and that they should be much better.  It is for that type of work as well as for stakes that this money is required.</P>
    <P>The main thing is to increase stakes.  As Deputies have mentioned, stakes are being increased from 1st June.  It was hoped that the legislation would have been through in order to provide for an increase in the levy.  This is reasonable allowing for the experience we have had of the board.  They have indicated that they do not intend to increase it beyond 6 per cent.  In order to do that they have to get the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Over and above that, the order has to be laid on the table and, if the House decides to annul it, it can be annulled.</P>
    <P>It is correct, as Deputy O'Malley said, that most of these orders are not dealt with until almost the last few days of the time scheduled.  It happened on very few occasions only that orders were annulled, but the power is there.  Up to now this power was not in the Racing Board and Racecourses Act.  It is in the Bórd na gCon legislation and we are now including the same power here.  It is less cumbersome than having to introduce amending legislation and, at the same time, it provides the same safeguard.</P>

      <P>We would much prefer that the figure of 10 per cent did not appear in it but as we have voted on that just now I do not propose to have the matter put again but, potentially, the percentage is too high.  Now that the power is given to the Racing Board to make regulations up to this limit we have no guarantee that they will not use that power and use it quickly although we are assured that in the current year the figure of 6 per cent will not be exceeded. However, we would be much happier if the figure did not exceed this 6 per cent which, as I have pointed out, is, in effect, an increase of 20 per cent and not only 1 per cent as might appear from a first glimpse of the figures.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that amendment No. 3 has been ruled out of order.  It was an important amendment but it was ruled out on the grounds that it would constitute a charge on revenue.  It is one that could be put down by the Taoiseach or by a member of the Government but not by a Private Member.  On the section, but in relation to the amendment, may I say that it is a matter which should be looked at carefully by anyone interested in the welfare of racing?  One of the reasons why we and the British, as opposed to virtually every other country in the world, have been able to put only very little money into racing is that in Britain and here the State takes the tax that is secured from off-course betting, whereas if it were put directly into racing, as happens in Italy, France and elsewhere, it would make a tremendous difference.  I do not know what is the figure regarding tax on off-course betting for the current year but for last year it was about £3 million.  Presumably it will be more this year because of the increase in the rate to 20 per cent, an abnormally high rate.  We were seeking to have only half that amount devoted, through the Racing Board, to racing because it would more than double the income of the Racing Board and, consequently, revolutionise racing.  It would mean that prize money could be doubled, that the grants to tracks could be doubled and that, generally, there would be a big improvement in the racing scene.  Therefore, I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to consider a step such as this either in a Finance Bill or in some other Bill that would be suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would urge the Government to consider this step.  Even if the amount collected in tax on off-course betting were to remain at £3 million, to devote 50 per cent of it to <Col N="286" /> racing would mean an extra £1,500,000 for the industry.  This would help to bring us in line with English prize money and would result in a vast improvement in racing and in the bloodstock industry.  We cannot hope to approach the levels that obtain in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The opposition to this is the principle that it has never been the practice to allocate specific revenue for specific purposes.  Deputy O'Malley raises the question of channelling more money into racing but that is the purpose of the Bill.  The question of using money accruing from bets placed other than on the course raises the wider question which we discussed here in the course of the Second Stage, that is, that in this country we have not the totalisator monopoly system that operates in France but we have the same system as operates in Britain.  To change this would be to change something that is fundamental. Undoubtedly, such change might provide more money for racing but I do not know whether it would enable us to retain the character of Irish racing. Certainly, it would involve the elimination of bookmakers.  The other difference is that in France there are no football pools, whereas some of the money placed here in bets is on the football pools.  This is not, strictly speaking, supposed to happen but some money that might otherwise be placed in bets within the country goes across the water because of our proximity to that island.  However, it is impracticable to designate the revenue from any one source to specific expenditure.  It has always been standard practice that revenue into the Exchequer is regarded as revenue for the Exchequer and that its disbursement subsequently is a matter for decision by the Government.</P>

      <P>On the question of expenses, one of the anomalies is that no effort is being made to change the situation in this legislation.

      <P>I made the observation on Second Stage that the penalties proposed here seem in some cases to be very high indeed, including an increase in one instance from the existing fine of £100 to a new fine on indictment of £5,000. That is a very large increase indeed. I presume the board are satisfied that they need these heavier penalties.  I realise that the evasion of levy would cost them a great deal of money if it takes place.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances I do not think one would oppose it but I would like to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that in subsection (1) £500 is being substituted for £100 as the fine on summary conviction. At least, by implication it is. It goes on to say, &ldquo;on conviction... on indictment&rdquo;.  There is a case that I <Col N="290" /> recall in which the Supreme Court held that a fine of more than £200 by the District Court was not in the Supreme Court's view a minor penalty.  I can recall in preparing Bills being advised by the previous Attorney General that summary monetary penalties should not exceed £200.  I just mention this to draw the attention of the Taoiseach to the fact that it is possible that the summary aspect of this fine may be excessive.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 52, to add the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;: provided always that any regulation increasing the levy provided for in section 27 of the Principal Act shall not come into operation until it has been passed by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment, as I indicated on amendment No. 2, is to avoid the difficulty that notwithstanding the fact that under section 9 the Racing Board's regulation would now have to be laid before the House and could be annulled within 21 days, the section contains the usual qualification that any annulment would be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. I pointed out to the Taoiseach, and would do so again now, that in practice these statutory motions for annulment are not ordered by the Government until the 20th or 21st sitting day after the making and laying before the House of the regulation.  The 21st sitting day could and sometimes does in practice mean an interval of three, four or possibly five months from the date <Col N="291" /> of the making, particularly if the Summer Recess intervenes.  The normal number of days for the House to sit in a week is three, which means that 21 sitting days would cover seven sitting weeks.  If after six sitting weeks the House recesses for three months there would then be an interval of 4½ months between the making of a regulation and its discussion by either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Of course, in the case of the Seanad the periods are even longer because, with the exception of the last few weeks, the Seanad has not normally sat as frequently as the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In my amendment I do not seek to cover every regulation which would be made by the Racing Board, because it would be unreasonable, but I do suggest in the amendment that where the board makes a regulation increasing the levy provided for in section 27 of the Principal Act as amended now by this Bill, it shall not come into operation until it has been passed by Dáil Éireann because it is, of course, a regulation in the nature of taxation.</P>
    <P>If the Government, for example, as they did this very year, seek to increase the rate of tax on off-course betting, they have to pass a Financial Resolution here after the budget, as they did this year, and it has to be confirmed within three or four months&mdash; whatever the period is&mdash;in the Finance Bill.  Essentially, there is from the point of view of the payer of the levy no difference between what is called off-course betting and what is called on-course levy.  In fact, it is not usual to refer to the on-course levy as a levy at all; it is always called a tax.  Both bookmakers and punters refer to it on the course as a tax and it is regarded by the general public as the same thing.  Therefore, because it is, in effect, from the point of view of the general public an imposition of tax I do not think the Racing Board should be allowed to do it simply by way of regulation without reference to this House unless there is a resolution passed by the House bringing it into effect.</P>
    <P>The proposal is confined simply to regulations proposing to raise the levy <Col N="292" /> and does not apply to any other regulation. I think it is needed here, particularly in the light of the fact that a long interval, potentially 4½ months could elapse&mdash;and may well elapse this year or any other time the levy is increased&mdash;during the summer.  So far as increases in levy are concerned, which are in the nature of taxation, it is only right that the Dáil should approve them in advance in the same way that the House must do by way of financial resolution after a budget if the Government propose to increase the off-course betting tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have discussed the principle of this Bill.  Under the amending legislation provision is made for the purpose of laying orders before the Dáil.  This is a departure from what was in the original Act.  In that Act if the Racing Board wanted to increase the levy or vary it, all they had to do was to get the consent of the Minister for Finance.  This amending Bill provides in this section that orders made must be laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that they can be annulled within a period of 21 days.  With very few exceptions&mdash;there was one in the case of certain salary increases, and a few others&mdash;all sections dealing with resolutions are in what is known as the negative form.  In other words, they take effect unless an annulling order is made.  It is highly unlikely that the Racing Board would operate this procedure without getting a reasonable assurance regarding the length of time.  It is obvious that any change in the levy would require a good deal of thought and generally some notice is given.  It is a matter that comes before the board, is considered by them and when they make a decision it is referred to the Minister for Finance.  This is a safeguard that was not there before and it is in the usual form.  Anything else would involve getting sanction in advance and, obviously, it would be more cumbersome and would involve much greater delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy O'Malley's amendment.  It is <Col N="293" /> unfair to on-course punters that they are not treated in the same way as SP punters in the offices.  As the Deputy pointed out, it is regarded as taxation whether it is paid in SP offices or at the racecourses.  If the SP taxation is increased&mdash;it is rather unlikely because it is 20 per cent now&mdash; the matter must be debated and passed by this House.  The Taoiseach has emphasised that an order will be laid before the House but that is not the same thing.  From 1970 to 1974 the volume of stake money on the racecourses increased from £11.8 million to £18.4 million, an increase of approximately 70 per cent.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the huge increase in the volume of betting on racecourses and the present trend, the Racing Board should be compelled to come before the House, as in the case of this Bill and in the case of an increase in taxation on SP punters.  We do not think it should be made any easier to increase the present levy on the racecourses without a full debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to impress on the Taoiseach that it is imperative for him to accept this amendment in view of the result of the vote a few moments ago.  When the discussion was going on about whether it should be a possible 10 per cent or whether it should be tied to a 6 per cent levy, the Taoiseach gave us an assurance that it would only be 6 per cent and if the Racing Board want an increase they will have to come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley pointed out that it can happen that an increase can be in operation for four-and-a-half to five months before it would come before the House.  Therefore, a levy increase would be implemented without the permission of the House.  Our amendment is simply to ensure that the House will not be faced with a <i>fait accompli</i>, that we will have a suggestion that the levy be increased but we will not be faced with a situation where the levy has been increased and where we have to decide whether to reject that increase or accept the suggested new increase.  If <Col N="294" /> the Racing Board are in difficulties surely they will have the time to put the matter before us rather than increase the levy and then send it to us for sanction.</P>

The only difference on this occasion is that we require them to lay the regulation before the Dáil.  Up to now all they had to do was to get the consent of the Minister for Finance without coming to the Dáil.  I did not appreciate that this matter would drag on.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent increase in the price of sugar was approved by the Government on the advice of the National Prices Commission, who outlined the reasons for their recommendation in their report for February, 1975, copies of which are available in the Library of the Oireachtas. At the time the increase was approved the world price of sugar was substantially above the Irish domestic level.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not ask the sugar company to look at the matter again? There has been a substantial fall, as the Parliamentary Secretary agrees, in the world price of sugar.  The two reasons given by the NPC for recommending this increase, which the Government were free to accept or not as they saw fit, were that the world price of sugar was above the Irish domestic price, and that increased prices would be paid to farmers for beet this year. The farmers cannot get the increased prices until they harvest the beet in October or November and the world price has fallen substantially and in these circumstances would the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Minister, not immediately instruct the sugar company to reduce drastically the price of sugar being charged to Irish domestic consumers?</P>

      <P>Normally, there are some variations in the retail prices of baler twine because the discounts obtained by traders will vary depending mainly on the time of purchase and the quantity purchased.  The variations this year are greater than usual because some traders are carrying stocks purchased last year at the lower prices then prevailing which they were unable to dispose of in <Col N="307" /> 1974 owing to the sharp drop in demand resulting from the poor harvest. As these exceptional variations in prices are likely to disappear when the old stocks have been disposed of, I do not propose to introduce measures to control the price of baler twine at retail level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want merely to deal with a few points in relation to section 2 and its effects on the economy and employment.  There is no doubt that it will have a major effect on employment because people realise now that anybody with money deciding to come to this country will be taxed to the hilt. That is the answer to all that.  Furthermore, at this time the country is very badly in need of capital and of investment especially when many industries that we have are collapsing and many others are about to collapse.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole taxation package now before the House and especially this Bill will have an adverse effect on industrialists who intend to start business in this country.  Why should anybody start a business here now?  If an industry expands, irrespective of what it is, it will be liable for tax.  You need not go far in Dublin city until you find the smallest property is worth over £100,000.  I am sure there are property owners in this city who have property that will be valued at at least £5 million.  Will the valuing not be done by the Valuation Office?  They are not far out in their valuations and will not let anybody away with very much.</P>
      <P>If the Government force this Bill through the House it will have serious repercussions on an economy which is faltering and starved for capital. Nobody can deny that.  The Taoiseach recently said we were living on borrowed time and, I suppose, on borrowed money also, as much as we are able to get.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs is now on a pilgrimage all over the world to see where he can get a few pounds in francs or in marks or anything else to bolster up this country and keep the Coalition Government in office until the members get their pensions out of it.  Then, as before, they can throw it to the wolves or to anybody.  It will be left to the incoming Government to decide what road to follow.  If we continue on the road we are now following I can see nothing but complete collapse.  In the situation we now have the present taxation package will inevitably bring about chaos.  Why would anybody with money build a factory here now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers do not know what effect this Bill will have on them.  All of us know that many companies have gone into liquidation.  It <Col N="358" /> is happening practically every day but the papers are doing the best they can to cover it up.  Yesterday they spoke about a package deal the Government were about to introduce.  We have been told that the Government have decided to call in the trade unions, the employers and the farmers. It is not the job of those organisations to run the affairs of government. They were not elected to do so and the Government should not ask anyone else to do their business.  A Government are not worthy of their name if they do that.</P>
      <P>This taxation will hit every factory. The result will be that in order to balance their books the companies will declare many of their workers redundant.  This is the new method they use.  If workers seek an increase the companies pay it but then they try to see how they may prune their work force.  The result is that the number of unemployed are increasing every week.</P>
      <P>I am not against wealth tax.  However, the timing of this Bill is wrong in view of the desperate state of the economy and our balance of payments. Yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce tried to cover up this fact.  He told us we should not state the facts because it would do the country harm.  The Taoiseach recently stated that our balance of payments is running at approximately £300 million and that it is the highest in 24 countries.  It is obvious to anyone that we cannot continue borrowing. Our creditors will want to know how the money will be repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot look forward to an expansion in the economy.  Slowly but surely it is grinding to a halt and the workers will be hardest hit.  The industrialists are frightened of this legislation.  It would be all right if we were a highly industrialised country, if we were like countries such as America, and Libya at the moment, who have tremendous resources.  We have no such resources.  They may say we have mines but the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been messing around in connection with this matter and has done nothing. Some of the mines are closing.  A mine <Col N="359" /> in Tipperary will close at the end of next month with 350 redundancies. This is happening because of the measures taken by the Government. There is fear in the country and that is one of the worst things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with all the Bill and the effect it will have. It will have an adverse effect on all walks of life and eventually it will affect the worker.  The workers do not realise this because they are being <Col N="360" /> brainwashed.  &ldquo;Informed sources,&rdquo; whoever they are, make statements in the Press and when one asks who the sources are ignorance is pleaded.  These informed sources say this Bill will have no effect at all on the economy.  If that is so, why do the Government not withdraw the Bill?  They will not withdraw it because the Labour Party have put the whip on Fine Gael; if Fine Gael does not do this Labour will not stay with them.  Many Fine Gael members are opposed to this but there is nothing they can do.  They have to row in, or else.</P>
      <P>Workers will be affected by this Bill. There is bound to be an adverse effect on expansion.  Nobody can deny that. We badly need employment but this Bill will frighten off industrialists. People will not invest money in the country.  If there is no investment the capital resources available will become dried up and then there will be nothing left.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands must realise the effect this will have.  It has already had an effect because it is running millions out of the country.  An effort may be made to counteract that statement by saying that the returns from the Central Bank show that not to be true.  Remember inflation is running at about 24 per cent and that has an adverse effect.  When it comes to providing more jobs the money will not be there to create the jobs.  The number of inquiries to the IDA have fallen off.  Potential industrialists are frightened off by this taxation.  The grants are not now as attractive as they were in earlier years.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that this taxation will affect the worker because industrialists will not set up here and job opportunity will become negligible. Most companies are operating on borrowed finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to deny Deputies to speak on this Bill but we had a very limited number of speakers. I wish we had more from both sides of the House.  The discussion we had from those who contributed was very informative and constructive.  I should like to acknowledge the offer of assistance that was given by Deputy Haughey, Deputy O'Connell, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Esmonde in making this Bill as effective as possible.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will recognise, as I do, that it is a very complex Bill but that is because the misuse of drugs and the treatment for it is a complex problem.  I have endeavoured to approach this Bill in two ways.  The first is to adopt a tough approach, so to speak, to criminality and unethical behaviour. The consensus of opinion in the House was that this was the approach that should be made in respect of criminality and unethical behaviour. This Bill not only adopts a tough approach to such people as pedlars and pushers, but also adopts a humane approach in the treatment and rehabilitation of drug abusers.</P>
      <P>The emphasis which I insisted on when I became Minister for Health and saw the original Bill was that there would be sanctions but, above all, that there would be care for those who were hooked on a particular drug or drugs.  I will certainly consider any suggestions made to me if it is believed that the Bill can be improved to combat this awful problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to reply to some of the main points but not all of the points.  This Bill, like many Bills that go through the House, is essentially a Committee Stage Bill.  There are many legal complications involved and for that reason we could do a far better job if we were to leave the detail to Committee Stage.  I hope, in view of the fact that the House is more or less unanimous in its approach, although some Deputies have certain reservations, <Col N="362" /> that this might be put through a special committee of the House.  I should also like to leave the Schedules to Committee Stage because most of us, with the exception of Deputy O'Connell who specialises in drugs and medicines generally, would admit that it would be much more efficient and and workmanlike to deal with the Schedules on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in many of the speeches has been on the drug cannabis and I will refer to that later on. The debate prompted approaches from the medical profession since the beginning of the Second Stage.  As far as the main provisions of the Bill are concerned, particularly in respect of the medical and other professions, approaches were made to me with suggested amendments.  I will, of course, consider these and will, undoubtedly, have some amendments of my own.</P>
    <P>Pretty long speeches were made during the course of the debate, particularly by Deputy O'Connell.  We had many and varied accounts of drug addiction and how the drugs were obtained, how they were peddled and pushed.  Also, some pretty strong words were said about the medical profession in regard to prescribing. That is something on which I do not care to comment now because as far as I am concerned a prescription from a doctor is a prescription from a doctor. It is a matter entirely for the medical profession whether or not a doctor disagrees there should be prescribing of this, that or the other drug.  I do not think we have irresponsible members of the medical, dental or veterinary professions in this country, at least not to any great extent, although there may be a small number.</P>
    <P>There was also reference to the fact that these drugs were readily available in the streets.  Deputy Haughey informed the House that his own children could tell him that in some of the principal thoroughfares in Dublin some of these drugs were readily available.  I do not disagree with that and I certainly do not disagree with him when he says he got this information from his children <Col N="363" /> whom, I assume, are teenagers and would have knowledge of the various practices and some idea of the drug scene in Dublin.  It is difficult to assess or reckon the number of drug addicts here.  The only real evidence we have is compiled from court cases.  These are no real indications of the problem although there has been some increase in the number of charges brought in regard to drug abuse in recent years. In 1972 the figure was 201; in 1973, 270 and for 1974 the estimated figure was 294.</P>
    <P>While the numbers are not big there has been a growth in the number of charges against those found in possession of or taking drugs.  I am bound to say that the majority of these charges were in connection with cannabis.  I am informed that as far as the charges in connection with cannabis are concerned they are in respect of the taking of the drug once. Nobody knows the real extent of the problem and the figures I quoted are no consolation to anybody.  We must be prepared to deal with the possible growth of drug abuse.  Other countries have been affected in a bad way by extensive drug taking.  It is the job of the Minister for Health, the Government and this House to ensure that the growth does not continue.  They have to endeavour to bring about a diminution in the use of the drugs referred to in the Schedules.</P>
    <P>We must also see that the number of hard core drug takers, the opiate or poly abusers who number about 100, does not increase.  These are the most deadly of all drugs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey pointed out that drug taking was not confined to Dublin City.  I do not think there was any necessity to say that, but some people are under the impression that the drug problem is confined to Dublin. A number of other places have been identified, through court cases, as places where drugs are taken, particularly seaside resorts during the summer months.  At those resorts the practice of drug taking and drug peddling takes place.  That is not any consolation to us but if we are to know the magnitude of the problem research is necessary.  Frankly, I do not <Col N="364" /> know what type of research is likely to yield such information in the present circumstances.  There is the possibility that the medical profession could give information as to the numbers suspected of being drug addicts.</P>
    <P>I do not say it is only the young people who use drugs or try to avail of drugs that are controlled.  The emphasis appears to be on drug taking amongst young people in various places.  There was a suggestion that drugs were freely available at a certain teaching establishment here; that they were manufactured at little cost and with the minimum of trouble. Enquiries at second level education might give us information with regard to the abuse of drugs and an indication of the attitude of those attending such schools towards drugs, particularly cannabis.  The point was made, and rightly so, that as legislators we are suspect as far as our credibility is concerned in tackling this problem. When one talks about drug taking, as Deputy O'Connell said, one excludes the abuse of alcohol and tobacco which are drugs.  He pointed to the fact that these are tolerated and accepted in society, but this dilemma is not peculiar to Ireland; it is facing the whole of western society.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent years that it has been recognised and accepted that alcohol and tobacco are drugs.  One can become addicted very quickly to tobacco and have that addiction for a long time to the detriment of one's health.  Some years ago tobacco was accepted as a social practice.  In the last 30 years the only criticism that was ever made about cigarettes was that it would stunt one's growth.  Unfortunately, we know that it is a drug, addiction to which causes serious ailments, including the dreaded one of lung cancer.  While alcohol is in the same bracket I do not think anyone would advocate total abstinence from drink.  Members must confess that it would be difficult to put back the clock and impose a ban on alcohol and tobacco.  There would be many implications if these drugs were abolished or declared illegal.</P>
    <P>The only way to combat them is by education and propaganda.  As far as <Col N="365" /> educational propaganda is concerned the House will agree that the Department of Health contributed in a big way towards trying to induce people, particularly young people, not to take up the tobacco or alcohol habit. Acceptance of alcohol and tobacco is no argument for adding to society's misery by being equally liberal with drugs.  Alcohol was introduced thousands of years ago, and we are told that Sir Walter Raleigh introduced the smoking habit to Britain and Ireland. If people at that time recognised the ill effects they can have it is possible they would have been banned.</P>
    <P>However, there is a distinction between addiction to drugs included in the Schedules to this Bill and addiction to alcohol and tobacco.  We are aware that addicts to the drugs included in the Schedules are prepared to and have stolen them in order to satisfy their needs.  They would be prepared to kill in order to obtain a cure; I am aware this has not happened here. Deputy O'Connell mentioned the behaviour of people addicted to LSD. He told us that some of them want to jump out of windows in five-storey houses, and believe they are supermen and can do all sorts of things.  Therefore, in regard to drugs there is a fair big margin between them and the two I mentioned, alcohol and tobacco, but it is still no defence for the abuse of alcohol and tobacco.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell and Deputy Dr. Byrne talked about cannabis. They are both in the medical profession and both of them had different ideas on it.  Therefore it is necessary for us to consider very carefully the three Schedules which define the three categories of drugs proposed to be controlled.  Deputy Dr. Byrne was absolutely against the use of cannabis, and Deputy Dr. O'Connell appeared to be in favour of allowing cannabis or at least putting it into a schedule other than Schedule 2; I think he wanted to put it into Schedule 3.  However, as he said himself, it is a very emotive question, and it has been a very controversial question not only here but in various parts of the western world.</P>
    <P>There has been a lobby in a loose kind of way for the legalisation of cannabis, <Col N="366" /> but I must say that western societies appear to be caught on the wrong foot here.  The lobby to which I refer points to the widespread tolerance of tobacco and alcohol and the apparent failure to answer scientifically and properly the claim that cannabis is harmless.  On the first point, may I say the use of alcohol as a beverage has been accepted for generations, especially since the failure of the famous prohibition laws in the United States of America.  However, the important thing is that no western country has permitted the use of cannabis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. O'Connell quoted various reports suggesting that the possession and use of small quantities of cannabis was not of any significance, and that a person should not be regarded as a criminal for using that drug or weed, as it is called.  This is a matter of history.  The younger generation may feel that it is incongruous that we should allow one drug to be freely used and are not prepared to legalise another drug.  This does not mean that we want to talk down to or rebuke young people who regard our attitude on drugs and alcohol as not credible.  The vast majority of young people in this and most other countries are sincere people who look for truth and good leadership, and their values are basically sound.  There is a minority who do not wish to conform with established traditions and values.  I want to say that this Bill is not an attempt to repress or rebuke that minority.  We are not trying to give a glib answer to revolutionary or drop-out philosophies or social values. What we are trying to do in this Bill is to set a course for our children and their children which we hope they will thank us for, even though, as I said, they may question our credibility when we speak about drugs and still allow alcohol and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, may I refer to what Deputy Dr. O'Connell said in a very long speech.  He talked about scientific evidence, and he said that he was bewildered at the number of reports from various sources on different aspects of the drug problem. He referred to the Wootton Report which got such wide publicity at the <Col N="367" /> time of its publication.  He also referred to the report of our own working party on drug abuse which was established some few years ago and which issued its report shortly after it was established.  It is true that the working party, like the Wootton Committee, recommended that possession of a small amount of cannabis, other than for peddling or pushing, should not normally be regarded as a crime to be punished by imprisonment. I think the Deputy will agree, however, that this point is counterbalanced by the other specific recommendations made by the working party on drug abuse at that time.  I should like to quote from their report in relation to cannabis:</P>
    <P>In the light of present knowledge it cannot be said that cannabis is harmless, especially in regard to long-term and frequent use.  Therefore, it should remain subject to control.</P>
    <P>He also talked about various reports, recommendations and observations that had been made by other organisations. He referred to a paper published by the Division of Narcotic Drugs of the United Nations in October, 1974, in which there was this comment, and again I quote:</P>
    <P>Among scientists working in the field it would seem that there is a general consensus that cannabis is dangerous&mdash;opinions differing, however, on the degree of the danger to the individual and to society.  It seems that, as progressively more scientific facts are discovered about cannabis, the more one becomes aware of its potential dangers.</P>
    <P>It goes on to give a summary of all the evidence elicited from a lengthy series of research projects and concludes with the statement:</P>
    <P>it should nevertheless be recalled that the World Health Organisation Expert Committee on Drug Dependence, at its sixteenth session, strongly reaffirmed the opinions expressed in its previous reports that cannabis is a drug of dependence, producing public health and <Col N="368" /> social problems, and that its control must be maintained.</P>
    <P>The main point I am trying to make is that in the light of present knowledge we have little option but to maintain control of cannabis.  There may be room for argument as to the degree and nature of this control, but this Bill makes a significant change from the present situation by providing for a lower penalty for simple possession of cannabis as compared with &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drugs.  This is as far as any sensible Government can be expected to go at this stage.  It does not take full recognition of the case for &ldquo;decriminalisation&rdquo; of personal use which was so strongly advocated in the First Report of the US National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse.  But, as that report points out, account had to be taken of the extent to which the use of cannabis had then become ingrained in American society. It should also be remembered that the United States Government did not act on any suggestion that cannabis for personal use should be &ldquo;decriminalised&rdquo;. As I have said before, to my knowledge and that of my Department, there is no country in the western world which has allowed the use of cannabis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said the Bill did not contain any clause which stated specifically that drug-taking was not an offence.  It would not be practicable to define this, and it would be very difficult to enforce such a provision in practice; there is the question of blood sample tests and so on. But in any case all the controls are aimed at preventing the misuse of drugs and this, in itself, means drug-taking. The Bill goes further than suggested by the Deputy.  All that is necessary now is to prove the possession of drugs and to determine for what purpose.  Section 3 makes provision for the illegal possession of a scheduled drug and drugs that would be used for self or supply.</P>
    <P>He also said that the Bill did not distinguish between hard and soft drugs.  May I say that this distinction is broadly made in the Schedules which contain three items of various drugs?  As far as the classification of <Col N="369" /> drugs is concerned, this would be a matter for a committee.  I am a layman and not a doctor, and to be quite honest, apart from not knowing what the bases of these drugs are, I could not pronounce half their names and therefore it would be something which should be debated in a committee, for example, as to whether a particular drug should be classified as category 1, category 2 or category 3, or whether there should be a change.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell was very tough on those who prescribed barbiturates and suggested that they were much more dangerous and should be regarded as such.  In the Schedules there are various types of barbiturates and I am afraid that I could not give any judgment as to how potent they are, what side effects they have, whether they are addictive or not, and these matters certainly would be matters for argument in committee.  The classification is purely for the scale of penalties for offences when the Schedules are finally determined.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 regulations would be made to provide for sharper and more concrete distinctions between hard and soft drugs.  It will also control by regulation the availability of various drugs according to the needs of medical practice and dangers associated with their use as medicine, so I think we have sufficient safeguards in that section by bringing in proper amendments to the Schedule to show the distinction between hard and soft drugs and also, as I said, regulations with regard to availability of various drugs for the professions, doctors, dentists and veterinary surgeons.</P>
    <P>There was also raised the importance of distinguishing between the pusher or pedlar on the one hand, and the pusher addict on the other, and I certainly agree with the Deputy on this point, which was made by several Deputies: the pedlar, no mercy; the pusher addict, maybe some mercy because he is addicted and he needs to be treated and cared for and if possible, rehabilitated, but one of the big differences in this Bill is shown in section 28.  The Bill in itself is a good Bill but when I read it, I believed that we should help certain of these people <Col N="370" /> rather than just put them into jail because they have taken cannabis or some other drug for the first time. This section is designed to enable the court to distinguish between the pusher who sells drugs for criminal gain and the addict who pushes to finance his own drug habit, his own need for drugs.  The section was welcomed by those who spoke because it makes it mandatory on the court to secure comprehensive medical reports, educational reports, reports on the social circumstances of a convicted person, and it must consider these before deciding how it will dispose of the individual by way of sentence or the treatment option afforded to it by the section.</P>
    <P>If Deputies will look at section 28, they will see that such a person who is an addict but not a pusher will have the law stretched to the utmost to ensure that within a particular period after receipt of a report on his general health, his social background and educational background the court will decide whether or not that person should be helped to the extent of being allowed out on parole, so to speak, and to report at a drug centre or to opt to go to some residential treatment centre.  I believe we must be humane as far as these people are concerned.  I do not think that anybody in the House or outside it will have the slightest sympathy for the pedlar.  Therefore that procedure defined in section 28 is to ensure that the court does distinguish between the two types to which Deputy O'Connell referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde queried section 15 with regard to the offence of possession of drugs for unlawful supply or sale. I suppose that doubt about the quantity of drugs reasonably to be assumed not to be for a person's own immediate use was what he had in mind, but I would like to point out that in section 17, again as distinct from the first Bill, there is a clause which says that &ldquo;other relevant circumstances&rdquo; must be taken account of and therefore it may not be necessary at all to rely on quantity.  As I have said, the original Bill did not include this and a person in possession of a controlled drug was practically <Col N="371" /> automatically convicted under the Bill. Therefore it may not be necessary to rely on quantity alone.  The reference to &ldquo;quantity and other relevant circumstances&rdquo; was inserted to meet certain criticisms that without these words the original section placed too heavy a burden on the defendant or the accused, that unless he could prove innocence, there was absolute presumption of guilt, and I do not think that anybody in the House intended that that should be so.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed by Deputy Haughey and various other Deputies about the powers to be given to the Garda.  I personally believe that if the law is to be properly enforced, powers of search are necessary.  This is not the only piece of legislation in which the Garda have power of search.  I remember a Local Government measure which is now in operation wherein a garda has power to stop a car where he suspects that, for instance, a car has no lights, has bald tyres or this or that defect.  If a garda has that power in respect of a motor car, he should surely have the same power to search, if he is reasonably satisfied that a person has offended against this piece of legislation.  In any case, as far as drug offences are concerned, detection is very difficult. I do not know anything about drugs myself but I am informed that there can be very powerful lethal doses in very small containers.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficulty for the Garda that the peddling of drugs and passing them on to other people takes place between two willing parties as distinct from the situation in which somebody is assaulted or a house is broken into and there is a complainant, and there is the other side to the story, but as far as drug abuse is concerned we have people who are willing parties to the offence and if we do not give the Garda the fullest power we can within our Constitution and our ordinary laws, I do not think we will ever come near to preventing drug abuses and minimising them particularly in respect of certain drugs. I certainly would deprecate police procedures associated with a totalitarian <Col N="372" /> state, and I do not think anybody here would tolerate any extra powers being given to the Garda to that extent, but, if our society wishes to combat drug addiction and pushing we must allow the gardaí to do the job properly.</P>
    <P>Knowing the Garda as we do, I do not think they will abuse the powers they are being given in this Bill.  As I have said, they must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed and this is provided in section 23.  I have sufficient trust in the Garda to know that they will not act in an unreasonable or irresponsible way.  The Garda Drug Squad were praised by Deputy O'Connell and I should like to add my voice to what he said and particularly in relation to the person in charge, Sergeant Mullins.</P>
    <P>Concern was expressed about the application of sections 7 to 12.  They are long and appear to be complicated but if they read them two or three times Deputies will understand their logic and the necessity for having them in the Bill.  They are designed to cater for irresponsible over-prescribing of controlled drugs.  As I said earlier, I do not know, nor do my Department know, of any widespread irresponsible over-prescribing of drugs by the medical profession. These sections were framed in consultation with the medical profession who had no objection to them generally. They may suggest some amendments in respect of some sections, subsections or words here and there but, generally, they have agreed that the sections are acceptable to them and, I presume, to the other two professions who will be engaged in prescribing drugs.  The sections provide the mechanics for investigation and appeal for a doctor or a dentist who might become involved.  If there are reservations about any of these sections, I would be willing to hear the views of any Deputies.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about section 24 which deals with the inspection of records of legitimate commercial dealings in drugs.  It was raised by Deputy O'Connell.  All that is required here is to have covering authority for enforcing <Col N="373" /> officers to have access to such records.  I have a reservation about it&mdash;the section may be too elaborate &mdash;and on Committee Stage if there are Deputies who believe the section is too elaborate, I would be prepared to consider amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to section 36 which makes provision for obtaining search warrants by gardaí.  There is nothing new about this.  This type of section was included in the Dangerous Drugs Act but section 26 makes it less cumbersome to obtain warrants to search premises.  Under the Bill a search warrant can be granted by a district justice or peace commissioner on the application of any member of the Garda Síochána.  Search warrants are needed, sometimes at very short notice.  There could be a tip off about a consignment of drugs, there could be a tip off that a certain person is in possession of drugs and is at a certain place trying to peddle them and it is only fair and right that the Garda should be facilitated to obtain warrants with the greatest speed possible.  The present position is that a search warrant can be obtained only by a chief superintendent through a district justice.  This can be very difficult and frustrating because in the meantime a garda may suspect that there are drugs at a certain place or in a certain house and they may have been moved by the time the search warrant has been granted and the culprits would have flown.</P>
    <P>I referred to section 28 which provides options for treatment and rehabilitation. These options are open to the courts.  The emphasis is on cure if possible.  This has been welcomed by every Deputy who has contributed. The section is long and may appear to be complicated and slightly cumbersome but the general idea behind it has been applauded by all Deputies who spoke.  There were difficulties in drafting and I am open to suggestions for amendments.</P>
    <P>Deputies emphasised the need for educating the public.  I am keenly aware of the need to acquaint teachers, parents, youth clubs and others of the existence of drug abuse <Col N="374" /> and I think we can expect much more help than in the past from the Health Education Bureau.  With the assistance of voluntary organisations and through discussions with teachers, parents and youth clubs, we can in a better way indicate to young people the evils of drug taking and the awful effects it can have.  Seminars are being held for teachers and they have been advised about how to recognise the problem.  We need the co-operation of all concerned to deal with youth in particular.  The Health Education Bureau will take a very active part as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to treatment and to the facilities provided by section 28.  I do not know of any country in the world that has evolved a single method of treatment that can be claimed to have been fully successful. There have been different methods used not alone in different countries but by different medical practitioners and psychiatrists.  The main objective is that drug abusers would be cared for and treated with a view to resumption of normal life.  If this can be achieved it will be all to the good but, unfortunately, in many cases this cannot be achieved.  At least it can be said that the person will be rehabilitated and can live with the problem. No preconceived facilities can be guaranteed to give absolute success.</P>
    <P>Anyway, it may be misleading to talk about facilities being adequate or inadequate.  So far, I have no reason to believe that the facilities provided with the assistance and co-operation of the Department and the health boards have not measured up to requirements.  Some would say that the treatment facilities available are not sufficient.  Such facilities are available in the psychiatric services and generally in the hospitals but particularly in the drug unit of the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum.  As far as that hospital is concerned, new facilities are being planned for reception and treatment of addicts or abusers. There will be a new centre, which I understand will be completed in June, in Jervis Street Hospital.  There will be a nine-bed detoxification unit which should be in service towards the <Col N="375" /> beginning of the autumn.  I am also informed, and I commend them for their efforts, that premises are being made available by the Eastern Health Board for the setting up by voluntary workers of a free therapeutic environment. This will be a residential centre and will try to tackle the problem of drug abuse from the therapeutic point of view.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am disappointed that there were not more contributions to this debate.  It is possible that people were caught on the wrong foot.  I would have liked to hear from Dr. Gibbons and other Deputies who have an interest in this problem.  There is still the Committee Stage and, so far as I can, I will be receptive to amendments. This is a complicated and complex Bill but I hope that together, the Opposition and the Government can make this the Bill we all desire to ensure that drug abuse will be lessened and those who unfortunately become drug addicts will get the care and treatment they deserve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 1 of the Bill proposes that the assets of the Restricted Licences Conversion Fund, which was established by section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, shall be disposed of in such manner and for such purposes relating to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcoholism as the Minister for Health, after consultation with the Minister for Justice, from time to time determines.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Bill is a consequential provision, which proposes the repeal of section 27 (7) (b) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  That provision is to the effect that the assets of the fund shall be disposed of in such manner and for such purposes as may be determined by Act of the Oireachtas and, strictly construed, it would require that the precise use or uses to which the money is to be put should be spelt out in the Act itself.  That, however, would commit the fund in an unnecessarily restrictive way and I think that it is better to replace the provision by one that will permit greater flexibility in the use of the money.</P>
      <P>The 1960 Act, as amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1962, provided that a person holding a &ldquo;restricted licence&rdquo;, that is to say, a six-day licence, an early closing licence or a beer-house licence, could obtain a full seven-day licence in respect of his premises on payment of £200 to the Revenue Commissioners.  This option was available for three years up to the 3rd July, 1963, and the total amount that has been paid in by holders of restricted licences is £145,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This option was in addition to another, permanent provision in the 1960 Act whereby a restricted licence may be converted to a full licence by extinguishing a full seven-day licence in any part of the State or by extinguishing a restricted licence attached to another premises in the same District Court area or by <Col N="377" /> extinguishing two restricted licences outside that District Court area.</P>
    <P>In introducing the provision in the Dáil in 1960 the then Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>The Government decided that this money should not be treated as ordinary revenue and their intention is that, if the fund amounts to a sum which would make it worthwhile, it will be used at a later stage for the purchase and extinction of existing licences surrendered by the holders.  If the money received does not make it worthwhile to frame a scheme for the purchase of redundant licences, the fund can be used for some other purposes....  The fact that it can be used only in a manner to be prescribed by an Act of the Oireachtas means that the Oireachtas will have an opportunity of discussing the matter fully in due course.</P>
    <P>That was said in 1960 and we now have the promised opportunity for discussion.</P>
    <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Commissions of 1925 and 1957 were both of the opinion that there were too many licensed premises in the country.  In fact a scheme for the reduction in the number of licences was incorporated in the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1927, but it was abandoned after a short time, in the course of which 299 licences out of a total of about 13,000 were abolished at a cost of £60,000. While, no doubt, there is much to be said for the view that there are too many licensed premises in the country, it is very doubtful, in view of the difficulties in the way of obtaining licences under the Licensing Acts, if the public interest would be served by a scheme of purchase of licences for abolition unless that scheme had the effect of (a) substantially reducing the number of licences and (b) introducing an element of greater flexibility into the Licensing Acts so that licences could be obtained without undue cost for premises in areas that are not adequately served.  Moreover, the experience of the 1927 Act scheme suggests that, long before any scheme for the <Col N="378" /> abolition of licences on the basis of compensation reached the stage of having any significant effect, the cost of the compensation would become entirely prohibitive.  For these reasons, the Government consider that it would simply be a waste of money to use the fund for the purpose of buying licences.</P>
    <P>Because of the undertaking given in 1960, the Government consider that, although it would be impractical to use the money to buy licences, nevertheless it would be desirable to use it for a &ldquo;drink related project&rdquo;, and they regard the study and treatment of alcoholism as an appropriate subject for the fund.  The Bill, accordingly, provides that the assets of the fund shall be disposed of for purposes connected with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcoholism. I am quite sure that Deputies will agree that the money will be well spent if it helps in any way to reduce the problems of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is a serious problem in Ireland and I have been concerned for some time about it as a factor in crime.  Accordingly, I have asked the National Council on Alcoholism to do a research study into alcoholism or problem drinking among prisoners with a view to establishing its incidence and considering possible preventive measures.  Arrangements for the commencement of the project are in hand.  It is the intention that the cost of this study, estimated to be about £24,000, will be repaid from the fund if the Bill is enacted into law.</P>
    <P>The proposed research programme includes a structured psychiatric interview designed to detect significant mental illness in those prisoners already identified as having drinking problems.  Participation in the project will, of course, be voluntary for all participants.  The project and any treatment programming necessary will be carried out in consultation with the Eastern Health Board to ensure that there will be no overlapping with psychiatric services already provided to prisoners under the aegis of the board.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Medico-Social Research Board, who very generously <Col N="379" /> offered to make finances available on a recoupment basis to get the project off the ground pending the passing of this Bill.  I would also like to thank the Irish National Council on Alcoholism for the very worthwhile task they are performing in making the public aware of the problems associated with alcoholism.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill by the Minister. It will be given a speedy passage through the House and, I am sure, through the other House as well, which is more than can be said for other legislation introduced by the Minister.  I am truly delighted that the money collected prior to 3rd July, 1963, is being spent as the Minister proposes to spend it.  I should like to know if the actual amount of money collected prior of 3rd July, 1963, was £145,000.</P>

      <P>What has that money being doing in the meantime? It is unfortunate that it was not put to some use, to earn its keep, as it were.  The problem of alcoholism is so great&mdash;and up to recently so few of us were prepared to admit that the problem was as great as it is&mdash;that it is a pity we have not more money to deal with it.  The Minister said the Intoxicating Liquor Commissions of 1925 and 1957 were both of the opinion that there were too many licensed premises in the country.  He went on to say that a scheme for the reduction in the number of licences was under way and, while that scheme was in operation, 299 licences out of a total of about 13,000 were abolished at a cost of £60,000.  Was that £60,000 in the fund we are talking about, or was it paid out of some other fund?</P>

      <P>The money is to be used in a way which can only do good.  I am sure many Members of the House would welcome an opportunity to talk about the scourge of <Col N="380" /> alcoholism.  If we were to have a discussion on that problem, the legislation would not be through by Christmas, despite the good will which exists towards it on all sides of the House.  I do not know whether I would be competent as a lay person to talk knowledgeably about this disease and the 1,001 causes of alcoholism, or how this sum of money could be used to try to eliminate many of those causes and to reduce the number of people who unfortunately suffer from alcoholism.</P>
      <P>The Minister says the money will be well spent if it helps to reduce the problem of alcoholism.  I accept that. I am sure the people on the board of the Irish National Council on Alcoholism will be in a position to advise the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Health on how this money should be spent.  Many of our young people, particularly those in their early teens, are not aware of the problems of over-drinking and alcoholism, the serious effects they can have on them and, indeed, the serious effects they can have on those who come into contact with them.  All of the £145,000 we are talking about could be spent on an advertising campaign on television and radio to point out the dangers of alcoholism and over-drinking to our young people.  The Minister could not agree to spend all of this money on such a campaign.</P>
      <P>Perhaps he and the Minister for Health and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs might sit down with those responsible for RTE and work out some system whereby advertising time might be given for a series of advertisements along the lines of advertising campaigns in other countries directed against over-drinking.  I do not intend to go in detail into how RTE are functioning or to offer any criticisms or suggestions about the running of RTE.  To the best of my knowledge we have something in the region of six minutes advertising per hour on RTE. I do not think anyone would object to another minute of advertising, nor would it cost RTE very much if they gave the facility to the Minister for Health, or any other Minister in an effort to combat the dreaded scourge of alcoholism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> The amount of money is small.  I am sure everybody would like to see that figure increased ten times or 100 times in an effort to do something for our young people.  We have just heard the Minister for Health winding up the discussion on the Second Stage of the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  Alcohol is a drug and alcoholism is a disease.  I am not belittling the efforts already made but it is a pity more worthwhile measures are not under way to combat alcoholism.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that arrangements are already in train for the setting up of a study group to examine the situation.  There is to be a study of problem drinking among prisoners. The Minister says alcoholism is a serious factor in crime.  I fully appreciate his point of view, but I would say that the percentage of alcoholics in prison is infinitesimal in comparison with the number of people affected by the disease.  Those of us who are in constant touch with the people in our constituencies would suggest that the number of alcoholics in prison is less than 1 per cent.  I am giving that as the opinion of a layman.  I hope the research study group into alcoholism and problem drinking among prisoners will come up with information which will help to reduce considerably the causes of this scourge in our society.</P>
    <P>I do not want to open a wide-ranging discussion on alcoholism.  I do not think that would be right, or fair, or proper.  I do not think this is the time or place for it.  In trying to be helpful to the Minister, and the board who will be advising him and the Minister for Health on how this money should be spent, I would suggest that all that £145,000 could comfortably be spent on television advertisements in a very short time.  That would not be good enough.  I suggest now that we are aware of the situation with regard to alcoholism, perhaps RTE could be influenced to give us free advertising time, because this problem of alcoholism affects the nation as a whole. As one of the younger Members of the House&mdash;the younger generation, if I may refer to it that way&mdash;let me say to the Minister that many of us <Col N="382" /> are very perturbed at the high drinking rate in the country, particularly among younger people at present.  The Minister, as a Deputy from a rural constituency, knows that if one cares to drive through his constituency any evening over the week-end one cannot help but notice the number of cars outside public houses, these singing lounges, which are the places our teenagers frequent, the majority of whom drink, and many of them drink spirits.  When we were as young as some of the people about whom I speak&mdash;in our late teens&mdash;many of us, fortunately, could not afford to buy drink and, if we could, we were lucky to buy a half pint of Guinness or some other beer.</P>
    <P>Now things are moving in a different direction and young people, in particular, are in need of guidance. They need to have the dangers of alcoholism emphasised, not merely because they might end up in prison but also because of the terrible misery it brings not alone to themselves but, if married, to their wives and families and, indeed, everybody with whom they come in contact.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will have the full support of every Deputy on any measure he seeks to implement which would help reduce the scourge of alcoholism in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill also.  As Deputy Collins pointed out, alcoholism has become a problem not alone in this country but in most countries in western Europe.  As a result of the affluent society, people tend to turn to the lounge bar and as is now generally recognised, the lounge bar society prevails.</P>

    <P>Greater emphasis must be placed on education.  Our attitude to drink here is often misguided.  Many of us tend to frown on people who become alcoholics rather than try to help them.  I do not know what prompts this attitude. Possibly it is fear.  In schools not sufficient emphasis is placed, not necessarily on the abolition of alcohol &mdash;I think that is the wrong approach; total abstinence is not necessarily the <Col N="383" /> correct approach&mdash;but on the consequences of over-indulgence.</P>

      <P>It is good; it tends to relax one.  Now, because of changes in society, with younger people earning substantial sums of money, they are seeking forms of recreation and the media and people in the business of providing such recreation set up these vast singing lounges and other establishments to attract people without considering the social consequences.  I know we live in a commercial world in which people will engage in this type of business.  We speak about cigarette-smoking leading to cancer but tend to overlook the evils of drink&mdash;broken homes, wife beating, degradation of people, people losing their jobs and so on.  The misery it can bring to homes behoves us all to be mindful of the problem and endeavour to enact discouraging legislation.  But legislation is not always the solution.</P>
      <P>We should encourage new ideas and get people to take a greater interest in other aspects of life.  Many people turn to drink because of boredom and it is sad to see young people so doing.  To go in for a drink is quite good but to go in merely for the sake of drinking is very bad.  Certainly, people much younger than 18 years are frequenting these establishments.  Perhaps they want to hear whoever is performing on a particular evening but there does not appear to be sufficient control over the drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin one of the good features is the afternoon closing hour which serves a very useful purpose.  I should like to see another such closing period between 6 o'clock and 7.30 p.m. because men leaving work at that time tend to go into a lounge bar, get involved in a round, and one round borrows another.  Before they know where they are, it is 8 o'clock or <Col N="384" /> 9 o'clock, but the damage has been done by then.  If premises closed, having allowed them time for a drink after work, and re-opened later, it would ensure that most people would have something to eat rather than get themselves intoxicated.  I do not know whether restrictive hours help in any way.  I do not know if a 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock or midnight closure would make any material difference.</P>
    <P>When they closed in Australia at 6 o'clock in the evening people were found to be footless on the way home at 5.55 p.m. having just managed to get in.  Therefore, the problem about which we speak is not easily solved. The only way in which it can be solved is by a long term programme of education.  I suppose other problems contribute such as bad housing, people living in very bad conditions, a husband coming home with a few children around him.  He probably finds that the most comfortable place is the local pub and off he goes.</P>
    <P>Our whole attitude to drink is conditioned by our attitude to society generally, how we were brought up and our social behaviour.  While the total abstinence people did quite a lot of good work, it is now becoming somewhat non-productive because people want to take a drink.  Rather than the emphasis being on total abstinence it should be on the control of heavy drinking.  In that respect, as Deputy Collins said, the media could play a large part.  Advertising is very important.  One has only to see the amount of money spent in attracting young people in, the inference that one is not &ldquo;with it&rdquo; unless one is drinking.  The herd instinct prevails amongst young people.  When they see their pals and the media operating in this manner, they tend to follow suit.  As people who have some control over the media, we have a responsibility to exercise that control and spend money, even if it means putting notices on bottles that excessive drinking can lead to alcoholism. It does not appear to be very effective with regard to cigarette smoking but, perhaps, it would rub off on some people.</P>
    <P>It is a problem of modern society <Col N="385" /> which must be tackled.  We must encourage the social workers and bodies such as Alcoholics Anonymous and others who do tremendous work in this field and if we have money, they should get grants.  There should be no shortage of money for this work. We should encourage the setting-up of pilot schemes and if possible operate from an outside situation rather than from hospitals, which are not in my view always the best means of dealing with this problem because a routine may be established of going in, drying out and then going out again and subsequently repeating the process.  The voluntary bodies outside should be encouraged and given money to implement the schemes or ideas they may have.  They may even set up their own rehabilitation centres which would be a very useful exercise.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  This is a vast problem of which we are all aware and it is a question of how it can be controlled.  If there is money to spend it should be spent in the area of the voluntary organisations and on advertising. There should be some control of people who advertise; they have obligations as well as rights.  The type of exploitation one sees should not be tolerated.  The Minister should examine the whole business of advertising drinks which is becoming very sophisticated and very appealing.  It is not doing the right kind of work. The Minister might also consider how we might appeal to youth to look at other aspects of life apart from the lounge bar.  This is a problem which impinges on a number of Departments, and they should tackle it before it becomes widespread&mdash;as it otherwise will&mdash;so that we can be on top of it at all times and doing all we can to solve it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I also welcome this Bill.  I recall the previous licensing Bill going through the House and the purpose for which it was stated the fund was being set up at that time.  I did not think it would be very successful for the purpose originally intended but I am glad that the Minister has at least utilised the moneys made available at the time.  These funds were made <Col N="386" /> available in cases where people wanted to convert their five-day, six-day or other licences to full licences.  The Minister now has £145,000 in the fund.  It will help, but it is infinitesimal compared to what is necessary for an undertaking such as this.</P>
      <P>Alcoholism is a serious disease and is widespread and it is incumbent on this House to see what funds we can allocate towards its diagnosis, cure and prevention.  The diagnosis and curing of alcoholism has been going on in a small way but when we attempt prevention we are going into a very wide field which will involve more than the Departments of Justice and Health.  I think the Department of Local Government will play a major role in this also.  That may not seem logical at first but I believe we will find, when we study the causes of alcoholism that much of it will be traced back to social problems&mdash;the environment and the home, the parents' way of living and conditions of living.  It may be traced to bad recreational facilities.  Having lived in Dublin and having a fair knowledge of the licensed trade, I believe it can be traced to a great extent to lack of recreational facilities.  I often wonder why things are not worse when I consider the situation in Dublin today.  In my own constituency there is a high concentration of population with no amenities for outdoor sports.  This is where the problem begins and this is where prevention will have to be undertaken if we hope to cure alcoholism. I have seen it develop down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two reasons why so many young people are drinking now.  First, there is the affluent society.  Young people have more money than they ever had before.  They should be trained at an early age to use that money sensibly.  This is where the Department of Education comes in. Before leaving school, young people should know how to handle money. It is not unusual today for a boy or girl aged 18 to take home £20 or £30. Neither is it unusual for a teenager to give the parents only £5 or £6 which might leave them with £30 pocket money.  A young person with <Col N="387" /> that amount of money is in danger and it would require a carefully considered policy to inform such young people as to how they should utilise their money or save it for a later stage.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious thing when young people are now drinking more than ever before and if it is to be remedied it will require the co-operation of the schools and the parents.  If there is bad example at home, no proper discipline, and if parents fail to inquire about their children's behaviour, these are all factors that must be examined.  The question of serving drink and who is to get drink is a most difficult one.  I have no time for anybody in the licensed trade who serves teenagers.  I have a fair knowledge of the business and I can say the same for the majority of the licensed traders throughout the country: this is trade they can do without.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the onus is placed on the licensee and the Garda.  I sympathise with the Garda in trying to eradicate this abuse from the licensed trade.  It is very difficult today to establish whether young boys and girls are over the age limit.  I do not know how the problem can be solved but I am glad that the Minister is taking a positive step in allocating £145,000 for this purpose.  We see many young people gravitating towards premises where there are licence extensions.  I do not completely oppose extensions of licences but where there is a concentration of teenagers at a social function, I very much doubt the wisdom of giving a late extension for such an occasion because it is in such circumstances that drink is abused.  Much of the absenteeism from work is due to excessive drinking but our function in this Bill is to make a distinction between the alcoholic and the heavy drinker and to ask ourselves what we can do to help solve the problems of both.  I understand that while the heavy drinker can manage without drink if, for instance, he has no money, the alcoholic will go to extremes in order to get drink.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="388" /> I see nothing wrong in people going to a lounge bar for a social drink.  It is pleasant for a husband and wife to go out together for a drink in the evenings.  This is a break for them both after the chores of the day.  Unfortunately, however, there are people who cannot control their drinking habits and while they deserve our sympathy we must impress on them the dangers inherent in heavy drinking. Our first step in this direction must be taken in the schools.  We must educate our young people to these dangers because if a person ha developed a heavy drinking pattern by the age of 18 or 21 it will be very difficult for him to control his drink ing afterwards.  Parents, too, must play their part in this.  It is wrong that young boys or girls are allowed stay out late without their parents know ing where they are.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe that legislation can ever cure alcoholism.  No law we pass here will prevent people from having access to drink.  Should we have a rigid law to prevent young people from obtaining drink in publichouses there would be the danger of them indulging in excessive drinking in private flats every night of the week because older persons would be able to obtain the drink and pass it on to those younger people.  That is why we must exercise the greatest care possible in tackling this problem.  Such voluntary organisations as Alcoholics Anonymous are doing very good work in this field but their funds are very limited.  I know of people who have attended AA meetings and who, afterwards, were able to overcome their drinking problems but such organisations need funds to help them continue their work.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the carrying out of a survey of prisoners so as to ascertain what percentage of them were addicted to alcohol.  I expect that any such survey would show that a high percentage of prisoners had this problem.  The importance of their rehabilitation cannot be overstressed.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to involve young people in voluntary work. There are many boys and girls from the country who are living in bedsitters <Col N="389" /> in this city and for them there must be a problem in finding something to do from the time they get home from work until bedtime.  It cannot be very pleasant to sit in a bedsitter for all that time.  Very often, they cannot afford adequate fuel for heating and they develop the habit of going to the publichouse or the singing lounge especially in the long winter evenings.</P>
    <P>This is just one section of the community who must be considered.  I am speaking in particular of people of 16, 17 or 18 years.  Everyone would prefer that they would not drink and the licensed vintners association have voiced their opinion on this matter. They have pointed out that they discourage young people of that age from taking alcohol.  If a young person starts at that vulnerable age there is every prospect that he or she will be a heavy drinker at 35 or 40 years.  At that stage they may find it very difficult to keep their job.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has brought this matter before the House &mdash;and that there is some positive way in which we can help.  There has been a drastic change in the trends of drinking in the last 20 years.  Then it was unusual to see a person under the age of 20 indulging in drink. There is one school of thought&mdash;I do not agree with it&mdash;which says that children should be given drink at an early age so that they may acquire a responsible attitude towards it.  On the Continent the majority of young people take wine at a very early age and I do not know if this helps them later in their attitude towards drink. I know that in France they have a very high rate of alcoholism.  I doubt if that line of action would be acceptable here&mdash;for one thing our climate might not be conducive to such action. Drinks on the Continent, particularly in France, are much lighter than here and, consequently, people drink much more than they do here.  Our whiskeys and beers are very potent and this may have some bearing on the drinking pattern of young people here as compared with their counterparts on the Continent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> I am delighted the Minister has introduced this Bill.  All of us welcome it.  Nobody wants to see an excess of teenage drinking.  I am completely against it.  Nobody wants to see people suffering from alcoholism because an alcoholic is a very sad person.  Probably all of us have met alcoholics at some time and know something of their problems.</P>
    <P>The amount of money involved here is very small but that is not the fault of the Minister.  If it can help in some small way towards diagnosing alcoholism and preventing excessive drinking we will have played a useful part.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this Bill.  At least it is an effort but when one considers that we spend £4 million weekly on drink the sum of £145,000 involved here is paltry.  It was good of the Minister to put forward this measure but we must look elsewhere to see how we can help.</P>
      <P>The Government and semi-State bodies should examine their consciences. I have attended many State functions and I have seen so much drink flowing around I could wash my car in it.  I am glad to say I am an orange man myself&mdash;not the type of Orangemen who cause all the trouble.  It is time we tightened our belts, even if only from an economic point of view.  Can we afford to continue on this merry-go-round?  Our Departments and semi-State bodies should cut out many of the sherry-receptions. On these occasions they go around with trays of drink and more or less force drink on people.</P>
      <P>It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing now to be photographed with a drink in one's hand.  I remember a time in my town when women were not seen in a bar. If an unfortunate old woman was recommended by her doctor to take a bottle of stout and if she had to go into a bar she hid her face inside her shawl so that people could hardly see her nose.  Now it is the fashionable thing to sit on a high stool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to take this opportunity of condemning the supermarkets and public bars who serve drink to young <Col N="391" /> people.  I should like to know how many cases have been brought before the courts by the Garda.  I think we are starting at the wrong end.  This money will be handed over to the Department of Health to spend as they think fit. It is time some of the Ban Ghardaí were sent to our holiday resorts.  They could stamp out much of this practice.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of this is to put the brake on and it is about time something like this was done to stamp out drinking by youth. Other speakers have referred to this and I am sure those who come after me will also refer to it.  It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing for youth now to be seen on a high stool in a bar.  In my town some time ago I condemned at a local corporation meeting something I had seen&mdash;a child of 16 coming out of a bar drunk.  I was attacked in the local paper a week later by a parents' association.  Who were the parents? They were the wives of publicans and I have that from people who were associated with the paper.</P>
      <P>We Irish should be educated in how to drink.  I saw a man one night being forced to drink: Get it down, it will do you good.  He went outside the door and he got sick: Get it up; it will do you good.  We do not know how to drink.  We drink for the sake of being great lads.  I am not a pussyfoot.  I do not condemn drink.  What I do condemn is the abuse of alcohol.  It is about time we took a look at ourselves. I saw very disheartening news in this evening's paper; in 24 drownings in the last year there were traces of alcohol in the bodies.  I have heard the coroner in my county say he will tell the public when the cause of death in an accident is occasioned by alcohol.  It is about time someone spoke out.  We have been sweeping this under the carpet for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shudder when we talk of drugs. The greatest drug in this country is drink.  It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing.  You are not with it unless you drink.  We close <Col N="392" /> our eyes to what is happening because so many of us are involved in it.  There is many a publican who has produced a good priest.  We should follow the example of the English.  The Englishman goes out for an evening but he never gets drunk.  There is no: &ldquo;What will you have&rdquo;?  Here, even though a man may not be able for it, he is forced to have it.  Then he gets into a car and wraps himself around a lamp post.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned Alcoholics Anonymous.  They know more than anybody how to cope with this problem because they have faced it and come out on top.  These are the people to whom we should go and these are the people to whom we should give every assistance.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to take particular note about what I said about sending ban-ghardaí into tourist resorts.  Parents let their children off and they have no idea what is happening to them.  What is happening will have to be stamped out by a proper implementation of the law. Make an example in a few cases and that will put an end to it.  I commend the Minister but this sum of £145,000 seems very small in relation to the £4 million a week spent on drink.  This money will not put an end to the abuse.  There is only one way to do that and that is by making the gardaí enforce the law.  There are places in the country where the gardaí can become a bit too palsy-walsy.</P>

      <P>This evening the Minister for Health preceded the Minister for Justice.  He was dealing with the abuse of drugs and introducing legislation to tidy up this side of our life.  Under this Bill the people in the trade will be making some contribution towards the eradication of alcoholism.  It is intended to use this money for the investigation, diagnosis and prevention of alcoholism. The amount of money involved is very small.  It will go no distance in diagnosis and treatment.  The money should be used for the prevention of alcoholism, preferably on the social side rather than in institutions.  No doubt the details will be a matter for consultation between the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Alcohol can be attractive.  It can also be abused.  Unfortunately it is abuse of alcohol we mostly see around us.  Nobody condemns the use of alcohol.  I do not condemn it for obvious reasons; my father had a publichouse and many of my relations had publichouses.  Abuses are there and they seem to be increasing. The problem is twofold.</P>
      <P>There is the abuse of alcohol by young people, many of whom will not become alcoholics in the future, and also people will become alcoholics as a result of using alcohol.  There are many problems which must be faced. I recommend that this money be used for investigation into the background of alcoholism, which has been adequately outlined by Deputy Fitzpatrick as it relates to Dublin.  Those problems could also be transferred to the country where there is loneliness, lack of recreation, the want of something to do and all those other aspects of social life which drive people into public houses and lounge bars to spend part of their free time.</P>
      <P>I can see difficulties for the people who undertake this work.  It is very difficult to get alcoholics to accept that they are on the way to becoming alcoholics.  By the time they arrive at the end of the journey very little can be done for them.  A lot of education is needed to persuade those people to seek help when they begin to drift.  If help is sought early the vast majority of them can be cured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> Doctors like me, who come in contact with those people in general practice, become very frustrated trying to deal with them.  We can offer them plenty of advice but not much practical help.  I am inclined to tell everybody in this situation that they can drink as much as they like provided they do not take the first drink, and if they follow that rule they will go a long way towards helping themselves. We come to the stage of trying to treat alcoholics after we have decided on the prevention of the causes that lead to alcoholism.  This brings us back to the institution, using it as a place where people remain for some time.  This has its problems.  There is a move away from the psychiatric hospital on the basis that it should be integrated with the general hospital and not be a house apart, that all medical problems are the same and should be treated within the same base.</P>
    <P>This can be done with alcoholics, but there may be very few specialists to deal with this problem on this basis. As a result, alcoholics would probably find themselves treated by people who have not full knowledge of the disease. This suggests that those people should be sent into an institution dealing with their problem on its own. This brings us back to the psychiatric hospital, which we are trying to get away from.  Any development which is to the advantage of alcoholics should be made use of. Until people with knowledge of alcoholics' problems are available, institutions should be developed on a central basis to help them and give them an adequate opportunity of recovering from the disease.</P>
    <P>Young people are a different problem. This has been referred to by other speakers.  Some of them go drinking for bravado.  This leads us back to the lack of recreation.  Pressures are put on those young people when they go drinking.  Some years ago I stated in the House that the one big inducement to alcoholism was the standing of rounds.  I got some publicity for using that expression and others have used it since.  We should hammer this home to the public.  It is very difficult to implement because <Col N="395" /> two or three people go into a place for a drink, they get involved with perhaps three more and before long up to seven are involved in the company. Everybody feels he must stand his round but that is not the worst of it.  They force people, who do not wish to avail of it, to take a drink. Most people must have had the experience of finding themselves presented with drinks which they had to leave behind them.  If they did not they were foolish people</P>
    <P>We have the background in Ireland whereby we are not considered decent or generous, sociable people unless we go out to drink and particularly to drink other people's money as well as our own.  Deputy Coogan refers to English people and their attitude to drink.  I know of one case of an English tourist in North Roscommon who stated that his only objection to going into a public house in the evening to have a few drinks was the fact that everybody forced drink on himself, his wife and his son.  His son was a teenager and he said he liked to teach him to take a drink or two but he found himself in the position where his son was presented with up to three extra drinks which he was expected to take before he left the premises.  He said this was most unacceptable to him and he probably would not return to the country again.  This indicates what some people think about this matter.</P>
    <P>We also have the extension of licences for various social functions throughout the country.  It appears that no social function can be run, whether it is a Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael dinner, dance or anything else or an open air function without licences being extended.  This has been referred to by other speakers. I mentioned it to endorse that I agree with them.  It is very hard to get over this problem.  It must be accepted that if people go out at night to a function they are allowed a minimum of drink. It is only by education that we can reduce excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>We also have drinking hours which have been extended over the years.  I <Col N="396" /> remember the days of the <i>bona fide</i> traveller when nobody got into a public house on Sunday except the person travelling over three miles.  We then had the extension to drinking on Sunday and also to drinking on Sunday evening, which is one of the most retrograde steps ever taken in the country.  It has ruined the social pattern around me.  We used to have various dances on Sunday evenings to which young people went.  They usually started at 9 o'clock and finished at 12 p.m. and people got home at a reasonable hour.  In some cases they went on to 1 a.m., which was a special privilege.  Since the changed drinking pattern on Sunday evening young people do not go to the dances until about midnight and they come home very late.  It has already been pointed out that this leads to excessive drinking over the last 20 minutes.  Some of those people go out and take charge of cars and accidents result.  We have no accurate statistics to prove the contribution of alcohol to motor car accidents. A coroner decided to take some steps to do this but it did not prove a very popular action by him. If a serious effort is to be made by the various Departments involved to track down the full effect of alcoholism there should be a legal obligation to take blood samples from those involved in accidents at the time of the accident.  Tests on those samples should be available to An Foras Forbartha who investigate road accidents.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of alcoholism is the reluctance to enforce the laws we pass dealing with alcohol.  There is no point passing any more laws unless a decision is made to implement them all.  The amount of money made available for the wide purpose envisaged in the Bill is very small and I have no doubt that the Minister will find a more limited field for it later.  The Minister for Justice must appreciate that he has earmarked £24,000 to hold an investigation in a limited community. This must impress upon him the limited amount of money that will be available to carry out any worthwhile investigation into this matter.  I urge the Minister to convey to the Government <Col N="397" /> that this should not be the end of the money to be made available for the investigation of alcoholism.</P>
    <P>The Minister should insert a new section into this Bill specifying that money will continue to be made available by the Government for this purpose. It would be a pity, if the Minister went to the trouble of organising this, persuading officials of his Department and medical people from outside to take a special interest in this, and, at the end of it all, the whole thing collapsed because there was no money to continue their investigation. In an effort to get to the root cause of alcoholism we should carry out a social investigation into the background of alcoholics; reduce the drinking hours; try and persuade our young people not to drink, and provide enough money to enable the proposed committee to function.</P>
    <P>In regard to drinking by young people I have often wondered if, on the income tax side, an inducement could be offered to them to save their money rather than drink it but, on the other hand, they may have more money to drink then.  On the question of drinking hours a certain interest demands periodically that drinking hours be extended.  We should not extend these hours.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Gibbons mentioned that this Bill was preceded by the Misuse of Drugs Bill and it crossed my mind that if alcohol was a drug that was put on the market tomorrow the furore it would cause would be such that it would be prevented from getting to the people.  The amount of damage alcohol has done is tremendous.  It has wreaked havoc on homes and caused premature deaths.  A big number of Members take a drink and many of them are involved in the licensing trade.  My parents' side were involved in the business and I worked in a bar for 12 or 14 years. Consequently I know as much about the problems created by alcohol as anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to everybody who takes a drink to derive as much enjoyment as they can from it, but one needs great self-restraint in regard to it.  Unless a <Col N="398" /> person has a certain amount of willpower a person can give way to the temptation in regard to alcohol.  We seem to think that alcoholism only occurs among the wealthy and we have failed to grasp the fact that alcoholism is something the average person suffers from.  The wealthy person is well catered for because there are many institutions to which he can go for treatment. It is a good thing that those institutions cater for alcoholics, but we must realise that a lot of average people suffer from alcoholism and that they have no place to go for treatment. When these people find themselves drifting in the direction of alcoholism they discover that there is no help available for them.  Before long they become chronic alcoholics and they find that a relative is forced to make a choice on whether or not to sign them into a mental institution.  In a lot of instances the alcoholic is signed into the institution because of the love his relatives have for him or her.  In most cases the results are beneficial but in other instances that person leaves the mental institution with a chip on his or her shoulder and a sense of injury and hurt at being signed in by a member of his family.</P>
    <P>As a result the alcoholism he was suffering from is aggravated by his sense of injury.  The two factors combined can accelerate an already deteriorating situation.  I do not think mental institutions are in a position to provide the treatment necessary for alcoholics.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest&mdash;I have already advocated this on the Health Estimate but this Bill is heading in that direction&mdash;that there should be an institution to which a person suffering from alcoholism can go for treatment without feeling that he is going to be locked away until he overcomes the problem.  That is not good psychologically. Most alcoholics are not prepared to meet the situation.  There has to be a sense of openness about it and an arrangement whereby he can receive treatment and go home again if he wishes.  If he goes into a home for treatment and sees other people there whose condition has improved, this will be beneficial and <Col N="399" /> will be an incentive to him to obtain treatment.  There should be a local centre attached to each of our health boards.</P>
    <P>There is one such home in Athy, County Kildare, which has proved a great success.  People can go there on a voluntary basis and obtain treatment. There are some people there who have their own chalets and centres where they can obtain treatment.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, in consultation with the Minister for Health, should be considering something along those lines for different centres.</P>
    <P>As somebody who attends the different courts in this country and who reads the various court cases in our daily papers and weekly local papers, I come across a lot of tragedy due to alcoholism.  Death and injury has been inflicted on people as a result of drunken driving.  Many people have lost their licences on being convicted of drunken driving and therefore lost their jobs.  Their wives and families and anyone else depending on them are all affected by this.  I remember reading a murder case in which a young boy, having consumed a considerable amount of drink, committed a murder on his way home.  The following morning he found himself in the Garda station, and in the statement he made in court he said he had no such intention, that he did not even know the house where he committed the murder, that he was on that road by accident.  Nothing can be done in such a case.  Because of drink this young man's life is in shambles.</P>
    <P>There are other smaller crimes due to drink which cause problems.  There are the people who commit petty crimes like pilfering or stealing to get money for drink.  There are those who take motor cars.  I know the Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Department of Health, have appointed court welfare officers to help to combat alcoholism.  These officers, who are attached to most district courts, have helped to diagnose many of the reasons for alcoholism and have also helped to <Col N="400" /> combat it.  Under the guidance of the district justices, these court welfare officers attend courses in alcoholism. I do not know if any other members of the House have attended courses on this subject, but I have done so and I have found them most beneficial.</P>
    <P>They bring home to people the devastating effect alcohol can have on a person's system, resulting in rapid deterioration in his health.  I would suggest that the district justices, members of the Garda Síochána and the Department of Social Welfare should help to spend the £140,000 the Minister is obtaining this evening in combating alcoholism.  It is only a drop in the ocean but with the proper spirit and dedication it would be money well spent.  If people in the community who are admired and respected were prepared to give guidance and help, this would also prove beneficial.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider allocating a certain amount of this money for a survey as to why public dance halls and marquees are suffering a serious loss of revenue.  The attendance at these places has been dropping, and bars and singing lounges have taken over from them.  People might wonder what was the relevance of that to this Bill, but many young people&mdash;this was touched upon briefly by Deputy Dr. Gibbons&mdash;who used to attend dances without having consumed large quantities of alcohol, no longer attend them.  They are going into bars and lounges and stay there until closing time.  I believe this is caused by the glamorisation on television of drink, and of the fun and games in bars and lounges.  The Minister should endeavour to have a complete ban imposed on the advertising of alcohol on television.  If you are watching television and you see four or five lads arriving at a bar and being served with drink, it has a psychological effect.  You begin to wonder what is happening down town.  If a person has a drink problem, it is like putting a match to oil.  He sees this on television and his thoughts turn in that direction.  I strongly recommend that the Minister make every effort to stop the advertising of alcohol on <Col N="401" /> television.  It has been glamorised to a great extent and the glamorisation of anything on television can have significant effects.</P>
    <P>There are very few organisations which have achieved such fantastic results as Alcoholics Anonymous.  I have known people who have attended Alcoholics Anonymous and I can safely speak of the wonderful results which have been achieved for them. These were people who were serious alcoholics and who were a problem not alone to themselves but to their wives and families.  The camaraderie and friendship which this organisation can build up has to be experienced and seen.  I have seen unbelievable changes in the lives of people, lives which were on the verge of destruction, by reason of attendance at these courses which achieved the most wonderful success.  Having treated themselves and improved themselves, these people have been imbued with a spirit which makes them try to get other people to attend.  The people who are organising these courses have the best wishes of every member of the House.</P>
    <P>There are a few points which were touched on by Deputies Gibbons and Coogan and I wish to touch on them briefly as one who enjoys a drink and as one who cannot see any reason why I should not do so.  It is important to bear in mind that most people, if they finish drinking at closing time at night, are normally able to get up the following morning and do their day's work.  I would suggest to the Minister that he prescribe a normal closing time of 11 o'clock at night all the year round, as has often been talked about.  It is said that the licensing laws are not really being obeyed, but this is not true in many instances. The average bar is exceptionally well run and most of the people running them are well aware of the important responsibility they have.  Most of them have a serious approach to that responsibility and the vast majority try to avoid giving people drink to excess, but if there were this uniform period of drinking throughout the whole year, it would be a good thing.</P>
    <P>The reason we have this Bill before <Col N="402" /> us is that way back in 1960 the then Minister for Justice decided that he would allow people holding restricted licences, that is, six-day licences, on payment of a certain fee, £200, to the Revenue Commissioners, to turn the six-day licence into a full seven-day licence.  There are six-day licence holders who would be agreeable to turn these licences into seven-day licences and whatever the extra amount of money obtained, the Minister should consider turning all licences into the one type.  For every reason it would be a good thing.  If this had been done at that time, we might not be discussing this Bill today. Nevertheless the Bill in relation to the amount of money being spent, £145,000, for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcoholism is an important step forward, because it is not necessarily the amount of money involved but the good-will shown by the Minister in his approach to the serious implications which alcoholism can have.</P>
    <P>Alcoholism is something that can be terribly personal, but if people realise that somebody is heading in a particular direction and are prepared to give their help and co-operation and to give their time to them, people might be given the necessary feeling of dignity to overcome this problem. It is only people who have suffered from alcoholism who can appreciate it.  All of us here are merely people looking in, and one has to be inside to recognise its seriousness and the damage it can do.  Alcoholics Anonymous are people who really realise this but it is up to us to endeavour to help out in any way we can, in the provision of centres, of medical personnel, of good-will and finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction and I wish it every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I also would like to add my voice to the voice of others who have spoken on the Bill.  It is only a small Bill but it can generate a good deal of discussion.  The subject matter is more or less a subject which has taken a special place on various forums in the immediate and the recent <Col N="403" /> past because of the spread of alcoholism. In discussing this matter, there is no use in blaming publicans for serving drink to this or that age group. We certainly expect that publicans would be realistic, as I accept they are, and would take steps to avoid serving drink to those of younger age.</P>
      <P>We have had good speeches on this Bill but some Deputies were inclined to be preoccupied with the idea that we should be providing more money and then wait to see how far that money would go.  The problem is fairly deeprooted here as in many countries but perhaps the roots are a little deeper here.  That may be because of the chequered nature of our history.  In years gone by our people had to engage in hard labour and they had to emigrate and these two have been posed as a cause for excessive drinking. Whether that is right or wrong, the fact is that our people have a history of heavy drinking, more abroad than at home, because their earnings abroad in the last century were probably better than at home.</P>
      <P>Speaking on this subject and trying to relate it to practicalities, one would be inclined to say that money will not make sufficient inroads into the problem of alcoholism.  One wonders about the logic of such an argument.  Deputy Enright gave a salutary comparison.  He rightly reminded us that we earlier today had the Misuse of Drugs Bill and pointed out that in drink we are dealing with the most potent drug of all because it is a poison that affects a person not only physically but mentally and it has an aftermath in both spheres.  We could argue this subject all night.  In this, as in many other subjects, we are inclined to be very enthusiastic for a certain length of time but then we do not press on with the cures and the curbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In every country in Europe in recent years&mdash;the Germans and the French will say it&mdash;in times of prosperity there has been an increase in alcoholism and there has been a diminution of the problem in times of austerity&mdash;a kind of ebb and flow in the tide of alcoholism. Nobody so far has adverted <Col N="404" /> to the connection between the shorter working week and increased alcoholism. The shorter working week means that there is more leisure time, and this reminds one of the programmes for leisure they have in Europe.  One hesitates to begin to talk about the cost of such programmes, but in Europe where they are very socially advanced and show social concern they link the social programme with the effect to cut down alcoholism.</P>
    <P>It has been widely suggested that prosperity creates the potential for alcoholism&mdash;rising standards of living and longer leisure hours create a favourable climate for drinking.  We know the attractions of drinking.  This is not a new problem.  We can read about it in the Bible.  Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned how to diagnose an alcoholic as distinct from a heavy drinker.  I suggest that when one enters an argument like this the best person to diagnose an alcoholic is a reformed alcoholic.  Alcoholics will not admit to others that they are alcoholics but they will admit it to fellow alcoholics.  I do not offer any advice in that direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright mentioned Alcoholics Anonymous and the wonderful work they have been doing.  Anybody who interests himself in the problem will know of this excellent work.  While an increased flow of money creates the opportunity for heavier drinking, will an increased flow of money set up measures to prevent heavier drinking? This is a six mark question.  It could be argued that it is not the size of the fund that is important but the spirit of the Bill.  It is the spirit of this Bill to promote the idea that we need not be alcoholics.</P>
    <P>When one discusses a subject of such expanding proportions, one could indulge in an excessive spate of talk and suggest measures which would not be to the point.  We all know that concomitant with the rising standards of living we have a better service in the media.  We have very high standards of advertising&mdash;where drink is presented and promoted.  Should we consider this aspect of the matter, as we considered excessive smoking, as being injurious to health?  No one wants to <Col N="405" /> interfere too far with normal commercial practice.  There will always be drink; there will always be scope for drink.  Drink can give pleasure to certain people who can control their drinking but it has brought terrible anguish, heartburning, poverty and illness to a great number of families. When one considers these matters one wonders what steps would be sufficient to curb alcoholism without walking over the community with nail boots.</P>
    <P>This has been a very realistic debate. It is a measure of the realisation abroad in the community of the difficulty of dealing with alcoholism, that money helps it along, and one also wonders if the allocation of money will hinder it.  These are the finer points.</P>
    <P>Father Theobald Matthew started a temperance campaign during the last century which had the effect of bankrupting a couple of brewers who were closely related to him.  As we know, he had a great measure of success. Would a campaign of those proportions work in present circumstances, even if it were mounted with the same degree of precision and leadership?  It might.  There are a number of ways we could tackle this problem.  The very young seem to be preoccupied with the social life.  The shorter hours at work and school give them greater scope to see everything that is to be seen.  If money is available they will be able to drink what is available.</P>
    <P>One of the things we should get away from is our inferiority complex. Youngsters will not go to a function unless they have taken a certain amount of alcoholic drink.  We have all attended functions which did not start on time&mdash;sometimes starting two or three hours late&mdash;in order to give the people an opportunity to drink more.  We should deplore that practice. If we are genuine about this problem we should condemn the friendly round system, the one-for-the-road. We would be striking at the roots of this problem if we did away with some of these practices and conventions. The reason most of these functions do not start on time is to make sure that the drink that has <Col N="406" /> been bought for the bar will be sold. That to my mind is a very bad practice which we should have the moral courage to condemn.  As I said, nobody wants to be a spoil-sport but when we see people indulging in excesses on such occasions as I mentioned, it is up to each and every one of us to condemn them.</P>
    <P>From our dealings with social welfare we all know that there are three main causes of poverty&mdash;where the breadwinner is incapacitated by illness, by indulging in the excessive drinking of alcohol or through unemployment. We have now reached the stage where we should be able to eliminate the deprivation and hunger which were caused in the past by those factors.  We must cut at the roots of this problem and curb advertisements for drinking and drink products in a reasonable way.  We should cut down on the opportunities for long hours of drinking.  We should discourage the complex which derives from our history that we could not go to a function and enjoy ourselves unless we were two-thirds or wholly drunk.  If we could make a start on those basics, we could report some progress.  We will not achieve this in a hurry.</P>
    <P>In Europe the programme for leisure costs a good deal of money.  It is some time since I was in Europe but I remember visiting a centre which had a youth hostel which catered for all the needs of youth, for all the games and all the recreation they required. Youth often becomes cynical about alcoholism because when money is plentiful certain people prey on them to extract revenue from them. The theory in Europe is that youth must feel adults are genuinely interested in them and that they will do something for them which will lead them in the right direction and away from the excesses of which we speak.</P>
    <P>We have not reached the stage, nor will we reach it for a long time, of being able to provide leisure centres to cater fully for youth and give them the confidence that something is being done for them to lead them away from drink rather than to drive them away from drink.  The money involved <Col N="407" /> in this Bill is not important but rather the spirit in which the Bill will be accepted not only by the House but by the community at large.  It is up to us as legislators and, therefore, leaders in thinking to encourage this valiant band of men and women in Alcoholics Anonymous to play a leading part in dealing with youth in regard to alcoholism.  With that type of programme we could get places.</P>
    <P>The 1960 Act was amended by the 1962 Act.  At the time I hoped the liquidation of marginal licences would assume even greater proportions and that we would cut down on the outlets. I was mistaken.  I noticed subsequently that hoteliers who set out to cater for people under the hotelier's charter were concerned to get a licence and more than concerned to display the lounge bar sign.  It is the first sign to hit you inside the hotel door.  If you went down the country tonight and went into some hotels between 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock and asked for a cup of tea instead of a half pint of whiskey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill is welcome.  It sets out to curb the spread of alcoholism, to reduce the scope for it, to upgrade the standards of education in regard to it, and to spread the idea that one can be a controlled drinker and enjoy wine without going to excess and bringing disgrace on one's self and one's family.</P>

      <P>There is no intention to delay the Bill.  This is the type of legislation I should like to see going through the House more often.  We all realise that £145,000 is a token sum in relation to the overall problem of drink.  I do not know whether, when this money is used up, there will be more money coming from the Department of Justice for this purpose. This seems to be an accumulation of licence fees over a number of years.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Carter on saying that the ideal should be to lead young people away from drink rather than drive them away from it.  That is a very important philosophy.  I take a drink like anybody else.  What we are talking about in this debate is moderation in drinking. Nobody is against drink <i>per se.</i> We have had people who do not drink at all speaking and I do not believe they advocate no drink for anybody else.  That must be clearly understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard various reasons advanced as to the cause of heavy drinking.  The main fear in all our hearts is that of young people drinking excessively.  We have heard about the harmful effects of television advertising.  I believe that the basic cause of drinking amongst young people in this country and, for that matter, anywhere they drink heavily, must be laid fairly and squarely on the doorstep of the adults who should be giving example.  We have all attended meetings where somebody has suggested that we get through the business quickly so that we can get to the pub before it closes.  When Deputy Enright suggested to the Minister that he might close the pubs half an hour earlier, all that came to my mind was it might mean people would be sober half an hour earlier in the morning.  That would be the only effect; it would not reduce the amount of drinking.  Parents must give example to their children and the adult pastime is to go into pubs and drink.  It is amazing to note when people come in at 9.30 or 10 o'clock and say: &ldquo;We are going down to the pub for a drink&rdquo; how many drinks they can consume in a very short period.  I am extremely pleased to <Col N="409" /> note that the Medico-Social Research Board are to receive money and have already made some available, pending a grant being paid to them by the Department of Justice.  I should like to go on record as saying that I as a member of this House&mdash;and I know there are other members who would appreciate the same courtesy&mdash;would be most appreciative if I could be kept apace of the progress they are making in this research because it is something about which I am most concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins suggested that possibly RTE could give a minute out of every hour to free advertising against drink, since they make up the revenue through six minutes in every hour.  I would go further.  The brewers and distillers in this country should make a contribution towards solving the causes of alcoholism.  I seem to be contradicting myself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, they do not advertise this to the extent they should&mdash;do not drink such and such a brand, advertised by so and so.  For example, it is well known that the tobacco companies contribute to cancer research.  They have made that well known and it is good public relations.  I cannot help coming back to the fact that the adults of this nation are those who should give example to the young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late President Childers was a man very much in favour of getting rid of the rounds system.  Because he was President, and had been Minister for Health, wherever he spoke he was reported.  That is something we should continue, and we did have television advertising to cut out the rounds system.  I do not get much time to watch television and do not know how frequently these advertisements appear. But they should be varied.  If the same advertisement appears night after night people tend not to notice.  An advertisement advocating abolition of the rounds system should not itself feature drink if at all possible.  This is something inherent in our nature: we feel that if we do not buy a round <Col N="410" /> we will be thought to be mean.  Talking with our colleagues who have been in Europe, they tell us they are getting out of the rounds system very rapidly there because, if one buys a round in Europe, it is not reciprocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably the best cure.  But we are too proud a people to say: I am sorry; I do not have the price of a round; I cannot accept your drink because I do not have the money to buy you one.  We know that many families go short because of that pride.</P>
      <P>I remember hearing of a figure thrown out about alcoholism in this country&mdash;that one in every 25 drinkers was an alcoholic.  I was told&mdash;and I cannot disclose my source&mdash;the figures were so bad it could not be said officially what they were.  But I understand they illustrate that somewhere between one in ten to 15 drinkers is deemed, by qualified opinion, to be an alcoholic.  When one thinks about it, that is quite an indictment.  That is something which makes the problem more serious than we are prepared to admit.  In a sense, we are like the alcoholic who refuses to admit he is an alcoholic.  Until we are prepared to admit how serious is our problem, we cannot hope to solve it.  I smoke the odd cigar and my little child aged six says: do not smoke that, Daddy, it will give you cancer.  I try not to smoke in front of him; I know I am wrong, that I should not.  Therefore, I am not even practicing what I preach. Within us all there is the hypocrite. Yet how earnestly we would all like to be able to say: I am going to set an example for my child.  There are people who have willpower and can do it.  Were more publicity directed at the parents urging them to be an example to their children, we would see the effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated by others&mdash;in fact Deputy Fitzpatrick made reference to it&mdash;that in France and other parts of the Continent it is common to give children alcohol at an early age.  He did not know whether that system was <Col N="411" /> effective.  There is a school of thought which says that that is no harm.  I grew up in a house where there was always alcohol on the sideboard.  From a very early age we drank wine.  My children have been having the odd drink of wine from the age of two years, not very much.  They do not want it; they never ask for it; they do not like it and would prefer minerals.</P>
    <P>We must try to abolish the mystique attached to drink, that one is not an adult until one can walk into a pub and drink.  How often, as teenagers, did we say: I had three pints tonight; how many did you have?  There was that challenge to our manhood to be able to hold our drink.  Again, that is one of the myths about drink.  If children grew up without the mystery attached to drink, that could have a certain influence.  It is something we have not tested.  It takes a long time to find out.  I know of many families where that mystery has not existed and in which there is no alcoholism, of which I am aware.  People say one can be born an alcoholic, that one can be an alcoholic without ever having had a drop to drink.  One finds out, quite by accident, one has this within one's system, one's metabolism, that drink triggers off that reaction and one becomes an alcoholic.</P>
    <P>Drink affects different people in different ways.  It affects me in a different way from other people.  I am thankful that I do not enjoy drinking to excess; it depresses me; that is probably why I have never been seen drunk anywhere.  It can send me to sleep or make me feel ill, but it does something for other people.  We should try to get them to realise the harm this does to their children, realise the families that are suffering because of alcoholism in the family, realise the plight of the mother in the home who is given £15 out of a wage of £40 or £50 to run the house while the rest goes on drink.  There is also the wife who sees no option but to join the husband in drinking to the detriment of the children at home. When the children eventually move out they do exactly as their parents did.  If they have not done so already <Col N="412" /> I am certain that the Medico-Social Research Board will discover that most alcoholics have a history of alcoholism in the family.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat sceptical about drinkers needing sympathy.  Some of them are so negligent of their responsibilities that I feel very unsympathetic to them.  It is like the saying: &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the child&rdquo;.  Adults are only grown up children who need a certain amount of discipline and appreciate it.  However, that is not a matter for me, but I do not agree that this is subject on which non-medical people are not qualified to speak.  Not so long ago when there was a debate in Private Members' Time about the advertising of drink and tobacco it seemed that only doctors were speaking, but lay people are just as well qualified to speak on this topic and, indeed, may not have as many preconceived ideas as some of the medical people, even though doctors deal with those who have this problem every day.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that if the age limit was too strict you would have people drinking in flats. Not everyone lives in a flat, but I think we all agree that the age-limit needs examination.  Despite people staying home to watch television drinking is still increasing.  We talk of young people having more money to buy drink but I believe we must always come back to the example of adults.  It seems to young people hypocritical for adults to tell them not to drink when the adults are drinking themselves.  If the vast majority of adults drank in moderation we might be nearer solving the problem, but the majority of adults who drink do not drink in moderation.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that teachers should teach the children in school about the evils of drink but teachers, like every other profession, include drinkers and how is one to know whether a teacher who is giving the specific talk on the evils of drink has not himself a problem?  I hope I am not misunderstood as saying that teachers are alcoholics but I think it is true that some teachers have this <Col N="413" /> problem just as have some politicians or some solicitors or some among any profession one may take right across the board.  I do not see the solution from the school point of view.  Whatever research the Medico-Social Research Board carry out I should like to see their advertising or propaganda emphasise the importance of trying to get adults to give good example to the young people.  It is no use telling young people: &ldquo;Do not do as we do&rdquo;.  That will not have any effect.  We must try to get this message home to the adults. I shall conclude with Deputy Carter's very enlightened comment&mdash;let us lead people away from drink rather than be seen to be driving people away from drink.  That is the important thing to stress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. The Minister said in his introductory speech that in 1960 a number of publicans who then held six-day licences purchased a seven-day licence for a contribution of £200 to the Department of Justice.  That provided the £145,000 now available.  I saw a licence advertised the other day for, I think, £7,000.  Something will have to happen to stop this division because if licence continue to increase as they have increased over the past 12 or 15 years it will be beyond the reach of anybody to purchase them.  I have no statistics to prove it, but I believe these licences are being purchased in rural Ireland and taken into cities or large towns where there is a greater population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To get a seven-day licence now you must purchase two, which means that the cost of a new licence would be in the region of £14,000 apart from legal costs.  If that situation is allowed to continue very few licences will be left in rural areas because people will be inclined to take such a sum of money and get out of the business.  Perhaps that would be a good thing, but I feel obliged to point out the trend so that the Department of Justice will know what is happening.  It is natural for a man living in Dublin, Cork or some large town where his turnover would be anything from three times to ten times the turnover in rural Ireland. <Col N="414" /> That is the danger I see, or perhaps it is a good trend.</P>
    <P>There is still a limited number of six-day licence left in the country. I know of at least one in my own town.  I believe there should be some opportunity to convert these into seven-day licences.  Under the 1960 Act a fee of £200 would be required for this purpose but I expect that it would be much more now.  However, if those people are interested they should be accommodated.  All those who have contributed so far to this debate have indicated their belief in moderate drinking.  I am one of those people who take a drink every night but I would never condone excessive drinking because it is one of the greatest evils of our society.</P>
    <P>As the other Deputies have said it is our duty here to do everything possible to help those unfortunate people whose drinking has got out of control. The Alcoholics Anonymous organisation have done tremendous work in this field and should be given every help possible, financial and otherwise, from this House.  They deserve help, too, from the brewers and distillers as well as from publicans who, I am sure, would help if they were required to do so.  Very often people think that publicans are prepared to sell drink to those who have had too much already. If that happens it must be only in very few cases.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the problem of drunken driving.  Unfortunately we have had many examples of the results of such behaviour. While a driving licence can be a big loss, people convicted of driving while under the influence of drink should not be allowed hold driving licences. In many cases it is not the alcoholic who is guilty of this offence but the person who goes out for a night's entertainment and who does not give sufficient thought to the danger of driving after he has had much to drink.  While it is unfortunate for them to lose their driving licence, it is more unfortunate if they are allowed continue to drive.</P>
    <P>If people in my age group or older take a drink they are likely to continue to do so for the rest of their <Col N="415" /> lives, but we have an obligation to guide our young people.  I wonder whether members of this House give sufficient thought to this obligation because, for instance, political parties tend to hold constituency meetings in hotels rather than in halls.  While all parties do their best to encourage young people to join them they are not setting a good example by bringing them into a drink environment. The same applies to any organisation. If halls are available they should use them for their meetings and forego the extra comfort that might be available in a hotel.</P>
    <P>People tend to blame publicans, too, for serving drink to people who are under 18 years of age.  As a publican I am aware of the difficulties in this regard.  First, there is the problem of determining whether a young boy or girl has reached the age of 18.  In asking their age, the publican is only complying with the law.  Very often they will say they are 19 when they may be only 16.  Even if they were to be asked to produce identity cards there would be nothing to prevent an older person buying the drink and taking it to a younger person in the bar because when a publican is busy it is difficult for him to notice someone doing this. The only solution that I can think of would be not to permit anyone under 18 to enter a pub.  Parents have a big responsibility in instructing their children as to the dangers of excessive drinking.  It is sad to find parents encouraging their children to accompany them to public houses.  Teachers, too, have a responsibility to guide young people who have reached Inter stage in this regard and to discourage them from beginning to drink.</P>
    <P>There is a problem regarding closing time because publicans are inclined to think in terms of a closing time that suits them while customers will be thinking in terms of what time suits them best.  They may be farmers, professional people or anyone else.  It is difficult to get general agreement on closing time.  In the winter closing time should be no later than 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m., although Dublin or other large centres might consider that the closing hour should be later.  That is <Col N="416" /> not my opinion because our closing times are much later than those applying in England.  In July, a time when farmers are very busy, the closing hour should be extended until midnight.</P>
    <P>The greatest complaint about closing hours concerns hours on Sunday. There seems to be general satisfaction with the opening hours of 12 noon to 2 p.m. but I think 12 to 1.30 p.m. might be better.  Normally on Sunday the housewife has lunch ready between 1 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. and frequently the family have to wait until 2 o'clock for the husband to come home from the local public house.  At the moment opening hours in the afternoon are from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  That should be changed to 7 p.m. until 11 p.m.  Very few people look for a drink at 4 p.m. and 95 per cent of the publicans do not open until 6.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>Intoxicating liquor has been the subject of considerable advertising on television and in the papers and there is not much we can do to stop it.  I do not think it does much harm.  The Department of Health have an advertisements on television pointing out the dangers of smoking.  These advertisements are directed towards young people and one advertisement featured the famous Mick O'Connell from Kerry.  The advertisements point out to young people that if they smoke it may affect the way they play football. My children and other children in my area watch these advertisements and they seem to have registered with them.  Perhaps advertising on similar lines would help with regard to drinking.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is general but in the west of Ireland, and particularly in my constituency, it is impossible to get exemptions after 12 midnight for carnivals and other events.  That was long overdue. Exemptions should not be granted after 12 midnight.  There are many private clubs in this country and if a person has sufficient money to be a member and to buy drinks in a club there does not seem to be any licensing law applied.  A person can stay in such an establishment until all hours. I do not know how these places are <Col N="417" /> covered by the law but it is our duty to ensure that they close at a certain time.  People think I say this because I am a publican but that is not so. I say it as a father and as one who thinks children should not be encouraged to go into these places.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What worries me is that nearly every speaker in this debate seems to be a total abstainer. We are the last people to talk to those who have a drinking problem, and I agree with Deputy Carter on this.  The only people who can talk to them are people who have had a similar problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill but what we must consider here is what we will do with the money.  This is an experiment to see how best we can curtail excessive drinking.  If I had a choice about what to do with the money I would arrange for a member of Alcoholics Anonymous to visit every school and hall where they might meet the people who need their advice.  Members of Alcoholics Anonymous were on a television programme and young people who were addicted to drink listened to them. They explained the dreadful lives they had, and they made more of an impression than any talk from people who did not experience the problem. As Deputy Carter said, it is possible to lead people from drink but one cannot drive them.</P>
      <P>There are obviously reasons for the increased drinking.  When I was young we had no money to spend on drink. It might be asked how we started smoking.  It was the same way as people get into the habit of drinking. When I was at school there was the two penny packet of Woodbines and whether or not a pupil smoked he had to subscribe his share.  There were five cigarettes in the packet and four boys subscribed a halfpenny each.  The bully who bought the cigarettes kept the extra cigarette.  Even if one boy did not smoke a cigarette he still had to subscribe his share, and naturally enough most boys decided that at least they would try to smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays young people are regarded as cissy if they do not drink and <Col N="418" /> join in the round.  It is not enough to tell people they should get out of the round; they should be told of the danger of alcohol and the damage it can cause.</P>
    <P>The whole point is, when does a person become an alcoholic?  I am a life-long abstainer but I have mixed with people who drink and I admire those who can carry it.  I do not think I would be able to do so and my reason for being a life-long abstainer was that I was convinced that I could not drink and that it was better not to start.  The pledge says that the person abstains for the greater glory of the Lord, but it was self-preservation more than anything else that prompted me to become an abstainer.  I knew happy families when I was a boy and, when a bit of money came into the house at Christmas time, the father would go on the booze and what should have been the happiest time of the year turned into near tragedy.  It was not always the father; it was sometime the mother who drank.</P>
    <P>The pattern of life has changed and I am convinced that only those who have gone through the mill themselves can convince others where alcoholism and its cure are concerned. These could lecture successfully whereas we, if we tried to lecture, might finish up sending all our listeners straight into the pub.  I had a friend who drank and who always got into trouble when he drank.  Once he got into serious trouble and he walked up to me one day and said he was going to become a Pioneer; he said he saw that I had a good old time and seemed to enjoy myself, but he was always in trouble.  He took the pledge and he still has it.  Now he could advise because he only started to enjoy life when he took the pledge. It was the example; it was not that I ever asked him to take the pledge or advised him to take it.  It is example that counts.  I would spend the whole £145,000 getting the people who have overcome their disability to lecture others.  I do not know how research can help alcoholism.  Deputy Leonard told us about a barman who took his couple of pints of stout; that was good <Col N="419" /> for him.  But there are others and they are on the road to becoming alcoholics, but they do not know it.  These are the people who would learn from those who have themselves gone through the mill.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of talk about the younger generation.  Things have changed and young people now have more money.  Someone said they switch now from the dancehall to the singing pub or the lounge bar.  In my time it was ballroom dancing and Irish dancing, and ballroom dancing was quite difficult.  Today one can go into a pub and it does not matter what you drink because, when you go to the dancehall, you just stand up there and the girl will do all the work. It is that simple.  They do not go into the dancehalls now until the pubs close.  Let no one think everyone who comes out of a pub has been drinking intoxicating liquor.  In my area even Pioneers frequent pubs because they have nowhere else to go.  They drink soft drinks.  When I was younger I went to my local town on Saturday night and I went into the hotel; friends met there for a chat and a drink or two.</P>
    <P>The danger of going into lounge bars is that one may be tempted. Deputy Carter said publicans do not cater for the person who does not want to take intoxicating liquor.  If there is a meeting at night no one will give one a cup of tea and, if one is hungry, one may be tempted to take a bottle of stout to take the hunger away.  If tea or coffee were served the temptation to drink would be removed. Meetings are very often held in the local pubs and, unless you can get away quickly when the meeting is over, it is very difficult to avoid taking a drink.  You might not have the energy to refuse.  Again, people who are shy of public speaking may need a drink beforehand to give them courage.</P>
    <P>We must face facts.  Young people are drinking.  Some can carry it and some cannot.  I have known young people in secondary school drinking quite heavily.  Later on when they got a little more sense they were able to <Col N="420" /> curb their drinking.  I would spend all this money getting the people who have gone through the mill to help others.  The kind of person who has had the experience and now has the courage in the interests of others to point the disadvantages and the miseries is the best person to help others. Great character is required.  What do we know about the problem?  I have great sympathy with people addicted to drink.  It is a drug just as cigarettes are a drug.</P>
    <P>I said I never had a drink, but I smoked.  I was told smoking was bad for my health and I tried to cut down. Why should I point the finger at the man who takes a few drinks?  The only person who can bring home to the alcoholic the tragedy of the situation is the person who has succeeded in giving up alcohol and can explain what is involved.  These are the people who will convince the youth of the danger of becoming addicted to drink.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism of the amount of money, because I regard this as an experimental fund.  If the Minister had too much money it might be used in the wrong direction.  The best place to spend the money is to get the men and women who have gone through the mill to give a lecture on: &ldquo;That was my life&rdquo;.  Any place there is a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous interest is taken by young people.  If those people feel they are going too far in relation to drink they want to hear from the people who have had that experience and who were cured.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing this Bill in.  He has the full support of the House in relation to it. Too many in the House have had no experience of being addicted to drink. I had the courage to stand up and say: &ldquo;I have smoked too many cigarettes. I have started on small cigars and now I am smoking too many of them.  I am finding it very hard to cut them down&rdquo;.  I would like to see people who drink a lot having the courage to stand up and say: &ldquo;I drink too much and I am finding it very hard to cut it down&rdquo;.  I urge the Minister to get as many cured alcoholics as possible to speak to the youth of today. I hear a lot of condemnation about <Col N="421" /> today's teenagers but they are not doing anything we did not do.  They have more money than we had.  We would probably have done the same as they are doing if we had as much money.</P>
    <P>We might be better church craw thumpers, people who keep the rules, but we might not be as good Christians as today's youth.  We could pass along and say that certain things were not our business, but today's youth get involved in charities of all kinds. The youth of today have so much money that they can spend more than we could on alcohol.  We were up to 19 years of age before we knew what we intended to do.  Today's youth get jobs at a much earlier age and then have plenty of money to spend.  There is nothing wrong with young people taking drink in moderation but I am afraid some of them go too far.</P>
    <P>One of the speakers today mentioned that too much alcohol among youth is the cause of motor accidents.  I know if a person comes out of a public house late at night after having too much to drink and then drives a car he is in danger.  I want to again impress on the Minister that the best place to spend this money is on people who have had the experience of being alcoholics and who are prepared to go out and tell others: &ldquo;This is what I went through.  This is what you are in danger of going through unless you stop in time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have spoken on this Bill except that I believe it is my duty to welcome it and to hope it can be enacted as soon as possible. There is a growing problem of alcoholism.  I am not the best person to speak on this subject, because I am not a drinker, but because of the growing problem I feel it is my duty to speak, not in the sense of dogoodism, but because I am concerned with young people especially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a fanatical anti-alcohol man.  We should have the spirit of the wedding feast of Cana and we should have a balanced approach to drink in this country.  We should realise that alcohol is a gift from God and if it is not abused it will not <Col N="422" /> cause so much misery.  Over £4 million is spent a week on alcohol.  Big businesses who make money out of the misery of young people should be condemned.  Those of us who want to see alcoholism cut down must be as sophisticated in our approach so that we can try to curb the wrong of too much alcohol.</P>
    <P>Manufacturers of alcohol can advertise it very attractively on television. Drink advertising is put on in such a sophisticated way that young people are encouraged to drink.  It looks very attractive to see the person holding up a glass of ale or whiskey. The State must step in to see that we have a balanced approach in relation to the problem of drink.</P>
    <P>We have got to take some blame if today's youth are drinking too much.  Public houses have become very palatial places and they are an attraction to young people.  One cannot go on drinking minerals all night.  I hope the Government can get some of our research people to invent some kind of non-alcoholic and non-gaseous drink so that one can drink this without having the effects of alcohol.</P>
    <P>We have got to be very careful how we approach young people because if we lecture them we do more harm than good.  I am not sure if we hold up some person who was addicted to alcohol, as Deputy Callanan suggested, that that will work.  We should engage advertising agencies to produce a counter advertising campaign to that launched by the brewers and distillers. We could then show the other side of the coin.  Drink advertising on television portrays drinking as the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to do.  Footballers are shown drinking after matches before they even take off their togs.  Most people in this House have played football at some time.  When we played football nobody took drink until after they had a shower and were dressed.  Amateur football has reached such a height of popularity that the people who make alcoholic drink are clever enough to see that the way to get young people to drink is to portray that the best athletes and the best footballers drink.  Young boys and girls want to have affinity with their favourite football <Col N="423" /> stars, so that if they cannot play football with the same expertise they will be able to drink with the same expertise.  The campaign by the brewers and distillers is a dishonest one. The Government insist on having printed on a packet of cigarettes that smoking can damage one's health, and I am of the opinion that bottles of whiskey should carry a warning to the effect that alcohol can affect one's health.  I am not a fanatic against drink but I get mad when I see young people in the cities and country towns being exploited for sheer profit by those who manufacture alcohol.</P>
    <P>An advertisement which I have drawn to the attention of the House on many occasions is that in which a young person buys a doddering old man a drink as a result of which the old man says: &ldquo;There is hope for the youth yet.&rdquo;  I presume the old man says that because he has been bought a drink.  It is that type of damning advertisement that is being put on our television.  When the Minister is advising those who are to make use of this money in an effort to rationalise our drinking habits I hope he will make sure that we employ the best brains in the journalistic and advertising fields to counter the present advertising campaigns which attract people to drink.</P>
    <P>The emphasis should be on helping our youth.  Unless our youth are educated in the dangers of excessive alcohol we may not be able to curtail the problem in a few years' time. Drink is a gift from God which should not be abused.  The Minister should tackle those who are making money from drink.  In this regard I am not blaming the retailers.  The vintners are doing a great job in curbing excessive drinking by our youth.  Where possible they ensure that those under 18 do not drink in licensed premises, but it is not always possible to identify the age of young people.  We should not put the onus on the publican to do this.  I have no time at all for distillers and brewers who make these beverages, advertise them in a most seductive way but then care little about what happens to young people <Col N="424" /> who drink to excess.  I am aware that the Minister shares my concern in this regard.</P>
    <P>Many of the problems in this city are caused by the abuse of alcohol and, without sounding alarmist, the situation is not getting any better.  In a few years we will have a big problem in this regard.  Oscar Wilde once said: &ldquo;Work is the curse of the drinking class.&rdquo;  On the industrial scene a new cliché has been introduced, industrial morbidity, which means absenteeism.  I am told that drink is the major cause of absenteeism, particularly after weekends.  Not alone are people experiencing bad health as a result of alcohol but workdays are being lost also.  I accept that the Exchequer takes in a lot of money in taxation on liquor, but we also spend a lot of that money on corrective measures.  It is frightening to think that as much money is spent on drink here as is spent on the health services.  It is time we stopped and looked at ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had occasion to complain in this House about the circulation of Second Reading speeches by Ministers.  Since the Minister for Justice's Second Reading speech was circulated I have been searching through volumes of the Official Report for the extract quoted by the Minister in that speech.  That extract referred to the debate on the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  I understood that every Deputy, including Ministers, in giving quotations should give the source.  The Second Reading speech referred to by the Minister in his contribution was made on 11th November, 1959, but I have searched through the Official Reports from that date to the end of June, 1960, and I have not discovered the quotation given by the Minister.  It is difficult to criticise the Minister in this regard, but it would have been helpful to me in my research if the Minister had followed tradition and given the column and Volume numbers.  I was interested in getting the background to the statement referred to by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree with the Minister in <Col N="425" /> introducing this Bill the sum mentioned, £145,000, is only a drop in the ocean in relation to the amount that should be spent in dealing with this problem.  I agree with the Minister that it would have been a waste of money to buy up licences.  I agree it is good to spend the money in the way the Minister has suggested.  I do not agree, however, that the money is being most usefully spent doing a research study into alcoholism or problem drinking among prisoners with a view to establishing the incidence and considering possible preventive measures.  I do not like to fall into the trap of saying that this initial experiment is going to be carried out on a captive group; I agree he goes on to say it will be voluntary for all the participants, but it sounds too much like the guinea pig idea to appeal to me.  It smacks too much of the creation of jobs for a select number of professional people.  I am surprised if, following consultation with his colleague the Minister for Health this was considered to be the wisest way of spending this money towards a solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>Surely enough has been learned by the Department of Health and by experts on the subject for the purpose of helping people who have an alcoholic problem and making the public aware of it.  I do not want to go into the problem itself; that has been adequately dealt with during the course of the evening.  I am questioning the advisability of having £24,000 spent on professional fees because that, as I see it, is how it must be spent if a research programme is carried out which includes a structured psychiatric interview designed to detect significant mental illnesses in those prisoners already identified as having drinking problems. We cannot usefully discuss the overall problem, because basically what we are discussing is the spending of a small sum of £145,000.  The spokesman for this party expressed the hope that the Minister would indicate what that £145,000 has been doing since 1963 and whether it should not already have earned <Col N="426" /> money.  However, the spending of onesixth of that money, that is, £24,000 on professional fees for the studying of a group of captive patients is not the ideal way to spend it, and I believe that the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, to which the Minister pays tribute at the end of his speech, could probably advise him further on this, and I recommend that course to him.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to say in his speech in regard to the spending of this £24,000 that the project and any treatment programming necessary will be carried out in consultation with the Eastern Health Board.  This tempts me to ask if the Minister does not feel that some of the prisoners in Portlaoise, in Limerick and Cork have similar problems.  Why does he confine this project to research in the Eastern Health Board area?  I do not think these are the ideal people.  I agree they need to be helped, but nonetheless there must be assistance the Department of Health can give, through the Eastern Health Board, to the people in Mountjoy, St. Patrick's, Arbour Hill and the other institutions or goals within the city area and the Eastern Health Board area.  There are other prisons in the Midland Health Board area, the Mid-Western Health Board area and the Southern Health Board area, that, I am sure, have prisoners with similar problems.  Why it should be confined to the Dublin area I do not know.</P>
    <P>I welcome, along with my colleagues, the decision to spend this money on actual study in regard to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcoholism.  I do not believe that enough imagination has been put into the overall plan as to how best to spend this money.  I confess to the fact that I have no brilliant ideas in this regard, but perhaps the National Council on Alcoholism could advise him on a more fruitful and beneficial way to spend it.</P>
    <P>I conclude, as I started, by saying that the Minister has not been exemplary in the manner in which he presents the quotation from the speech by the Minister for Justice in the Dáil in 1960.  The Minister's introductory <Col N="427" /> speech was given in 1959 but certainly the extract is not from that nor is it from the reply to the Second Stage. It was discussed for a long time. While the Government Whip may make general allegations about contributions to this House and about having too much to say, I have learned a lot in the last couple of hours in trying to research the debates of 1960 on the Committee Stage of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill which we are now proposing to amend.</P>

      <P>I shall not be very long, but I cannot let the opportunity pass without saying something about this small but very important measure and the manner in which it is proposed to use this windfall from the publicans of the country in relation to alcoholism.  The last Intoxicating Liquor Commission referred to by the Minister was one before which I gave evidence on behalf of the licensed vintners in the North-West and I think I gave evidence for some hours. Following the report of that commission, we had the 1960 Intoxicating Liquor Act which made certain provisions, some of which we are discussing here now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing I want to say before I make reference to the money available and its use is that since this has mainly accrued from the conversion of six-day licences to seven-day licences, the Minister might be aware from his experience that there are a few yet left who have not converted.  They can be more of a nuisance than anything else in so far as they are restricted to six days, and would the Minister not consider on Committee Stage making provision for an extension of the time available for those few who have not yet converted so as to give them an opportunity to convert to seven-day licnces?  He might fix a fee, a different figure from what it was then, £200.  Spirit licences have gone up a lot whenever they changed hands since then, and I would not <Col N="428" /> quibble about what the fee might be, but I seriously suggest to the Minister that he consider those people who for one reason or another did not or were not able to take advantage of the provision then made.  There are not many of them, but there are sufficient to make it worthwhile, and I appeal to him to make a period of time available in which the same opportunity would be available in order that they might convert to seven days.  I think he would get the support of the House in that.</P>
    <P>The effect of the 1960 Act in reducing the number of licences was reasonably successful, but there are yet towns and villages throughout the country where the number of licences are far too many for the population they serve.  There was some question at the time the Liquor Commission was taking evidence that a fund should be created whereby some of these could be bought out and compensated. The problem may now right itself by reason of the requirement to extinguish two old licences to create one new one and it might be a suitable time for the Minister to look at some of the provisions of the last Act to see whether in respect of the restrictions imposed on the creation of new licences, it would not be necessary to have some amendments. That Act was not intended, I think, to wear so long without coming up for further examination and possible amendments.</P>
    <P>In regard to the actual proposal in the Bill to use this windfall, this accrued surplus from the sale of six-day licences, for the purpose of research into alcoholism&mdash;research and remedial measures were mentioned by the Minister&mdash;I doubt if there is much research needed so far as alcoholism is concerned.  Somebody gave a figure recently as a percentage of drinkers who have problems, and it is a very small percentage.  What is most required is treatment, and whether it is to be psychological or otherwise this is where the money might be spent rather than in research. Research might only lead to the causes of alcoholism and this is something which is long since diagnosed, <Col N="429" /> the problem that some people just cannot drink at all, and where it is only detected when they do indulge and the problem then is in what way to eradicate it.  As is pretty well established, the only real cure is abstinence from any alcoholic drink at all.</P>
    <P>There are a number of voluntary organisations doing magnificent work in this country in relation to alcoholism and they are not even mentioned in the Minister's speech.  As Deputy Lalor has pointed out, the provision of this money for research to a body that will examine prisoners &mdash;and it will be voluntary; they will not be compelled to make themselves available&mdash;means that the money will be spent in this way and no doubt we will have a report at a later stage as to what was discovered and what opinions were.  There is no shortage of such reports throughout the world on alcoholism.</P>
    <P>I notice that the speakers who have gone before me were all Pioneers and they always have a different angle, a different slant, and that is not to say that they do not belong to a great organisation, one of those to which I have already referred without naming them.  In talking about this problem of drinking, people sometimes think that the only way to cure alcoholism is to shoot all the publicans in the country and close them up, tax them out of existence, and then there will be no drinking, which of course is nonsense.  Some greater countries than ours tried this and it was a total failure.  When it is driven underground, it becomes a really serious problem.  The incidence of alcoholism in the United States during the Prohibition period was perhaps one of the outstanding examples of what can happen when you try to prevent people spending the usual social evening in a licensed premises which, whether we like it or not, is the focal point of all social contact in this country and indeed in any other country.</P>
    <P>I remember a previous Minister for Finance on one occasion being commended by a speaker at one of our árd-fheiseanna for increasing the tax on intoxicating liquor.  He complimented <Col N="430" /> the Minister on the action he had taken and hoped he would continue to tax drink out of existence. Of course the natural retort of the Minister was that the purpose of increasing the liquour tax was not to stamp out drinking but to get revenue.</P>
    <P>In this way, the common publican is unique in the community.  He is a tax gatherer.  He is taxed at every turn yet he is made to feel he is some kind of an evil in society.  He is pursued by the police, and the general attitude towards him would give the impression that he is an evil in society.  Still, the publican is the tax gatherer the Minister for Finance turns to every time there is a shortage of revenue, to such an extend that the price in bond and the price to the consumer after excise is paid bear no relation to each other.</P>
    <P>I suggest the country should have another look at this whole question. First of all, a publican has no part whatever to play in so far as alcoholism is a problem.  We have only to look at where prohibition was applied and it meant only secret drinking and an increase in underworld production. The conditions in which drinking is done in Ireland are as good as if not better than anywhere in the world. Premises are kept in excellent condition in the main; food is served in many of them and it may be served in all of them in the near future.  The standard of hygiene has been improved out of recognition.  When we have an opportunity of paying a tribute to the trade I think we should be prepared to do so.  I also think we should be prepared to make better provision in so far as the law concerns licensed premises.</P>
    <P>In seaside resorts like Bundoran, Salthill, Ballybunion and Tramore, licensees have a problem in Irish summers.  Irrespective of what anybody says, the place where visitors are found in such resorts in summer evenings is mixing with the locals in the pub.  When the hours were extended to 11.30 p.m. on the last occasion there was no noticeable increase in the incidence of alcoholism. On the other hand, it adds considerably <Col N="431" /> to the revenue.  The vast majority of people who drink during holiday periods are casual drinkers.  At the seaside, darkness does not fall until 11 o'clock and people who go into public houses have only 30 minutes before the gardaí come along to move them out.</P>
    <P>As I said, an extension of the hours in the last Act did not result in more alcoholism.  Indeed, the most unwanted person in a public house is the alcoholic but the publican cannot do much about him.  To say that there is not a demand by tourists for public houses is not in accordance with the facts.  It is a place for social contacts and relaxation.</P>
    <P>When the Intoxicating Liquor Commission were sitting in 1957 the trade union movement opposed any suggestion of an extension of the hours. Their representatives attended sessions at which evidence was taken and some of them were amazed when I informed them that I knew a town where the public houses were open for 23 hours a day.  This is Killybegs where, being a fishing port, they are compelled to close for only one hour.  If any proof is required that such hours do not lead to more alcoholism, it is Killybegs. Those hours have not led to any abuses.  The hours are to facilitate those engaged in fishing who have to be around very late and very early, but others in the area did not abuse the facility.  Though I am not advocating that public houses should be open 24 hours every day&mdash;as some people do&mdash;there is ample evidence that if summertime extensions were until midnight this would be accepted by most people.  The Pioneers who have their own remedy of preventing people from getting into the habit of drinking could not find anything wrong with the extended summertime opening hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to suggest how the Minister could get more money.  If he did a little thinking about the licensing laws, a better fund could be built up for which the licensed trade would gladly be prepared to pay.  I suggested that the main source could be the conversion of the six day licence to seven days and the payment of the £200 fee.  I strongly recommend that the Minister take this opportunity to provide for those who did not take advantage of it at that time and make it available for a further six-month period.</P>
      <P>I do not want to widen the scope of the debate.  As the Ceann Comhairle has already been very tolerant, I do not propose to go into any matters relating to the licensing laws which I would like to discuss.</P>
      <P>The Minister might have second thoughts about the amount of money he is about to commit to research rather than to remedial measures. Perhaps he might allocate some of the funds available to some of the existing organisations which are doing very good voluntary work in this field.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, may I say that this is the first time I have had an opportunity to remark on the appointment of Deputy G. Collins as Opposition spokesman on Justice.  I was very pleased at the appointment and welcome him to it.  I hope it will give him satisfaction and some pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to thank him and all members of this House for their contributions to this Bill.  The Bill has a very narrow and limited objective&mdash; to dispose of the accumulated funds in the hands of the Exchequer to the consequence of section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960.  I have also indicated in the Bill the areas <Col N="433" /> in which these funds should be spent &mdash;diagnosis, treatment and prevention of alcoholism.  That immediately raises a very wide field for debate and Deputies, quite naturally ranged over that field.  We have had a discussion on existing licensing laws in regard to the position of the restrictive licences still remaining, hours, the position of clubs, special exemptions, and so on. We have also had a survey of alcoholism as a problem affecting this country.  This has been an interesting and useful debate.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the specific points raised, might I deal with the points raised by Deputy Lalor, that is, the lack of specific reference in my speech to the volume and column of the Official Report containing the quotation I gave.  I regret Deputy Lalor was inconvenienced by this unintentional omission, and also regret that a busy man like him, Chief Whip of his Party, had to spend so long researching.  The reference was 24th May, 1960, Volume 182, columns 44 and 45 of the Official Report. If Deputy Lalor had sent in a note, I would gladly have provided the reference and saved him a lot of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins asked where this money was maintained since the fund was accumulated.  I am advised that the fund was not invested until 1972 when it was invested in Exchequer stock.  I do not know why it was not invested sooner but, as the Deputies will realise, I had no responsibility, nor had any of my colleagues, for the disposal of the funds in those days. Possibly there was some feeling that it was a special fund and did not fall to be used at all.  In any event, a query was raised at that time as to why that money was lying idle and as a result it was invested in 6½ per cent Exchequer stock and the income which has accrued will be added to the fund.</P>
    <P>I decided that the fund should be spent in the manner proposed in the Bill because it is common case that alcoholism is a serious problem here. We are not alone among the nations in the western world in having it a serious problem in our society.  Although it is a problem in most other <Col N="434" /> countries that does not make it any less real or pernicious.  It is a very real problem which we will have to solve.  Its solution will require research, prevention, cure and, with respect to Deputy Brennan, research into the causes of it.  It is not enough to say that because a man drinks that is the cause of alcoholism.  We have to go back a stage further and find out why he drinks.  Is it a matter of his body metabolism?  Does heredity play a part?  Is there a personality defect?  If so, is it chemical or psychological? Is it a result of his environment? There is a fairly wide field for research into the causes.  If that research should be fruitful and can identify a recurring pattern of causes, the cure and, more important, the prevention of the disease will be assisted.  This is a serious disease and still needs a lot of research.  We are all familiar with this disease and we see its bad effects.  We see the hit and miss way it affects people.  We are perhaps, inclined to forget about the need to be scientific in our approach to it.  It is like a more esoteric disease such as scarlatina or some other disease which is visible and familiar to the medical profession.  It is seen by us all and can be recognised.  We do not consider ourselves experts on it but we have more than a nodding acquaintance with it and the need for a scientific approach may be blunted. That is why I decided the money should be spent in dealing scientifically with this disease.  It is a real scourge.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not designed to deal with alcoholism or the treatment or prevention of alcoholism.  That is a vast subject which is outside the scope of this Bill.  The Bill is limited to providing this fund for the purpose.  I do not presume to say it will be the end, or even the start of the beginning of the end, of this problem.  It is an apt way to spend this money because of its origin.  It is an accumulation of fees paid by publicans to convert restricted licences into full licences.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech it was intended at the time, without being hard about it, that the accumulated <Col N="435" /> fees might be used to buy up other licences and so restrict the general pool of licences.  That was only a hope.  It was not a hard decision.  Experience has shown that it would not be a good decision and that it would be an impractical way to deal with the fund.  The number of licences becoming available would be very limited and they would probably be moribund anyway because active licences would not be surrendered for sale.  If the full market value were to be paid the fund would go a very short distance only in buying licences, and the overall pool would not be diminished.  The original idea concerning the disposal of this fund did not prove practical and some other use had to be found for it.  In consultation with my colleagues in the Government we decided that it should be connected with the licensed trade and that research into alcoholism would be an apt way to spend it.</P>
    <P>Quite naturally Deputies talked about the problems of alcoholism.  I want to disabuse the House of the idea that this Bill purports to be the answer to the problem in any way.  It could not be, because the sum is too small and the problem is too big.  The Bill is merely for the narrow purpose of disposing of the money.  It was implicit in what some Deputies said that it was a paltry sum to provide for the purpose but, as I say, that is missing the point.  Deputy Dr. Gibbons and Deputy Briscoe wondered whether, because the sum is small for this research project, when the fund was exhausted all research projects would end.  I can reassure them that that will not happen.  Apart from this fund, other moneys are being made available for research in this area.  In fairness to the spirit industry, Irish distillers and the vintners themselves have made considerable amounts of money available for study and work in the area of alcoholism.  I do not think there will be a cessation of work in that general field when this fund is exhausted.</P>
    <P>The question of advertising and education in this field was touched on by many Deputies.  It was suggested <Col N="436" /> that the fund could be used very profitably in that area.  There was some apprehension that because of the techniques of the advertisements for drink, the counter-techniques would have to be so sophisticated and widespread that the fund might be inadequate.   The Department of Health initiated a campaign of education and information on this subject in October, 1973.  This campaign involves educational programmes for schools.  Some commercial time has been taken for the publication of factual knowledge concerning alcoholism and drink.  There have been press advertisements and booklets have been produced.  Seminars and lectures have been promoted up and down the country directed principally at people who are in the position to pass on this information to the younger and more vulnerable generation. Over £100,000 has been spent on that campaign to date.  I take Deputy Moore's point that, having regard to the amount of money being spent by the other side, this is probably very small, but there is a limit to the money available.</P>
    <P>I agree that education is possibly the most important weapon available in the fight against alcoholism.  The licensing hours and the rounds system, whether clubs are abusing their position, the mores of the younger generation, are all factors.  Essentially &mdash;and Deputy Carter put his finger on it&mdash;it is the social attitude of the community that will determine the drinking habits.  This is a layman's view as an observer and, to some extend, it contradicts what I said earlier, that it is a subject which requires scientific research.  I suppose we are entitled as laymen observing the scene as we see it, to make comments on that scene and on the problem of alcoholism because it is so tied up with our social customs and our recreational habits and our attitude to leisure.  We have to look at the social scene for a change in the attitude to drinking.  This gets back to education because it is through education that the coming generation can have their views trained or channelled into a proper appreciation of what drink should <Col N="437" /> mean, the dangers of drink and how not to abuse it.</P>
    <P>Some worries were expressed by Deputies about the growth of lounge bars, and their sophistication and attractiveness being contributory factors. They may well be, but they should not be if there is a proper motivation on the part of those using them, and if they are properly educated into using them and properly warned against the dangers of the abuse of alcohol.  Education is terribly important.  I have no doubt that in the projects which will be undertaken following the enactment of this Bill attention will be given to devising techniques to educate young people in drinking.  It may be that some of the money will be given to associations such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  The fact that I did not mention them in my opening speech does not mean that I do not appreciate their work in this field.  The whole community is aware of their worth and grateful to them for their work.</P>
    <P>There is one specialised agency in the field, that is, the Irish National Council on Alcoholism, a body set up and specially devoted to dealing with this problem.  They have a lot of expert knowledge and experience available to them, including the experience of Alcoholics Anonymous. Possibly that body will be consulted by the Minister for Health and myself in deciding how this money is to be spent.  I agree with Deputies who urge that education of our youth is a matter of grave importance, It is basic. That is a layman's personal view.  We have to take scientific advice on it when it comes to spending the money.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who spoke laid emphasis on that point.  I suppose Deputies who mentioned advertising &mdash;Deputy Moore, Deputy Collins and Deputy Enright&mdash;had it in mind that it was part of the process of giving out information and blunting bad information, so to speak, or indiscriminate pushing of a dangerous substance which alcohol is.  I suppose the advertisements could be described, perhaps a bit unfairly, as doing just that.  When we talk about countering them that would be a matter of education <Col N="438" /> rather than counter advertising. It would be entering into an advertising war with experts whose budgets might be somewhat differently geared.</P>
    <P>The hours of trading were mentioned by a number of Deputies. Deputy Fergus O'Brien thought that the afternoon closing hour should be extended to an evening period in Dublin which would have a useful social effect, the same effect in the evening as it was designed to have during the day, to break the continuous pattern of drinking where a person would be so inclined.  It was thought it would be of particular benefit to a person on his way home from work who dropped in for a drink and perhaps found himself the victim of a rounds system, ending up remaining the whole evening.  The Deputy felt that if there were to be a break from six o'clock to 7.30 p.m. a person would be forced to go home and, if he wanted, return, having had a meal.  There is merit in that suggestion and something which would bear consideration.</P>
    <P>The question of Sunday hours was raised also.  Deputy Reynolds thought the morning hours might be shortened slightly because the present hours tended to interfere with the midday meal&mdash;that the husband would be in his local until 2.10 p.m. and so hold up the family midday meal.  He felt also that the hours for the second part of the Sunday period should be changed from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. rather than, as at present, from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m.  That has some merit because, as he said, a lot of publicans, in any event, do not open their premises on Sundays until 6.30 p.m. or thereabouts.  I would have some consideration also for the staff working in licensed premises.  Such an arrangement would enable them to have a Sunday afternoon and evening meal with their families.  It would be providing the facilities for the general public from 7 p.m. until 11 p.m., the normal recreation time on Sunday evenings, and would permit customers to spend the afternoon and early evening with their families also.</P>
    <P>The question of seaside resorts <Col N="439" /> raised by Deputy Brennan is a matter of considerable difficulty, on which I have had a lot of representations. Indeed, I can see the force behind such representations.  In many of our seaside resorts, unfortunately, the pub is the only place of entertainment and perhaps shortens unduly the night's entertainment for people on holiday, who have not got the duty of working the following day.  There would be real difficulty of definition here in deciding what is a &ldquo;seaside resort&rdquo; and what is a &ldquo;holiday resort&rdquo;.  Possibly &ldquo;seaside resort&rdquo; could be defined as being within X miles of the sea, or within sight of it.  But, when one thinks of a town like Lisdoonvarna, which is purely a holiday resort, how does one deal with it? Then there is the inland town beside lakes, such as Killarney; indeed, in my own county, there is Athlone, in the middle of the Shannon where serious problems of definition would arise.  I am giving thought to this problem to see if there is any solution, but my thoughts so far lead me to being pessimistic.  That problem was raised in the context of alcoholism. Indeed, it was raised in two ways. Some people raised it as a factor contributing to excessive drinking, and there was the other side who did not want unduly restrictive hours either.</P>
    <P>Deputies Fitzpatrick, Reynolds, H. Gibbons and Enright raised the question of special exemption orders. From representations I have had from youth clubs and leaders, I am aware that there has been concern about the operation of the facility for special exemption orders, concern that such facilities have been too easily available; that it would be stretching language as describing them as being special; that the meals served which have to be an integral part of a <i>bona fide</i> special event could hardly be described as <i>bona fide</i> meals, notwithstanding the provision in the Act that they might be presented to the court as being <i>bona fide.</i> But the reality to the customer might not be the same as the court was led to expect he would be receiving.  Because of the publicity this aspect received, there <Col N="440" /> has been a consciousness all round of the need for care in the granting of these special exemptions.  I am giving it consideration to see if the law would require tightening.  It is not an urgent problem but is a matter of some concern in parts of the country, a concern that has been well and properly expressed.  Should the position deteriorate further, then remedial legislative action will have to be taken.</P>
    <P>The question of rounds was raised by Deputies H. Gibbons, Carter and Briscoe.  I agree completely with them that this is a pernicious habit.  I gather from speeches made that it is essentially an Irish one.  It has now reached proportions in our drinking society, so to speak, that it is a matter of serious concern to a person's honour that he be seen to meet his obligation to stand his round.  When it reaches that stage, the thing becomes ridiculous.  There is no doubt about it that it causes people to drink far more than they want or indeed need.  Was it Deputy H. Gibbons who gave the example of the fisherman from England who came here with his son, who used to go to the local in the village where they stayed and found he became involved in rounds, was offered far more drink than he wanted and found the whole experience quite unpleasant?  The late President Childers was very vocal in his condemnation of this practice and, on many occasions, urged the need for its abolition.  There has to be a lead given.  At some of their conventions the GAA gave a lot of publicity to the subject and requested their members to give a lead.  It is a plea-that needs endorsement.  The lead should be given by anybody who is concerned, and we all must be concerned about alcoholism, because it is a serious factor leading to excessive drinking.  Again, speaking as a layman, too much drinking is possibly what leads to alcoholism.  In clubs, football clubs, social clubs and sporting clubs it would be a great thing had some member the courage to propose it be a rule of the club that no member be allowed buy a round for another member.  Of course, <Col N="441" /> there would need to be an exemption in the case of visitors so that ordinary hospitality could be offered.  But that would be a good practice between members of such clubs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There again, that might be a very desirable end.  There is another type of club&mdash;I do not know quite what name to put on it&mdash; not too far from here where I should like to see the same thing practised.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds was somewhat worried about drinking in clubs, that they might abuse their rather special position by being careless about the licensing laws.  I hope this would not be widespread because, if it were, it would be a matter of serious concern. I am aware that the Garda are very alive to this danger and to the need to enforce the licensing laws generally. If any Deputy has any information concerning abuse by any club, I should be glad to have it, as would the Gardaí.</P>
      <P>Essentially the problem of alcoholism gets back to our society and to the question of example&mdash;example in the home, education in the use of leisure and in attitudes to drink.  Those are things that will have to be taught by parents.  Parents themselves may have to be taught how to pass on proper attitudes.  Again, it comes back to the question of education which is fundamental.  That education, in turn may depend on having the benefit of the results of scientific research into this field.  If scientific research throws up that alcoholism is due to certain social attitudes, if it can pinpoint those attitudes, then educational therapy can be devised to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need for scientific research to establish if there are chemical factors involved&mdash;does the metabolism of the body come into it?  If so, why in some and not in others?  Does heredity come into it?  Environment?  The stress of the job?  All these are matters that can be scientifically established and this is why there is need for research. When they are established prevention can be tackled on a methodical basis. <Col N="442" /> The question of cure can be tackled. The only cure is abstinence when a person reaches a certain stage.  That has now been scientifically established &mdash;that the requirement for total abstinence is absolute.  To get a person to the stage when he can physically and mentally tolerate total abstinence after a lifetime, perhaps, of total dependence is difficult, and scientific research is essential in arriving at that situation.</P>
    <P>I make no apology in reply to Deputy Lalor's criticism of the project which I mentioned in my opening speech&mdash;research into the prevalence of alcoholism as a factor in crime.  I was aware from my observations as a lawyer practising and doing the ordinary amount of criminal court practice that a country solicitor would do, that alcoholism was very often mentioned in the course of the instructions for the case.  A district justice in the midlands area, because of the frequency with which he found this factor being mentioned in cases coming before him, had an informal&mdash;not scientific&mdash;experiment carried out to establish whether it was a factor of frequent incidence.  He devised an informal educational programme for people coming before him where this factor was mentioned.  He found it was a very common factor but, more important, the informal education programme which he devised&mdash;he got assistance from the National Council on Alcoholism in it and had the support of the court welfare officers&mdash; even that appeared to be of immense benefit to those who availed of it, and he had ways and means of ensuring that they did avail of it.  They were able to assure him&mdash;I think this also came from other sources&mdash;that it was of immense benefit.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied from my own observations and information I have received from people working in the crime area, in the prisons, that alcoholism appears to be a recurring feature, and consequently I make no apology for having the first project, a project in that area.  That is not to say that the results of the project will be of use only in that area.  I have no doubt that scientific research of the detailed kind that will be undertaken will <Col N="443" /> throw up information that will be useful in the general field of alcoholism. Deputy Lalor threw a good deal of cold water on scientific research and structured psychiatric interviews&mdash;I used that expression in my speech.  He seemed to think it was a matter of soft money for researchers.  That does less than justice to dedicated scientific people who at the request of the Irish National Council on Alcoholism have devised the research programme. If anybody has any queries about what the programme involves I can only refer them to the National Council because it will be an independent survey, independent of me and it will have to be confidential. Any persons who participate in it will do so voluntarily.</P>
    <P>Again, I take serious issue with Deputy Lalor for suggesting that we are using the prisoners as guinea pigs in this project.  I reject that suggestion most vehemently; this project is in ease of people who are unfortunate enough to come into our prisons because it will try to determine if alcoholism is a factor in what has happened to them and if so, can we assist them by removing it from their lives and assist in their rehabilitation and remove them from the category of recidivists.  I reject any suggestion that advantage is being taken of them. This is in ease of their situation and is part of the on-going programme in our prisons to get away from the idea of having prisons as mere places of custody.  We want them to be places of rehabilitation treatment and cure, and this is part of that general programme of concern for our prisoners. Their co-operation will be voluntary; I hope they will co-operate but they cannot be forced.  I assure them their confidence will be respected even though they may need no assurance from me because those who will be carrying out this programme will be professional researchers who can only research competently and efficiently if they have the highest standards, and one of those standards is absolute confidentiality.  These people are experienced researchers of the highest calibre.</P>

      <P>There is a certain body of research available; I could not disagree with the Deputy.  I do not know if there are volumes of it, that there is a vast amount of it, as he implies.  No doubt there is a considerable amount of it but if so, it has been singularly unsuccessful in ending the problem because instead of getting smaller the problem is growing.  That is not only our experience but it is the European and American experience also, and the U.S. is the place where research has generally been more sophisticated and advanced than elsewhere. There is still room for a good deal of research.  So far as I am aware there has been very little research into alcoholism as a factor in crime and a factor among our prison population. The social mores of a particular community may themselves be a factor.  If that is so, and there is evidence to suggest that it might be, there would be a need for us to carry out our own research here into our own situation.  I am very pleased that the first project being undertaken is the project I mentioned in my introductory speech. There was no need for me to mention it because it is possibly a matter to be announced by the National Council of Alcoholism who are setting up this programme.  They will announce the details of it and I can arrange to get full information, for any Deputy who is interested, of the pattern of the research.  They will see how thorough, complete and scientific the Council's entire approach will be.  It is not a question of jobs for the boys; I reject <Col N="445" /> that suggestion with the contempt it deserves.</P>
      <P>Apart from that slightly abrasive note, I want to thank Deputies for their contributions and their concern with this problem.  When the community becomes concerned in the problem it will be a factor in dealing with it and in solving it.  I thank Deputies for their reception of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the possibility of some amendments to the Bill but apparently the Minister did not even give them a moment's thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry; I overlooked that.  Perhaps I may mention it at this stage.  I have a note of it. Deputy Brennan mentioned the question of the right to convert the remaining restricted licences.  It was also mentioned by Deputy Enright, and I have had deputations about this.  I am disposed to consider this sympathetically but I do not think that this is the appropriate Bill in which to do it. This Bill has the very narrow purpose of disposing of this particular fund. I think it would be more appropriate to make any changes or improvements we might wish to make in the intoxicating liquor code generally.  This is a matter I should like more time to consider, and I certainly could not <Col N="446" /> consider it in the context of this Bill as there would not be sufficient time to tease out all the implications of it.  It is a matter I have under consideration for inclusion with other amendments that have been suggested to me in regard to the intoxicating liquor code. I have to reject it as an idea for this Bill.  I apologise to the Deputy for omitting to mention it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that this is not the most appropriate Bill in which to insert an amendment of this kind and that there may also be other tidying-up amendments required in respect of the 1960 Act.  If the Minister would undertake to give the matter serious thought in the near future we would be satisfied and we are prepared to give all stages of the Bill tonight.</P>
