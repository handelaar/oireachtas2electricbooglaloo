    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi mar a d'fhógair an tUasal Tomás Ó Domhnaill, TD, Aire na Gaeltachta, le déanaí, tá socraithe ag an Rialtas go mbunófar Údarás nua Gaeltachta, leis na cumhachtaí feidhmiúcháin is leithne is féidir, agus go mbeidh guth láidir ag pobal na Gaeltachta ina chuid imeachtaí. Is amhlaidh a thoghfaidh pobal na Gaeltachta ionadaithe ar thrí bhord chúigíocha agus ainmneoidh gach <Col N="1544" /> ceann de na boird sin duine lena cheapadh ar Bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Tá Bille á ullmhú chun na socruithe sin a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>While the population of Greenland white-fronted geese can be affected by many considerations&mdash;for example, destruction of habitat, human disturbance, and so on&mdash;the extent of breeding success in Greenland is the major factor in the population level.</P>

    <P>The latest information available to me suggests that there is no question of this subspecies being threatened with extinction.  Indeed I am glad to say that, in so far as this country is concerned, the number of these birds wintering here at present compares <Col N="1550" /> more than favourably with the numbers recorded for several years past.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will ensure that the letting of estates by the Land Commission on the 11 months system will be done by means of advertisement in two successive issues of the local newspaper and by public auction, rather than by private treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Current policy provides for the letting of Land Commission lands by public auction.  This is accepted as being the fairest system and the one least likely to give cause for complaint.  Only where there are exceptional circumstances are lettings made by private treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the general practice of the Land Commission to advertise lettings, whether by public auction or otherwise, in one issue of the local newspapers and since these arrangements have proved adequate the <Col N="1553" /> further advertising suggested by the Deputy is not considered necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMSheridan" hpid="Mr. Sheridan Mr. Sheridan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in Westmeath, last year at least, there was grave dissatisfaction over some&mdash;I stress some&mdash;lettings made privately?  Is the Minister also aware that in some cases the advertisement was very scanty, I want to be fair to everybody, and that some land in the hands of the Land Commission was let to larger type farmers instead of to the smaller type who did not even get a chance to bid for it?  That is the reason for my putting down this question. If it were more widely advertised everybody would be placed in a fighting position and more deserving people would benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I told the Deputy, the general practice is to let by public auction. The invariable practice is for the Land Commission auctioneers to follow the custom in the area in regard to advertising. That, in Westmeath, is to advertise in one issue of the paper which comes out usually on a Thursday or a Friday and not hold the auction until the following Wednesday or Thursday.  I believe that sizeable advertisements are inserted.  As a matter of fact, I am told that sometimes the auctioneers acting for the Land Commission, for some reason or another, insert bigger advertisements than the ordinary private ones.  I am aware that the Deputy raised the question of one estate last year where there was some discontent or uneasiness about the manner in which the letting took place.  But my information is that in that case the 1974 letting was advertised in January, 1974 and that after negotiation by private treaty the lettings were not actually made until April.  If the Deputy will write to me or contact me about the case he has in mind I will go into it fully with him.</P>

    <P>Up to 1st January, 1975, Land Commission records relating to the acquisition and division of lands were kept on the basis of the financial year ended 31st March and not of the calendar year.  Figures for the year ended 31st December, 1974, are not therefore readily available.  However, it may meet the Deputy's requirements to know that in the year ended 31st March, 1974, the Land Commission <Col N="1559" /> acquired some 20,400 acres and divided 34,200 acres.  Final figures for the nine-month period ended 31st December, 1974, which excludes the peak allotment months, are not yet available but it is expected that acquisition and allotment figures will be in the region of 14,600 acres and 8,000 acres respectively.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have investigated the question of sand-blowing in the Banna area, with particular reference to the townlands of Ballinprior and Commons.  The report obtained is being considered but it is not yet possible to indicate what action, if any, the Land Commission may take in the matter.</P>
      <P>In regard to the townland of Ballyheigue, the situation is that there is no agricultural land involved and accordingly this is not a case where the Land Commission would be prepared to take remedial action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the disappearance of bent grass from the sandunes there is a good deal of coast erosion in the Banna and Ballyheigue areas.  The Land Commission set bent grass successfully in the Maharees and Castlegregory areas and this resulted in stopping coast erosion in those parts of the county. Therefore I appeal to the Minister to arrange for the setting of bent grass also in the areas referred to in the question.  In winter sand is blown away quickly from these areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to point 6 of the communiqué issued by the heads of Government of the member states of the European Communities at the end of their conference in Paris on 9-10th December, 1974, which states, and I quote:</P>
      <P>In order to improve the functioning of the Council of the Community, they consider that the practice of making agreement on all questions conditional on the unanimous consent of the member States should be dropped, whatever their respective positions regarding the conclusions reached in Luxembourg on 28th January, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This reference to the conclusions reached in Luxembourg relates to an &ldquo;agreement to disagree&rdquo; that emerged at that meeting when one <Col N="1569" /> Government indicated that where in its view its vital interests were affected in respect of a matter which under the treaties was subject to a qualified majority vote, it would not be subject to a decision reached by this method.  Instead that country insisted that where very important interests are at stake the discussion in Council must be continued until unanimous agreement is reached.</P>
    <P>Point 6 of the Paris summit communiqué reflects a widespread recognition that during the past nine years the practice in question has been extended to matters which are not in effect of vital interest to any member state and that this has affected the efficient functioning of the Community decision making process.</P>
    <P>It was agreed during the preparatory work for the Paris conference that the practical implementation of this proposed decision could best be secured by bringing up at the beginning of each session of the Council those questions appearing on the agenda and which will have been chosen in the course of the preparatory work, with the desire of putting into operation the decision of the heads of Government.  Accordingly at the outset of the first normal Council meeting in the Irish Presidency I indicated from the chair that I proposed at the outset of each session of the Council to distinguish items on the agenda requiring decisions by unanimity under the treaty, items for which majority decision making is provided for in the treaty and items not requiring formal decisions by the Council.  This procedure is designed to facilitate the implementation of point 6 of the Paris summit communiqué by identifying the matters in respect of which this decision could be applied.</P>
    <P>As there is therefore no proposal that the veto should be abolished the second part of the Deputy's question does not arise.  I should nevertheless like to draw the Deputy's attention to what I said in moving the motion on European Integration in the Dáil on 4th December last, when I stated that at this stage of the development of the Community I was quite clear that <Col N="1570" /> on matters of vital interest the veto has to be maintained and that it would be premature to change the system of vetoes in cases of national interest now.  I went on to say, however, that:</P>
    <P>I was convinced, before I became a member, from what I knew of the system, and I am thoroughly convinced now through seeing it working in practice, that in the longer run the veto system is the protection for the great powers and the qualified majority voting system provides the protection for the interests of the smaller countries and is one which would be much more suitable for our purposes in the longer run.</P>

The regional fund regulations now being examined relate to the regional fund itself and they are coming forward at the next council meeting on 10th February, that is next Monday. The question of State aids is a separate issue and on the existing treaty provision the review of State aids is proceeding and the Commission are making proposals as to how they should be carried through and what conditions should apply to State aids.

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the present position concerning the question of economic and monetary union in the EEC, in view of the very small sum allocated to Ireland in the regional fund; and whether the Government's fears about the dangers of economic and monetary union have been exacerbated by the disappointing regional fund allocations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At their meeting in Paris on 9-10th December, 1974, the heads of Government of the Community repeated the objective of establishing an economic and monetary union, an objective previously agreed in the Paris Summit Conference of 1972.  Ireland, along with other member states, remains committed to pursuing the goal of economic and monetary union.  Apart from supporting this aim in the context of European union as a whole, it can be argued that our own interests are best served by movement towards EMU. For example, it is important to this country to preserve the common agricultural policy, the functioning of which is seriously impaired by the continued absence of fixed parities between Community currencies.  Of course, we consider that progress towards achievement of EMU in the Community should be accompanied by satisfactory progress in improving the decision-making arrangements in the Community and in ensuring that policy-making at Community level is brought under more effective democratic control involving for instance greater powers for and direct election to the European Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The heads of Government also decided to set up the European Regional Development Fund as from 1st January, 1975.  For its first three years of operation (1975-77) the fund will be endowed with 1,300 million units of account (£542 million) of which Ireland will receive 84 million units of account (£35 million).  In the view of the Government the annual amounts involved in this contribution of 84 million units of account, while being a useful addition to our domestic resources for regional development would be quite inadequate as a contribution <Col N="1574" /> to the Irish economy in the middle and latter periods of adjustment towards EMU when the pressures on the Irish economy that could arise as a result of these adjustments would require much more extensive action by the Community than is involved in the regional fund as proposed for the years 1975-77</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In fact the EMU target of 1980 was not pressed and the communiqué wording makes it clear that it is no longer thought to be realistic.  Therefore, the argument that we must now have a <Col N="1575" /> regional fund of a much larger amount to reach the EMU target of 1980 is no longer as relevant an argument as it was once the 1980 deadline argument was eroded at that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Attorney General (Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern Governments who consciously undertake the task of reforming society have many means available to achieve this end.  Taxation policies can be used to redistribute wealth; physical resources can be so allocated as to help the most needy; social welfare, health and education policies can be so formulated as to alter radically unjust social conditions.  A series of comprehensive and systematic well-conceived programmes of law reform <Col N="1578" /> is yet another means available to a Government which wishes to reform a society for which it is responsible.  In present times virtually every important and significant private, economic and social relationship is conditioned and controlled in some way by our great body of laws and legal rules.</P>
    <P>Laws affect the citizen as a member of a family, as consumer, as tenant or property owner, as employee or employer, as a party to a contract as victim of a tort, as participant in court proceedings, as vendor or purchaser. If a community's laws become inadequate for the functions for which they were designed, if they become obsolete, or are too numerous, or over-refined by judicial interpretation, then cases of individual injustices will multiply and society as a whole will suffer.  Governments in a dynamic fast-changing world should ensure that the laws are kept under constant review and are regularly and systematically reformed.</P>
    <P>It should, of course, be made clear that the proposed legislation which the House in considering is concerned with the concept of law reform, a term which has a distinct and definable meaning.  It is used, generally, to refer to the activity of reforming laws which require legal knowledge and expertise if reforms are satisfactorily to be effected.  Obviously many legislative changes or innovations which could properly be classed reforms in the law require no specialised legal knowledge to bring them about; an alteration in the age qualification for the old age pension, or alternations in the local authority tenant purchase schemes do not require a law reform commission to assist in their enactment.</P>
    <P>There are, however, many areas of possible legislative action which would require expert legal knowledge for adequate action to be taken.  It is with such areas that this Bill deals.  These are not confined to what is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;lawyers law&rdquo;, that is to say laws with a highly technical content of concern to a limited group of persons only.  Law reform in the context we are now discussing will deal with reforms in the laws relating to some of the most important matters of widespread interest and concern&mdash;laws <Col N="1579" /> relating to the family, laws relating to consumer protection, employer and employee relationships, landlord and tenant matters, the rights of persons suffering from personal injuries and many aspects of the citizens basic human rights.</P>
    <P>I feel that there will be general agreement that there is a constant need to develop and implement detailed programmes of law reform.  The Bill before the House proposes an institutional framework which would, it is submitted, assist in such development and implementation.  The framework suggested is basically similar to that adopted in England and Scotland by the Law Commission Act, 1965, in Canada by the Law Reform Commission Act, 1971, and in Australia by the Law Reform Commission Act, 1973.  It is necessary to have an agency for law reform capable of reviewing the law as a whole; it is desirable that the agency should be at once impartial and expert; it should be composed of persons engaged full-time in the task of law reform; it should be able to consult freely with members of the legal profession and obtain the assistance of outside experts from other disciplines; it should command respect; it should work in close co-operation with the Government and through the Government with Parliament. These diverse and wholly desirable ends can best be achieved by the establishment of a Law Reform Commission on the lines suggested in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Whilst the commission which is now proposed will be independent and adopt its own procedures it is certain that experience gained elsewhere will be utilised.  In the light of that experience it can be anticipated that the commission will operate, broadly, on the following lines.  The five commissioners will be assisted by a full-time professional staff.  Obviously legal knowledge and expertise will be necessary to examine the legal problems with which it will be seized, to draft reports and prepare legislation.  Equally obviously the assistance of outside experts from <Col N="1580" /> other fields, such as the social sciences, would greatly facilitate the work of the commission and it can be anticipated that such experts can be associated with the commission in some appropriate form.  The commission will make proposals from time to time for the examination of the laws with a view to their revision and programmes prepared by the commission will suggest how such examination should be carried out, that is to say whether the commission itself should undertake the work or some other agency or body, for example a Government Department or a special committee established for the purpose.</P>
    <P>The commission will no doubt seek to achieve the maximum amount of consultation with members of the legal profession, other experts and interested members of the public on projects undertaken by it and in this connection it may seek the assistance of established expert agencies such as the Economic and Social Research Institute.  It may, in this connection also, issue working papers which will analyse a particular problem with which it is concerned and which will outline the commission's provisional views on possible solutions to it.  Following consultation the commission would then submit a report which would embody its own considered proposals, giving reasons for them and, it is hoped, incorporating its recommendations in a draft Bill.  Its staffing policy can be flexible so that it can, in addition to full-time staff, employ special experts on special subjects for limited periods.</P>
    <P>In addition to the preparation and implementation of its programmes the commission should be able to undertake special reviews from time to time of particular problems which may not have been included in its programmes but which require its urgent and expert attention.  It should publish annually a report which, together with its programmes and reform proposals, should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas to facilitate discussions and comments on its work and on matters relating to law reform generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> I have mentioned in passing the importance of co-operation between the commission and the Government and, through the Government, the Oireachtas.  Such co-operation is of great importance; indeed it is crucial to ensure the speedy formulation and implementation of law reform.  The commission is to be independent in the proposals which it formulates but such independence will not preclude close liaison with the Government in this field of law reform.  The skills and knowledge available to the commission will eminently qualify it to advise and consider the programmes of law reform to be undertaken and whilst it is clear that the Government must approve such programmes&mdash;it must accept ultimate responsibility for priorities in this field&mdash;the commission's independence is not affected by this fact and its considered expert professional judgment will be given without fear or favour.  Its link with the Administration will be through the office of the Attorney General.  The reasons for this are readily understandable. The Office of the Attorney General advises all Government Departments and is uniquely situated to appreciate the needs for legislative changes which become apparent from the work in the office.  A free flow of information between the Government and the commission will be made possible by the arrangements which are envisaged.</P>
    <P>It will be widely appreciated that the tasks facing the commission are considerable and formidable.  As most members of the public have their own particular idea of which branch of the law needs immediate reform, it is obvious that it will be difficult to find widespread agreement as to what areas of law should first be tackled in the commission's initial programmes.  A start however must be made and it is believed that the institution proposed in this Bill will in a comparatively short space of time be a means for bringing about desirable and significant reforms in the laws of our country.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the details of the Bill it is right that this opportunity be taken to pay tribute to the small group <Col N="1582" /> of officials in the public service who have in the past been involved in law reform; to the members of the Judiciary, both branches of the legal profession and academic lawyers, as well as lay people, who have in the past contributed to the work of committees engaged in reforming some aspect of our laws.  It is right, too, to give public acknowledgement to the members of the Judiciary who have in the past, interpreted our laws in a humane and liberal manner so as to help, in so far as their office would permit, this development in accordance with the current social concepts.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal briefly with the principal features of the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the definition of &ldquo;the law&rdquo; contained in section 1 is a wide one.  &ldquo;The law&rdquo; which the commission is to keep under review, and in respect of which it is to prepare reform programmes, includes all the law of the State and embraces private and public international law as well as matters of legal practice and procedure.  I am sure it will be agreed that it is desirable that the commission should have the widest possible terms of reference given to it by the Act.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;reform&rdquo; is also given a wide definition in section 1.  Law reform is often regarded as a process of updating laws by means of statutory amendments.  It should have a wider connotation under this Act.  The commission should not be excluded from considering and formulating proposals for codification which would result in the simplification and modernisation of our laws.  It should also be able to make proposals for the revision and consolidation of statute law.  The statute law reform and consolidation office will of course be unaffected by this Bill, but the commission's programmes may indicate specific areas in the field of statute law revision and consolidation in which it considers the office should be involved.</P>
    <P>Under section 2, the establishment day is to be appointed by the Taoiseach. It is to be hoped that appointments to membership of the commission will be made as soon as <Col N="1583" /> possible after the Bill is enacted and that it will be possible to appoint the establishment day within a short time thereafter, so that the commission can begin its important work without delay.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for the establishment of the Law Reform Commission and its constitution.  Section 4 provides for its functions.  The commission is to comprise five persons, one of whom is to be its president, appointed by the Government.  Subsection (7) is to be read in conjunction with section 14, which latter section will provide that, if a judge of the High Court or the Supreme Court becomes a member of the commission, an additional judge may be appointed.  This power is necessary to avoid the possibility of delays which could otherwise result from the reduction in the number of judges available to fulfil judicial functions in the courts.  In this connection it is to be noted that a judge who acts as a commissioner will not cease to hold judicial office but he shall not be required to perform his duties as the holder of judicial office while he remains a member of the commission.</P>
    <P>It is recognised in subsection (7) that, apart from members of the Judiciary or members of the legal profession and academic lawyers, persons with qualifications other than those of a legal character could contribute to the work of the commission, and subsection (7) is so drafted as to permit the appointment in appropriate cases of such persons to membership of the commission.  In addition the commission will itself have powers which will enable it to employ experts in the social sciences if it considers it helpful to do so.  It is considered desirable to provide for a flexible approach to the terms on which commissioners are to be appointed.  Whilst full-time appointments are obviously desirable, it must be recognised that special circumstances may require that some, at least, of the commissioners should act in a part-time capacity.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) will permit such a flexible approach.  It also places a limit of five years on the term of office of a commissioner as lifetime appointments might not be conducive to the <Col N="1584" /> attainments of the tasks which the commission will be established to fulfil.</P>
    <P>The commission is to be an independent body.  It is right therefore that it should be free to regulate its own procedures and business as it thinks proper and this is so provided for in subsection (14) of section 3.  The remaining subsections are formal and require little comment at this stage. As a matter of practical convenience the commission is to be a body corporate and the section gives the commission the necessary powers ancillary to a body with such a status.</P>
    <P>Section 4 sets out the commission's functions.  It is to keep the law under review.  It is empowered, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to undertake examinations of the law, conduct research with a view to reforming the law and to formulate proposals for law reform.  One of its most important functions will be the preparation, from time to time and in consultation with the Attorney General, of law reform programmes for submission to the Government.  It is important to have a planned and systematic approach to law reform.  It is important to define clearly priorities in the field of law reform and to sensibly allocate scarce resources both of skills and money.  The commissioners' qualifications will ensure that their tasks are expertly fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The law reform programmes will not only recommend the particular branches of the law which should be examined with a view to reform but should suggest the agency which should carry out such examination and formulate proposals.  For example, a programme might suggest that an existing committee could undertake an examination of a particular branch of the law or it might suggest that the commission itself should do so or that a special committee be established for the purpose. When required to do so by the terms of an approved programme the commission itself is empowered by subparagraph (b) of subsection (2) to undertake an examination of and conduct research and formulate proposals for law reform.  The commission's proposals will in the first <Col N="1585" /> instance be transmitted to the Taoiseach who, as head of the Government, can decide how best they should be submitted thereafter to the Government and which should be the sponsoring Department.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (c) of subsection (2) of section 4 is included so that the assistance of the commission can be sought from time to time in areas not included in an approved programme. A decision of the Supreme Court may bring to light an anomaly in the law as a result of which immediate legislative action is desirable.  A proposed development in the secondary legislation of the European Communities or in the rules of public international law may require the sort of expert examination which the commission could bring to bear on the problem. These are examples of instances in which the provisions of the subparagraph could be utilised.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to subsection (3) of section 4.  This is an important subsection.  It would obviously be impracticable, and in any event undesirable, to lay down by statute rigid procedural rules which the commission should follow in the fulfilment of its tasks. It is however desirable that the Oireachtas should set out certain guidelines for the consideration of the commission which the Oireachtas considers might assist it in carrying out its statutory responsibilities.  These guidelines are set out in this subsection. It is suggested that the commission might receive proposals for law reform from members of the public, which would of course include members of the Oireachtas, and that it would consider such proposals for inclusion in any programme for law reform which it may formulate. Obviously most lawyers, many lay people and probably all engaged in social work have ideas as to what areas of our laws call most urgently for reform.  It is equally obvious, as I have already pointed out, that it will be impossible to adopt every suggestion, no matter how meritorious it may be.  The views of interested members of the public would however clearly be of assistance to the commission <Col N="1586" /> in assessing correct priorities and degrees of urgency of particular reforms.  For these reasons subparagraph (a) of subsection (3) has been inserted.</P>
    <P>It has been considered desirable to express in subparagraph (b) of this subsection the view that the commission need not feel constrained in any way by the legal system which pertains in this State and this subparagraph suggests that if it considers it appropriate so to do the commission should examine the legal systems of other countries.  There are many aspects of the Scottish legal system and of the legal systems of our EEC partners which would repay careful examination for the purpose of formulating suitable reforms in the laws of this country.</P>
    <P>Experience both in this country and elsewhere shows that inordinate delays may occur between the presentation by a commission or committee of its report and the implementation of its recommendations in legislation.  Delays of this sort can be considerably reduced if the report contains a draft Bill incorporating its recommendations.  It must be recognised that a shortage of skilled draftsmen may hinder the implementation of subparagraph (c), but it is hoped that ways of overcoming this difficulty may be found.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (d) refers to consultation between the commission and outside qualified persons, subparagraph (e) to the establishment of working parties and advisory committees, subparagraph (f) deals with the publication of preliminary working papers prior to the final formulation by the commission of its reform proposals.  These subparagraphs are interlinked and are informed by a common concept.  It can be laid down as a general rule that the greater the degree of preliminary consultation that occurs the better will be the final proposals for reform and the speedier will be their implementation.</P>
    <P>Obviously the nature and degree of consultation will differ from subject to subject; the views of members of the legal profession, academic lawyers, as well as those with <Col N="1587" /> specialist qualifications in the subject under examination would obviously assist the commission in the preparation of its proposals.  Such views can be obtained by means of the establishment of working parties and advisory committees as well as by the publication of preliminary working papers on which views of professional bodies and others will be sought.  The different ways in which consultation may take place are obviously matters for consideration by the commission itself.  The Bill outlines in these subparagraphs some of the ways in which the commission may operate and, by so doing, expresses a point of view in which the commission will, it is believed, fully concur.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that after a programme has been approved by the Government a copy of it is to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and section 6, which makes provision for the submission of an annual report by the commission to the Attorney General, likewise provides that the annual report which is to be submitted to the Government will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Procedures contained in these sections will not only ensure that Members of the Oireachtas are kept informed of the work of the commission and the progress of law reform undertaken by it but also should afford an opportunity for debates in both Houses on appropriate occasions.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 make provision for the financial aspects of the establishment and operation of the commission. The commission's expenses will be met out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas by means of grant or grants&mdash;section 8.  The Attorney General will have special knowledge and experience which will enable him to express a recommendation to the Minister for Finance in the budgetary proposals which the commission may make each year.  The accounts of the commission are to be submitted annually to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit in the usual way.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill, <Col N="1588" /> other than the section dealing with the Short Title and section 14 to which reference has already been made, make provision for and in relation to the staff of the commission.  In accordance with the independent status which the commission is to enjoy, it is provided by section 10 that the commission is to appoint its own officers and servants.  In so doing it will consult the Attorney General, and the numbers of officers and servants which it may appoint are to be subject to the approval of the Minister for the Public Service.  A distinction is drawn between the clerical staff, to whom the Civil Service Commissioners Act, 1956, and the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, will apply and other officers and servants of the commission. Because of the nature of the work which the commission will be undertaking it is considered desirable to allow the commission considerable flexibility in the appointment of its professional staff.</P>
    <P>By virtue of subsection (2) of section 10, the commission may engage a person in a part-time capacity and by means of the payment of fees rather than on a salary basis.  It is easy to envisage circumstances in which the commission might wish to retain the services of a professional person for a limited period on a fee basis, or in which an academic lawyer may be seconded to the commission for a particular task and so it is important so to legislate that the commission will be empowered to function in this way.</P>
    <P>Subsections (4) and (5) of section 10 refer to a situation which could arise in the expansion of the staff of the commission.  While these subsections do not permit any interference in the independence of the commission in their choice of staff, it was considered desirable to provide that, in the circumstances set out in these subsections, appointments may be subject to methods specified by the Attorney General.  It is, for example, possible to contemplate a situation in which it may be desirable to provide for the advertisement of posts and for the selection of officers by means of an interview board, examination or otherwise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> Sections 11 and 12 deal with the making of superannuation schemes for the Commissioners and for the whole-time officers of the commission.  The provisions of these sections are in the form usual in enactments of the sort now being considered and do not call for any special comment at the present time.  Section 13 will render it impossible for a person to be an employee of the commission and a Member of either House of the Oireachtas at the same time.  It would appear to be clear that employment with the commission would not be compatible with the duties of membership of the Dáil or Seanad and thus it was considered necessary to insert the provisions contained in section 13.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill, in time, will prove an important means for the improvement of many aspects of Irish society and I would hope that this view would be shared by Members of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill on behalf of my party and I hope, with the co-operation of the House, that it will be legislation in a very short time. My party have proposed to the Government that the Committee Stage of the Bill be taken by a select committee of the House which I understand is to be set up this afternoon or whenever the Second Stage concludes.</P>
      <P>The function now proposed to be passed to the Law Reform Commission referred to in the Bill was a function formerly performed by the Attorney General in his control of the law reform consolidation offices in the draftsman section of his Department. In the past few weeks the establishment of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions has relieved the Attorney General of all of the functions in relation to prosecutions formerly dealt with directly by the office of the Attorney General and by the Attorney General himself.  This comprises approximately 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the work of the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that prior to the advent of the Coalition Government the entire work of the Attorney General's office was carried out by the former Attorney General and two legal assistants so far <Col N="1590" /> as all matters other than the drafting of legislation were concerned.  This meant the former Attorney General and two legal assistants dealt with all the work in relation to criminal prosecutions in the courts including the Special Criminal Court.  They advised the Government and all Departments and, in addition, they prepared and dealt with preparations for entry into the EEC. They also prepared the entire preliminary work on the case of Ireland against Great Britain and its initiation at Strasbourg.</P>
    <P>Following the change of Government, the present Attorney General had his staff augmented by four further appointments of experienced barristers, bringing the number of barristers as legal assistants in his office&mdash;quite apart from the parliamentary draftsman's office of the law reform and consolidation offices&mdash;to six highly qualified persons.  There was need for this addition to the staff and it was being prepared for before the change of Government, but it was being prepared for on the basis that the workload of the Attorney General's office would remain the same as it had been and would not be diminished as has happened.  What has happened is that a Director of Public Prosecutions was provided for by the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974. The provision of this office meant that 75 per cent to 80 per cent of the work formerly the responsibility of the Attorney General was transferred to the new office.  I should like the Attorney General to tell us if these assistants will remain in his office or if they will be seconded to the new commission.</P>
    <P>The concept of a law reform commission is a good one but it is dependent on two vital matters.  First, the persons who comprise the commission should be suitable and experienced and it should not be just another vehicle for the preferment of party supporters for which this Government have been notorious.  Secondly, the commission should be seen to be a body that can produce reports speedily and whose proposals are implemented promptly.</P>
    <P>We share with many countries the <Col N="1591" /> common law system.  Those other countries, such as Britain, Canada and Australia have set up permanent law reform bodies.  America, another country that shares the common law, has been engaged for many years in the task of codifying its laws.  We have taken over much of what is outstanding in common law and we have included many of its concepts in our Constitution.  The right to trial by jury, the right to a fair trial and the right to protect one's dwellinghouse are in the form of constitutional guarantees. During the years we have elaborated on and given extra meaning to many of these concepts; for example, the right to fairness in procedures applies not only in courts but in administrative tribunals.  In our statute law we have been in advance of other countries in providing additional protection for certain classes of persons.</P>
    <P>I will give three examples of this. We were ahead of Britain in providing compulsory motor car passenger coverage.  The Succession Act is an outstanding example of providing proper protection for widows and children and I should like to pay tribute to Members of the Dáil and Seanad of all parties who helped to set up this legislation.  Another example is the Civil Liability Act which deals with the whole field of negligence about which most court cases are concerned.  This legislation is as advanced as any measures in other countries.  Indeed, the idea of giving damages for mental distress is quite unique.  At this stage I suggest that the Government should increase the amount which can be awarded under that heading which has been fixed at £1,000 since 1961.  We all know too well what has happened to the value of money since then.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first task that the new commission should set themselves is a comparative examination of the statute law in the two parts of this island.  When we talk of reconciliation it is essential that we should know what laws we share and where we differ and whether, in fact, there are any great fundamental differences. It is obvious to all that we <Col N="1592" /> share the same basic structure and it would be a pity if we could not keep our laws on parallel tracks.</P>
    <P>In his announcement of the setting up of the Law Reform Commission the Attorney General said it might well be that reports from commissioners would draw attention to constitutional problems, particularly in the area of family law reform.  The need for reform in this area has been increasingly recognised in recent times and I will be particularly attentive to any proposals which the Government may make in this respect.  I am concerned that there should be an extension of legal aid to civil cases, particularly where family law is concerned, in connection with maintenance, separation, or guardianship of infants so that no one should be deprived of his or her rights in this regard because of a lack of money.</P>
    <P>On a more domestic front we would need to improve our consumer protection laws.  With spiralling inflation the housewife needs all the protection she can get through our legal system when she is purchasing items in shops.  The last Act dealing with consumer protection was the Sale of Goods Act 1893.  Clearly the law should move more with the times and steps should be taken to outlaw any conditions in a contract which would seek to cut down the protection which the law would give to any consumer.  For example, a customer when he buys an article has the law on his side inasmuch as that the article must work.  However, a customer is often persuaded to sign a so-called guarantee which in effect cuts down his legal rights.</P>
    <P>Many areas of the criminal law require urgent reform.  Our chief Act dealing with theft dates back to 1916. The Act dealing with malicious damage to property dates back to 1861.  At present there is quite good legislation in draft form stockpiled in the Department of Justice&mdash;I am thinking of the Criminal Justice Bill that lapsed.  There were many useful and controversial proposals for the reform of criminal law dealing, for example, with the prohibition of flick-knives, in that.</P>

      <P>We know that the commission will be expected to produce drafts of Bills and we hope that an effort will be made to simplify the language used in legislation.  There are many areas in which the law should be consolidated.  For example, the intoxicating liquor code is spread over a series of Acts from 1844 to 1962.  The habit of having legislation by reference should be curtailed or abandoned altogether.</P>
      <P>The basis for examination and investigation of matters related to law reform seems to be sufficiently covered by the provisions of section 4 of the Bill, that is if one takes it that the provisions of subsection (3) of that section are intended to give the commission a reasonably wide discretion and that the section does not envisage that they must go back and forth to the Government for confirmation, that any particular topic is within the programme for examination propounded under section 4, subsection (2) (a).  However, it would appear that the function of the commission is to be confined solely to the suggestion of material suitable for examination and the examination of that material, if so permitted by the Government, and that the commission are without power to propound the nature and extent of the law reform which they may decide to be suitable to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appears to be the clear effect of section 5 where the word &ldquo;programme&rdquo; seems to refer back to the meaning of the word as it is used in section 4 and not to be capable of any other meaning.  If this is the extent of the powers of the commission <Col N="1594" /> then it would appear to be unsatisfactory. Some method should be found whereby a commission of this quality, having made the full investigation necessary, would have the power to propound the matter in which the particular aspect of law reform should be pursued.  It can be considered that the present method of initiating legislation by which the first proposals come only from the particular Department concerned with the matter in hand is unsatisfactory. In many instances individual Departments have no expertise as to what is acceptable or desirable from a legal and constitutional viewpoint. There is major wastage of time and effort in propounding material that, in the end, must be rejected on, for example, constitutional grounds.</P>
    <P>It is desirable in the highest degree that the present mode of propounding legislation from each individual Department without any real co-ordination between Departments and without any reference to expert legal advice in the first instance and before the proposals are submitted to the Government should at least be supplemented by giving to a commission such as is visualised in the Bill power to propound to the Government the nature and extent of the preliminary proposals for the law reforms they feel desirable.  Therefore, this Bill should be strengthened by giving to the proposed commission at least some powers of this nature which do not seem to be visualised in the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <P>In a matter of detail it is impossible to understand what is meant by the provision contained in section 10 (4) of the Bill.  The subsection refers to the Attorney General making a designation but there is not a clue as to what the designation is to be about. Obviously, it is intended to refer to some kind of post or posts as an officer or officers of the commission but the word &ldquo;designation&rdquo; stands alone in subsections (4) and (5).  It does not appear to relate to subsections (1), (2) or (3) to which it was intended, presumably, to relate.  I think the provision is possibly an undesirable one and should be the subject <Col N="1595" /> of very serious debate and discussion.</P>
    <P>The consequential provisions in section 14, together with the provisions of section 3, subsections (7), (9), and (11), indicate that it is proposed that one or more of the members of the commission is intended to be a judge of either the Supreme Court or the High Court.  As to the latter, it might be the President of the High Court.  It seems to be proper that if a judge is to be a member of the commission he should hold the office of president of the commission rather than being one of the four other members.  The intention of the Government should be made clear in this matter.  Clarification is certainly required.  If it is the intention that more than one judge should be appointed to the commission it should be so stated in this House.</P>
    <P>Looking at section 3, subsection (7), which deals with the qualification of persons to be appointed commissioners some explanation should be given for the inclusion of:</P>
    <P>or by reason of other experience or of other special qualifications or training.</P>
    <P>This is capable of any interpretation one wishes to put on it, and it is far too non-specific for comfort.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from section 11 (7) that this provision is intended to include a civil servant and, perhaps, a civil servant with no very obvious claims to such an appointment.  A provision like section 11 (7) almost always means that the appointment of a civil servant to the commission on their initiation is envisaged.  I should certainly like this commission to be as independent a body as any body can be.  I hope that, once the commission are set up, their independence will not be interfered with in any way, for any reason, by any member of the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party in Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Collins on his new appointment on his party's front bench and also on his first handling of a legal matter in this House.  I should like to begin by referring briefly to a few <Col N="1596" /> things he said.  Perhaps I will be forgiven if I refer to the note on which he chose to end.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy and the House that the very same person who is promoting this Bill, which has attracted in Deputy Collins' opening speech the references to jobs being made for political supporters of the Government, is the person who promoted the Prosecution of Offences Act which, in effect, destroyed patronage of a political or any other kind at the Bar.  While I will not play childish games with the Deputy opposite by pretending that things have not happened which have happened, and while he will not expect me to do that, he will, I hope, have enough grace to admit that the Prosecution of Offences Act, sponsored by the Attorney General in front of me, was intended to&mdash;and so far as I am aware has done so&mdash;put an end to political patronage in the assignment of State work at the Bar.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of his remarks Deputy Collins referred to the fact that this is the second change which the Attorney General has sponsored since taking office.  He spoke of what I do not think he would mind being paraphrased as an inflation of personnel in the Attorney General's office.  There are three points which I would draw to his attention in that connection.  I agree that the predecessor of the present Attorney General under the last Government carried out functions which will now be distributed, to some extent at least, between the Attorney General, the Director of Prosecutions and the Law Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people welcomed the creation of the office of public prosecutions and I think the Opposition welcomed it&mdash;I give them credit for that&mdash;for the reason that its creation increased public confidence in the machinery which precedes the institution of a prosecution.  It is an independent office and it is as clearly fenced around from interference of an improper kind, political or any other kind, as it possibly can be.  That feature alone would have justified its creation, independent of the office of <Col N="1597" /> the Attorney General who, in the nature of things, must be a political animal if he is to attend Government meetings and advise the Government on the legal aspects of questions which may have very large political dimensions as well.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I would have been happy if Deputy Collins had acknowledged that the present Attorney General and his staff have had to absorb, along with their other work, a colossal burden of business in connection with the Sunningdale talks, the Sunningdale Agreement, and the resultant efforts to implement aspects of that agreement.  The fact that the Sunningdale arrangement seems to have run into the ground does not take away from its lasting value.  It will remain a monument to the efforts of decent Irish and English people of all kinds to find a peaceful solution to the problem of the country.  I cannot believe that the investment in that effort will have been wasted in the long term, even though it may have met with a temporary check at the moment.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I hope Deputies opposite will not take it as being intended offensively towards any previous holder of the office of Attorney General if I say that, perhaps as an indirect result of the inadequate staffing of that office, law reform, the very thing we are talking about here today, was left far behind.  I quite understand and accept that it is not the sole function of the Attorney General to promote law reform but he certainly is a person who must take an interest in law reform.  If one is asked to explain how it is that law reform proceeded so slowly here, over the past generation or two generations, it may very easily be that the overloading of the Attorney General's office and the singularity of the person who carried the responsibility for it were very large contributory factors.</P>
    <P>All I want to do in welcoming the Bill and supporting it, is to draw the attention of the House to three or four instances of neglect which the absence of a dynamic law reform engine has caused within living memory, and within fairly recent living memory.  Without going into <Col N="1598" /> detail which a layman would not be interested in, I should like to give a couple of very simple instances of which the most conspicuous is the law on contributory negligence.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, it was the law here up to 1961 that, if the plaintiff in a road accident or a factory accident case had been guilty of any degree of negligence, notwithstanding the fact that the other party to the action, the other driver or the owner of the factory, had been guilty of gross negligence, the plaintiff would utterly fail to recover damages.  Perhaps that is a crude statement of a different subject but broadly speaking it is true. In 1961 that law was changed by the Civil Liability Act which has since provided for an apportionment of damages in a percentage ratio to the degree of fault which the jury or the judge find to have existed on one side or the other.  That accords with reason.</P>
    <P>That change had been made in Britain in 1945, 16 years previously.  I am assuming for the purpose of the argument something which I do not believe, namely, that we must trot after the British and not go ahead of them.  I do not believe that, but let us assume it for the purpose of the argument. How many plaintiffs lost their actions and had to do without compensation for serious injuries, for which somebody was very substantially to blame, due to the delay in producing that piece of law reform which was crying out to be made and which our nearest neighbour had made 16 years previously?</P>
    <P>Another instance of a slightly different kind is afforded by the law in regard to actions against the State where the State, through one of its servants, has inflicted injury on a citizen.  That subject is entagled in antique constitutional difficulties.  These difficulties were sliced through in Britain in 1947, by a Crown Proceedings Act which, since that year, has enabled citizens to bring actions without any bother against the Crown where one of the Crown's servants through negligence has caused damage or injury.</P>
    <P>In 1962, 13 years ago, a very slim little booklet of not more than 12 or <Col N="1599" /> 16 pages was issued by the Department of Justice here called <i>A Programme of Law Reform.</i> It foreshadowed the early introduction of similar legislation here which would give the Irish citizen an analogous remedy against the State. Repeated questions were asked in this House over the following seven or eight years about when we would have a State Proceedings Act which would put the citizen, in his dealings with the State in this sort of setting, on the same footing as if he were suing one of his own fellow citizens.  The reply was that it was coming up shortly.  In the end, the Supreme Court caught up with the then Government.  It was the Supreme Court in the end which established, in 1970, I think, the right of the citizen to sue Ireland in respect of injuries sustained through the negligence of a State servant.</P>
    <P>To this day no legislation has arrived on our Statute Book which establishes what in Britain was established in 1947.  The whole story has been overtaken by the Supreme Court and not by the Oireachtas which was the proper place to have regularised it because, if I may say so without disrespect to the courts, a court decision, although it may be very far-reaching in its results, is essentially directed to the facts of the particular case before it. That way of making the law is not necessarily entirely satisfactory, because a court, focussed, as it may be, on the facts of the case before it, cannot take into full consideration, in the way the Oireachtas can, all the various possibilities.  It cannot on Committee Stage thrash out, so to speak, the various possibilities that may arise from a particular legal proposition being made into law.  Not infrequently when law is made by the courts, consequences flow from it which have to be checked, impeded or inhibited by Parliament in case they go too far. That may not necessarily be the case regarding the decision which here has taken the place of what ought to have been a State Proceedings Act, but it may be.</P>
    <P>Without the slightest disrespect&mdash;I hope there is no need to say that&mdash;<Col N="1600" /> I recall a decision given by the Supreme Court in the matter of bail, which proved in effect something of an embarrassment to the police.  It is fairly common knowledge that a good proportion of offences are committed by persons, already at liberty on bail, and awaiting trial on charges relating to other offences.  The granting of bail, no doubt as a result of extremely well-meaning and liberal interpretation of the Constitution, is much more common than it used to be.  The police are in a much weaker position than they used to be.  I do not want to sound illiberal about this.  I recognise that personal liberty is not a trivial thing, but it seems it would have been preferable if the Oireachtas had faced up to the problem presented by bail and tried to regularise it by statute rather than wait until the Supreme Court, in a particular decision which was inspired by the facts of that case, set out guidelines without the matter being thrashed out on Committee Stage and without having what I may call departmental advice behind the court.</P>
    <P>Naturally, a statute enacted here is not protected and cannot be protected against attack in the courts.  That is as it should be.  We could pass laws until we were blue in the face and if the Supreme Court found them repugnant to the Constitution they would keep on cutting them down.  But the chances of finding ourselves in a condition of embarrassment either from the point of view of the police or any other section of the community is a good deal less if the Oireachtas have had a chance to look at a particular problem and legislate about it.  I think if this Bill when it becomes law has the effect of enabling that to be done more commonly, it will be very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I shall give two more examples of gaping holes in the law which I hope this commission will close.  One of these is another matter of which reform was foreshadowed in the 1962 law reform programme, the malicious injuries code, which is based on the idiotic assumption that the inhabitants of a particular county must bear some imputed liability for criminal acts <Col N="1601" /> committed within their county even in the case where it is clearly known and proved that the person who committed the Act is not only not a resident of the county but may not even be an Irish citizen or a resident of the country.  In 1962 the programme foreshadowed the possible reform of this area of the law but it has been reformed only piece-meal&mdash; it has not been really reformed. Mitigations of it have been carried out by the Government in cases where a particularly heavy award in regard to malicious injury has fallen on a particular county; but the problem of principle represented by the malicious injuries code has not been faced up to 13 years after it had been adverted to by the Department of Justice in their law reform programme.</P>
    <P>I shall not blame one side or the other for that, although it would be easy to do so.  It may in part be due to overwork, overpressure and lack of individuated responsibility for doing this particular job in two or three separate Departments of State.  Lack of pinpointing responsibility for getting something done in this regard will, I believe, be removed by this Bill and to that extent I would be more optimistic that in the future we shall not be complaining about very long delays in reforming the law in directions where we are all agreed it should be reformed.</P>
    <P>The last example I shall give is perhaps the most frightening.  It is certainly more sensitive and delicate than the other ones.  It is the area of matrimonial law.  The civil matrimonial law of the State is unbelievably antique; it has been far overtaken in liberality and sophistication by the canon law of the Catholic Church; and in regard to having marriages annulled, I do not need to tell the House that the code of canon law and civil law are completely independent systems and the fact that your marriage is annulled in canon law does not relieve you from the obligation, if you wish the State to treat it as a nullity, from having it annulled in the civil court also.  It seems to be a ridiculous anomaly that the Church should now be more <Col N="1602" /> liberal and sophisticated than the State in its interpretation of the rules regarding nullity, whether consent is defective and so on, and it seems indefensible that this situation should be allowed to continue.  Not being an expert on it, and speaking subject to correction, I do not think our law regarding nullity has been touched by statute since the State was founded.  I do not think there has been a line of legislation since this State was founded 53 years ago which has modernised or in any way affected the civil law of nullity of marriage, although the perceptions won by modern psychology have advanced out of all recognition in the same period. Medical and sociological knowledge and psychological understanding have advanced, but our law of nullity remains the same as it was in 1922; and I would guess that the law then was probably not much different from what it was in 1822.</P>
    <P>These are a few examples in which I hope there is nothing controversial. I could extend the list very much, but there is no sense in pushing what is evidently an open door.  I welcome the Opposition's attitude to the Bill and hope it will have the effect which I, and I think all of us, desire for it.</P>
    <P>It is true, as Deputy Collins said, that the Opposition suggested sending this Bill to a special committee and that suggestion was willingly and gladly accepted by the Government. It will save this House some time.  I do not know how long the Bill would have taken in Committee, perhaps two or three hours, but that time will be saved.  In case Deputy Collins' words may have inadvertently created a wrong impression I should like to say, that that suggestion from the Opposition, constructive and welcome though it is, was made only after repeated pressure from our side, that we should go ahead and make use of the special committees which were, in fact, suggested by a committee over which Deputy O'Malley had presided. The suggestion was made by us in connection with another Bill and was rejected by the Opposition.  But they have come back now and made this suggestion in regard to this Bill, <Col N="1603" /> and certainly it is welcomed on this side.  I hope this committee will work well and will persuade both sides of the House to make greater use of committees in the future.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker, I am glad to see this Bill introduced.  I am sure it will have a speedy passage, particularly as it is going to a committee outside the House. I do not see much likelihood of conflict on the terms of any of the sections. For that reason I regard it as suitable, unlike certain other Bills that have been suggested for these special committees.  Because there is considerable political ideological differences in relation to certain other Bills, they are not suitable to be debated in a room by a small group of people, in private, outside the House.  This one is because I do not foresee any conflict about its principles or to a great extent its terms.</P>
      <P>I note the Bill proposes that the five commissioners will be appointed by the Government.  In the normal way, I suppose, that is fair enough but, unfortunately, one cannot but advert to the unhappy history of legal appointments by the Government since they assumed office 23 months ago.  Regrettably, it has been an unhappy and sorry history.  Not the least of the various unhappy aspects of this has been the question of the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions to which the Parliamentary Secretary was referring in the course of his speech when I came into the House and on which he considered the Government had done a splendid day's work by establishing that office and by taking about 80 per cent of the Attorney General's work away from him, leaving him and his staff in a situation that one would think possibly they were candidates for payments under the Redundancies Acts. I have no wish in any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to appear critical of the eventual appointee to the office whom I knew in my time as <Col N="1604" /> Minister as a competent and very hard-working public servant.  He is a man well capable of performing the functions of the office.  But it is very disturbing that the unanimous recommendation of the committee which was established under that Act to vet candidates was ignored by the Government even though the committee, from what I am told, expressed the view that their nominee was clearly more suitable than any other.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that this matter was raised in the House by way of question by, I think, Deputy Andrews to the Taoiseach, who asked him two fairly harmless questions: how many applicants there were for the post in question and how many, if any, of them were women.  The reply of the Taoiseach to both questions was that he did not know how many applicants there were and he did not know if any of them were women.  I would venture to think that it would be impossible for the Taoiseach not to know as the whole operation was carried on in his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee was set up by him and the report of the committee on their interviews with the various candidates, and their selection and positioning of the various candidates was sent, in the first instance to the Taoiseach.  I believe the reason the Taoiseach gave the answer he did was that he could not stand over what the Government did in relation to the recommendations of that committee, which was totally to ignore them.  Of course, the reason they did so was that the man recommended by that committee as being far superior to any other candidate was well-known to be closely associated with this party.  That fact, and that fact alone, disqualified him and the committee concerned&mdash;which was a representative one and included people such as the Chief Justice, the President of the Incorporated Law Society, the Chairman of the Bar Council, the Senior Assistant in the Attorney General's office, the Secretary to the Government and, I think, one other equally eminent person&mdash; found themselves in the situation that their recommendation was <Col N="1605" /> totally ignored by the Government for the reason I have given.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that that action by the Government came simply as the latest in a succession of judicial appointments which have given rise to a fair amount of disquiet generally and in the legal profession in particular. The qualification of most recent appointees to the Bench is that they were unsuccessful parliamentary, presidential or Seanad candidates for one or other of two political parties in recent years.  Defeat in a parliamentary or Presidential election may well not carry with it any great stigma, and it does not so far as the practice of the law is concerned, but it stretches coincidence a little far in the eyes of many people that defeat in Seanad, Dáil or Presidential election seems to be the <i>sine qua non</i> of obtaining judicial appointment in the past 23 months.  I do not need to remind the House how considerably the practice of the past 23 months contrasts with that before then, where, indeed, it was alleged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One section of the Bill provides that the members of the Commission shall be appointed by the Government.  I started off to point out that I had certain misgivings about that.  Admittedly, perhaps, with the indulgence of the Chair, I gave at some length the reasons for my misgivings.  I revert now to the section of the Bill which provides for the appointment of the commissioners by the Government.  I express the hope, <Col N="1606" /> even though I do not do so with any great confidence in the light of events of the past 23 months, that the five commissioners who will be appointed by the Government, after the passage of this Bill, will be appointed on their merits and that it will not have been necessary for them to have been former Members of this House or former candidates for election to this House on behalf of either the Fine Gael or Labour parties.</P>

      <P>I should think it is a general principle that a commission appointed by the Government could have been appointed by other bodies such as the committee which was set up to deal with the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions but there is no such facade in this Bill.  It is clear from the start that the Government will make the appointments. On behalf of the legal profession and of the many others who are interested in these matters and who are concerned in regard to them I urge the Government&mdash;but not with a great deal of confidence&mdash;to ensure that the most suitable people are appointed to act as commissioners. All that needs to be taken into account are their knowledge of law and legal procedure, their ability to recommend modernisation and reform and, in particular, to prepare legislation arising out of such recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the various places which was concerned in recent years with law reform was the Department of Justice.  This was one of the main Departments in which law reform was expected to be carried out.  I was in that Department for almost three years but, unfortunately, I did not achieve very much in the way of law reform although we brought forward and had passed some useful Bills. However, the reason for our not achieving more in this sphere was that <Col N="1607" /> neither I, personally, nor the appropriate officials in the Department were in a position during most of that period to devote to law reform the sort of time that such work requires if it is to be undertaken successfully.</P>
    <P>The situation was that officials who were skilled particularly in various aspects of law reform had to be taken away from that work and, in the national interest, deployed on other work in which, perhaps, they were less skilled but in which their talents were needed urgently.  Likewise, as Minister, I was unable to devote anything more than a small fraction of my time to considering the problems that were involved in relation to law reform. The problems are considerable but I am hopeful that this proposed commission, since it appears that they are to have full-time members, will be able to go ahead with this work quickly and that as a result Bills dealing with law reform will be brought before the House in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>The commission will not have to start from scratch.  To my personal knowledge large amounts of work have been carried out in the Department in this field but, unfortunately, in many cases it has not been completed.  This is because there has not been available enough time to complete the work.  In particular I recall a major landlord and tenant Bill being produced to me in 1971 after several years of drafting but which, unfortunately, was so complex that I had to suggest it be redrafted.  If the commission were to work on that Bill and have it produced here, they would be doing a very good day's work.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the commission are to be encouraged to draft Bills and not merely to bring in reports.  One of the major causes of the delays in the past was that although one might receive a very good report the chances were slim of having it drafted into legislation within a reasonable period.  In my time in the Department I can recall only one commission bringing in a report to which they appended a Bill in draft form.  This was the Bill which proposed to reform and modernise the law on bankruptcy.  It was presented to <Col N="1608" /> me in 1972 by a commission who had sat for ten years.  I discovered then that it was not clear whether the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Industry and Commerce should deal with bankruptcy but I was prepared to take it on myself to introduce the Bill.  Unfortunately, however, very shortly afterwards there was the general election of 1973 and, consequently, I lost the opportunity of introducing that Bill.  It is a huge Bill, very complicated but very necessary because of our bankruptcy law being so much out of date.  All of the law in this regard is about 100 years old and the commercial conditions at that time were totally different from what they are now.</P>
    <P>The procedure that must be adopted in the bankruptcy office is extremely unwieldy, slow and tedious. Bankruptcies which, unfortunately, because of the economic recession of the past 18 months, are becoming an increasing feature of life, are slow proceedings to hear.  Creditors are receiving smaller dividends than might otherwise be the case if we had a more up-to-date system of law in this sphere and the bankrupt is being kept in bankruptcy for a far longer period than is usual in other countries and for a far longer period than is necessary.  I hasten to add that this is not the fault of the assignee of bankruptcy or of any official.  It is a result of the system.  I urge whichever Minister is responsible to bring forward that Bill.  Perhaps it is not perfect in its present state but we could go into it in detail on its Committee Stage.  It is a Bill that could be dealt with ideally in detail by a committee outside the House.</P>
    <P>The fact that this commission are to draft Bills as well as to make recommendations should speed up the whole question of reform generally. Another reason why I am glad the commission are being set up is that their existence should be the means of getting rid of a practice that has developed in this House during the past ten or 12 years whereby when a Bill that was of a general law reform nature was brought before the House, one or two sections of it became controversial, <Col N="1609" /> the reason for the controversy being that, while drafted by academic lawyers who had no political interest but who endeavoured simply to modernise the law as they saw fit, the Bill was introduced by a Minister whose opponents decided to tackle him about various provisions of the Bill with the result that good Bills became bogged down completely for long periods and, in some cases, were never passed.  The provisions in those Bills were not such as to justify the rumpus raised in relation to them. In future, because of this commission a Minister may come into the House with a Bill and in addition to laying the Bill before the House, he may lay before the House also the report and draft relating to the Bill which he received from the commission and may say: &ldquo;These are not my suggestions.  They are the work of the commission who believe they should be implemented, subject to the views of the House.  I am merely promoting them here&rdquo;.  One would hope that in that way Bill of the kind I have in mind would be less controversial than they were in the past.</P>
    <P>I should hope also that there would arise a situation that because a Bill is not the Minister's as such but is something adopted by him he would consider himself freer to accept any useful suggestion that might be made on Committee Stage or elsewhere in relation to any of the Bill's provisions than has been our experience in the past 23 months.  During that time we have had situations of Bills being brought forward by various Ministers but in respect of which changes that were seen to be desirable were not made.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister concerned in each case felt that in some way he would be letting himself down or that it would be a political victory for the Opposition if he were to accept the amendment.  That is foolish.  Bills have gone through this House in the past two years which were not as good as they could have been if our suggestions had been accepted.  I hope that because a Bill will be seen to emanate from this commission in future rather than from a Department, Ministers <Col N="1610" /> will be more willing to accept patently correct suggestions made here than they have been during the period about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>I note it is intended that the commission should set out programmes of what they propose to do and should obtain the consent or approval of the Government for these programmes.  It would be wrong to tie the commission to precise implementation of these programmes because frequently it is necessary at short notice to make some change in the law.  I hope this Bill will be flexible enough to allow the commission to deal with such a situation in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion.</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to close down the law reform section in the Department of Justice and transfer all its staff to the commission?  Or, if it is proposed to maintain the section, on what basis? I note from what the Attorney General said that it is proposed to maintain the statute law reform and consolidation office.  I would have thought that that might profitably be merged with the commission because in many ways their functions will run parallel.  We have not seen in this House in recent years much codification or statute law reform of the kind done by that office.  I had hoped that a number of such measures would have been introduced here over the past two years.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope that the approach to the appointment of the five commissioners will be different from that adopted in regard to other legal, judicial and quasi-judicial appointments over the past 23 months.  They caused much disquiet in the legal profession and the country generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of this Law Reform Commission and wish them well in their work.  Law reform has been with us since the rule of law was first established here.  This is not the first time serious consideration was given to law reform.  A system of precedents has built up over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hardly a month or a week passes that a judge does not give a decision which throws new light on a certain aspect of law.  In recent years much <Col N="1611" /> good work was done on statute law.  I refer in particular to the Succession Act, 1965.  We did not just follow the English and copy them, we took a bold step and drew up a code of law for the inheritance of property which fits Irish conditions very well.</P>
    <P>That leisurely pace of development might have been all right in the old days when a man visited a solicitor once or twice or at most three times in his lifetime.  He probably went when he got married to make a will, went back when he bought a house to draw up a mortgage and when his father or mother died he went to prove the will. Nowadays all individuals, regardless of age, see a solicitor many times in their life.  They might have an accident going home from work.  The Land Commission might step in and take an interest in their holding.  A multitude of things could happen which would necessitate their visiting a solicitor.  However simple the problem might be, very often a solicitor will not have the answer.  Even the counsel, when the case is presented to him, will not know the answer.</P>
    <P>I read somewhere that there are over 3,000 statutes and over 300,000 reported cases.  I hope the Law Commission will not delve into all this to try to bring the law up-to-date because that would be an impossible task.  All I want them to do is keep their ears tuned to public opinion and root out the areas where reform should take place.  I can think of several areas but the most glaring at the moment is the law dealing with malicious damage to property.  This law was introduced before we had a police force.  When property was damaged, the owners, the innocent victims and their neighbours, had to pay for the damage. This system has continued down through the years.  There was a study carried out in 1965 but its recommendations were not acted upon.  This area should get the attention of the Law Commission with a view to its complete reform.  I would like the commission also to look across the water to the EEC and try to get the laws not just in uniformity but in conformity with the broad concept of law throughout the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> Deputy O'Malley's remarks on the commission and their formation were typically cynical.  No matter what is brought into this House he says it means jobs for the boys.  There was a Bill introduced in this House very recently and it certainly did not provide any jobs for the boys.  It was set out in a very impartial way and I feel this commission will be set up in the same manner.</P>
    <P>As some of the commissioners will gain very valuable experience during their term of office, I would not like to see them being dropped at the end of the five-year period.  Some of them should be reappointed.  I do not know if that is set out in the Bill but if not it should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the House has given a welcome to this measure. I would like to repeat the view expressed on both sides that there is a need for a systematic approach to law reform.  The institutional framework we are proposing will be a means for fulfilling this need.  In view of the general welcome given to the Bill, our main discussions will probably be in the Special Committee to be established.  Accordingly, I need not detain the House at any great length on matters of detail which we can discuss later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like, however, to pick up a few points made in the course of the discussion.  I can assure Deputy G. Collins that the officers of my office will not apply for redundancy payments nor would they qualify as a result of the appointment of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the creation of his office.  It is a matter of detail which I think I should correct for the purpose of the record.  In fact, the amount of time spent by officers of the Attorney General was approximately 50 per cent in relation to crime and 50 per cent in relation to other work.  As far as I personally was concerned I can inform the House that a much greater percentage of my time was taken up on non-criminal matters and <Col N="1613" /> I would imagine that this was the experience of my predecessors in office too.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the Director of Public Prosecutions will of course raise problems in relation to the staffing both of his office and of the Attorney General's office.  These are problems which obviously will have to be considered very shortly and I do not wish to anticipate the solutions to them but I would like to take up something Deputy O'Malley said with which I agreed very strongly.  The problem we have faced in this country in the past in relation to the area of law reform generally has been a shortage of skilled personnel.  It is generally true to say that the legal services available to the Government, throughout the whole Government, have been inadequate.  This has put a tremendous burden on the legally qualified people in the different branches of the public service including the Office of the Attorney General.  Far from there being too many redundant legal officers available to the Government for legal advice, it seems to me that one of the matters which should give concern is that delays occur due to the fact that the number of legally qualified personnel is small.</P>
    <P>One of the very considerable new factors that has arisen in relation to the legal services available to Government Departments has been our entry into the EEC.  There is now a great volume of advice being sought by many Government Departments from the office of the Attorney General of a sort which never arose before our entry into the EEC.  Government Departments are being faced virtually daily with important decisions which require the assistance of the legal expertise available to the Office of the Attorney General. Therefore the character of the work of the Attorney General's office has undoubtedly been changed as a result of the establishment of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions but it has also been changed very considerably by the fact that we are now in the EEC and a great deal of the time of the officers of the Office, which heretofore might have been available purely for advising Government Departments <Col N="1614" /> on their ordinary legal problems, is now taken up with the special, new, very difficult and very intricate problems arising from our membership of the EEC.  In addition, the question of servicing expert committees of the EEC has arisen in a very acute form and all this has placed the officers of the Attorney General's Office under considerable strain and has indicated very clearly the need for expanding the legal advice available to the Government.</P>
    <P>I agree completely with the points raised in a general way by Deputy Collins.  We have in the past been able to develop our law in certain areas in a way different and in advance of that in the neighbouring jurisdiction.  While that is true and reference has been made in particular to the Succession Act, undoubtedly it is also true that the United Kingdom, with its vastly greater resources, has been more successful than we have in programmes of law reform.  The United Kingdom has resources which must be the envy of most countries in the world in this sphere and we cannot hope to emulate them, but the experience which they have had is of benefit to us.  The experience which they have had in Canada and Australia can also be of benefit to us.  This institutional framework of a full-time commission with an expert staff is something which we will adopt, I hope, in this legislation and which will enable us, by bringing in a whole lot of new expertise to this field, to expand the programmes of law reform which it must be agreed have been too slow in the past.</P>
    <P>I think there would be general agreement on the desirability of more consolidation. Consolidation of statues is of very great importance and I hope that shortage of skilled staff will not hinder this very important work.  It is not quite correct, as Deputy Collins seemed to say, that what the Law Commission will do is to take over some of the work in this field which heretofore was undertaken by the Attorney General.  This is not so.  The Attorney General has no function at the moment in relation to law reform.  In so far as the Office of Law Reform and Consolidation is concerned, it depends on instruction from other Departments <Col N="1615" /> and it carries out the views that are conveyed to it from other Departments through the Government in relation to consolidation of statutes.  I do not think there is any question of transferring from the Office of the Attorney General to the new commission any functions which heretofore were in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>Certain views were expressed by Deputy Collins in relation to what he regarded as defects in the proposals in relation to the drafting of the programmes which the commission would draw up.  We can discuss these in the Committee but it is not intended in any way to constrain the commission in the preparation of its draft programmes.  Frankly, what we had in mind when putting forward these suggestions were ideas based on the experience in the United Kingdom in relation to the Law Commission of Scotland as well as the Law Commission of England and Wales. Deputy Collins will see in the programmes prepared by those two bodies the manner in which they have approached their task of preparing programmes and it is envisaged that the commission here will do likewise. Therefore in preparing a draft programme the commission here would be absolutely free to outline the problem which it sees and recommend how the programme of research should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>In relation to the point raised by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the programme, it is provided in the Bill already that the commission can be seised of problems and be requested to undertake research into problems which are not included in the programme. This is provided for in section 4 (2) (c).  I dealt with this in my opening remarks.  Briefly the position would be that situations could well arise, and experience elsewhere has shown that they do arise, which are not covered by the programme on which the advice of the Law Reform Commission would be desirable and which should be referred to it.  This mechanism is provided for in the subsection to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> We can probably discuss more appropriately in committee the designation order.  The concept here is that the situation could develop.  If, for example, the committee are expanding their staff considerably, without any interference in any way with their freedom to appoint members of their staff it may be thought desirable to have some form of competitive examination, perhaps have an advertisement, for the selection of candidates.  The concept here is if this is thought desirable there should be some provision in the Bill for it.  We can discuss this in committee.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to refer in any way, as Deputy O'Malley did, to the absolutely confidential proceedings of the selection committee in relation to the DPP and also the confidential proceedings of the Cabinet and I do not intend to do so.  I am entitled to say it is not proper for a Deputy to make statements based on what could only be the assumption that this highly qualified, responsible group of people, the selection committee, informed a Deputy of what their recommendations were.  I do not think it is proper to refer to this in any way and I do not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was correct when he underlined the difficulties he had as Minister for Justice.  Obviously, he was Minister at a time when his attention and the attention of his officials were very much exercised by the needs of the security situation among others.  Equally obviously, the staff available to the then Minister for Justice and the present Minister for Justice was not sufficient to carry out the reforms in the law which would be the particular concern of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Of course, law reform does not cover merely the Minister for Justice. It covers the whole gamut of Government and the whole concept behind the establishment of an independent body outside the Government is that it can review the whole law, not merely from the point of view of a Department and make appropriate recommendations.  Deputy Toal's point in relation to the re-appointment of the commissioners is obviously one we can discuss in committee.  It is undesirable <Col N="1617" /> that there should be full-time life appointments as commissioners. The reasons for these are fairly obvious but I think it is also desirable if a particular person was highly qualified and suitable and desired to continue his appointment he could continue beyond the five year period.  It is not intended that such a development is to be stopped by the Bill and it is not intended if somebody acted for five years he would not be eligible for re-appointment. This is a matter to see to when the time comes and the views of the committee of what is appropriate in this connection can, of course, be canvassed. I think this is all I need say at this stage of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea that this Bill is to go to a special committee.  I have long favoured the use of special committees of this House.  A great many of our problems in the House and in the Oireachtas generally could be overcome by much greater use of special committees and a transfer of legislation from the Dáil to special committees.  I hope this Bill will set a precedent which will be followed later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, in view of the crisis in the private sector of the house building industry, provision should now be made for</P>
      <P>(a) an increase in the local authority maximum new house loan limit to £6,000 and in the income limit to £3,000;</P>
      <P>(b) a 50 per cent increase in new house grants;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> (c) the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000;</P>
    <P>(d) the granting of trustee status to building societies; and</P>
    <P>(e) the charging of fixed interest rates on building society mortgages.</P>
    <P>We are urging the Minister to accept this motion to revitalise the private sector of the house building industry.  We have two main objectives. The first and basic one is to give to as many people as possible a real opportunity to build their own homes.  The second objective&mdash;to reduce unemployment&mdash;is of particular significance at the present time when the unemployment rate has soared to approximately 100,000.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that no industry is as capable of giving a response in added employment as quickly as the building industry can. I feel, given the necessary financial assistance, that the private sector of the building industry is capable of providing a dramatic increase in employment.</P>
    <P>There is little need for me to stress the necessity to enable as many people as possible to build their own homes. Apart from any other consideration, the more people who build their own homes the less is the strain placed on local authority housing, and the better opportunity those people who could never hope to build their own homes have of getting a local authority house at an early date.  The desirability of creating this kind of situation is particularly apparent to Members of this House who are being constantly requested by young married couples, often with young families living in intolerable conditions, to help them to get a house so that they can live normal lives and get away from surroundings where they must cook, eat, sleep and live with their children in a single room and, in urban areas particularly, often up three or four flights of stairs.</P>
    <P>Anything that can be done to improve the lot of these people must be done as a matter of urgency, and <Col N="1620" /> we are suggesting that improving conditions relative to loans and grants will help them directly or indirectly. It will help them directly by enabling them to build their own homes, or indirectly by reducing the list of applicants for local authority houses. There are applicants on the list for local authority houses for long periods of time.  In some areas it is not possible to get a house unless there are one or two children in the family.  If we are to make real progress in housing these people, we must accelerate the housing drive on all fronts, but what I am mainly concerned with here is accelerating the housing drive in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why it is desirable that people, where possible, should build their own homes.  In rural Ireland, for example, people tend to build their houses where they themselves were reared.  This ensures the continued viability of the area in question, because the facilities already available, such as churches, schools and halls, continue to be fully utilised. This, in turn, saves the State considerable financial outlay.  In my experience, local authorities tend to build groups of houses around existing villages and to bring people in need of these houses from the more rural areas, whether they wish to come there or not.  This ultimately results in much greater expenditure by the State on, for example, new schools or extensions to schools, while existing schools and other facilities in rural areas are utilised at less than half of their capacity.</P>
    <P>The contributions from this side of the House during the budget debate stressed the need to make the best possible use of Government expenditure to stimulate employment.  We are, therefore, very disappointed to find that the Government have done little or nothing to make the necessary funds available to lift the private housing sector of the construction industry out of the doldrums in which it finds itself at present.  It is a truism that when the building and construction industry is buoyant, then the whole economy is in a healthy state, and of course, the opposite is equally true.  It is, therefore, a matter of concern <Col N="1621" /> that the increase in the capital budget for the construction industry generally barely keeps pace with inflation and takes no account of continuing escalating prices, and that the private housing sector does not even reach this level.  Extra assistance in this field would be particularly helpful, because most of the materials used are home-produced, and because of the considerable employment in ancillary industries.</P>
    <P>The private housing sector has been particularly badly hit over the past two years.  Little positive action has been taken by the Government to cope with the inflationary trends in respect of loans and grants for private housing, and I think there is general agreement now that the present level of loans and grants and the qualifying income limits are unrealistic.  The present income limit to qualify for a local authority loan is £2,350 per annum. This limit has remained static since September, 1973.  The cost of living has been escalating since that period, and this certainly has not eased the problems of the married man with a family trying to provide a home.  Since September, 1973, wages and salaries have been increased more than once, but these increases, at best, simply kept pace with the cost of living, with the inflationary trend, and did not improve the standard of living of those who received the increases.</P>
    <P>One thing, however, these increases in income did in many instances was to remove a considerable number of people outside the qualifying income limit for local authority housing loans and supplementary grants. People's living standards have not improved one iota, but their prospects of building a home of their own have reached zero level, because they were no longer entitled to a local authority loan or grant.  I had a case recently where a person called at the local authority office to apply for a housing loan.  He was told to get a certificate of income from his employer, which happened to be a State Department.  He called at the Department to get the certificate and was told it would be sent on.  It was not sent on for quite a long time.  In the meantime his income increased, and <Col N="1622" /> he was then ineligible.  I need not tell the Minister how this man felt about his position.</P>
    <P>The point I am making here is that if, by reason of a cost of living increase in wages or salary, a person finds himself outside the income limit for a housing loan or grant, then he is in an infinitely worse position than he was.  His standard of living has not changed, and I am convinced this situation must, in justice, be rectified by increasing the qualifying income limit.  This then is the request we are making, that the income limit should be raised to £3,000 per annum.  There is nothing unusual in this proposal. Similar action has been taken in other fields to cope with the inflationary situation.  We are simply trying to ensure that citizens will not be penalised when monetary increases are granted which merely hold the standard of living at the level at which it had been.  It is possible for a person earning a gross income of over £3,000 a year to be housed by the local authority if he falls within the housing priority category.  I have no objection at all to this.  But it is an anomaly that the very same person, if he wished to build his own house, could receive no assistance of any kind from the local authority.</P>
    <P>The new house loan limit, which is now £4,500, again is unrealistic in present circumstances.  The loan level has not been altered for a long time. It was introduced in May, 1973, which is the best part of two years ago, and in a period which was bedevilled, as it was, by rampant inflation, it is not necessary for me to refer to the length of time since its introduction, because that is hardly relevant.  There is little doubt that the level of the loan is deterring people from building their own homes or from buying houses which are built by speculative builders.  The price of a three-bedroomed house, including the site and so on, is now about £7,000, and I understand this price will not remain at this level for very much longer.  I am giving an average price here and, in fact, a relatively low average.  The present maximum loan level, added to the State grant and to the supplementary grant, <Col N="1623" /> where the person building the house is entitled to a local authority supplementary grant £5,150, and this leaves a deficit of approximately £2,000 in round figures.</P>
    <P>Now, while the Government may have same hope of getting loans to cover their budget deficits, a private individual with an income of less than £2,350, a married man with a family, has very poor prospects of getting a loan sufficient to make up the difference between the cost of the house and the money available to him by way of loan and grant.  Where can he turn to get this money?  The banks are not the easiest places to get money, especially when they know already that the prospective house buyer will have to commit himself to making repayments of his local authority loan.  Even if the banks were willing to make a loan available, and I am informed that they are not so willing, it would be a short-term loan only, at high interest rates, and these would mean particularly high repayments in principal and interest. If one were to add these short-term loan repayments to the local authority loans repayments, and view the lot in the context of the maximum income permissible, it is not hard to see how difficult the task is for a private individual anxious to build a house for himself and his family.</P>
    <P>A person who borrows £4,500 maximum loan pays it back over a 35-year period at 10½ per cent.  That is the position in my county and I imagine it is no different in other counties. The annual repayment on this money is £480 or £9.35p per week.  If the prospective house purchaser must get a loan from a finance company of £1,500 on top of this&mdash;I am assuming though it is a considerable assumption, that he has saved £500&mdash;the finance company will give him the loan, according to the information available to me, over a two-year period only and his repayments will be at the rate of £70.40p a month.  I might add that I have been told on good authority&mdash; and, in case it might be assumed the information was biased, it was not by a builder&mdash;that my estimate of £2,000 as the extra money needed is too low. <Col N="1624" /> However I am working on that basis and on the basis that the man has saved £500.  If we add the rate payable to the local authority and that payable to the finance company and deduct the total from the maximum permitted income we get some idea of the problems facing a person anxious to build his own home, particularly when one takes cognisance of the fact that the cost of living is constantly rising rapidly.</P>
    <P>Our proposal is that a loan of £6,000 should be made available with the same rate of interest applying over the 35-year period.  The annual yearly repayment would be £648 or approximately £12 a week.  That would be appreciably less than the total bill facing such a prospective house purchaser in present circumstances.  If our proposal is not adopted I have no doubt that many of those anxious and willing to build their own homes will be compelled to join the queue for local authority housing, very often in the knowledge that they have no chance of getting such a house for a considerable time, unless they have families, and this is a condition which is rarely explicitly stated but which is very much there in practice.  As well as that, these people are reducing the prospect of getting houses of those who are unable under any circumstances to build houses for themselves.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the Minister will comment on the fact that repayments on a £6,000 loan would be greater than they would be on a £4,500 loan. This argument was made some time ago when a similar suggestion was being opposed.  I have already pointed out that the repayments on the £6,000 local authority loan would be much less than the repayments on a £4,500 local authority loan plus the finance company loan repayments.  I would also point out that we propose the qualifying income limit should be £3,000 per annum.  We are also proposing that an increase of 50 per cent in new house grants should be made available.  With the rapid increase in living costs since the motion was tabled I am not all that sure how long that figure of £3,000 income limit will be a realistic one.</P>
    <P>Grants have not been increased <Col N="1625" /> since September, 1973, and I would point out that, just as in the case of loans, the present grant levels are much too low particularly when they are related to the present qualifying income level which, for supplementary grants, is something in the region of £1,900 per annum.  In my view these are entirely inadequate in this highly inflationary period in which we are living.  The purpose of the grants was to encourage people to build their own homes.  They symbolised the desire of the State to help out.  The grant is now a very much smaller fraction of the total cost of the house and the level must be rectified if justice is to be done.  The present level is £325.  Increasing it by 50 per cent would mean an addition of about £160, which is little enough in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>In most cases those who wish to build their own homes are married people with children.  With a qualifying income of £2,300 per annum no one would have any great amount of money to spare.  A change must be made here and, on due consideration, I am sure the Minister will agree that this is so.  Those who are within the local authority grants qualifying income limit anxious to build their own homes are having a very considerable burden deliberately placed on their shoulders.  They accept this burden and, by doing so, are not only benefiting themselves ultimately but are also benefiting society generally.  This is, therefore, something that should be encouraged.  I do not think one could honestly say they are being encouraged under the present loan and grant system.  Indeed, the opposite is true.  It is time we faced up to our responsibilities in this and this motion is now giving the Minister an opportunity of playing his part.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated for 1975 for private housing grants is about equal to the amount provided last year in the period April to December, a nine-months' period, and the only conclusion one can come to is that the Government must be anticipating a fall in the production and supply of private housing.  Even at equal money terms it would be necessary to make available about £1.7 <Col N="1626" /> million more&mdash;and that is not taking the inflationary situation into consideration&mdash;if we were to produce the same number of houses as last year.</P>
    <P>Building societies have contributed considerably to the provision of houses.  The societies are not without their faults but our housing problems would be much more acute were it not for the contribution of the building societies during the years.  Much can be done to improve this contribution, to increase efficiency and to give a better service to the borrowers. However, that may be debated at another time.  I am concerned about how we can improve the inflow of money into the building societies so that they may be able to provide loans for a greater number of people. In that way they will help more people to build their houses and they will assist in giving employment.</P>
    <P>The first proposal in the motion with regard to this matter is that the liability for income tax paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000 should be abolished.  This is not the first time this proposal has been made by our party; it was made on two separate occasions.  So far as I remember it was turned down by the Government on the ground that it was not feasible, that if this were done for building societies one would be expected to do it for various groupings who are engaged in encouraging financial investment.  I would be inclined to agree that in normal circumstances one would need to exercise care in such matters, but the Minister knows as well as I that as far as the private sector of the construction industry is concerned these are not normal times.  They are far from it; a desperate situation needs exceptional remedies that might not necessarily be adopted at other times. On the basis of our social commitment to housing the proposal we are making is a reasonable one.</P>
    <P>So far as building societies are concerned, the great problem is the need to attract further investment. When I say it is a great problem for the societies, that necessarily means it is a problem for the borrowers also.  It is essential that investment conditions should be so attractive in the societies <Col N="1627" /> that they will find it possible to encourage people to invest rather than to leave the money stagnating or to invest it in less useful ways so far as the country and the economy are concerned.</P>
    <P>In order to do this the terms must be special.  This is what we are asking the Government to do, and what we would do if we were in office.  What we propose would be attractive to investors and it would ensure that many people who are outside the local authority income qualifying limit would be able to get loans to build their houses.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that where it is necessary to impose a means test limit for State aid, whether in regard to higher education grants, medical cards or local authority housing loans, those just outside the limit are the hardest hit.  Often they are in a more invidious and difficult situation than many on a lower income when they wish to avail of third-level education, when there is regular need of a doctor or when they wish to build a house.  They are forced to rely almost entirely on their own resources and these resources are meagre enough when they have met all the costs.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that as a group these people are as anxious to own their own homes as any other section but there is no alternative method available to them to do so. The fact is that, if they cannot get a loan from a building society, many must forego their hopes and prospects of getting their own home.  Bank loans and finance company loans are of little use to them because they are short-term, they carry high interest rates and the repayments are usually too heavy.  If the Government accept our proposal regarding the tax remission on interest, I am convinced the inflow of money into the building societies would be unprecedented.  The fillip this would give to the private housing sector would take up a considerable share of the slack in the area of unemployment at a time when it is most needed.</P>
    <P>In section (d) of the motion we are proposing a further measure that will <Col N="1628" /> make investment not only more attractive but possible in certain circumstances where it is not possible at the moment.  We are suggesting that the granting of trustee status to the building societies would be a considerable help.  As things stand at the moment, building societies have not trustee status and therefore, trustees of various types of funds must invest their clients' money in what are tantamount to being gilt-edge securities. Because of this it is not possible for them to invest the money in building societies.  This results in a considerable loss of revenue by the societies and it is a great loss to the nation generally because the money could be channelled into housing loans with a resultant upsurge in the building industry.  This proposal is a reasonable one and, if the Minister is not prepared to accept it, perhaps he will give his reasons.  Is it that the Minister for Finance is uneasy that the money would not be available to him for other purposes?  If that is the case and if we knew what were the other purposes, we would be in a position to judge if what we are proposing would be as acceptable and beneficial as what the Minister proposes to do with it.</P>
    <P>Section (c), which deals with the charging of a fixed rate of interest on building society mortgages, is important. It is generally accepted that it puts an intolerable burden on some people when the original mortgage rate is increased very considerably. The fact is that the local authority loan interest rates are frozen in the sense that the rate charged when a person receives the loan is the same rate which prevails throughout the period of the loan.  This is a very satisfactory situation because the borrower can always budget for the future.  He knows exactly what his repayments will be and, therefore, he is in a position to decide on other financial matters.  The position is quite different in relation to loans from building societies.  Repayments very and depend on the cost of money at any given time.</P>
    <P>For years the trend has been in one direction only, upwards.  Interest rates have been increased quite often and <Col N="1629" /> this means that the borrower cannot budget for the future because he does not know what his outgoings will be in regard to his mortgage repayments. The tensions and pressures of family life which result from this type of situation are very severe and the least I would ask the Minister to do in this respect is to consider the points I have made.  It is unfair that a client who is offered financial assistance at a certain rate of interest should have that rate changed to meet the exigencies of the moment.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to suggest that it would be easy to find a solution to this problem but any solution would need State financial involvement. I am aware of the fact that the Government in the past made a subsidy available to the societies but this was only for a couple of years and was of little use to the societies who loaned money over a long period but what will happen when the subsidies are withdrawn?  A bigger loan and an increased grant necessitate a greater subvention from the Exchequer. It would be of little use to make larger loans and grants available from the same amount of money because, obviously, this would defeat the whole purpose of the motion.</P>
    <P>In moving this motion I should like to point out that we understand the problems but we are willing to face up to them.  There is a difficulty at present in obtaining money from building societies.  Some of those with whom I have had contact since I was made Opposition spokesman on local government affairs have set conditions such as that the applicant must have money invested in that society for a number of years before a loan is made available.  There is also a condition whereby the loan is related to the applicant's income.  I have no doubt that if the inflow of money into the societies is increased, as would happen if our proposal was accepted, more money would be available for borrowers and the restrictions would be less onerous.</P>
    <P>Everybody is aware that the building industry is a labour intensive one employing mainly male workers but it also gives considerable employment in ancillary industries and builders' providers. <Col N="1630" /> The manufacture of the commodities associated with the construction industry gives considerable employment when that industry is doing well but when it is seriously and detrimentally affected as at present employment falls.  There is no need for me to list the commodities or the industries affected by the recession in the construction industry but everybody knows that if the demand for these commodities falls off there is unemployment, redundancy and short-time working.</P>
    <P>Many of the ancillary industries have been severely hit in recent times; some, in fact, have closed down. Builders' providers are also severely affected by the slowing down in the construction industry.  The Minister has insisted that there is nothing wrong in the industry, an attitude which I find difficult to accept when I see the difficulties and problems facing the private housing sector in my constituency.  I should like to make it clear that I am not questioning the Minister's veracity but I find it difficult to equate his point of view of the situation with conditions in my constituency. The figures for completed houses of all kinds between April and November of last year, as compared with the number for the previous year, are down and money for private house grants is less than it was in former years.  In my view if the number of privately built houses is to be increased more money will have to be made available.</P>
    <P>From statistics published to date there is a continuous decline in the sales of cement in 1974 as compared with 1973.  This was underlined today in the reply given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to a question put down by Deputy Cronin. I imagine that statistics in relation to the cement industry are one of the best barometers available as regards the progress or otherwise in the building industry.  I know of a large construction firm in my constituency which obtained planning permission to build 400 private houses but, after they had completed 130, stopped because of the lack of purchasers.  These houses, in so far as I can ascertain, were, in present circumstances, very reasonably <Col N="1631" /> priced but the potential buyers were unable to obtain a deposit of the difference between the loan plus grants and the price of the house.</P>
    <P>Among the many workers in the building trade at present unemployed are skilled tradesmen.  I should like to make it clear that I am not interested in anything except improving the output of houses.  I would like it if we could clear up the confusion which appears to exist in relation to the industry.  Statements are being issued by all sides which completely contradict each other.  I am not blaming anybody because it is possible to interpret statistics in many ways.  If we could get clearly in our minds exactly what the position is, we could make better progress.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that, with regard to the building of houses in the private sector, there is ample evidence in the official figures published&mdash;and from our own observations&mdash;to show that things are not as good as they might be.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to give favourable consideration to the proposals set out in the motion so that this very important sector of the industry can be restored once again to its full vitality.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the motion and puts its terms into operation, not only will he be doing a good job in helping those who are interested in buying or building their own houses to achieve their aims but he will also, in a time of serious unemployment, help to reduce the number unemployed. I have no doubt that the Minister is as concerned about this matter as we are on this side of the House. I believe that if the terms of the motion as put forward were accepted, this would have a beneficial effect all round.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In Opposition Deputy Faulkner has deservedly earned a reputation for a calm, rational, clear-cut exposition of his views.  I am sure that when he hears the arguments from the Government side, and particularly from the Minister, he will accept the merits of a great many of those arguments.  I <Col N="1632" /> would contrast the comments made by him with some of the more hysterical propaganda which one has heard in relation to the private house sector and some of the difficulties with which that sector has been faced. I would contrast his constructive statements with some of the very special pleading, some of the very selective pleading, made by some spokesmen for some sectors of the industry, notably the official sectors on the federation side.</P>
      <P>It is essential, as Deputy Faulkner suggested, that we should be quite clear in our minds as to what we are talking about.  My experience of the industry is limited admittedly.  It is largely on the trade union side and, at present, it is limited largely to membership of a local authority, Dublin County Council.  It is important that we should put the private house sector in its proper perspective in its overall relationship within the construction industry.</P>
      <P>We know that housing generally accounts for 40 per cent of the total output of the construction industry. It is generally accepted that about one-third of the industry is accounted for by the private house building sector. Taking a rough statistic, on this motion we are talking about one-third of the overall construction industry. This is the first important point one must bear in mind in relation to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to take into account what has occurred in the industry.  One must go on the record of the past and contrast the past with the current situation.  Then one can put it in its proper perspective.  The statistics show &mdash;and I am sure Deputy Faulkner will not dispute these statistics because they were compiled during his term as a member of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet&mdash;that in 1970-71, 13,671 houses were completed.  At that time Fianna Fáil were very proud of that record.  In 1971-72, 13,921 houses were completed.  In 1972-73, 21,647 houses were completed.  In none of those three years was there alleged to be a crisis in the private house sector. The number of houses completed in 1973-74 was 25,365.  With the reasonable <Col N="1633" /> knowledge of estimates we have, we can be assured that the number of houses completed in 1974 will exceed that figure.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to reconcile these simple facts with statements made about the overall house construction side, public and private.  If one is honest one takes into account the very substantial growth in the public sector and the relatively small decline in the private house sector.  It must be put in its proper perspective.  In that context one cannot accept the doomsday pronouncements of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen.  I do not accuse Deputy Faulkner of that tendency but I deplore those at local authority level and in this House who try to convey an overall impression to the industry, and to the construction sector at large, that there is a general catastrophe in the construction industry. That is not so.  There are undoubted difficulties in some areas of the private house sector, but the overall picture is exceptionally good.  I have not the slightest doubt that when the recovery comes, a more substantial recovery in 1975, the Fianna Fáil Party will have to eat their words.</P>
    <P>Sweeping allegations were made in this House in July, 1973.  They were even more hysterical in November, 1973, when we had been some six months in office.  It was alleged that the construction industry was in a state of total and absolute collapse. Early in 1974 the Minister was being &ldquo;bet around the head&rdquo;&mdash;not that he takes that exercise too lightly&mdash;when it was suggested that he was presiding over the carrying to the grave of the coffin of the construction industry. Of course, that did not happen, and many Fianna Fáil Deputies had to eat their words in the middle of 1974.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of 1974 we had the same ollagoning in this House and there were special pleadings from some spokesmen of some sectors on the outside, and particularly from one noted spokesman.  I will not refer to his name.  He is well known.  He has never yet produced any supporting data despite his sweeping allegations, which I have experienced at local authority level and which we have <Col N="1634" /> had to refute.  Fianna Fáil have fallen into the old occupational hazard of politics that if you grossly overstate your case in the end nobody takes you too seriously.</P>
    <P>The Members of the Opposition have failed to realise that this Government provided far greater financial assistance for the construction and house building industry than any previous Government.  We have given unprecedented financial support to the construction industry.  In the nine months from April to December, 1974, a total of £189 million&mdash;the equivalent of £240 million in a full year&mdash; was provided in the public capital programme to generate work for this industry.  In 1975, the corresponding provision was some £300 million.</P>
    <P>These figures belie the assertions by Fianna Fáil that this Government have completely neglected the construction industry.  I agree with Deputy Faulkner that our economy requires a very active building and construction sector to cater for new demands for new schools, new houses, new factories, and so on, which our people require.  The harsh and correct fact is that we have provided the money.</P>
    <P>I know no Minister for Local Government in our history who has shown such tenacity in getting money for the public housing programme and getting it used in the general construction industry on the public housing side.  Housing accounts for about 40 per cent of the total output of the construction industry and it is clear that measures taken to increase housing output may have had a beneficial effect on the construction industry generally.  When this Government came into office we declared our intention of raising housing output to 25,000 dwellings annually, a most ambitious target.  If the figure dropped 100 below 25,000&mdash;bearing in mind that Fianna Fáil had 13,000 in 1970&mdash; there would be an outburst of hysterical dismay by the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I regard targets as necessary and valuable and we have reached the target but if we go up or down by 1,000 I shall not do a war dance.  The aim is general stability and that is what we have provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> In 1973-74 the target was achieved with 25,365 houses.  In that year a total of £68.22 million was provided in the public capital programme specifically for housing.  The provision in the nine months of 1974 was £71.05 million and this year it is £101.5 million.  These figures clearly underline our commitment towards the maintenance of a progressive housing programme and as a result of our positive action housing output in the last calendar year was 25,402 dwellings. I emphatically point out to Fianna Fáil that in 1973 and in 1974 they caused a good deal of uneasiness in the construction industry with their quiet propaganda at local level getting off the odd remark to the effect that things would be terrible, that the Minister was a raving socialist who would destroy this or that sector and suggesting we should all run to the bank and lodge our money and not invest and not develop the general house programme for our own firms. That sort of insidious propaganda has a disastrous effect on the construction industry and it was indulged in in 1973 and 1974.  The facts are that in 1973, 25,000 houses were built and the construction industry did not lose its verve although Fianna Fáil lost their propaganda effort.</P>
    <P>In 1974, 25,400 houses were constructed and this was well above the annual target and I see no reason for not achieving a comparable level in the housing sector in 1975.</P>
    <P>I was in Opposition long enough to know that one puts down a simplistic motion suggesting, say, that we should raise local authority loans from X to Y and raise the income level from X to Y.  One fails to spell out the implications. This motion calls for an increase in the local authority maximum new house loan to £6,000 and in the income limit to £3,000.  Let us see what it would mean to the person who would get the alleged benefit of an alleged increase from Fianna Fáil.  In July, 1972, the loan limits were increased from £3,300 in the four county boroughs, Dublin County, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire and Galway to £3,800 and from £3,000 to <Col N="1636" /> £3,400 in the remainder of the country.  That is the Fianna Fáil record, a miserable increase in 1972 of 13 or 14 per cent in the amount of house loans.</P>
    <P>When the present Minister came into office he immediately increased the loan limit for the whole country to £4,500, an increase of over 18 per cent for the county boroughs and County Dublin and an increase of 33 per cent for the remainder of the country.  That is a record of which we are proud and which indicates that what was done in 1972 was grossly inadequate.  It is also important to point out that the Minister at that time raised the income limit from £1,800 to £2,000 and six months later, again raised it to £2,350.  These increases were very necessary then and have been reflected in the data available since then.  This is shown by the tremendous growth shown in the operation of the scheme since.</P>
    <P>In the quarter ended 30th June, 1972&mdash;just before these limits were increased by the Minister's predecessor&mdash;the number of loans approved by local authorities was 1,298 valued at £3.5 million.  In the quarter ended 31st March, 1973, when we took office local authorities approved 1,698 loans valued at £5.2 million.  In the quarter ended&mdash;this is the important figure&mdash;30th September, 1974, the number of loans approved was 3,390 valued at nearly £13 million.  I would say particularly to Deputy Burke, who well knows the effect of that record, that in the quarter ended 31st March, 1973, 1,700 loans were granted representing £5.2 million while in the last quarter ended 30th September, 1974, the figure was almost 3,400 costing nearly £13 million.  So, where is the proof of the Fianna Fáil propaganda regarding this motion?</P>
    <P>If we look at payments on foot of approved loans the picture is the same.  In the year ended 31st March, 1972, the Minister's predecessor paid out £9 million.  In the following year he paid out £11 million.  In the first year when the present Minister was in office he paid out £21.4 million and in the nine months ended 31st December, 1974, the total was £30 million. <Col N="1637" /> By any criterion a tremendous effort was made to maintain stability in the construction industry through the public capital programme and the housing allocation in that programme and this has been maintained and we are continuing to maintain it in 1975.</P>
    <P>We must also look at the number of applications on hands at present to understand just how effective the local authority house loan scheme now is. On 30th June, 1972, local authorities had on hands applications for loans for approximately 7,000 houses valued at £16.2 million.  On the 30th September last the number of applications on hands for local authority loans was 17,000 valued at £57 million.  What, perhaps, has not yet dawned on many people is that there has been a transformation in housing in two years.  There has been a phenomenal shift.  Some sections of the private housing sector have declined in marginal areas.  But where Fianna Fáil failed most certainly to appreciate the overall change is in their ignorance of the fact that there has been a phenomenal overall growth in public sector activity and particularly in regard to local authority loans.  I have no doubt that the Minister must have regard to these facts.  At present, the obvious fact is that the scheme is in operation within those limits.</P>
    <P>I would point out also a further major factor which inevitably must confront anybody here.  It is facile for Fianna Fáil to suggest that loans should be increased to £6,000.  I have an insurance company loan on my house, bought in 1964 for £3,600&mdash;£600 deposit and £3,000 loan&mdash;on which I make monthly repayments.  But we have to take into account the ability and the immediate strain which undoubtedly will exist on any applicant taking out a loan of £6,000.  Repayments on the existing loan maximum of £4,500, if spread over a 35 year period at an interest rate of 10½ per cent, will amount to £490 per annum. Let us be quite clear, the corresponding figure of a loan of £6,000 would be £650 per annum, or £12.50 weekly. Therefore, if I accept the arguments of Deputy Faulkner for raising the loan to £6,000.  I must point out that the <Col N="1638" /> immediate corollary is, of course, repayments of £12.50 weekly.  Therefore, let us be under no illusion as to who is paying for what.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but if he reads my speech he will find that his argument would be valid provided one could build a house for £4,500.  But the problem arises where it costs £7,000 and a prospective buyer must make up the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that later on.  There seems to be the public impression that automatically raising the income limit and the amount of the loan means one is virtually getting a free gift when, in fact, the weekly repayments would, indeed, be quite substantial.</P>
      <P>There has been also a proposal in part (b), I think, of this motion by the Fianna Fáil Party that there should be a 50 per cent increase in new house grants.  I am a private house purchaser. I bought a new house and got very generous assistance from the State in its purchase&mdash;tax relief on my mortgage repayments right down to ten years' remission.  One must point out that at present the Department pay grants for private houses ranging from £175 to £460 which can be supplemented by local housing authorities to an equivalent amount.  Furthermore, a new grant-aided-house qualifies for a remission of rates for nine years and, similarly, no stamp duty is payable. Therefore, between income tax relief on loan interest and, in a number of cases, the benefit of some subsidy, it is fairly clear to any objective observer that the private house purchaser gets very substantial benefits and gets them at a time when national resources for housing are quite scarce.  Certainly, the number of new house grants allocated and paid by the Government at present do not make a particular case for the increase of 50 per cent sought by Fianna Fáil.  I would make that point strongly in relation to that aspect of the motion before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other implications of the motion relate to three different aspects of the operations of building societies.  There has been a great deal of specious propaganda <Col N="1639" /> by Fianna Fáil in relation to building societies.  For a while I thought the party were indulging in a kind of suicide pact with a few commentators and, indeed, property editors in some of the newspapers, virtually destroying the building societies.  I was very perturbed about it and while I have reservations about some of the legislative aspects of building societies, and I accept the Minister's view that we need a new Bill for building societies&mdash;certainly we need a Bill that would stop some of the more questionable operations of building societies&mdash; I deplore the fact that the Fianna Fáil Party implied time and time again in this House in 1973 and 1974 that the building societies were on the rocks, on the way out, not a hope in hell for them and that the building societies were folding up altogether.</P>
    <P>I would point out just two statistics to the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1972-73 the value of loans advanced by building societies was £43.3 million in respect of 5,300 houses, and that was during a period when their attempt to destroy investors' confidence in building societies was at its height.  They will remember their ard-fheis of last year.  I hope they will be more responsible in 1975.  I see Deputy G. Fitzgerald has just taken up his position on the far side, a new front bencher.  I congratulate him, a fellow Corkman, on his appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy left us.  He went to Dublin from us.  We could have used him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>He deserved his promotion.  However, I would point out to Deputy G. Fitzgerald that in 1972-73 £43.3 million was advanced by the building societies.  In 1973-74, despite the Jeremiahs on the opposite side, £46 million was advanced in terms of loans by building societies and a total of 5,800 new house loans advanced by them.  There is a response to the argument of Fianna Fáil.  Undoubtedly, there has been some reduction of late but I submit that, without question, the overall level of loans for new houses advanced by building societies this year, certainly up to the <Col N="1640" /> end of the first quarter anyhow, will be well maintained.  There may be some slight drop.  I do not have the precise data but most certainly the prospects for 1975 are good having regard to the substantial improvement in the net inflow of funds to the societies in recent months.  That gives the lie to the propaganda of Fianna Fáil in relation to the building societies.  I would say to Fianna Fáil: Do not you destroy the building societies.  Do not destroy investors' confidence in them. Do not indulge in some of the more ridiculous type of propaganda you have put forward, such as, for example, exempting the first £5,000 of investment in a building society from income tax.  We got rid of that; that was about the most hairy form of speculation ever produced by an Opposition.  It will not wash and even the building societies know it has not much merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the other sector, we must bear in mind the contribution of the insurance companies. I should like to see many more insurance company loans being advanced.  But I would point out that, in the calendar year 1974, close on £6.9 million was advanced by insurance companies by way of loans on new houses and another £3.5 million on other houses.  A total of approximately £10.3 million was advanced by life assurance companies in the last calendar year.  I doubt if this motion was meant to be constructive in any sense but, rather, I expect it was put down for the purpose of having a go at the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry need have nothing to fear in so far as this Government are concerned because we will give to the industry every support possible. We will not respond to the more hysterical charges of Fianna Fáil but we will respond in a constructive way to the views of the spokesmen in the industry where they put forward constructive proposals.  Contrary to the Fianna Fáil view, the construction industry is in good hands and the private <Col N="1641" /> sector of the industry is not experiencing difficulties as dramatic as those outlined in the motion.  I have no doubt that there will be a substantial recovery and that we will achieve our target of 25,000 houses a year.  Certainly the number of houses built will be far in excess of the 13,000 built in 1970-71 while Fianna Fáil were in office, and I am confident that we will bring about full employment in the industry in a short space of time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The absolute necessity for the Dáil to accept the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil is obvious when one considers the situation in regard to the housing industry, a situation that can be examined under three headings&mdash;(1) the effect it is having on the labour market, (2) the effect that the present limits and regulations are having on prospective buyers and, (3) the effect the situation is having on existing house owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make a case under each of these headings.  First, in relation to the question of the labour content of the building industry, it has been recognised since the beginning of this State that the great barometer of the health of the economy is the state of the building industry. On the basis of that criteria it should be accepted by most unbiased commentators that our economy is on the rocks.  I have listened with a certain amount of interest&mdash;I emphasise the words &ldquo;certain amount&rdquo;&mdash;to a half hour of statistics trotted out by Deputy Desmond but one statistic he did not mention but which I had expected him to mention was that released yesterday by the Central Statistics Office.  According to Deputy Desmond, any criticism of the Government, regardless of from which source it comes, can be laid at the door of Fianna Fáil.  We were told that any criticism of the Minister or of the Government was mischievous in the extreme, but yet he omitted the statistic I shall quote.  I suppose he will tell us that the <i>Irish Independent,</i> which printed this statistic this morning under the heading &ldquo;Building Industry Has Biggest Job Losses&rdquo;, is another Fianna Fáil organ, but even <Col N="1642" /> he would not say that the Central Statistics Office is a Fianna Fáil organ.  I quote from today's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    <P>MORE PEOPLE are unemployed in the building and construction industry than in any other industrial group apart from agriculture, according to figure issued by the Central Statistics Office yesterday.</P>
    <P>The industry showed the biggest increase in the number unemployed for the year ending mid-December &mdash;up by 3,280 to 15,572.  Of this total, 11,475 are in the &ldquo;general building, construction and repair work&rdquo; sector and the remainder are in the &ldquo;construction and maintenance of roads, bridges and railways&rdquo; category.</P>
    <P>I assumed that, as a Labour Member of this House, Deputy Desmond would have quoted that statistic.</P>

      <P>I assume, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I will be allowed an extra couple of minutes at the end for those I have lost as a result of the Minister's interruption. I shall not continue my speech by <Col N="1643" /> quoting statistics.  Everybody will recognise that there is a crisis, whether it can be categorised as a major crisis which is how we would categorise it, or otherwise, and that the private building sector is experiencing great difficulty.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government has made much play of the 25,000 houses which he succeeded in having constructed in his first year in office and we hear of the 13,000 that Fianna Fáil had built in 1970.  However the figure to note is the 21,500 houses built during the last year of the term of office of the last Government.  It must be remembered that to construct a house one must have the foundations out, and if one reads the figures for new foundations at the time we left office one can see clearly how the Minister arrived at his figure of 25,000.  What is more interesting is the question why the figure is not improving at the same rate as it had been improving in previous years.  The answer is that the SDA loans have not been keeping pace with inflation.</P>
      <P>The last occasion on which SDA loan was increased was in May, 1973 &mdash;almost two years ago&mdash;but inflation since then has reduced this by at least 33? per cent and that is why we are asking the Minister to increase the figure from £4,500 to £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall give the Minister an example of the situation as it arises for a young man seeking an SDA loan.  An average new house costs between £7,500 and £8,000 on the Dublin market but I shall take the lower figure in case the Minister might accuse me of exaggerating the situation.  The net loan available is £4,500.  Therefore, there is a balance of £3,000 to be met by the applicant but in order to qualify for the loan in the first place he must be earning less than £2,350.  Therefore, he would have to save £3,000. How is it possible for a young man starting off to save that £3,000 if he is earning less than £2,350?  I ask the Minister to consider these figures. They are not Fianna Fáil propaganda. They are not given out in a scare manner.  They are the facts of which the Minister is only too well aware. <Col N="1644" /> I hope he will accept the need for an increase in SDA loans and the limit of £3,000 because one goes with the other.  It is impossible to separate them.</P>
    <P>Together with the need for an increase in the loan limit there is also a need for an increase in the supplementary and new house grants.  For those building their own houses the need for the State grant is greater than for those buying their own homes from a private builder because normally it is at the net price that the purchaser acquires the house.  It would be a tremendous incentive to people building their own houses if the supplementary grant was increased.  When was it last increased?  We asked the Minister in his first months in office to increase the grants.  He told us at that time that a complete review of the grant system was being undertaken. That was nearly two years ago.  I asked him last Wednesday how far he had got in this review.  He informed me he was still examining the situation and could not say when the grants would be increased.  Surely he will appreciate the need for an increase if for no other reason than to keep pace wit h the inflation which has taken place in the past two years, to give the same value to the £ as he did then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is still going on. Paragraph (c) of our motion reads:</P>
      <P>the abolition of liability for income tax on interest paid by building societies on deposits up to £5,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy B. Desmond in his contribution was inclined to sneer at the Fianna Fáil proposal in that section. I would like to give an example of a man living in my constituency.  I am not in any way trying to decry the work being done by building societies. This man borrowed £3,200 in November, 1971, at 9 per cent over 20 years.  Since then he has paid over £1,000.  In 1974 the interest rate had increased to 11¼ per cent and he still owed the society £3,126.  In other words, after paying over £1,000 he <Col N="1645" /> had reduced his loan by the princely sum of £74.  If the interest rate had not increased he would have owed £2,800.  His repayments had risen from £28.30 per month to £33.54 per month.  If the Government accept our proposal this benefit could be passed to the home owner.  This would be of great assistance to him and we would not have the appalling figures I have just read out.  This situation is faced not by one person but by hundreds and thousands of home owners throughout the country.  Many people facing this problem are in my constituency. We have had the unfortunate mortgage strike which was initiated by members of ACRA.  This situation has existed for 15 months.</P>

      <P>That is an unjust solution to a strike.  We have an unjust situation where home owners were facing massive increases in repayments, extended terms in lengths of years and the problem of the individual <Col N="1646" /> I quoted.  Therefore, I appeal to the Minister to accept this part of the motion so that the societies can pass on this reduction in interest rates to the unfortunate people who were and are involved in the mortgage strike.  They bought their homes at a particular figure, assuming their repayments would be at a certain rate.  They now find themselves paying 20, 25 or even 30 per cent more than they budgeted for, and this at a time of raging inflation.</P>
      <P>If the Government accept this proposal it would encourage extra investment in building societies.  This extra money could be given out in the form of loans which in turn would encourage extra employment and the construction of extra houses.  As the Government have not put down an amendment to this motion, I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) reads:</P>
      <P>the granting of trustee status to building societies:</P>
      <P>This principle has been accepted by the Government for some considerable time but, like much other promised legislation, it has not yet been put before the House.  I appeal to the Minister to ask his colleague to bring forward this legislation which would grant trustee status to building societies as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin where I left off, with the statement that the Government underestimate the sense of anger and frustration of the public at present.  I do not say this lightly.  It is genuinely the case. More and more people are getting more and more angry each day as they see the mishandling of affairs by this Government.  I contend that <Col N="1647" /> many Departments when preparing their Estimates this year were told to cut back on those Estimates by possibly 10 or 15 per cent.  They were probably also told on the quiet that money which was earmarked for certain projects would not be forthcoming. This is the state of the country's finances at present.  While Departments have had their Estimates agreed to by the Department of Finance they will not receive the sums of money involved.  The Government have got into the habit, and the public are well aware of it, of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.  Last year it was announced that the Government were giving £200,000 for the alleviation of poverty.  Poverty is on the increase.  This cannot be denied. I wonder what increase the Department of Social Welfare will get from the Minister for Finance to deal with this increased poverty.  When the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries was questioned about the increase to 41p in the price of butter he advised the people to eat less butter and said they were eating too much anyway. This must have been very embarrassing for Bord Bainne who must be spending a large amount of money advertising on television so that people will eat more butter.  This is what I call irresponsible Government.</P>
      <P>The Government's pledge to introduce strict price control has been watered down considerably.  When the Minister for Transport and Power was answering questions here for the Minister for Industry and Commerce he said the Government had not altered their pledge in respect of price control. On radio a few weeks previously the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that strict price control was not possible to operate if we were to retain jobs.  So far as I know we have yet to hear from the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this debate. It will be interesting to hear what he has to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ratepayers of Dublin this year will be forced to pay close to £1 million for malicious damages in this city alone.  The exact figure which the corporation must pay, as decreed by the <Col N="1648" /> courts, is £937,101.  Yet the Government have cut back on the paltry sum of £296,000 spent on amenity grants last year.  They brag about an increase to the Department of Education of £300,000.</P>
    <P>Years ago at a public meeting at election time a heckler shouted at my father: &ldquo;What about the penny on the pint?&rdquo; and my father said: &ldquo;Is it not better to put a penny on the pint and have the penny to buy the pint than to take a penny off the pint and not have the money to pay for it?&rdquo; At the moment we have rising prices but the people just have not got the money to meet them.  The VAT returns for last year show this.  Purchasing power is going down rapidly. When VAT was taken off food and put on other commodities such as building materials and the motor industry in particular huge unemployment followed. This is extremely sad.  Normally we hear in the budget how much the Minister is giving to Third World countries.  This country has a wonderful record of generosity.  We certainly have paid our way in this respect. Under this Government we are rapidly joining the Third World and will do so unless something happens quickly and the happening I hope and pray for is a general election.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen the Minister for Finance do something original in his budget.  I would like to have seen him set up some special contingency fund, possibly administered by the Department of Social Welfare, which various Departments could call on to cope with the many anomalies that exist in legislation. There is no legislation passed which does not have anomalies.  I have called for this before.  It has never received much attention and I do not expect it to receive much attention now but that does not deter me from repeating it.  There is a need for a special contingency fund to deal with cases that fall just outside statutory regulations.</P>
    <P>The Government on assuming office reduced the amount of money which was to be charged for tenant purchase houses.  This was estimated to cost the taxpayer £2 million.  I do not know if it did.  On the other hand, as an <Col N="1649" /> example of what I said before&mdash;giving with one hand and taking back with the other&mdash;the Minister for Local Government decided he would draw back one-third of any profit on that house if it was sold within a five year period.  We all know that a person who buys a house and sells it will not buy a similar type of house cheaper than what he got for the first house. This Government, who stated they would tackle all the speculators, started by treating the working people as the front line of speculators.</P>
    <P>They talk about social justice but I do not think they understand what it means.  I know the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be amazed at all these revelations because he has to travel abroad very frequently and it must appal him every time he comes back when he sees the deterioration in our economy.  He is the financial expert who carried the Government's financial programme in the last election and found himself exiled to the outer fringes of Europe, of which Ireland is very much a part.  Perhaps the Minister, who could have given sound advice to the Minister for Finance when preparing his budget, was too keen to try to be an European equivalent of Dr. Kissinger.  I do not know how he is succeeding in that, but I wish him luck.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Council was set up a few years ago. It consists of a small body of very dedicated people whose function is to help community associations.  The Government should create structures in which the advantaged can help the disadvantaged.  I should like to have seen the Minister in his budget make a special allocation for this purpose. We will need every bit of community spirit we can muster in the difficult times that lie ahead.  We will have to look to people to help each other.</P>
    <P>I believe I have made some points which have not been stressed sufficiently. I hope that in the year ahead the Government will allocate funds for community organisations, such as Muintir na Tíre.  I should like to see them spending more money on the junior liaison officers in the Garda whose strength needs to be increased. <Col N="1650" /> We want to do something about our young people who have been neglected for so long.</P>
    <P>I hope this year will not be like last year when an extra £50 million taxation was imposed after the budget.  I again make the appeal, which I made to the Minister for Finance last week that, when the threshold agreement of 10 per cent is given under the national wage agreement to make up for inflation, the social welfare recipients will not have to wait until October for this because the increase which they received has not even brought them up to the level they were at before inflation raged as violently as it has over the last year.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to begin by referring to social welfare.  I intended to come to it later on, but in view of the last sentence of the previous speaker's remarks I should like to start by dealing with that.  He said that the increases given did not come up to the increase in the cost of living.  I have the figures here and I will give them and ask him if he would like to withdraw his remark.</P>
      <P>I want to be completely fair and take the period from May, 1973, the time of our first budget after we came into office, and what it is likely to be in April next when the social welfare benefits we have allowed will come into effect.  We must allow for the full increase in the cost of living over that period.  On the assumption that the cost of living increase will be similar to that in the six months from November to May, the nearest month we have for this purpose to April, to what it was in the previous six months &mdash;it will be the same plus or minus a couple of percentage points&mdash;the increase in the cost of living between May, 1973, and May, 1975, will be of the order of 32 per cent.  It may be a couple of points less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that per year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an average of 16 per cent per annum.  I am sure the Deputy is capable of dividing the figure I gave by two.  It is 32 per <Col N="1651" /> cent over the two years.  The figures are readily available.  The figure for May, 1973, was 149.1.  If one assumes the same rate of increase over the latest figure, 188.2, and one allows for the probable increase over the next six months, one gets a 32 per cent increase. By how much will the social benefits have increased over that period, from what they were in May, 1973, after we came into office and before we increased them in July to what they will be next April?</P>
      <P>Let me give some examples.  There are of course the cases under Fianna Fáil where there was no provision whatever, such as the unmarried mothers who now have £11.80 with one child and the single women, aged 57 and over, who will have £7.70.  In those cases the increase is infinite by comparison with the total neglect under Fianna Fáil.  Let us take the cases where under Fianna Fáil there was provision.  Let us take, for example, the retirement pension.  It will have risen by 70 per cent from £6.20 to £10.50.  The old age pension will have risen by 72½ per cent from £5.50 to £8.85.</P>
      <P>I have started with the least favourable increases, the smallest increases that have been given.  Let us move on then and take the man in receipt of unemployment benefit who has three children.  The increase there is from £14 under Fianna Fáil to £25.40, an increase of 82 per cent. When we come to the unemployment assistance for the man with three children the increase is from £11.80 to £22.15, an increase of 88 per cent. Take the contributory widow with three children.  Her benefit has gone up from £11.10 to £21.35, an increase of 92 per cent.  The deserted wife with two children has had her allowance increased from £8.35 to £16.15, an increase of 93 per cent.  If the Deputies opposite can find any cases where the increases have been less than 70 per cent or indeed outside the range of 70 per cent to 95 per cent, I hope in the subsequent debate they will point these out to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a period in which the cost of living will have increased by 32 per <Col N="1652" /> cent the smallest increase in social benefits is 70 per cent and in the case of social benefits for people with children, the combination of the increases in the basic benefits, the dependant allowances and children's allowances will bring those increases to figures ranging from 82 to 93 per cent. Roughly speaking, it can be said therefore that, in the worst case, social benefits will have risen by more than twice the increase in the cost of living, and in the best case, by three times.  I therefore throw back in the teeth of the Deputy who made it the allegation that they have fallen behind the cost of living.</P>

      <P>Whatever defects in numeracy may exist in the Deputies opposite, they are not such that had I mentioned an incorrect figure they could not and would not have challenged me.  These are the results of less than two years of Coalition Government.  The priority we have given to social welfare has had dramatic effects in improving the standard of living of the poorest groups in the community.  Under Fianna Fáil that priority was never given.  I do not say they were neglected, because under the schemes that existed when Fianna Fáil came to power increases were given which kept up with and, in some cases over 16 years, somewhat improved upon the increased cost of living.  But at no stage under Fianna Fáil was anything even remotely equivalent to the vast improvement achieved under this Government sought or obtained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Fianna Fáil there was not the priority given in this area.  The reasons for this go back perhaps into the history of the 1950s.  When they came into office the priority they sought to give was, in the first instance, to economic growth.  I think they were right at the time, but what they failed to do when economic growth came about through the results of the First Programme in 1958 to 1962, was ever to adjust themselves to a situation of economic expansion. Throughout their period in office they never turned their mind to the question of what should be done with the increased wealth.  They allowed it to fructify in the pockets of the speculators.  They allowed the rich to get richer and did not attempt to redistribute wealth on any significant scale.  They did, in that period, make adjustments in social welfare, but made no attempt to alter dramatically <Col N="1654" /> the balance between rich and poor, no attempt to raise in real terms the living standards of those depending on social welfare.</P>
    <P>For that it was necessary to await the coming into power of a Coalition Government dedicated to that objective. From the figures I have just given you can see how, in the short space of time in which we have been in office, improvements in the living standards of these groups have occurred which, in the minimal case, add up to an improvement of the order of 30 per cent, and which in the case of social welfare beneficiaries with children add up to an increase of the order of 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite can subsequently in this debate tell me of any instance where social welfare payments will not between May, 1973, and April, 1975, have increased by these amounts, they are welcome to seek to demolish the figures I have presented.  If they do not do so, then the remarks they make by way of interruption will be seen for the bluff they are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been the really significant breakthrough in this budget, and it is one which this Government came into office committed to undertake and achieve in the face of great difficulties, because, goodness knows, this period since we came into office has been one of extreme economic difficulty. <Col N="1655" /> We were not in Government more than seven months when the oil crisis occurred and we had to face the consequences of that, which have in the intervening 18 months threatened to wreck the world's economy. This is a crisis none of the most powerful countries have been able to surmount, a crisis which in the wealthiest and most powerful of them, the United States, Japan, and also Britain, has seen a positive decline in living standards and in output, a crisis so great that even today we are not certain that it can be surmounted.</P>
    <P>In the face of that situation which has beset this Government for almost 18 months of our less than two years in office, we have nevertheless continued with our programme.  We have not been deflected from our course, and we have brought the people with us.  The reaction of the people to this budget, a difficult budget which involved significant increases in taxation, has shown that the leadership we have given in the movement towards social justice is being followed. I do not think that, if the tax increases which in these difficult circumstances we had to impose had been imposed by the previous Government, they would have been accepted, because they would not have been seen by people as what they were, as necessary to contribute to a programme of social justice to which a Government were committed.  Because people saw the tax increases were being put to the purpose of improving social welfare standards, the standards of the poor, to a significant degree, they accepted our policies and the increases.  It is a measure of the maturity of our people, a measure of the commitment to social justice that exists among our people, that when given leadership in this direction they followed it, that when they were told they would have to accept substantial increases in taxation on beer, tobacco and spirits, they did not grumble.  Let me move from that area, which I was tempted to deal with at the outset of my speech by the misrepresentations of Deputy Briscoe, to the economic field.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come back now to the overall shape of the budget and the background against which the budget has to be seen and studied.  The world economic situation is the background against which we must view everything that is happening at present. Our problem is that we are an economy more vulnerable than almost any other economy because of our small size, the openness of our economy and the very high proportion of imports. Given the extraordinary increase that has taken place in import prices, <Col N="1657" /> which have been rising at a rate of 40 to 45 per cent over the past year&mdash;I checked the figures last night and the latest figure is 45 per cent&mdash;in a country dependent for almost half its needs upon imports, dependent to a far greater extent than any of our European neighbours except, perhaps, the very smallest, for us to be able to sustain economic growth when more powerful countries, much larger countries, much wealthier countries have been unable to do so, is a remarkable achievement.</P>
    <P>The fact is that during that period, although the rate of economic growth has slowed down, as it has in every country in the world, the slowing down has left us still with an economy which is still edging forward when, as I said, in countries like Japan, the United States of America and Britain economies are in decline.  Despite the fact that we face a much worse problem because of our greater dependence on imports we have been able to maintain economic growth and the reason for this has lain in the shape and pattern of the budgets we have introduced since coming into office.</P>
    <P>Each time we have had to introduce a budget&mdash;in 1973, in 1974 and again in 1975&mdash;the Opposition criticism has always been the same: you should not expand too rapidly; you should not have such a big deficit; you should have a more orthodox conservative policy.  This is what, in fact, this spokesman for Finance, Deputy Colley, said in 1973; it is what he said in 1974 and the same thought is being echoed in comments made on the budget on this occasion.  Had Fianna Fáil been in office and had that policy been adopted&mdash;I am not sure it would have been because I suspect Deputy Colley, in office, would have acted and spoken differently from Deputy Colley in Opposition, but I suppose that is a common failing of politicians&mdash;then in each of these years our economic growth would have been perceptibly less than it has been.  It would have been very much slowed down had a policy of balanced budgets been adopted in a period when, in fact, the economic situation was deteriorating.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> We had the foresight to see that the economic situation in 1973 was delicately balanced and, generally speaking, the trend of the world economy would be running against us and it would be necessary for us to have a fairly expansionist budget to maintain the momentum of our economy.  If anything, we under-did it. If anything, it should have been more expansionist than it was in 1973.  If it erred on any side it erred on the side of conservativism.  Yet, it was criticised by Fianna Fáil as being too radical, of going too far, of being too expansionist.  It would be difficult to calculate just how many extra unemployed there would be today if the policies advocated by Fianna Fáil spokesmen from those benches on the two budgets in 1973 and 1974 had been the policies adopted.  It may well be that had Deputy Colley been in Government he would have acted quite differently, acted as we did. Perhaps these criticisms are merely captious criticisms on the part of a Deputy in Opposition trying to find fault with the Government's budget. I would like to think so.  I would not like to think that had he been in office he would have been so ill-advised as to have adopted and pursued the policies which, in Opposition, he is advocating.</P>
    <P>In this budget we have had to face up to a situation in which over a period of 15 months previously the world economy had been getting out of balance, where economic growth had been declining and where the liquidity of industry everywhere had been threatened and where also, in our own case, there was the additional hazard of the impact of the cattle cycle which was most acute, a problem which most of these other countries have not faced as they are not major cattle producing countries.  The fact that we have been able in the face of the general difficulties, in the face of the degree to which we are dependent on imports, in face of the degree to which we are dependent on the cattle trade, which went through a very difficult period in 1974, to keep our economy moving ahead to some degree and maintaining some momentum <Col N="1659" /> is a measure of the success of this Government in their three budgets to date.</P>
    <P>I come now to look more immediately at this particular budget.  One of the major problems facing a Government in time of inflation is that the work of Government is labour intensive. The proportion of Government expenditure which is spent on the remuneration of civil servants and, indirectly, the proportion of remuneration to people in agencies to which grants-in-aid are paid is a very high proportion indeed.  I am not sure if any exact figure has been worked out because of the problem of disentangling grants-in-aid to find the proportion of the grant which goes towards salaries and wages and the proportion that goes to other purposes, but if one could find that figure and arrive at a fair balance one would find that the total budget spent on salaries and wages, not only in the civil service, including the Army and the police, but outside it on teachers, the great bulk of whom are paid by the State in the educational sector, and in the various bodies which receive grants-in-aid, is a very high proportion indeed. In a time of inflation when wages and salaries are rising very rapidly the burden placed on the Government is very great, particularly in a period when wages and salaries have been moving ahead at a rate very much faster than the rate of increased prices.  This was the case in 1974.</P>
    <P>The Government found that their revenue derived to a large degree from taxation on goods and therefore dependent on the general pattern of prices, lagged behind their expenditure, expenditure swollen by the very large sums that had to be paid to public servants and semi-public servants outside the Government sector remunerated from the Exchequer. This was a fundamental problem and it involved for the Government this year when preparing the budget really the most difficult and intractable problem ever faced.  A very high proportion of additional revenue coming in a period when the buoyancy of revenue was relatively poor because <Col N="1660" /> of the economic difficulties we faced meant that a very high proportion of the extra revenue was pre-empted by the need to provide money for the remuneration of the public service on the basis of wage and salary increases already granted, already foreseen, already in the pipeline, plus those which have to be foreseen arising from negotiations now in progress. This is a fundamental difficulty because of the labour intensive character of Government.  It is fair to say it is a problem that has never been so acute as it has in this particular year.</P>
    <P>I do not think any Government have ever faced such a disproportion in the growth in their own wage bill, direct or indirect, and the growth in revenue from taxation.  This placed a serious strain on the formulation of the budget, a strain which forced the Government to spend far more time on preparing this budget than that spent on the preparation of any budget in the history of the State.  We had to find a way through the difficulties created by this so that we could maintain our commitment to social welfare, so that we could take the necessary action to expand output in agriculture and industry and achieve a fair balance and an expanding economy and minimise unemployment. To find a way through these problems was immensely difficult and it took long discussion and debate within the Cabinet and consideration of many alternative proposals before the budget emerged in its present form.  I wish the Minister for Finance were not here at this moment but I must say, even though he is present, that a very great debt is owed to him for the way he carried through this difficult task in the face of enormous pressures on the limited resources upon which he had to adjudicate and pass.</P>
    <P>The budget that has emerged is a balanced budget, not in the sense of balancing revenue and expenditure, because such would have been inappropriate to the needs of the economy, but balanced in the sense of balance between the different claims on the Exchequer, balanced to provide adequately for the pay <Col N="1661" /> of the public sector, balanced <i>vis-à-vis</i> the needs of social welfare in order to maintain our commitment in that direction and balanced in the sense of maintaining economic growth, of maintaining liquidity in industry and expansion in agriculture.  All these different needs were met and, at the same time, the commitment to continue to increase personal tax allowances which, under Fianna Fáil had remained virtually static for almost the whole period of Fianna Fáil rule, has been maintained.</P>
    <P>I am looking at the table that gives details of the budget and I can see the different elements in it.  Let us consider the items one by one, starting as we did from a position where there was a significant opening deficit. First, we faced the need to provide for increases in public service pay not already in the pipeline and we wanted to make some provision for what we knew would arise in the months ahead.  The large sum of £40 million has been set aside for that.  In this connection, we should bear in mind we are not talking of the total increase in the public service pay but the necessity to provide an additional £40 million to what was already committed by wage rounds and negotiations and whose effects we see operating now and for some months past.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we might consider social welfare where almost £35 million of additional expenditure has been provided. This is a very large sum in a year of great difficulty; in fact, there has been an increase of approximately 22½ per cent in social welfare payments. When I say &ldquo;this year&rdquo; I am understating what has been done. This increase will take effect in April, only nine months after the last increase, and the Government are committed to a further increase in six months' time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must not have heard it correctly.  That was not what was said.  The reason why the increase of £34.63 million is so large is that it involves not merely a 22½ per cent increase within nine months of the last increase but that it includes provision for a further increase affecting the last three months of the year in order to maintain the value of the increases given.  This was never contemplated by Fianna Fáil when they were in Government.  There has been an increase of 22½ per cent in addition to providing for a further increase to compensate for the cost of living.  We do not know what that will be but, given the rate at which it is still rising, and allowing for some deceleration, the total increase in 15 months will be in excess of 30 per cent or an annual rate of 25 per cent to 27 per cent.  That is why the figure is so great and we are not ashamed of it.</P>
      <P>Those are two of the major items of additional expenditure but there are others also.  There is provision for an extra £1 million for manpower training to cope with the problems of unemployment imposed on us by the economic situation and external influences on our economy.  There is provision also for an extra £500,000 for local improvement schemes.  On the agricultural side, as well as the cattle feed voucher scheme there is an oil subsidy for horticulture.  Each aspect of agriculture where there are difficulties has been examined and given the necessary assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to industry where there is a real problem of liquidity, a sum of £12 million of company tax relief is provided.  This should help significantly to improve the liquidity of industry&mdash;especially manufacturing industry&mdash;and help to maintain employment. <Col N="1663" /> The effect of these measures on employment, of the additional spending power released through social welfare benefits, of the additional sums for training and local improvement schemes and the effect of company tax relief, should certainly be significant.  The effects of a budget that pumps back into the economy £125 million more than it takes from it will help to maintain economic growth this year.  In addition, the extra personal income tax relief of almost £16 million will help to increase purchasing power and maintain demand and economic growth.  In their impact on the economy all of these far outweigh the substantial tax increases it was necessary to impose to find money for social welfare.</P>
    <P>That is the overall shape of the budget. It is a budget that involves by any standards a very large deficit and in a normal year such a deficit could not be contemplated or justified.  However, when we see how other countries around us have reacted to the oil crisis, the way in which they are budgeting for it, and when we consider the advice given to us by agencies such as the OECD, we realise that in present circumstances this scale of deficit is justified.  In relation to our GNP, it is similar to or less than the deficit of countries such as Britain and the United States.  I will not say it is a conservative deficit in the current year&mdash;that is putting it too strongly&mdash;but by the standards of other countries, by what they have felt obliged to do, it is not an excessive budget.  Nevertheless, as I have pointed out, in a normal year it could not be justified.</P>
    <P>The current deficit, plus the capital expenditure necessary to maintain economic growth, involves overall a very large deficit of the order of £250 million to be financed by external borrowing.  Again, in a normal year this amount of residual borrowing could not be justified but in this year it is justified and it is essential.  The House knows that the problems created by the quadrupling or quintupling of oil prices, depending on <Col N="1664" /> whether one takes the price at a particular stage of production, has transferred purchasing power not merely to countries that are poor, that need money and can spend it on their people&mdash;that is worth doing and it can keep the world economy going by way of the sale of goods and services abroad&mdash;but, unfortunately, it is not only to these countries that the money has gone.  It has also gone to countries which because of their small populations are not able to spend the additional sums they have received.</P>
    <P>The vast accretion of purchasing power to these countries that they are unable to spend creates a unique situation in the world economy.  Unfortunately, the way they wish to lend the money is not the way in which the money is most useful to countries like ourselves or to great industrial powers. Nervous of committing it for long periods in an inflationary situation, they tend to lend it for short-term periods and this creates the problem of recycling.  Individually we cannot tackle this but we support other countries in their efforts in this area.</P>
    <P>The availability of this money and the problem of getting it to where it is needed is something that can be tackled only on a world scale by the major financial and industrial countries. They have endeavoured to do so but when looked at from inside as a small participant I must say their efforts have been very slow in bearing fruit.  It is something of a tragedy that it took approximately 15 months for these countries to react to the new situation, to concert their efforts and to decide what kind of policy was best suited to the needs of the crisis. They have now done so effectively and the new schemes that have been proposed, the EEC loan, the increased IMF facility and the Kissinger-Simon safety net proposal, help to provide the finance most needed by those countries whose economies are weakest. They help also to provide a safeguard, guarantee and assurance to countries that might otherwise get into difficulties if confidence in the world industrial economy as a whole is not maintained.  These are, therefore, important to us and while I hope we will <Col N="1665" /> not have to draw upon them their existence creates greater stability in the world financial sector and it will make it easier for us to borrow the sums we need, vast sums by the standards of a small country.  In fact, the sum we have to borrow will be something in the region of 8 per cent of GNP this year and this is a large sum.</P>
    <P>What are our prospects of getting it?  In my view the prospects are good and I say this for two reasons.  The problem of recycling has now been tackled firmly and effectively by the major financial powers.  It was only achieved at the time our budget was brought in.  In our own case there has been a striking maintenance of confidence in our economy in so far as capital flow is concerned.  There is always a time lag in getting information on capital flows, their nature and precise character, but we know, very quickly, their order of magnitude because we know how our merchandise trade is going.  We get these figures monthly and we know the level of our external trade imbalance and we can know from that, within a degree of accuracy of £10 million or £15 million, the size of our external payments deficit in a given time.</P>
    <P>When one compares on the one hand the scale of our external payments deficit for any given 12 months period and the change in reserves that occurs in that period one can see what must have been the inflow of capital months before one has any real idea of what form this inflow of capital took.  From this comparison we can see that in our case the inflow of capital in 1974 was very large&mdash;I would think that it would be something of the order of two to two and a half times the figure of any preceding year.  I hope the Deputies opposite will not hold me to that because it is a guess but it is unlikely to be less than twice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the nature of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This money is coming here in one form or another. A fair proportion of it is coming in in direct investment in industry where the scale of industrial promotion activities <Col N="1666" /> has been increased.  In the last two or three years, aided very much by our membership of the EEC, there has been an increase to a new level of activity in industrial promotion and development.  This helps significantly but it can only account for part of the total and it is clear that a significant part of the remainder consists of people in other countries deciding that the best thing to do with their money is to lend it to Ireland.  It can consist of nothing else and in the financial flows that have occurred the net inflow of capital in liquid form must have been very significant in 1974.  I will not put a figure on it but it is difficult to see how it would not be of the order of, or even significantly greater than £100 million.</P>
      <P>The fact that in a year in which there were great economic disturbances in the world and when the economies of a number of countries were badly shaken a country with an economy as vulnerable as ours, as open, as small and as hard-hit as ours in terms of import prices and the problem of the cattle cycle, was able to attract such a vast inflow of capital several times greater than any preceding year is the best and, perhaps, ultimately the only testimony of the kind of confidence people have in the economy and the way the country is being run.  The one thing we know about the capital system is that the money goes where the capitalist who has it thinks he will get the best and safest return.  There is no reason why people should send money to this country unless they thought they would do better by sending it here and that they would get a better return from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the money that has left the country, £200 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, some of this money has been borrowing by the Government or State bodies but borrowing which we were able to secure because of the confidence of people in our economy.  In addition to that borrowing, very extensive though it was but nothing like as extensive as it is going to be this year, by the Government and State bodies there was an autonomous capital flow of a <Col N="1667" /> large character.  This came freely here without the Government having to go and look for it.  It roosted here because it was felt by those who owned it that it would produce the best return.  That is testimony to the strength of our economy in difficult circumstances.</P>
      <P>The scale of this autonomous inflow has been beyond anything I would reasonably have expected to happen. All of us have been not just heartened by the way in which our external reserves have been maintained but, perhaps, a little surprised that there should be a capital inflow of this scale and that we should be able to maintain our reserves at the level they have been maintained at.  This means that despite the difficulties we face our economy is in good shape and good health, because it is in good hands.  I hope, and believe, that in the year ahead that will be maintained. I hope, and believe, that the Government will be able to borrow the enormous sum which they have to borrow abroad in order to finance continued economic expansion.</P>
      <P>I hope, and believe, that in addition to what the Government will be borrowing abroad there will be a continued autonomous inflow of money to this country.  If the confidence so notably shown during 1974 by investors in Ireland continues to be shown in the year ahead we will once again come out of this difficult year in better shape than many of our neighbours.  We should come out of this year with some degree of economic expansion.  One cannot be sure at what rate but we will come out of the year with an economy still moving ahead at a time when economies of other neighbouring countries are declining.  I believe that this budget enables us, for the second year running, to achieve that result.  That is something which, given the extreme difficulty of our position, is an achievement we can be proud of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are some of the main features of the budget, the broad strategy of the budget, its impact on the economy and, above all, its impact on the growth of production and <Col N="1668" /> on social welfare.  These are the matters which should be debated here but, inevitably, the Opposition will be reluctant to take issue with us on these matters where their ground is weak and where they know that our performance has been effective and is appreciated by our people.  The Opposition have notably refused to tangle with us on these issues; they have refused to face up to the extraordinary expansion in social welfare provision; they have talked platitudes and untruths about it and not been willing to talk figures.  It is only the number of pounds in a person's pocket that counts and not the platitudes or the propaganda.  The Opposition have also been unwilling to talk about the capital inflow to our economy; about whether the economic growth we have maintained could have been maintained if our budgets had not been as expansionist as they were.</P>
    <P>In fact, the Opposition have been unwilling to talk about the economic realities because economic realities do not suit their propaganda.  I recognise that they have a problem and if I were in opposition at this time I would have a problem.  An Opposition often have a problem in criticising a Government whose policies are well thought out and appropriate to the particular situation.  I recognise that one of the most difficult tasks of an Opposition is to criticise a budget if it has been properly drawn.  There are times when a Government misjudge the situation and when the Opposition may have the insight and skill to detect this and to criticise a budget in terms which events show are justified. I do not think the present Opposition have had this insight.  It would have been possible for the present Opposition to have said to this Government in 1973 that the budget was not expansionist enough, that there was going to be a recession and enough was not being done to maintain economic growth.  Had they taken that line there would have been some justice in it because, in fact, there was a decline in economic growth in that period.</P>
    <P>With hindsight one could say that the budget could have been somewhat <Col N="1669" /> more expansionist.  The same could be said of 1974.  I am afraid the Opposition have got everything so much upside down that all their criticisms have been directed in the wrong direction. Instead of encouraging this Government to be a little bolder and a little more expansionist on these occasions &mdash;and this could have been justified in the light of hindsight&mdash;all the criticisms were the other way.  All the criticisms were: &ldquo;You are going too far, too fast.  You are expanding the economy too rapidly.  You are spending too much money.  You will overheat the economy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>All the criticisms of each of those three budgets were irrelevant to the issue.  I can only suggest that perhaps there should be a rethinking on this, and perhaps in the Opposition there is a need for an economic think tank to look more deeply at our problems and to try at least to criticise our budgets from the right standpoint.  In the light of hindsight any budget will almost always turn out to be a little too much one way or the other.  I suggest that Fianna Fáil should try to work out in advance in which direction is the budget likely to err.  To be wrong three times in a row in assessing our budgets is something of a hat trick.  Any Opposition should reconsider their economic thinking when they manage to be wrong quite as often as that.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I wanted to make.  This budget is appropriate to our needs at this time as far as we can judge.  The situation ahead is extremely difficult and extremely uncertain. No one can say with certainty that, in fact, in a year's time this will be seen to be just the right mixture for the situation.  One thing is certain.  The great problem we face, and the one we have to concern ourselves with, is to ensure that this vast imported inflation, from which we have suffered for the past two years almost, and certainly 18 months, does not become converted into a domestic self-generating inflation.  This will be very difficult to avoid.  It seems almost inconceivable that a country could so discipline itself as to avoid creating domestic inflation when faced with a <Col N="1670" /> rate of imported price increases of the order of 40 per cent to 45 per cent. The pressures and strains created by that in any country are enormous. In a country where so much of what we use is imported, where almost half of our total GNP is accounted for by imports, the pressures and strains created by such an enormous increase in import prices are almost intolerable.</P>
    <P>It will require leadership and skill on the part of the Government and it will require leadership and skill on the part of management and trade unions alike, to get out of the situation without creating a runaway inflation domestically.  I think that the import price increase will ease off. Perhaps it has already begun to ease off.  It is evident that a number of raw material prices have fallen over the past six months or so.  Others have remained stable.  Overall the enormous upsurge in raw material prices other than oil has tended to level off.</P>
    <P>It is evident, too, that in the case of oil prices the increase which occurred in late 1973 and early 1974 has also tended to level off.  There has been some small increase since then, but it is clear that the producers are aware of the danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs of industrial production and world demand, which they need in order to find a market for their oil products. It is fairly clear that in the months ahead during 1975, oil prices will either not increase or increase very little.  We are moving, therefore, from a position of the most dramatic world price inflation that we have seen, certainly in this century, to one of relative import price stability.</P>
    <P>Of course, import prices will continue to rise to some degree particularly because the effects of the raw material and oil price increases of 1974 will still be finding their way through the manufactured goods prices in 1975.  Even if raw material and oil prices do not go up much more in 1975, there will be quite substantial increases in the prices of manufactured imports and semi-manufactured imports because of the increase in raw materials and oil prices in the previous year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1671" /> Overall the rate of increase of import prices is already slowing down and during 1975 it should slow down very perceptibly.  If we can hold our hand domestically, if we can prevent a runaway inflation in terms of incomes at home, we can begin to get the situation under control domestically during 1975 and into 1976.  It is possible to do this.  I believe that there is a good chance of its being done. In a crisis our people have always shown a sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is a general recognition that any attempt at this stage to seek excessive increases in incomes at any level, whether they are profits, or wages, or salaries, or farm incomes, or whatever they are, could push the whole economy into runaway inflation. Such increases in the basic labour cost element could generate vastly increased unemployment.  People are coming to grips with the threat of unemployment and the reality of unemployment which faces us today in this country as in every other country in the world.  There is a growing realisation that it is necessary for us, in these circumstances, to tighten our belts in more ways than one and, above all, to try to prevent a runaway increase in incomes in this period.</P>
    <P>If we can do this, if we can moderate income increases, if we can get a general will in the community to try to maintain living standards but to accept that we can do no more than maintain living standards in the current year, if that belief can be reflected in whatever agreements are reached at any level, or whatever profits are sought or secured, or whatever prices are sought or secured by manufacturers, or whatever wages or salaries are secured by workers, if that is the spirit motivating all of us, I believe we can move from a period of really extremely dangerous inflation into a period of a lower rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>It will take time.  I do not think that any economic analysis of the situation would suggest this can be done rapidly. For anyone to promise that inflation will fall back to single figures during the current year would be to promise <Col N="1672" /> something that cannot be performed. It is possible to get back to single figure inflation in 1976 if we keep our heads, if we act responsibly, and if those of us in Opposition as well as in Government give a lead here. I know the Opposition are a responsible Opposition in this matter.  I know that when it comes to a matter of this kind we can rely on their support in giving this lead.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a party point out of this at all.  It is far too serious an issue.  We can argue about the details of the budget here politically but when it comes to the future of our economy and to tacking this problem of inflation, these can only be achieved if we work together.  It can be achieved, but it will take time. It will be possible by the end of next year to get back to a rate of inflation which, although it may still be beyond what we were accustomed to in the halcyon days of 20 years ago, will still be a tolerable rate of inflation and enormously less than what we have had to become accustomed to in the past 18 months.</P>
    <P>This is our target; this is our aim; this is our objective.  The budget will help towards this in more ways than one.  For example, the commitment to adjust social welfare benefits in six months' time in line with prices should help to create a climate in which those seeking increases in incomes will be willing also to think in terms of incomes being adjusted in relation to prices, which is essential if living standards are to be maintained, and more than which we cannot promise, and more than which we cannot secure in this period without the danger of a runaway inflation.</P>
    <P>Therefore the budget should help in more ways than one towards this objective. I hope it can.  I hope the sense of responsibility which exists in our community will be maintained, a sense of responsibility which has been greatly heightened by the spectre of unemployment around us which all of us, no matter how safe our jobs may be, feel as something very personal in a country where the problem of unemployment has always been such a difficult one.  Sensitivity to that problem <Col N="1673" /> will help our people to follow the lead which we in political life in Government and in Opposition can give them.  I hope and believe that we can, during this year, begin to get on top of this problem and that as we move into and through 1976 we can restore normality and get back not only to a rate of inflation of a more tolerable character but also to an economic growth at a rate more appropriate to our needs.</P>
    <P>The storm which hit the country and the rest of the world in 1973 and 1974 has cost us a great deal.  In these years the world economy slowed down almost to a standstill.  Our own growth rate in these years will be only a fraction&mdash;I hope a substantial fraction but still only a fraction&mdash;of what it should be, what it needs to be, what it can be in the future, and what it has been in the past.  If we are to get over the problem of unemployment we can do so only by generating economic growth, by becoming competitive, by increasing our exports, by increasing demand at home and abroad in a way that can be sustained. It is in that way only that more jobs can be created.  We have to aim at economic growth.  We cannot go very far this year.  If we can keep ourselves moving ahead at anything like half or threequarters of our normal rate, that is probably the most that can be achieved in 1975.</P>
    <P>If we can do that on a sound economic basis, and if we can come through this year successfully with a diminishing rate of inflation, we can hope in 1976 to move back to a rate of growth which would give us the extra jobs we need and which in that year and in the following year would bring down unemployment and help us to maintain what has been achieved in the past few years, a situation in which there is no significant emigration. This must be our target.  It can be achieved, not quickly, not without sacrifice, not without pain and certainly not without leadership.  It can be achieved and I believe it will be achieved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Foreign Affairs one would <Col N="1674" /> think there is a rare disease called inflation in other parts of the world which has not been caused in Ireland by the present Government.  If we look at the statement of Dr. Whitaker earlier this year we can see that if the present Government believe that the rate of inflation was not partly caused at least 50 per cent of it, by themselves then this economy and its future are in serious trouble.</P>
      <P>We once had a budget day which was considered as a sort of social event by many who did not normally come to this House and were not Members of it, as something like Ladies' Day at Ascot, but now we have the position in which we have a formal budget day on 15th January but we have a minor budget every second day.  In the three months prior to Christmas we had first, the postal increases of over £20 million which inevitably, in view of the fall in usage of the Post Office must mean redundancy in some section of the Post Office staff in future if that drop continues. We had the petrol increases which the Minister for Finance brought in on a war time measure basis which he said at that time meant £27.5 million but which we know now from reliable sources&mdash;a term the Press uses: we know who these reliable sources can be&mdash;that in fact it will be nearer £35 million.</P>
      <P>The worst increase of all resulted from the withdrawal of the butter subsidy shortly before Christmas which meant another 5p or, in more frightening terms one shilling, per pound on butter.  So much for the 14-point plan and keeping the cost of living down.</P>
      <P>In total, before Christmas, £50 million in taxation was imposed inside two months while budget day, which is meant to spell out taxation for the year added something in the region of £34,500,000.  I should like the Minister for Foreign Affairs to explain that when he talks about social welfare increases, and explain about somebody having to pay three shillings in old money on a gallon of petrol when he goes to draw his unemployment or dole or whatever it is when he has to travel two or three miles to the post office to collect it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>But the rate of inflation then was nothing compared with what obtains now.  The Minister himself gave a figure of 32 per cent as the increase in the cost of living since this Government came to power.</P>

      <P>Up to May next&mdash; estimated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>How many of us will be able to exist by May next at the rate we are going?  We had £50 million taxation before Christmas and £34 million in the budget bringing total taxation inside two-and-a-half months to £84,500,000.  This does not include the VAT which the Minister will collect from price increases.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone for a deficit again this year in the budget.  Last year he went for a deficit of £76 million and that turned out, as we know, to be £92 million.  I quote from column 1460 of the Official Report of the debates of 3rd April, 1974, when the Minister speaking of the economy at that time said:</P>
      <P>Increased economic growth will, as it did last year, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know what happened&mdash;in fact we were short £92 million and that was in spite of inflation raging at the rate of 22 per cent last year.  When we come to this year, not only has the Minister again done nothing about the rate of inflation but in fact has helped it and has, in hidden terms, more or less said that not only must it continue but the rate of inflation must increase to make up the deficit of £125 million.  If the £125 million is to have the same fate in percentage terms as the £76 million deficit we had last year, we can reasonably expect a deficit in the region <Col N="1676" /> of £160 million or £170 million next year.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs talk of the inflow of money.  Shortly before Christmas I heard the Minister for Finance speak of the amount of money coming into the country and how great it was, but 90 per cent of it was borrowed and 10 per cent was voluntary investment and natural inflow.  The Government themselves borrowed £200 million, which is more than the Fianna Fáil Government borrowed in 16 years of office.  This shows the danger this country is going into with further borrowing this year of much more, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We are running the risk of becoming much over-borrowed and becoming a bankrupt country.</P>
    <P>We have 100,000 people unemployed and it appears that this will be in the region of 120,000 very shortly if the present forecasts prove correct.  There is a hidden aspect of it in the case of many small businesses and industries. I know in the case of many industries and small businesses there will be widespread bankruptcy this year.  Some of these will be wiped out of existence in the next 12 months.  Nothing has been done by the Minister to alleviate the position for them.  Their turnover is up, their profits down and if they are lucky enough to have had profits these will be eaten up in buying back stocks affected by the continuing rises in prices.</P>
    <P>I know an example of a small shop with a turnover of £125,000 per year with an average profit of 17 per cent or 18 per cent.  The overheads are 7 per cent so that there is really only 10 per cent or 11 per cent profit on average.  This year the profits are down to 5 per cent.  What hope or what inducement is there for that business to continue employing ten or 12 people?</P>
    <P>No expansion of credit was given and there was no incentive to the banks to give an expansion of credit to firms that find themselves in such a position.  No confidence was given to the firms to encourage them to borrow money on the basis that we would shortly be out of this period or that <Col N="1677" /> the Government would try to help them in some way.  Many such businesses are now caught in a credit situation, where on the one hand they have given credit and cannot get the money in, and on the other hand they owe money which they have to repay if they want to continue buying stocks.  This is one aspect of the situation that will bring sorrow to many small businesses this year.</P>
    <P>Since coming into power 18 months ago the Government have borrowed £200 million, some of which was borrowed at alarming rates of interest. I do not fully understand the dollar-revolving credit one, which constituted £74 million borrowed.  The rate of interest on that can be as high as 14 per cent, if not a little higher which is frightening.  I presume that is done under written guarantee that the Government will pay back in the currency of the country from which they have borrowed.  If the rate of sterling continues to fall, God knows what would be the interest rate on top of that.</P>
    <P>We have experienced on the part of this Coalition Government this doctrinaire, straightlaced attitude of bringing in a wealth tax at present.  The benefits from that tax will be in the region of £6 million, that is if the Government have not frightened even that much benefit out of the country.  Two hundred or 300 people at the most will be taxed under the present wealth tax.  As a result of that, we will have lost £4 million, £5 million or perhaps even £6 million.  I heard one solicitor in Dublin say he had transferred £6 million out of the country on behalf of clients of his.</P>
    <P>There is the introduction of the capital gains tax to which nobody would object in principle.  This party have put down practical amendments because we foresee the anomalies that can arise as a result of the Minister's doctrinaire type of attitude to it.  I would ask the Minister to restore some confidence to the people who had money in this country, who were prepared to invest it here and not have him and the Government running abroad borrowing money at expensive <Col N="1678" /> interest rates which has to be repaid within short periods of time. For the sake of cutting off his nose to spite his face, for the sake of keeping the young toothless tigers within the Fine Gael Party and indeed now the so-called socialists within the Labour Party, he and the Government adopt the stupid idea of having a wealth tax.  In the name of God, what wealth is there that we can afford to shove out of the country so quickly?  Whatever little confidence there remained in investment in this country in the past two years, with the continuing dogmatic attitude of the Minister for Finance I suspect it will not be even £6 million in revenue he will reap from that wealth tax. Those people are prepared to pay the highest rate of income tax.  But if they are taxed on what they accumulate, apart from what they pay in income tax, they will not even remain here to pay that income tax.  The Minister for Finance will be the sufferer but God help the rest of the people in employment because whatever little confidence there remained has vanished.</P>
    <P>This budget attacks what I always consider to be the vanishing race of this country, the middle-class, who are the one section of the community constantly being harassed, constantly being taxed and who are a disappearing people generally.  These are the people who have to go beyond local authorities to borrow from building societies, insurance companies or banks in order to build their houses. These are the people paying the high interest rates, who have to continue to pay high rates, who may have car repayments to meet, who do not qualify for any of the health benefits or any other type of relief.  They are the people constantly being scourged.</P>
    <P>I remember asking the Minister, at the time of the last budget, to allow some concession to anybody wanting to send his child to university.  We consider it would cost an average country person wishing to send his child to university, without a scholarship, £1,000 per annum.  Does the Minister think he is being fair not to allow such people a concession above the ordinary taxation allowance of <Col N="1679" /> 200 26 pences or 35 pences?  Does the Minister think that in many cases he is being fair in preventing such a child from going to university through lack of finance?  Seeing that the Government will not provide the extra finance to enable such children go to university, would the Minister, as Minister for Finance, at least help the parents to put such children through university?  I understand it now costs a student attending Dublin university £15 for bed and board in any hostel or other such place.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, in that regard I believe the Revenue Commissioners propose now to add 6.75 per cent to all landladies' bills in Dublin, to all hostels in Dublin, to all student accommodation in Dublin which, on average, would mean at least £1 extra a week for such accommodation.  First of all, would the Minister not consider withdrawing VAT from any student accommodation, be it a hostel, lodgings or anything else?  The parents of such students should be allowed at least a minimum of £1,000 per annum or some contribution towards the cost of putting their children through university.</P>
    <P>In regard to investment there is one point I should like to make.  The Minister for Finance received many representations from credit unions this year.  The one great social credit service available, the credit unions, who lend money at low interest rates, who lend reasonable sums to people to carry out reconstruction of family homes, to buy motor cars or motor-cycles&mdash;which the banks refuse to do &mdash;are refused the same interest free on deposits as is allowed to the banks.  In fact, the Minister has failed to reply to letters form Deputies in regard to this matter or, at least, has not given his reasons in the budget for not doing so.</P>
    <P>As far as the farming position is concerned you, a Cheann Comhairle, are fully aware of how badly off the farmers are.  I suspect you are more than fully aware of the fact.  As a Deputy you must have received many representations in regard to the dire plight, particularly of the small farmer <Col N="1680" /> in whom you and I are interested, in the past 12 months.  The Minister for Finance gives them back £100,000 in taxation relief on something he never collected form them in the first place.  I suspect he is going to have a damned hard job collecting it in the next couple of months.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister for Finance passed through Tipperary last Saturday. Perhaps the Minister might remember where he was last Saturday? Was the Minister in Tipperary last Saturday?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be replying at the end of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I guessed the Minister was because somebody said: &ldquo;Lee Harvey Oswald where are you?  Tipperary needs you.&rdquo;  That was a Fine Gael farmer's remark at that time.  I would not go along with it but I would somewhat agree with the sentiments.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his 1974 budget stated that 9,000 farmers only would be affected by the taxation of farming. Being rural representatives, we know that figure could be as high as 30,000 to 40,000 farmers.  I am not talking about the £100 valuation man. In my own constituency alone there are 639 farmers with over £100 valuation. I think that is the exact figure.  But there are many more who have valuations of more than £20, but who have bad farms and who must go to work in order to make a living for their families.  These people are allowed only half the tax allowance. This is a disincentive to them to work away from their farms.  However, those who continue to work often resort to what I would consider to be the worst type of farming, that is, dry stock.  The responsibility for this situation must rest with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no help in the budget for those who are endeavouring to provide themselves with homes.  The SDA loan of £4,500 is not nearly sufficient to build a house of, say, between 11,000 and 12,000 sq. ft. because, excluding the cost of the site, a house of that size would cost at least £7,000. <Col N="1681" /> There is no help in this area from this so-called socially conscious Government.</P>
    <P>Neither is there help in the budget for that fast disappearing section, the middle-income group.  There is nothing that will help them to acquire loans from building societies or from insurance companies.  In the case of the insurance companies, the Minister took money from them to boost his national loans this year which, without this help, would have been a nonevent. The result of this is that people who had hoped to acquire loans from the insurance companies now find that they must continue with bank overdrafts which, if not repaid within the year agreed, are charged at 6 per cent extra.</P>
    <P>The increases in drink prices will lead to a recession in the trade.  Indeed there had been a recession already as was noticeable at Christmas when there was not the same social activity of other years.  To many people in rural Ireland going out for an evening to have a few drinks is the only social activity available.  Not only has the Minister hit these people very hard by putting an extra 3p on the pint but he has put the publican in the position in which he may be losing from 4p to 6p on a dozen bottles.  This is because the Minister for Industry and Commerce has not stated the position in regard to VAT on these extra charges and the publican pays VAT on general turnover and not on individual items.</P>
    <P>Regarding social welfare we are told that there is an overall increase this year of 23 per cent.  However we know that inflation last year was running at a rate of 22 per cent. Therefore social welfare increases have only been brought into line with what was the rate of inflation last year.  There is nothing to make up for the inbuilt inflation within a deficit budget, which in this budget is greater than was the case last year.  May we expect that in the next year the rate of inflation will be in the region of 24 per cent or 25 per cent?</P>
    <P>In the case of an old age contributory pensioner the rate is to be increased from £8.50 to £10.50 per <Col N="1682" /> week.  This increase comes into effect in April and not in January.  That extra £2 will be merely enough to buy 1 cwt. of coal while the extra 30p in children's allowance for each child will merely buy one pound of sausages and these would not go far among three or four children.  The rate for the non-contributory old age pension and for the blind pension is to be increased from £7.60 to £8.85 per week. At the same time the means test limit is being increased to £600 per year.  In other words, a person can have £3,000 or £4,000 in the bank and yet qualify for a weekly allowance of £8.85 from the Department.  I am not cribbing about that, but I would point to the anomaly whereby if a person owns his house his allowance will be reduced by 25p per week.  Is not that an iniquitous situation?  Why not help the person who has nothing?</P>
    <P>A more worrying feature of our social welfare code is that in rural Ireland, where the average take-home pay is about £23 per week, a man would be better off to be on the dole. This is a development that should not be encouraged.  It would be much better to ensure that workers are paid at least the minimum wages rather than that they would be in the position of being better off drawing unemployment benefit and perhaps doing &ldquo;nixers&rdquo; for which they would be paid £5 or £6 per day.</P>
    <P>Any country Deputy can tell the number of people on his own labour exchange who are working for a return of £5 or £6 a day.  They have no rates or income tax to pay.  They have medical cards and, therefore, have no medical expenses to pay.  Between children's allowances and social welfare allowances they could get £35 a week.  Add to that the &ldquo;nixer&rdquo; of £5 a day.  That makes £60 a week without any contribution to this country or to our less well-off people.  The Minister has aided and abetted that situation. In spite of many representations made about these people to the Departments of Social Welfare and Labour nothing has been done.  I know the reasons why in many cases.  I know several honest people who are ashamed to draw the dole because of the attitude of some <Col N="1683" /> of the investigating officers.  The hard-necked professionals, who could walk rings around any Social Welfare Act here, always get away with it.  I do not think the Minister is aware of what country people are tolerating with regard to the dole and unemployment. At least 25 per cent of those people in many rural areas need not be on the dole if they want to work.</P>
    <P>I know one man who has been on the dole since he was 21 years of age. He is now 39 and has nine children. He has been on the dole for 17 years. Nothing has been done about him because nobody had the courage to get up and condemn or stop him.  If the Minister directed the unemployment rates more into the field of food and medicine rather than direct cash payment this would not happen.  Many of these cash payments are not going to the wives and families.  They are going into the nearest pubs and betting offices, from which the Minister will collect extra revenue.</P>
    <P>We are becoming the most over-borrowed country in the world today. Last year the Minister borrowed £200 million and will borrow excessively more this year, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He has dispelled from this country by his doctrinaire policy at least £400 million to £500 million.  He will further dispel by his continuing dogmatic attitude towards the capital gains tax any further investment.</P>
    <P>Let us recap on the money which has come into this country.  It has been in the region of 90 per cent borrowed and 10 per cent investment. All I can say is God help this country and let us hope He speeds it up with a return of a single party which from its own broad base can diversify in times of crisis and not be stuck to doctrinaire policies, such as those of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for giving our people such a good budget.  In 1973 and 1974 we had very bad harvests and severe winters.  That made it difficult for the Minister to do what he did. Due to the severe weather conditions <Col N="1684" /> and other reasons, livestock prices tumbled.  They enjoyed excellent prices for three or four years.  Suddenly the people were faced with a crisis for which they were not prepared.</P>
      <P>Cattle prices in the west were around £200 per head, and suckling calves made from £50 to £70.  Had it not been for the factories I do not know what the cattle situation would be today.  We were critical of the factories because we knew they could have done better but if they had not stepped in many farmers would have faced wholesale losses.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for adding to the £750,000 for fodder the generous sum of £2.2 million to help farmers.  This is being organised throughout the country by the various committees of agriculture. Vouchers are being sent to the people concerned.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the cash is sent to these people as quickly as possible. As I said, this has been a most trying year.  The costs of hay and other feedingstuffs are very high.</P>
      <P>The Minister has faced up to this crisis.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will let us know about the hill farm scheme around the 11th February.  Farmers are looking forward to hearing about this scheme. They hope they will be getting a generous allowance per head for their livestock.  Then they will be able to plan for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £16 beef incentive scheme which has been in operation for some years past is bad.  It encouraged farmers to keep more livestock.  Some people were so anxious to get the extra £16 per head that they increased their cattle numbers from ten to 20. As a result of the two bad harvests they found themselves in trouble. Under this scheme they had to keep the calves and cows until November or December.  The winter had arrived before they decided what they were going to do and the market had dropped.  They were left with cows and calves and some of that livestock was from the previous year.  I strongly urge the Minister to change this at the first opportunity because in my <Col N="1685" /> part of the country it has led to disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy, but matters of such detail dealing with agriculture would be more appropriate to another time, perhaps to the Estimate for that Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great necessity to spend more money on drainage throughout the country and in particular in the west.  For many years very little drainage has been done apart from a few arterial drainage schemes which cost an enormous amount of money.  The Government should concentrate on drainage and use some of the EEC grants for this purpose.  Colossal losses are being suffered as a result of flooding.  There are two schemes in existence to deal with the problem&mdash;the arterial drainage scheme and the local improvements scheme and they are not adequate to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Housing is still a big problem. People are getting married much earlier than they did years ago, many of them hoping for a house in a scheme in their town or village, but of course many of them do not succeed in getting one.  I know the Minister for Local Government has told us about his housing target.  He has made a very good attempt, but last year we could not carry out many of the plans we had envisaged.  I know the Minister is doing his best.  Somebody said the Government were not generous enough in giving loans.  The Government are reasonably generous in this regard.  Only last week a young man called to see me here.  He is a bus conductor, which is not one of the top jobs.  A building society is prepared to advance him £6,000 to purchase a house or erect one.  I do not think we can complain about the loan situation when a young man like that can get a loan of £6,000.  The same applies to local authorities and to the EEC.  They all advance money where they know it will be well spent.  Naturally they must make sure it will be properly spent before they advance it. When the winter is over and livestock prices are higher it will be easier to <Col N="1686" /> get loans.  All over the country the livestock trade is looking brighter. Marts and fairs have shown a steady improvement in the last week.  That is the one thing that will put the country's affairs in order and make it easy for our Government to get on with the work.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies have mentioned social welfare benefits.  We have gone through two very difficult years and many people did not expect to do so well in the budget.  They realised the Minister's difficulties, how cattle prices had deteriorated and the losses suffered on all crops.  For that reason it was not easy for the Minister to get money.  He certainly gave a generous increase in social welfare benefits.  I must congratulate him on the fact that 67 year olds are now eligible for the pension.  In two years' time we hope our working people and our farmers will be able to stand side by side with professional people, entitled to a pension at 65 years of age.  The years from 67 to 70 were three difficult years for many people.  It is a great consolation to them now to get the pension at 67.  As well as that the wife at 58 years qualifies for something over £4.  That means over £12 going into a home.  Any housewife will do a good job with an additional £12 a week.</P>
    <P>Prices are high and will continue to rise due to circumstances beyond our control.  This is a world wide trend and we cannot escape it.  When we were having a rather tough time many people were asking why we joined the Common Market.  They forgot to ask what our position would be if we had not joined.  It would be much worse. Of late, through the Government, we are getting large amounts of money from the EEC.  It was a surprise to many of us to hear that this country had benefited by so many millions in the last 12 months.  This will continue. We have a very able representative in our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the rest of the Cabinet will do a good job on behalf of the people.  I know they will bring back the best terms available.  They know what conditions are.  The members of the Cabinet <Col N="1687" /> come from many parts of the country and they have the views of the Deputies.  They know what the problems are and the amount of money required to help people to live.</P>
    <P>Grants are being given to what are known as the disadvantaged areas.  We do not know exactly what those areas will receive but we hope to see good results from this scheme.  Most people are very happy about this budget.  It is impossible to please everybody in a budget.  You will always have some people who do not come in under the various benefits but throughout the west of Ireland all the people will receive something.  I was glad to see this year that an allowance was given to single elderly women, who very often found it hard to live because they remained at home possibly to look after their mothers or fathers and when their parents died they were left without anything to live on.  Those people now find they have a small pension to help them in their remaining years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has being most interesting listening to Members on the Government side of the House praising this budget when most people know that it will do nothing whatever to expand the economy.  The Minister was not able to balance the books for the current financial year and we now have another large deficit.  The capital programme will be financed by going to the Arabs for £100 million, if they will advance the money, and something in the region of £158 million will have to be borrowed from any financial house in this country that will lend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No money is made available to the private industrialist because it has all been gobbled up by the Government to keep the services of the nation in operation and to keep the wheels of the Department of Finance moving.  The money that is borrowed is costing something in the region of £200 million to service at the moment. What will it cost us to service the money which the Minister intends to borrow now?  We must remember that if you go to the Sheik of Araby or some other Sheik you have to pay a <Col N="1688" /> very high interest rate for the money you borrow.  Some of those people might do what they did with the English Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this budget for expansion in industry or nothing for expansion in housing.  When inflation is taken into account there is a great increase in the price of houses. House building is a very large industry but no capital is being given to the private sector, which is almost at a standstill.  In Offaly if a man wants to buy a new house he finds it very difficult to get a loan from the banks.  The banks are also very slow in giving bridging loans because they find the money is not paid back very quickly.  They are also afraid that, when they give a loan of, say, £4,500 it will not be sufficient to build the house and more money will be required.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to see nothing in the budget in relation to an increase in the income limit and the amount of house loans which borrowers could receive from local authorities.  The amount of money given at the moment is completely unrealistic when inflation is taken into consideration. The average cost of a house of 1,000 sq. ft. is about £7,000 and you have to add on £1,000 for the cost of the site.  When the person building the house gets the grant from the local authority he has to make up the difference of about £2,900.  How can any young man afford to pay that before he even puts a stick of furniture into his house?  This is what has brought about a standstill in the private sector of housebuilding.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to get money from building societies.  I cannot understand why the Minister did not give some concessions to building societies which would be a big incentive to depositors and Irish people abroad to come back and invest their money here.  People will not invest here if they find they would be taxed to the hilt.  It may be said they will do it for love of the country.  It is love of the pocket now.  Therefore, it is a grave mistake on the part of the Government and the Minister not to give tax relief on amounts up to <Col N="1689" /> £10,000 to the building societies and other financial concerns.  They badly need a boost.  It would make more money available for the building of houses, for industrial expansion and for agriculture.  Maybe the Minister would be afraid of the criticisms which might come down on his head if he decided to do that.  But it must be remembered that we have only 50 years of self-government behind us. You might say we are a developing economy and a developing nation also.  I do not see all the wealth some organisations are talking abount, such as NITRO.  There may be a small section of the community here who are wealthy but there is no great wealth amongst the business and farming sectors, especially now. Therefore, there would not have been much of an argument against the Minister if he had given this tax relief.  An inflow of capital is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said earlier that our reserves had stood up well, but if the rate of inflation is considered, they have not stood up that well.  If you take the inflow of capital, you will have to admit that up to 90 per cent of that was borrowed money and that only 10 per cent of it was finance that was invested back in here.</P>
    <P>I was amazed that the Minister did not afford some protection for the textile and footwear industries.  I understand&mdash;and I want to be constructive on this&mdash;that we have obligations in the EEC and certain undertakings must be given.  Nevertheless, if the present trend continues, a grave situation will exist.  I come from a constituency in which the major employers are in textiles and footwear.  If competition from outside continues, even outside EEC countries to the extent of cheap garments and footwear being dumped here, it will have an adverse effect on these industries. According to the report from the task force that came to examine the footwear industry, there is nothing they can do for us, and we are back to square one.  However, as far as I know, it is open to us to renegotiate any of the terms on which we entered <Col N="1690" /> the EEC.  Last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have brought to the notice of the people in Brussels that a serious situation was developing.  I do not want to say anything that would damage any of these industries, but if nothing is done in this regard the inevitable will happen, more redundancy and great difficulty in keeping the doors open.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas the Minister also increased the tax on petrol by 15p. His explanation for that was that it would lower imports of oil.  People in the country depend on their cars to take them to work.  Most of them in my area travel up to 20 miles per day.  Many firms are depending on petrol to supply supermarkets, stores and so on.  What is happening now? All the firms that are caught by these higher costs are applying for increases in their products, and those increases will be passed on to the people.</P>
    <P>If revenue is required it must be obtained on something that is daily and hourly in demand.  It is no use putting it on clothes and so on, because we can wear those for a good while. Petrol is in demand daily and the Minister went for that because it brings him in about £35 million, money he badly needed for the Exchequer. However, the big petrol dealers have informed me that there is a reduction of something like 25 per cent in sales. That means that the collection of revenue to the Minister will be less. There will also be a reduction in VAT, and it seems that the Minister is relying on the same turnover for VAT as last year.  With sales falling I simply cannot see VAT holding its own and I have no doubt that later in the year the Minister will be bringing in yet another budget to try to rectify the position.  That will be a sad blow to the people because the Minister will have to opt for direct taxation and that will hit everybody.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's idea was in bringing in a wealth tax. Presumably he did this under pressure from the Labour Party.  The introduction of that tax resulted in the withdrawal of something in the region of £300 million from the country last <Col N="1691" /> year.  People lost confidence in the country.  The Minister realised what was happening and he toned down the Bill later; he saw the reaction to it on the part of the public and on the part of the farming community.</P>
    <P>Talking about farmers, farmers are not afraid of paying income tax.  However, in the last two years the income of the small farmer in particular has decreased by something in the region of 60 per cent while his costs have spiralled by as much as 100 per cent in some cases.  Diesel oil which cost him 9p at one time is now costing him 23p a gallon.  Cattle prices are falling.  I could not understand the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries allowing the meat factories to clean up at the expense of the farmers.  It was the factory who decided what cattle they would take, when they would take them, what they would pay and to whom they would pay it. Inspectors should have been placed in the factories and the marts to examine the cattle and decide what cattle should get the slaughter premium.  I know farmers who were lucky to get their cattle into the factories but, when I asked them how much they would get, they were not able to tell me.  They were hoping for the best. Who got this money?  Certainly the farmers did not get it.  Had they got it it would have meant an extra £33 on average to the farmer and that would have been a great help to him.  Sending inspectors might have caused staffing problems but the problem was not an insurmountable one.  The farmer was at the mercy of the people running the factories and they were quite ruthless.</P>
    <P>Postal charges have increased enormously. The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs seems more interested in the international situation than he is in the domestic situation.  The telephone system is appalling.</P>
    <P>Where industry is concerned many small firms will be in serious difficulty. One industry badly hit is the coach-building industry.  They are faced with competition from imports.  Imports are affecting them very adversely and redundancies are actually taking place. <Col N="1692" /> Small firms are finding it hard to get overdraft accommodation.  If one is doing well the banks will help but, if one is on one's knees, the banks will do nothing to help.  I suppose they have to ensure that every £ they lend will be well spent.  Three banks had a clear profit of £18 million but, even with that profit, they will not help those who need help.  The time the farmer, the industrialist or the businessman needs help most is when he hits a bad patch, when he is going through a bad time through no fault of his own.  The banks have not given as much assistance as they could.  Overdraft accommodation and new loans are almost impossible to negotiate and where a person is not able to repay bridging loans within the required time he may be required to pay an interest rate of 20 per cent.  I know of cases where borrowers had to repay the banks an extremely high interest rate.</P>
    <P>The Government have handled the mining industry very badly.  I am told that certain people went to the Minister when he would not give them a lease and said they would do the job if he gave them the money but he refused to do this.  Mining is a highly technical industry and I admit we have not as many experts as we would like but the Government should have negotiated. I do not mean they should have sold out but certainly they should have tried to negotiate in order to maintain people in employment.  Some of my constituents were involved in the mining industry; they got loans and built houses but now they are in a dreadful plight.  Some of them have had to leave the country but the people who remained have had to pay as much as £10 per week in loan repayments.</P>
    <P>With regard to drink prices, it may have been all right to increase the price of whiskey and brandy but the taxation on the pint, the drink of the ordinary man, was too much.  There has been a reduction in drink consumption and some publicans have said that there has been a fall in revenue of 25 per cent.  It appears the Minister will not get the return he expected from this source.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The increases in social welfare are welcome but by the time they come into operation on 1st April their value will have been eroded.  At the moment there are many applications for price increases on essential items before the National Prices Commission who will be recommending them to the Minister. If firms are not allowed the increases there will be further redundancies and the closure of businesses. Employers are faced with the prospect of finding an extra 10 per cent increase and this amounts on average to £3.50 per week for each employee. When some employers were pressed by the unions and workers to give this additional money they agreed to pay it but they let go a certain number of their employees.</P>
    <P>The increase in social welfare will cost approximately £28 million but the Minister has not told us the cost of the stamp.  More than likely the employees will have to pay the major portion.  I am told the stamp may cost as much as £5 per week.  If that happens the Minister will collect £42 million, thus giving the Exchequer an extra £14 million.  Anyone who is working will have to pay the cost of the stamp.  The increase in the tax allowance will be of little value because in the long run the taxpayer will have to pay more to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister increased the health contributions significantly.  We are in the situation that each month measures have been introduced which entail an increase in taxation.  The Government are in trouble with chemists, doctors and many others but they cannot bulldoze these people into agreements.  There will have to be negotiations and the sooner that is done the better.</P>
    <P>I do not see any hope of economic growth this year.  Each week there are further redundancies and the inflationary rate increases.  There will be a serious situation when equal pay is introduced.  This applies particularly to the textile industry, a concern that is going through a rough period.  I can see those who employ a large number of females reducing the number of <Col N="1694" /> their staff because they will be faced with a huge wage bill.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that females are not entitled to equal pay for equal work. That is all right provided companies are able to pay the wage bill.  In this regard also I hope the State will be able to pay the bill when equal pay comes into operation in the Civil Service. It will cost the State an enormous amount of money.  I can see the Minister going on the borrowing market anywhere and everywhere.  There are more avenues open to him now than before.  He can go to the European Bank and the Arabs but they will dictate the terms, the length of time he will have to pay the loan back and the interest he will have to pay.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase whatsoever in the amount for road grants.  In my constituency when one takes into consideration the rising cost of material and increased wages the total amount left for road works will be 37 per cent of the amount allocated.  Administration costs alone will account for 63 per cent of the amount allocated.  In Offaly and Laois all the county councils are able to do is patch because they do not have money for anything else.  I should like to ask the Minister how it is that in Offaly where they collect in the region of £300,000 in Road Fund tax they only receive a grant of something like two-thirds of that sum.  Because a lot of the roads in that county go through bogs they are more difficult to maintain and, consequently, necessitate more repair work than roads in other counties.</P>
    <P>We have only a limited amount of primary roads that qualify for a 100 per cent State grant.  In my view all the Offaly and Laois county councils will be able to do is to keep the wheels turning as they did last year.  They must cut back on some of the major proposals brought before the councillors in view of the fact that the Government grant will not amount to very much.  On the question of local improvement schemes I should like to remind the Minister that we have not received any allocation so far.  We would need something in the region or £80,000 to clear the backlog alone. I <Col N="1695" /> do not know what the position will be but I can see further deterioration of the roads in the midlands because we have received no extra money.  We need at least 20 per cent more of an allocation to keep up with the rising costs of materials and increases in wages.  It should be remembered that just over a year ago a gallon of tar cost 9p while now it costs 22p.</P>
    <P>For the financial year ending 31st December last we had a deficit of £92 million.  Allowances to the public service have now created a further major deficit.  Is it now the intention of the Minister to keep borrowing and borrowing until we cannot go anywhere else?  This is something we will have to face up to.  It may be easy for the Minister to borrow now because he is doing so on the credibility of Fianna Fáil who were always creditworthy at home and abroad.  When Fianna Fáil floated a national loan it was over-subscribed.  The last loan floated before we left office, in November, 1972, was for £25 million but we got £35 million.  We got it because the people had confidence in us to do a good job.  They had also confidence in us to spend the money wisely and properly.</P>
    <P>At present the Minister goes for small amounts, in the region of £12 million or £15 million.  If one looks at the subscription list one will see that most of that is given from the Minister's own resources and not from the public.  None of the loans floated by this Government even at an interest rate of 12 per cent, have been oversubscribed. Why they have not been, at such an interest rate, is something I cannot understand and something that baffles me.  Those who invest in such loans here are liable to income tax while foreigners do not have to pay tax.  That is not fair.  An Irish person investing in a national loan is lucky if he gets a return of 8 per cent and that is not very encouraging.  The Minister should do something about that.  Perhaps there is a reason for it that I know nothing about but I should like to have it explained.  It should be looked into.  The Minister would receive much more finance if the depositor <Col N="1696" /> here was not taxed.  He will not invest here if he is to be taxed at 35 per cent.  Taking it all in all, that is not a very happy position for the investor to find himself in.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said he hoped that we on this side of the House would be constructive in matters concerning the good of the nation.  Nobody can say that we have not been constructive on this side of the House.  We always spoke out on anything we thought was worthwhile and would be of benefit to the nation. I hope that a new national wage agreement will be negotiated.  It would be a disaster if the talks broke down and we ended up with a free for all. I hope common sense will prevail and that the agreement between employers and employees will be honoured.</P>
    <P>I like to be constructive and responsible. I do not like to lambaste anybody or to browbeat anybody.  I admit that the employers felt the squeeze because at the time of the negotiations before the last agreement they did not realise they would be caught for this extra 10 per cent.  The agreement was negotiated and it had to be honoured.  Employers may be more wary about the new agreement but I hope the negotiations will be brought to a fruitful conclusion.</P>
    <P>We have pay-related benefits for the unemployed but, when the first six months have passed and there are no pay-related benefits, we will have the squeeze.  Then we will see the position, and then the trouble will start. At the moment some people are not inclined to work because with pay-related benefit and sick benefit they can make more money by staying at home.  Between the insurance stamp, PAYE, and other stoppages, they would lose something like £2 to £3 a week.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit is costing something in the region of £2½ million a week.  This is an enormous sum.  I can see no early reduction in the number unemployed.  I believe the figure will move up because the Government have done nothing to boost building and other industrial concerns. Nothing has been done for the building industry in which we have <Col N="1697" /> had most of the unemployment.  Some of the biggest builders have decided to pull out with their machinery and go to England, Scotland, or somewhere else.  That was a severe blow to the country and a severe blow to the workers in the building industry, some of whom have been with the builders for 18 to 20 years.  When a person has been in the building industry for a long time it is not easy for him to turn to any other trade.  Thanks to Fianna Fáil we have redundancy payments but they are of little help to the workers because they will only tide them over for a few months.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the financial programme which the Minister laid before the House I can see no expansion in the economy.  I see more unemployment in the building industry and many schemes being held up because of lack of finance.  Many of the schemes the Minister may have in mind will depend on his ability to borrow.  The Minister will have to rob the subsidiary banks and the merchant banks to keep the affairs of the nation in operation.  Last June the <Col N="1698" /> Central Bank made about £20 million available to the public.  When I made inquiries I was told that that money had been gobbled up by the Government to keep the services in operation.</P>
    <P>How can the private sector of the community expect to get finance if the Government are eating up all the money available?  If the Minister takes all the money there is nothing left to enable the builder, the industrialist and the farmer to expand.  When the banks are cornered they say: &ldquo;It is the Central Bank.  They sent us a directive.&rdquo;  When the Central Bank are cornered they say: &ldquo;The Government have the squeeze on us.&rdquo;  In some of their statements the Central Bank have not been too sympathetically disposed towards the Government. They said that many of the proposals would run us into inflation and into serious problems.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.  Health authorities in Great Britain work in close liaison with health authorities in this country and with my Department. In the recent case of a contact of Lassa fever, difficulty arose in deciphering an address on a passenger list and this caused a delay in the matter coming to notice.  In the above circumstances the delay on this particular occasion was not one in relation to which it is felt that representations to the World Health Organisation would be necessary but the substance of the point made by the Deputy, namely the desirability of ensuring as far as possible through the auspices of the World Health Organisation that rapid communication of information on an international basis is achieved, will certainly be borne in mind.</P>
