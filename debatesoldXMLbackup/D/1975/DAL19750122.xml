    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The permission was given yesterday and I would give permission again to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to give permission again to-day.  In that event, I object on behalf of my party to your giving this permission.  I suggest that the very use of the words that &ldquo;with your permission&rdquo; the Minister proposes to answer a question in a certain way implies that that permission may be given or withheld. With due respect, I would suggest to you, Sir, that that permission ought to be withheld in the circumstances in which we find ourselves today with a Minister answering a series of some 17 question in one omnibus answer. I accept entirely that the Minister may make a comprehensive written answer to a number of questions that seek to elicit the same information. But I suggest, Sir, that you should not use your discretion to permit the Minister to answer this series of questions in that fashion, many of them seeking specific information, information of a type that, having heard as well as I could what the Minister proposed to say yesterday, is not being given.  In these circumstances I suggest that the Minister should be directed to answer these questions separately, or combining a number of them, but certainly not combining every one of them.  I formally now put it to you that you ought to withhold your permission to answer the questions collectively, as the Minister has asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Lynch, may I say that it has been ruled on a number of occasions <Col N="718" /> by my predecessors that the Chair has no control over the number of questions which a Minister takes together? For the purpose of giving a single reply to them, the request of the Minister for permission to reply to two or more questions together is merely a courtesy to the Chair and relates to the fact that the Chair calls only one question at a time.  There are many precedents for this.  It is a well established practice in this House over a very long period of time.  In the circumstances, Deputy Lynch, I would not be justified in departing from that procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make another suggestion to you, Sir, in reply to your statement that the words &ldquo;with your permission&rdquo; are used only out of courtesy to the Chair, because normally he is disposed to calling questions individually.  In that event, Sir, I think the words &ldquo;with your permission&rdquo; should be dispensed with in any case because a Minister is free, therefore, to answer as many questions as he likes in order&mdash;as is obvious in this case&mdash;to withhold information from the House.</P>
      <P>Now, there are two good reasons why these questions should not be permitted to be answered in the form that the Minister proposes.  In the first instance, as I have already indicated, there are specific pieces of information sought here which the Minister, as well as I can anticipate, does not propose to give.  There is no reason why they should not be given.  The subject matter of each one of these questions, in the custom of the House, will be ruled out as the subject matter of questions for a period of six months. In other words, whatever statement the Minister is going to issue at a later date may or may not contain answers to the specific questions now put.  As well as that, it will mean that he will be free, without this House having the opportunity to put questions to him, to delay any statement on a matter of such public importance as long as he likes up to the limit of that period of six months before another question on the subject matter can be properly put.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put another point to you, <Col N="719" /> Sir.  You say, probably rightly, that you have not control over the subject matter of the answer to the questions. I accept that entirely.  You say also that there is ample precedent for a Minister putting a lot of questions together for the purpose of giving a single answer.  I accept that, Sir, but I would suggest to you that this is done only where the type of information sought in each question is similar, almost similar or exactly similar.  In these cases, Sir, I think it is perfectly justified that a Minister should seek to answer a number of questions together.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, Sir, I want to put this to you, especially in the context of your saying that you have no responsibility for the subject matter of the answers: the Minister is responsible to this House.  He was elected by the Members of this House; he was nominated by the Taoiseach, but elected to his office by the Members of this House. The Members of this House were elected to their particular positions on behalf of the people and it is not only their duty, their function, but their right to elicit answers to questions of public importance.  The Minister is denying to the elected representatives of the people, in the manner in which he proposes to answer these questions, that information.</P>
    <P>Again, I want you to reconsider, in the light of what I have said, the permission you have given to the Minister to answer these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the things to which Deputy Lynch has referred would obviously require some amendment of Standing Orders. I want to allay his anxiety in respect of repeat questions, to which he has adverted.  A repeat of an earlier question is disallowed if tabled within six months of the answer to the original question.  But this rule does not apply where the circumstances have changed in the meantime.  For instance, if the Minister, or a Minister, takes a decision on issues or issues a statement in relation to the matters in the answer to the question or questions, questions are allowable in relation to the decision or the <Col N="720" /> statement.  So that if a statement or an action is taken in the interim, within the six months' period, questions would be allowable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again respectfully suggest that that implies a situation in which the Minister will make a public statement on the subject matter of these questions.  I put it to you again that the Minister is now free, within the rules of the House, to delay such a public statement for six months and that if he should not make a public statement within that period Deputies are precluded, without any redress, from putting questions of the type put by Deputy Wilson and, I suggest, by Deputy Thornley for that whole period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position in which the Chair finds itself. That is the usual procedure.  I would ask Deputies to abide by the ruling of the Chair on this occasion. Let us hear the reply.  Let us have relevant supplementaries and let us deal with Question Time in the normal fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal for the co-operation of Deputies.  If there is a strong opinion that there should be a change in respect of this whole matter, I suggest that the issue might be raised at Procedure and Privileges where an agreement could be reached as to how these matters should be disposed of in the future.  But the Chair is conforming with tradition, practice and precedent and does not consider itself free to deviate from that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate your position but I suggest that you have discretion in so far as the Minister asks you to exercise discretion.  You have exercised that discretion in his favour and against the interests of the Deputies who put down these questions.  Yesterday, Sir, you indicated that you would not give any undertaking in advance as to the number of supplementaries that might be asked.</P>

    <Col N="721" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a discretion which must be left always to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the manner in which, normally, you exercise that discretion, we envisage that, if the Minister answers the questions in the manner he proposes to answer them, after five or six supplementaries you would proceed with the other questions and that, therefore, adequate supplementary questioning would be ruled out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As there are 17 questions involved the Chair proposes to deal generously with the supplementaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken issue with you, Sir, but yesterday a reasonable suggestion was made to the Minister by a Member from this side of the House.  Having regard to what happened yesterday I suggest that the Minister rewrite his answers individually or, perhaps, collectively, in a more modified way.  I appeal formally to the Minister to do that and to avoid further recrimination in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have accepted your discretion, a Cheann Comhairle, and I intend to proceed with my reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, as my protest individually to your refusal to exercise a discretion that I suggest you have, but particularly because of the manner in which the Minister proposes to answer these questions, I propose to withdraw from the House for the duration of the Minister's answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Deputy leaves I would reiterate that the Chair has no discretion in respect of Ministers' replies; that the Chair never had such discretion and that it would place the Chair in an intolerable position to be made responsible for Ministers' replies or for the manner in which they are dealt with.  I assure the Deputy that I am anxious to deal fairly and impartially in this whole matter but if I am prescribed by Standing Orders and precedents, Members should appreciate that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to you, Sir, I limit my purpose of withdrawal to a mark of my disapproval of the manner in which the Minister proposes to answer these questions.  In withdrawing I am leaving strict instructions with the members of my party that they are to continue with supplementary questions, if necessary, on this matter but to do so in an orderly manner, as I know will be the case.  In the meantime I shall allow the Minister have his way, if that is what he wants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and appreciate the procedural difficulty in so far as the Chair is concerned and I have sympathy for him in that regard. However, I tabled a set of questions which were prompted by what happened on 16th December.  That was the date on which this document was issued to the Press with a great flourish of trumpets.  Why, for example, is Question No. 12 included in the lumping answer while Question No. 18 is not included although the latter is on precisely the same subject?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not to have a sense of grievance but can I have an explanation as to why Question No. 12 is to be included in the lumping answer while Question No. 18 which deals with the same subject is to be excluded?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Chair appreciates the importance of the subject matter of these questions because you admitted so yesterday.  It is not my wish to incur the displeasure either of the Chair or of the House but I am in pursuit of knowledge regarding a very important issue and a short lumping answer to these questions which were framed after careful reading of the proposals will not satisfy the House nor the country. Therefore, I appeal to the Minister, through you, to give a full and adequate answer to each question individually.</P>

      <P>The Chair has ruled that the Minister may reply to the questions he has outlined in a single reply.  The Chair's decision in that regard must be accepted.  Therefore, I ask the House to hear the reply.  Then, let us have the supplementary questions when the Chair will facilitate Deputies in eliciting as much information as possible on these questions. As usual, supplementaries must be relevant, must contain no argument and must not tend to speech-making, but let us hear the reply and deal with the matter in a responsible way.</P>

      <P>As a Minister who is answerable to this House, he refuses to reply to the legitimate query of the elected representatives of the people in this Parliament.  The sooner we realise that the better.  The fact that <Col N="724" /> the Minister refuses to stand over his proposals, refuses to answer in relation to them to the elected representatives of the people, is the greatest possible indictment of him and is a far greater indictment than if he were to attempt to answer and answer badly.  Through you, Sir, we must assert our rights as representatives of the people to question a member of the Executive of the country.</P>

    <P>The Higher Education Authority did not specifically advert to the matter <Col N="732" /> of a binary system at all.

      <P>It will set out the reasons why the Government decided that University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, should be constituent colleges of a re-constituted National University of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Following my policy decision announced at the INTO congress in Wexford, I initiated discussion between the colleges of education and the universities with a view to ensuring that primary teachers who had successfully completed a three year course would be awarded a university degree. Negotiations towards the achievement of this aim have reached an advanced stage.  The colleges of education will become recognised colleges of the universities awarding their degrees, and will be designated institutions for purposes of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.</P>

Therefore, for me to answer some of those questions would have been to pre-empt the rights of my colleagues to pronounce judgment in certain aspects of the matter.  In so far as I have been able to answer the questions I have done so.  In so far as I have not been able to answer I have said so in the answer.</P>

Would the Minister now explain to the House why he decided, he said as a matter of courtesy to the House, to give a different answer today to the same questions that he had yesterday?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that these were not proposals for further discussion, that they were decisions and that, in so far as Government decisions are final, these were final.  I also pointed out in numerous interviews that if, when the Bill is brought into this House, consequent on the publication of the White Paper the Opposition, or indeed the Government, wish to put down amendments in the light of proposals then obtaining, they could do so.  Only to that extent are they final.  I want to clear away any impression that might be held by the public that these were a further set of proposals for a further set of merry-go-round discussions&mdash; that in fact the Government had decided.  May I point out that this matter has been the subject of discussion for upwards of 15 or 16 years and that I have only been in office about 18 months.  In 18 months we have got out decisions.  In the 16 years of the previous Government's tenure of office they did not get out decisions.</P>

From these various people we will get an input of ideas and I will take cognisance of these, but the board parameters of the decisions are already visible and they will remain so.</P>

The exact form of the charter, the number of members on particular bodies, what will be the recognised colleges or constituent colleges, all these matters are the subject of continuing discussions, not in fact the question of which will be the constituent colleges because one college has an option as to whether it will go into the new National University of Ireland or go in another direction towards one of the Dublin colleges. These are all matters to which I am giving urgent attention; but the broad decision, I repeat, has been taken to constitute a new National University of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I have raised a question as to the hours which it is proposed to sit next week.  I have heard a suggestion that we shall have all-day sessions starting next week <Col N="758" /> which, I submit, is, to say the least of it, rather unusual&mdash;we have witnessed rather a lot of unusual things here today&mdash;at this time of the session.</P>

      <P>I agree it is unusual, but we are moving into an unusual era in as much as the new Standing Orders absorb a little more than a quarter of the Government's time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. There will be a budget debate and a very large amount of financial business which must be disposed of before Easter, which is unusually early this year.  The Government wishes to secure agreement on such matters, and I had intended to raise with the Opposition, not only this week but last week as well, the question of full-day sittings on Wednesdays with the intention that the budget debate would continue on Wednesday mornings thus leaving the rest of the week, or as much of it as possible, for legislative business.  I agree it is unusual, but as the Leader of the Opposition will realise, we are extremely busy, and the disappearance of about 3¼ hours of Government time all the year round makes a fairly substantial difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unusual and, indeed, unreasonable nature of this suggestion, and having regard to the fact that Members of the House made commitments as to the disposal of their time, especially at this time of the year, which would preclude their attendance at the House, for example, for the morning session on Wednesday, would the Parliamentary Secretary take that into account?  It is not easy for Deputies to disengage themselves from these commitments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with Deputy Lynch that that is so.  Usually what the Government find themselves criticised for is unwillingness to do some work.  Now we want to sit longer hours and do more work and I hope the Leader of the Opposition sees the reason for it.  Apart from the budget debate, which has barely begun, there is the Finance Bill which <Col N="759" /> must be passed within 20 sitting days of the budget, as the Leader of the Opposition knows.  There is the Capital Gains Tax Bill, which should have begun this week but, to convenience the Opposition, we agreed to postpone it until next week.  I make no complaint about that.  This is a very heavy programme by any standard. There is also the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill and the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  If the Opposition have got some suggestions for economies I shall be very glad to hear them.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 25:</P>
    <P>Before subsection (8), to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where, on appeal to the Board, the decision of the Board in granting a permission would materially contravene the development plan or any special amenity order relating to the area, the Board shall call upon the planning authority to show cause why the Board should not so decide and after consideration of such submissions as the local authority may make, the Board shall then make its decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were discussing this amendment on the last occasion I was pointing out that cases will arise in which the granting of permission in material contravention of a development plan is justified because, for <Col N="760" /> example, of changed circumstances since the plan was made.  What we were talking about the last day was the problem of devising a proper procedure to be followed in cases where it is proposed to allow contravention. I have already argued that the procedure suggested by Deputy Molloy is not the most appropriate one.  Possibly it could be changed around.  I am prepared to have another look at the whole problem before Report Stage to see if there is merit in the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it then that the Minister is offering to consider the amendment I have on the Order Paper, amendment No. 25 to section 13, and may I also take it that, if he considers the amendment reasonable, he is prepared to put forward a similar amendment on Report Stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to be very clear about this on the last occasion and I want to be very clear again now in the words I use.  What I am saying is that I shall have a look and if I find something like this will improve the legislation then, of course, an amendment will be necessary.  If, however, I am satisfied it would not help, then I will not be prepared to introduce an amendment.  I do not want to give the impression now that I am guaranteeing introducing an amendment because I am not saying that.  I thought it was accepted on the last occasion that it would be sufficient to deal with this matter in the way I have suggested in relation to it and, indeed, to other suggestions made earlier on in the debate on that occasion and, I am quite sure, there will be more on this occasion.</P>

      <P>The Minister's reply puts us in a difficult enough position. I do not wish to labour this but, if we got a similar reply to all the amendments we have tabled, we could agree to withdraw our amendments in the hope that the Minister would bring forward his own amendments on Report Stage.  The Committee Stage having been completed, and finding on Report Stage that the Minister has not in fact brought forward any of these amendments, we would be allowed to make only one contribution on the Report Stage debate.  It would be <Col N="761" /> much more open, if the Minister feels he cannot do what we want in this case, to tell us in clear terms what his objection to the amendment is.  Possibly, having a look at it later, he might find there was some merit in it and might bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, but that is a very vague way of dealing with legislation. He has had the amendment before him for quite some time and he has had adequate time to consider the legal and administrative implications; he should be able to give us a fairly clear indication now of how his mind is working from the point of view of the inoperability of the amendment or the impracticability of complying with it, and he should state clearly what his objections are.  Could he give us any indication why he feels he cannot accept the amendment now but is prepared to consider it again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy J. Lynch and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach have just been arguing about long sittings.  Sometimes I feel it is a pity we cannot start a Bill and continue right through with it.  If Deputy Molloy reads the last few pages of the Official Report on the last occasion on which the Bill was before the House he will find all the answers he is now asking me to give him.  I went into great detail and I rather thought that Deputy Molloy himself objected to the detail into which I was going in explaining why I was not prepared to agree the amendment was necessary.  I can assure Deputy Molloy I have been very busy since then and it was not possible for me to consider this and I am not, therefore, prepared to go any further now.  At column 168 of Volume 277 of the Official Report I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy made a case for going back to local authority elected representatives.  This is not specifically stated even in the amendment.  I will have a look at it&mdash;I will not promise anything&mdash; and see if there is something which could be done which would strengthen it.  Every protection should be given but, if something is being done, we would want to <Col N="762" /> ensure, number one, that it is the elected representatives, for whom I have the greatest respect, number two, that there is a time limit.</P>
    <P>Later on I said I would not like to hedge around the new planning board with too many regulations which would make the board unworkable. That is what will happen if we put in too many little bits of amendments here and there.  At column 169 of Volume 277 again I said:</P>
    <P>... I did not say it prevents it from being brought forward...</P>
    <P>I do not believe that Deputy Molloy's amendment would mean that the elected members of a local authority would be notified of what was happening. The matter would go back to the planning authority and the elected representatives would not see it.  They could be shown it, but they would not have to see it under the amendment Deputy Molloy suggests. It does not spell out that the elected representatives should be the people. In addition to that, I do not want to build in a great number of technicalities which would result in holding up the planning board.  They might spend days deciding on a material contravention instead of doing some other work.  That is something none of us wants to see happening.  We want a good board, a board that works.  That is the spirit in which the Bill is being debated and that is the spirit in which I am telling the Opposition that I am prepared to have another look at this and, if I consider there is merit in it, then I will be prepared to introduce an amendment.  As Deputy Molloy said, a Deputy may speak only once on Report Stage.  I trust he was not suggesting that I was resorting to this device for the purpose of preventing him saying what he wants to say on an amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;14. &mdash;(1) A deposit of £10 shall be lodged with the Board by an appellant with his appeal and any appeal to the Board which is not accompanied by such deposit shall be invalid.</P>
      <P>(2) As soon as may be after an appeal to the Board is either withdrawn or determined, subject to section 16 (3) of this Act, the Board shall return the deposit to the appellant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> There is a very specific reason for this amendment which proposes the insertion of a new section requiring a deposit of £10.  In the Bill as drafted, section 28 (1) (a) (ii) would have enabled the Minister to make regulations providing for the payment of fees or deposits by appellants.  The intention was that these powers should be held in reserve until it was seen if other provisions were sufficient to deter vexatious appeals.  It has now been decided to dispense entirely with the idea of fees for appeals and to have a uniform requirement in regard to lodgments.  It is very difficult to determine what amount of a deposit would be likely to deter vexatious appeals.  The man who has genuine grounds for appeal will not mind making a deposit and £10 might be regarded as a reasonable compromise. Subsection (2) of the amendment provides for the return of the deposit.  Amendment No. 35 to section 16 will provide for forfeiture of the deposit to the board where the board are of opinion that the appeal is vexatious, and they can so direct.</P>
    <P>One of the things about appeals which really annoys me&mdash;and I am quite sure annoyed various Ministers since the Act was passed&mdash;is the fact that it is not uncommon for an appeal to be lodged, usually on a small matter, and an oral hearing requested, and the person who makes the appeal does not even turn up at the oral hearing.  Time is wasted and annoyance is caused to decent people. There is no provision in the existing legislation which will allow the Department to refuse to prepare to hear a second such appeal after the first one has been made and treated in this way, and even a third, or fourth, or fifth appeal.  There are on record appeals submitted by one person which were submitted out of some misguided sense of humour, I should imagine, or to annoy the neighbours, or something like that.</P>
    <P>This is simply for the purpose of ensuring that, when an appeal is lodged, the person who lodges it has good reason for lodging it.  I have always believed that if something is free it is not valued very much. People will not spend a sum of money <Col N="766" /> unless they are satisfied that they have a grievance and that they are entitled to go ahead with the appeal.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 35 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 8, between lines 40 and 41, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) In case the Board in determining an appeal is of opinion that the appeal is vexatious, the Board may direct that the deposit lodged in relation to the appeal shall be forfeited to the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is related to amendment No. 26.  If it is the opinion of the board that an appeal is vexatious the deposit shall be forfeited to the board. I grant the argument that this may impose on the board the responsibility of deciding whether an appeal is vexatious.  But something like this will have to be considered to ensure that we do not have a continuation of vexatious appeals which hold up the work of the board.  They may not be very numerous but even a small number of them can cause a lot of disruption. There are difficulties in trying to arrange suitable times and suitable venues for oral hearings.  It is very annoying to find that, when all the elaborate machinery has been put in motion, the person who lodged the appeal does not bother to turn up.</P>

      <P>As drafted, section 28 (1) (a) (ii) would have enabled me to make regulations providing for payment of fees or deposits by applicants.  It was my intention that these powers would be held in reserve until we would see if the other provisions were sufficient to deter vexatious appeals.  I propose to withdraw that now and to provide for the lodgment of £10 which will be returned if the appeal is a normal one. If somebody makes an appeal and, having made the appeal and paid the deposit&mdash;I doubt that he will do this &mdash;then does not turn up because he made the appeal to annoy somebody, he will forfeit his deposit.</P>

      <P>There are two sorts of appeals.  In one case a citizen submits an application to the local planning authority to be permitted to build a house, for example.</P>
      <P>If the local authority turn down that person and the appeals to the Minister against the decision not permitting him to do something, that is one situation.  It is difficult to envisage vexatious appeals in that type of case. These arise more in the case where a local authority have granted something and some third party or outside person decides to appeal to the Minister against the local authority decision to permit or allow something. I am putting this point to the Minister. Is it fair in the normal case of the citizen who wants to do something&mdash;extend his house or build a new house&mdash;to ask him to pay a £10 deposit to stop the possibility of vexatious appeals when such appeals are almost impossible in that situation? I can readily see the need for the deposit in the case where permissions are granted and appealed against.  Vexatious appeals could arise in that situation and I see the necessity for a deposit but there is a difference in the two types of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There can be vexatious appeals.  Deputy Molloy may remember some of them coming in and being repeated over the years and they are still coming to me.  These could be regarded, perhaps, as vexatious appeals, appeals by somebody who does not realise the facts are as they are.  On the other point as to whether it is an oral hearing, one would not know on the application whether it will be an oral hearing and it would be difficult to differentiate between one and the other unless somebody asks for an oral hearing.  Either we put in some type of fee or we do not. I may mention that amendment No. <Col N="768" /> 78 proposes to amend section 28 (1) by the deletion of the provision in it for fees or deposits.</P>
      <P>I am not anxious to prevent people appealing against some planning permission which has been granted.  It has been suggested that I am attempting to do this by putting in a provision like this.  There is no such intention. It is simply an effort to make the Act more workable.  I believe this will help considerably in achieving that.  I am open to comment from the Opposition.</P>

      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), lines 48 to 53 and in page 17, lines 1 to 5, to substitute the following paragraph for paragraph (a):</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister is meeting us there.  The only point that <Col N="769" /> remains is one which I suppose we cannot solve here, choosing a figure. The Minister has taken £10.  To some appellants that may be a substantial sum and to others a trifle.  I realise there is the problem that you cannot draw up a scale of sums to be applied in different cases when dealing with an abstract thing like a planning appeal.  Basically, we will accept the Minister's amendment and thank him for coming so far to meet our point of view because we would strongly oppose the charging of fees and that is to be withdrawn.  That removes one aspect of the Bill which we would have vigorously opposed.  Not being able to decide whether £10 is the right figure and having no other suggestion to make, that leaves us no option but to accept the Minister's amendment as it stands.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>Before section 14 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the Board is of opinion that a request for an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board is ill-founded or vexatious, but not otherwise, the Board may refuse such oral hearing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this amendment we are suggesting that the Board should not have the right to refuse an oral hearing unless they are satisfied that the appeal is a vexatious one or an ill-founded one. They should be able to state their reasons for so deciding.  Section 14 of the Bill states that &ldquo;The Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board.&rdquo; This gives very sweeping powers to the Board. I am suggesting that before that, the amendment in my name should be inserted. I think that would ensure that whatever decision would be made by the Board would be fair and that all citizens could be assured that they would be treated equally and fairly before the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Giving the board this absolute discretion <Col N="770" /> is a new departure.  One of the strenghts of the old planning Act was that any citizens with a grievance against any decision of a local planning authority could appeal.  There have been cases which were frivolous and may have delayed development unnecessarily and they may have been entered for that purpose but, on the whole, I think that right on the part of each citizen was appreciated and this was one of the finest characteristics of the 1963 Act.  That will be seriously curtailed if we allow the board absolute discretion in the holding of an oral hearing.  The case as between oral hearings and ordinary decisions through written submissions may not seem to have great significance to the ordinary person but there can be individual cases where the facts can be much better presented when each side to the appeal confronts the other across the table.  The oral hearing granted that concession but now it will only be granted at the discretion of the board.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that there is a strong temptation to give the board this power because it has been argued that oral hearings have delayed the issuing of some decisions.  It has been argued that they have slowed up the appeal decision machinery in the Department of Local Government and that there was an increase over a period in the number of persons applying for oral hearings.  It was deemed by some people who deal with appeals to be a bad thing.  I am not so sure that it is a bad thing if people seek the right to present their case orally.  To deny them that right will greatly diminish public respect for the Bill.  This right is not being denied to them totally but it is being denied inasmuch as that this new board will have a discretion which the Minister did not have.</P>
    <P>We concede that in order to enable the planning appeal machinery to proceed efficiently the board should have the right to withdraw an oral hearing or to forbid such a hearing to be held but in doing so the board must be satisfied that the reasons for seeking the oral hearing were ill-founded and vexatious.  I would go further and suggest that the board should give <Col N="771" /> their reasons in writing.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this matter.  I accept that the Minister had some heart-searching before he agreed to include this because of the denial of a right which had existed under the old Act to the ordinary citizens.  The section in my view diminishes public respect, to a certain extent, for the Bill and for planning. Both sides of the House agree that the board is more desirable than having an individual political figure making these decisions but we must be conscious, in deciding on balance in favour of this board, that there is the danger that we are dealing with a body which will not be answerable directly to this House as the Minister was.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong in this provided we can put in adequate safeguards to ensure that they are obliged to provide relevant information on some major decisions which they will be making.  I consider that denying a person the right to an oral hearing can be a major decision in certain cases.  I would put the restriction on the board which the amendment suggests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point in Deputy Molloy's amendment.  One thing I found in the Custom House was that people required, as far as possible, a reasonably quick decision. This may not be possible where major issues are involved.  It is amazing all the people who had the idea that an oral hearing was what they required for the erection of a single house, the carrying out of repairs to a house or the reconstruction of a dwelling but these people soon realised that requesting such a hearing resulted in great delay in obtaining a decision on their application.  The time it takes to deal with oral hearings has improved but the number of oral hearings has increased enormously.  In 1968-69 there were 1,886 of which 297 or 15.70 per cent were requests for oral hearings. From April to September, 1973-74 the number had gone up to 4,050 of which 776 were requests for oral hearings which amounts to 19.2 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Oral hearings take much longer.  The <Col N="772" /> position is that while in 1970-71 the average for written cases was 36.9 weeks the average for oral hearings was 48.2 weeks.  This has improved somewhat because in 1973-74 written cases took 28 weeks while oral hearings took 33.7 weeks.  The time it takes to deal with oral hearings, some of them relating to small matters, is far too great.  We must also take into consideration the amount of time taken by staff who deal with such hearings. Unless we are prepared to give a sizeable increase in the number of staff employed on planning if the pattern as it is now continues it will not be possible to give everybody who wants an oral hearing such a hearing unless he is prepared to wait a long time.</P>
    <P>Many people have told me that they would rather get a decision in three or four months, even if was a refusal, rather than have to wait for up to nine months.  Some cases which involve millions of pounds take up an inordinate amount of time at oral hearings and I accept that oral hearings for these are still necessary.  In my view there is no injustice to people, who are allowed to make a very elaborate case if they wish to in writing for or against a project, in preventing them from having an oral hearing if it is not possible to permit them such a hearing.</P>
    <P>I believe that the board should have this right while Deputy Molloy says that unless it is a vexatious appeal they should not have the right.  I have not been convinced that I have taken the wrong line.  The decision was not taken without a lot of heart-searching. There is a lot in the right of people to be sufficiently heard but I believe they are being sufficiently heard under the terms of this Bill.  I would rather have it in this way than reach a situation where the board would come back to the Government and say that they could not find time for all the oral hearings within a reasonable time. Then we would have to substantially increase the staff and return to this House and inform Members that the Planning Act was not operating as it was hoped it would.</P>
    <P>These are fluid ideas.  I am not copper-fastened on any particular idea <Col N="773" /> like this but I want to ensure that we have a Bill that will work.  My best advice and my own inclination is that this is the way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be suggesting that the board should have the right to refuse an oral hearing in an arbitrary way without having to justify their decision.  The amendment I have put down is reasonable and I ask the Minister to consider accepting it.  Where the board is of opinion that a request for an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the board is ill-founded or vexations but not otherwise the board may refuse such oral hearing.  The right to appeal is a property right defended in the Constitution.  The right to give oral evidence on an appeal is a very important constitutional right of any citizen of this State.  It is most unsatisfactory to deny citizens that right without stating the reasons or the grounds for so doing and it must be opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  I would ask the Minister if he intends putting this to a vote because we shall have to vote on it.  There is a great principle at stake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a constitutional principle.  The Constitution is not involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The property rights of each citizen are protected under the Constitution and the right to appeal can be deemed to be a property right. The Minister is restricting greatly the appeal procedure of any citizen if he allows a board, who are not answerable to the Parliament of the country, to make a decision which will restrict and curtail the form which that appeal takes.  We would go a lot of the way with the Minister if he would protect the citizens by ensuring that this power was exercised only where it was deemed that the request was a vexations one or was ill-founded.  That is simple, clear-cut and reasonable. I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decisions.  In fact, I am not sure whether or not he has finally made a decision on this as yet.</P>

      <P>As I told Deputy <Col N="774" /> Molloy, I have put proposals to the House.  I believe that a Bill like this should be debated in the House so that we have the best views of everybody incorporated in it but it is not correct to say that there is a constitutional right to an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said that the property rights of each citizen are protected under the Constitution and the right to appeal is the property right of each citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  Each citizen has the right to appeal but it does not say that each citizen has the right to appeal and have an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said the form of the appeal is now being restricted by the Minister's amendment of the original Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy did suggest there was a constitutional right to an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think so. I said there was a constitutional right to appeal and the Minister's amendment of the original Act will restrict that right of appeal; the form that it takes, will limit it to written, formal submissions and citizens' rights hitherto of presenting their cases orally will be withdrawn if the Minister's proposal stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Molloy is slightly mis-stating the fact.  There is a constitutional right to protection of property and this is safeguarded by the right to appeal in this case. Both of us are agreed on that.  Where we differ is that Deputy Molloy says that the board should not have the right to refuse an oral hearing except where they consider it to be vexatious. Again, the property right comes along because, if it is applied in one instance, it would apply in all.  Therefore, as far as the question of refusing an oral hearing is concerned, Deputy Molloy agrees with me that in certain circumstances, the board should have that right&mdash;the right to refuse an oral hearing in a vexatious case.  What I am suggesting, in addition, is that in relatively minor cases, oral hearings are being asked for very <Col N="775" /> often because of the fact that the people who ask for them do not seem to understand that they do not improve their position but, perhaps, delay the matter further.  What I am saying to Deputy Molloy is that the right of the individual is protected fully by giving him the right of appeal.  I am saying that it will improve his chance of having a reasonably early decision by having an ordinary written appeal rather than an oral hearing.</P>
      <P>Again, I am always a little puzzled when I hear reference to a board which is not answerable to this House because this is what we have all been clamouring for for the past three to five years.  We have been looking for a board which would not be answerable to this House.  Now that we are putting it on the Statute Book that such a board should be set up it is suggested at the same time that having almost achieved that, there should be some particular brand on it, that it should be answerable to the House and that if it was so answerable we would trust it a lot more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I was making there was that because it is a board not answerable to the House, there is need for greater safeguards in the legislation controlling it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>At present we have all the safeguards of a board answerable to the House which provides for the rights of people who are not satisfied with that particular attitude to planning. However, let us not get away from it.  What we are doing is attempting to introduce a board which will deal with this idea.  The written procedure does, in fact, protect fully natural justice.  There is no question about that.  I am afraid the suggestion that there should be a board which should deal objectively with cases, that there should be an oral hearing is again suggesting that there is something peculiar about it.  It must be an oral hearing.  It must be seen that the board is, in fact, meting out justice.  We have already agreed that the chairman of the board will be either a High Court judge or a former High Court judge so he will <Col N="776" /> be somebody eminent in that field.  I suppose such people can make mistakes like the rest of us.  But we are setting up a board which will, as far as possible, do a good job.  I would not be as doubtful about it as Deputy Molloy appears to be.  While Deputy Molloy has come a long way towards us by saying vexatious appeals, if it is decided by the board, are not entitled to an oral hearing, I would ask him to let it go further and say that if, in the view of the board, an oral hearing is not necessary then an oral hearing is cannot be insisted upon.  Let me come back to my original argument.  My main reason for putting it in is that I believe that if we do not we will be unduly delaying the work of the appeals board.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister not see, even in his own words there, that this would be done only where there were minor appeals, where there was not any important question at issue, that the board in such circumstances would decide not to grant an oral hearing as that would be unnecessarily cluttering up the appeals system and delaying decision-making?</P>

      <P>As the Bill the Minister has brought forward is worded, there is no guarantee that the board will exercise this power only in minor or unimportant cases.  There is no guarantee that the board will exercise that power only for good and just <Col N="777" /> reasons.  They can use it in an arbitrary fashion in any case that comes before them.  I think that is too sweeping a power, that it does infringe on the rights of citizens, that one group should have a right to decide differently between equal groups of persons, without stating the reasons and without being confined, in the legislation, to having to consider any particular reason for refusal.  They can merely make a decision: &ldquo;We are not allowing an oral hearing in this case.  That is our decision&rdquo; and they have every right to do it under the Bill, if it is passed, amending the 1963 Act with which we are now dealing.  I think that is too broad.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider it and to limit the exercise of that power to certain cases where it could be easily identified that the appeals were in fact minor, ill-founded or vexatious.  In doing so one could not deem that the exercise of this power by the board would in any way infringe property or constitutional rights.  The case is an obvious one and I do not wish to continue labouring the same points but if the Minister wishes I shall elaborate further.  Briefly, what I am asking the Minister to do is to limit the exercise of this power to certain cases which could be identified as being ill-founded or vexatious. The inclusion of those words would leave all of us happier with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the board will consist of reasonable people will take decisions.  Therefore, is it too much to expect reasonable boards to decide whether certain appeals can be dealt with justly by way of written submission rather than by oral hearing?  We are to trust the board to decide on appeals but, according to the Deputy's amendment, we are not to trust them to decide whether appeals are vexatious. I would trust them to do that.  We expect to appoint a board of the right type of people and, consequently, that trust should be placed in them.  I am not disagreeing with the general sentiments expressed by Deputy Molloy but I am endeavouring <Col N="778" /> to see the common ground between us.  I am prepared to agree that the board, having been given a good deal of trust, could be trusted to decide whether an appeal should be heard orally or whether it could be dealt with adequately otherwise but it seems to be Deputy Molloy's opinion that they should not be trusted that far.  If I am misinterpreting the Deputy, perhaps he will correct me. In my opinion the wording, as it is, is adequate.  However, if it is the Deputy's opinion that it should be tightened up in any way I shall consider that.  Either we give to the board absolute discretion on the question of oral hearings or, else, we must spell out the areas in which we think they should have discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>Having had some experience as Minister for Local Government I know that the staff in the planning section of the Department would be very happy if there were a discontinuance of oral hearings on planning appeals because this would mean much less work.  An oral hearing requires a great deal more preparation beforehand than would be the case in respect of written submissions and it also necessitates a lot of work afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this right is to be given to the board solely for the purpose of cutting down on the number of oral hearings, we are doing a disservice to the people because they should be entitled to present their case orally when they would be confronted by the other side so that the case could be argued openly with a representative of the board acting as chairman and recording the views of both sides.  I have had experience of several cases of persons who did not request oral hearings because they were not aware of the availability of that right and there were others who thought they would be dealt with fairly without having recourse to an oral hearing but who complained afterwards that the inspector from the <Col N="779" /> Department who visited the site in question made no attempt to contact the applicant or to hear his views.</P>
    <P>If we allow this matter of oral hearings to be pushed aside, the board might say that there are too many requests for oral hearings coming forward and that they would discontinue granting oral hearings for, say, six months.  They would not have to justify their decision and could go ahead and clear up the backlog of applications with the attitude that all the people want are decisions.  We should not allow that sort of situation to develop. I must take a rather extreme view in speaking of the dangers involved although I may be accused of exaggerating but I have had many complaints from people to the effect that they did not have an opportunity of making their views known to the persons who were to write a report for the Minister.  If we were to give to the board the right to decide on the question of oral hearings a person with a grievance such as I have outlined would have to redress if the board decided against an oral hearing.  While it might be the opinion of the board that in some cases oral hearings were not justified, that might not be the opinion of the person making the application. The worst situation that I can foresee is that the board may reach a decision to cover a certain period of time in order to allow them decide one way or another on the planning appeals in the Department.</P>
    <P>My amendment asks that the board be given this power only where the request is deemed to be ill-founded or vexatious.  The word &ldquo;vexatious&rdquo; was used by the Minister in amendment No. 35 which reads:</P>
    <P>In page 8, between lines 40 and 41, to add to the section the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) In case the Board in determining an appeal is of opinion that the appeal is vexatious, the Board may direct that the deposit lodged in relation to the appeal shall be forfeited to the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is an instance where the Minister agrees that the board are competent <Col N="780" /> to decide when an appeal is vexatious and in such cases we have agreed that the board would have the right to forfeit the deposit of £10.  We could argue both sides of the case at length but I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the form in which it is here or that he will give me some reasonable assurance that he will place some limitation on the board's right to exercise this very wide-sweeping power which he wishes to give them under section 40.</P>

      <P>Some people are very &ldquo;flahoolach&rdquo; with the nation's money. I do not know how many appeals Deputy Molloy looked at, although his Parliamentary Secretary was responsible for them as is my Parliamentary Secretary.  It is interesting to find out about the case being made.  A man could complain that somebody came to his site in the middle of the night and then did not give the correct report to the Minister, but that would not be quite correct.  The appellant is entitled to make a number of very full statements on appeal.  When looking at these appeals I was amazed to find that many of these people may not have been very highly educated but they were able to state the facts <Col N="781" /> of the case better than some people who took silk.  You would be amazed if somebody has an interest in something and wants to make a case how well he can do it.  Good luck to these people.  That is their right.  They are entitled to give evidence.  Often people have prepared wonderful words of wisdom but when they go in to appeal they get tongue-tied.  After appealing people have often come to me, maybe 12 months later, and said they regretted that they had not made an ordinary appeal.  I believe that most of the people who appeal make a very good case.</P>
      <P>I do not want to see the time of the appeal board wasted.  A lot of the time of planning authorities is spent on oral hearings when they should be doing something else.  It is not a question of putting those who are appealing and those who are objecting on opposite sides of a table and having somebody referee while they slag each other.  They make statements and, while it is on record that on occasion they have been allowed to ask relevant questions, in the normal course of events those appealing state the facts as they see them, those opposing state the facts as they see them, and from that a report is made.</P>
      <P>It is not a case of question and answer.  Deputy Molloy suggested it was like the Labour Court where the two sides meet and argue, and both sides are allowed cross-question each other and the court acts as a referee. This is not so.  I cannot see what else we can do.  This way the board can see the people who are appealing and objecting.  There might be something in that.  I am not tied down to the wording of the section.  I want the best possible wording when it becomes law.  While I felt that the section as worded:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have an absolute discretion to both an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>was adequate, I would be prepared to see if there was some way we could decide that certain applications for oral hearings should not be refused or, to put it the other way round, <Col N="782" /> that only minor or not so important requests for oral hearings might be disallowed.  I would be prepared to have another look at it because I am not satisfied.  I am not trying to claim that the fountain of all wisdom is here and therefore what we say must be exactly as it will be.  That is what discussion in this House is for.</P>
    <P>I can see some of the points made by Deputy Molloy but I cannot agree with him on a number of them.  If he would agree to let it go at that I will see what I can do.  There might be an argument in favour of ensuring that only certain appeals can be refused apart from those being put down as frivolous.  We have had experience of applications for oral hearings and from people who had appealed against sizeable housing schemes&mdash;and this is where difficulty would arise, as Deputy Molloy asked what size of appeal&mdash;and then did not even turn up at the oral hearings. I would be very careful about the wording of this section so that people who do this sort of thing will not get away with it even once.  I have had experience of people who have done this four or five times.  There was nothing in the 1963 Act which prevented them from doing that.</P>

      <P>Section 33 reads:</P>
      <P>(a) the substitution in paragraph (a) of section 82 (2) of &ldquo;appeal to the Minister, or in relation to an oral hearing held pursuant to section 76 of this Act, as amended by section 34 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1974,&rdquo; for &ldquo;reference or appeal&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>(b) the insertion in paragraph (a) of section 82 (3) of &ldquo;or the Board, whichever is the person by whom the reference or appeal falls to be determined,&rdquo; after &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;;</P>
      <P>This will deal adequately with the matter to which Deputy Molloy is referring.  Earlier we were talking about appeals and decisions under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  When a person appeals to a Minister against a decision on a claim the matter is referred to an appeals officer.  If he is of the opinion that the case is of such a nature that it can be properly determined without an oral hearing, the hearing can be dispensed with and a decision can be made summarily.  This means that already there is an explanation which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  That may suit the application of social welfare legislation but even social welfare officer's powers are qualified.  This is quite open to be used in an arbitrary way.  No reasons and no justification have to be given by this board as to why they are witholding the right to an oral hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think that may suit in the case of social welfare.  It would not satisfy me in relation to planning.  I believe this is a device inserted by the Department of Local Government to try to cut down on the number of oral hearings and <Col N="784" /> planning appeals.  There is no other good reason for it and it is infringing basic human rights.  Article 40.1 of the Constitution provides:</P>
      <P>All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.1 provides:</P>
      <P>The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal right of the citizen.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.2 provides:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
      <P>I have been advised by those whom I have consulted in the legal field that the right to appeal is a property right. In my view this section which enables the board to discriminate as between one citizen and another brings about a situation where citizens may be held unequal before the law in respect of their property rights which the State in the Constitution binds itself to vindicate.</P>
      <P>We feel strongly about this amendment and if the Minister cannot see his way to accept it we will have to push it to a vote.</P>

      <P>The alternative to this is that a person should have the right to go to court.  I do not know whether there is such a right but even if there is it would be very expensive, especially if the case were against a wealthy person who might afterwards take it to a higher court.  This is the ordinary man's form of legal appeal. It existed under the 1963 Act and it is a mistake to take away this right. It is very useful and it is not expensive. The aggrieved person may, if he wishes, bring his solicitor or such other qualified person along but he does not have to employ a solicitor.  The Minister is now taking away a right from the ordinary person.  I object strenuously to what the Minister is doing.  I agree, having had the experience of dealing with planning appeals over almost <Col N="785" /> three years, that mischievous and frustrating oral hearings are requested. It can be a delaying tactic.  However, it would not be right to remedy one wrong by taking away the right of all and sundry to an oral hearing.  It comes very badly from a Labour Minister for Local Government to take away this right of the ordinary person.</P>

      <P>Looking at it again would not satisfy the Fianna Fáil Party.  We accepted that on the last one and on others but here there is <Col N="786" /> a very big principle at stake.  We must take a stand on it.  We cannot accept the Minister's offer to consider it and that he might bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  That would not be satisfactory where there is a matter of great principle involved.  This is one of our strongest objections to this Bill.  We all agree basically on the establishment of the board.  What we are dealing with is the mechanics of how the board will operate.  This is giving the board powers which the Minister did not have under the 1963 Act.  We, as an Opposition, must be very vigilant and must examine carefully the reason behind a change such as this.  The board is being given much greater powers than the Minister has at present under the 1963 Act, powers which we think seriously interfere with the rights of ordinary citizens.  If a person decides that he wishes to present his case orally in the machinery already established for that purpose under the 1963 Act and carried out by officials of the Department, if the citizen wants to avail of that machinery with the board replacing the Minister, that right should be continued and he should not be denied it.  We can quote instances to show how important it is that the right be available.</P>
      <P>The Minister said this right will only be exercised by the board where a minor appeal is coming up and where it is not very important.  The attitude is to get rid of it quickly by refusing to have an oral hearing because it might add a few days to the length of time the appeal is awaiting decision in the Department.  This is not a good, sound reason for granting this power to the board.</P>
      <P>The real reason has come out quite clearly in the Minister's words, that the only purpose of this section is to cut down drastically on the number of oral hearings of planning appeals in the Department.  If that is the only reason we consider it an arbitrary reason and one that cannot be justified. If the board are to be given any power of this nature, they must have terms and conditions laid down within which they can operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are suggesting that a fair and <Col N="787" /> reasonable condition is to require that this power can only be exercised by the board where, in their opinion, the granting of an oral hearing would be given for vexatious or ill-founded reasons.  The Minister has already conceded in the terms of his amendment No. 35 that the board are competent to decide what is vexatious.  There is a meeting of minds and words between the Minister and our party on that, but we object very strongly to withdrawing the right of any citizen to an oral hearing where he can show good and just cause for the right to present his case orally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might take the example of a large industrial concern, for instance, an oil refinery or some other type of refinery about which there are divided local opinions, where the majority of the people in the area concerned are absolutely against such a development. If the local authority grant permission the decision on appeal rests with the board.  The people in that area will be very unhappy if a decision on a matter that will affect their lives in the future is taken behind closed doors because they cannot make their views known apart from correspondence on the matter.</P>
      <P>In this age of civil and human rights it is crazy for a Minister to attempt to put back the clock.  A right has existed since 1963, one that gave individuals the right to attend a hearing with their advisers, irrespective of how poor the people concerned might be.  It is bad to deprive an individual of that right but it is worse to deprive a community who, collectively, want to put their case, perhaps through a legal representative or architect, by way of deputation, or by people who voluntarily back up what the group are trying to do and who offer their services to the group.  The abolition of the right of people to request an oral hearing, to get it and to be heard, is a retrograde step.  It is a change in the existing law and it is one to which our party cannot and will not agree.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <P>I am surprised the Minister has inserted this section.  I <Col N="788" /> think the Minister knows my views on planning matters.  He is giving to faceless men power he has not got himself.  He is responsible to the people and if he does anything wrong he will have to account to the people in Meath.  However, the board will not have to account to anyone.  They are being given power that will allow them to make, behind closed doors, decisions that affect ordinary people throughout the country.</P>
      <P>When I became interested in planning matters I found that local engineers would visit an area precisely when the people concerned were not there to meet them.  Our only hope was to go to the Minister and to ask for an oral hearing; in fact, I have gone to the Minister and to his predessor on occasions.  When the application for an oral hearing was granted the people concerned could explain if alterations were to be carried out.  In Galway we are making it a requirement that the local engineers meet the people.  Human beings are entitled to be consulted.  It is a retrograde step to abolish oral hearing and, on principle, I could not agree to it.  I am not the Opposition spokesman but I will be obliged to force this matter to a vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must apologise to the House because I had to leave to attend a committee meeting.  I am glad I got back in time to discuss this section because it is a crucial one. When I read the Bill first I was conscious of the fact that a great deal of our debate would centre on this provision. I am in full agreement with my colleagues who have spoken in their attempt to persuade the Minister to abandon this proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister will see from the Order Paper that my proposal was to delete section 14 and that would have meant that the board would have no authority in any circumstances to refuse an oral hearing; in other words, the present situation would continue. I have been persuaded that perhaps some in-between situation might be better, that some medium position would be preferable.  On the face of it the suggestion of Deputy Molloy is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> None of us wants vexatious oral hearings.  They could nullify the whole effectiveness of our planning regime and the machinery could be fouled up by an excessive number of vexatious requests for oral hearings.  I think all of us would agree that the Minister and his advisers are right in directing attention to the situation with regard to oral hearings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan has said very clearly what I was going to say, namely, that whatever about the Minister as an elected representative and a Member of this House and subject to questioning by us here&mdash; perhaps unlike the Minister for Education&mdash;having the right to decide whether there should be an oral hearing, we are totally against letting a board who are not answerable to this House in their absolute discretion decide not to have an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the Minister that very shortly after this piece of legislation was published I was speaking to a very eminent lawyer.  The one thing he said to me about this legislation was: &ldquo;Oppose section 14&rdquo;. He gave me that advice on the basis of his experience and his understanding of the judicial and legal process. He felt it would be a very retrograde step to abolish this right of the aggrieved party in a planning matter to have an oral hearing.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that there is some discrepancy in his approach in this regard because in the Motorways Bill he very rightly and very sensibly provided where it is proposed to put a motorway through a particular area or region there would be a public hearing before the matter could be proceeded with.  All those people affected by the motorway would have the right to come to that public hearing and go fully into every aspect of the proposal, put forward their objection and cross-examine the various experts involved.  The Minister was right in his approach in that regard.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why he is going in the opposite direction here.  I am particularly strengthened in my dislike for this section by the fact that <Col N="790" /> involved is a board which is not answerable to us in any way.  I agree that, perhaps, there is a need for some provision in regard to ill-founded or vexatious requests for oral hearings. It is important that we should have some safeguard against that type of situation.  Deputy Molloy's amendment is one formula and I think it is a reasonable one.  The right to an oral hearing would not be absolute.  It would be tempered by the provision that the board could reject ill-founded or vexatious requests.  It is going very far to leave it to the board's absolute discretion.</P>
    <P>I do not know if some other solution to the problem could be found along the lines of the board being able to refuse a request for an oral hearing by applying to the Minister for permission to refuse it or some such safeguard built into section 14.  I say all that on the basis that my original approach, from the point of view of the ordinary citizen, was to give him an absolute right to an oral hearing and delete section 14 altogether.  I am permitting myself to be persuaded because of the danger of the machinery for planning being nullified through vexatious and ill-founded requests for oral hearings to have some restriction on the right for an oral hearing but certainly I am not prepared&mdash;I agree fully with my colleagues who have spoken in this regard &mdash;in any circumstances to give this new board absolute discretion in refusing this very important fundamental civil right to the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might have a look at this between now and the time the question is put to the House.  Deputy Callanan and Deputy Haughey referred to the faceless men. The Minister must remember it is always the big fellow who does not want the oral hearing.  The small person who is affected by a planning application will go to the oral hearing. A recent example of this was where the Minister gave an oral hearing and the developer at the last minute made a very reasonable offer to the residents opposing the matter.  If there was no oral hearing that would not have happened. As Deputy Haughey puts it, <Col N="791" /> the citizen should have the right to go to the highest tribunal with his appeal.  I agree you get vexatious appeals.  You get people who are vindictive but the common good demands that the greatest access to the council of decision must be given.  I fully support Deputy Molloy's amendment and also what Deputy Haughey said. I believe most Members of the House will see the reason behind their opposition to this section.  I hope the Minister will see it before the question is put to the House.</P>

If that is the way the party opposite want it, then they are right to challenge a vote and I certainly will not stand in their way between now and 6 o'clock if they want to do it or after that.  I am sorry everybody was not here.  I can understand they have reasons for being elsewhere but Deputy Molloy and I have been discussing this.  I suggested to him that possibly we could find some other form of words which would limit the type of case on which an oral hearing could be refused. I have great respect for legal luminaries, particularly when they go around handing out free advice. Usually outside the courts they are able to give excellent advice on some things but maybe if we were inside they might not be so anxious to give the advice.</P>
      <P>The situation as I see it is that at the present time, as I stated earlier, we have an increasing number of people looking for oral hearings. There are over 19 per cent looking for them.  It is also not correct to say that there is any question of natural justice.</P>

I am as anxious as he is, and, perhaps, more so, to protect the right of the individual.  The situation is that I have been asking the House to agree to the proposal which I put into the Bill, that we should give the authority to the board to restrict the number of oral hearings.  A number of Deputies have got up here and used certain phrases.  Deputy Moore used the expression, which all of us from time to time use when we want to hit at somebody that we do not like, when he referred to the board as &ldquo;faceless men.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I give the Deputy credit for having used it.  If the Deputy has the copyright for it, Deputy Moore may pay him damages.  Inside and outside this House there was a request for <Col N="793" /> a board to deal with this matter.  For goodness sake, let us get away from the idea that now, when we are having a board appointed to do the job, we are now saying: &ldquo;Maybe it was not the right thing.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of the Deputies over there appear to be trying to have it both ways.  All I am saying is that the phraseology used in my section: &ldquo;The Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board&rdquo; was put in there for the purpose of allowing them to decide. Deputy Molloy came a good way with me because he says: &ldquo;Where the Board is of opinion that a request for an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board is ill-founded or vexatious, but not otherwise, the board may refuse such oral hearing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Later during the discussion&mdash;again if I am misstating what the Deputy said, perhaps, he will correct me&mdash; he was prepared to go along with me to the extent that even other types of not so important appeals might also be dealt with by the board.  This is where the phraseology of the section comes in, whether or not we should use this or I should, as I suggested, have a look at it and see if we could phrase it in such a way that it would do in the main what this House wants it to do.  Immediately I was threatened with a vote, for which I am ready, as I will be, until the Bill finally goes through, at the end of every section.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I am again making the offer: I am prepared to consider whether we can tighten it up so that it would not give absolute powers, although, in reference to the legal luminary&mdash;again Deputy Haughey referred to the person who gave him the advice&mdash;it will be a High Court judge or an ex-High Court judge who will be in charge of the board and he will have recourse to his previous experience in the courts.  I do not think anybody on the board will do something just for the purpose of doing away with a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is true that the 1963 Act <Col N="794" /> guaranteed the right of an oral hearing on request, the previous planning Act of 1934 did not give any right whatever, and there were no cases about taking away the right of the individual or a breach of the Constitution or anything else.  There is no breach of the Constitution involved in this.  I am prepared to listen to what Deputies have to say and if I think the section can be improved I will do so, or if the Fianna Fáil Party want it to go to a vote I am prepared to allow it to go now.</P>

      <P>There are two matters I want to raise.  One is irrelevant to what is under discussion but relevant to the general discussion.  I shall deal with the first point first.  As spokesman here for Local Government I am in a little difficulty with the numberings of the various amendments that have been put in.  I will accept the answer that if I had kept each one and filed it exactly as I got it and changed the numbers I would have an exact replica of the Bill and the amendments circulated from time to time.  There have been sheets of amendments circulated at different stages.  Today I visited the Dáil General Office and asked for an up-to-date copy of the amendments that had not been dealt with yet.  I was given this document here for which I am very grateful to the officials, but the Minister has already mentioned an amendment which I cannot find in my papers and which was not included in the full list of amendments which the Dáil office gave me.  I am not criticising the officials.  I did not give them much time; I just went in there about 4 o'clock.  I would ask the Minister if he would ask the Dáil office to circulate an up-to-date version of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just crazy.  I have failed to find section 33 (a) to which the Minister referred when he was making a reply to me, when I questioned him on section 82, subsection (2) (a) of the 1963 Act.  That is the first point, which I am glad the Minister has taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> The second point brings us back to the amendment before the House. Strange as it may seem, the Minister circulated an explanatory memorandum when the Bill was published and the explanation given in that memorandum for section 14 of the Bill is a better explanation of my amendment to section 14, which would involve the deletion of the section, than it is of the Minister's section 14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy drew up the amendment afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If what is in the Minister's explanation is what he intended by section 14, then I submit that the amendment I have down meets the case the Minister himself was making in his explanatory memorandum. I would further submit that section 14 in the Bill does not meet the case made by the Minister in explaining section 14.  I want to write the explanation of section 14 on to the record of this House.  Before doing so I wish to read section 14 as it is written in the Bill:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board.</P>
      <P>The definition given by the Minister, and circulated in the explanatory memorandum, to section 14 was as follows:</P>
      <P>This section gives the Board absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal. This will help the Board to deal expeditiously with cases, particularly&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Particularly.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where an appeal appeared to be ill-founded or vexatious (see also note on section 16 below).  The Act of 1963 required the Minister to accede to the request of any party to an appeal for an oral hearing and it seems clear that the provision was being abused in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> Any person reading that would logically come to the conclusion that what the Minister intended by section 14 was to deal with abuses and to deal with ill-founded and vexatious requests for oral hearings.  But as he has worded the section it is broad and gives sweeping powers, and is not restricted to cases of abuse, ill-founded or vexatious or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Our amendment clearly limits it to the purpose for which the Minister states the section was being inserted. The only justification for the section is to limit abuse, to deal with abuse and with those persons who were using the right to ask for an oral hearing as an instrument to delay development and as an instrument in certain cases of spite towards their neighbours, knowing they could delay the matter further by requesting an oral hearing.  This may have been the case, and if that is so, then certainly the House would agree to deal very effectively with persons who would abuse the appeal rights under the 1963 Act in such a way.</P>
    <P>However, in trying to catch those few cases the Minister has decided to give this new planning board sweeping powers, and he has let the cat out of the bag in the course of the discussion here this evening.  The real purpose of the Minister inserting this is to cut down dramatically on the number of oral hearings or planning applications. That is being done to convenience the planning staff who are dealing with planning matters in the Department. It is to remove the obstacle and urgency of oral hearings and the bother that places on officials.  Whatever inconvenience and difficulties are experienced by officials because of oral hearings, it is something which will have to be tolerated in order to preserve the right of each citizen to have his case heard openly and orally as heretofore.  I am fully conscious of the abuse that can occur under this section. I am perfectly well aware of the arbitrary fashion in which appeals will be decided.  They can be issued without very much consideration and no explanations have to be given in any great detail for the decisions.  The sole <Col N="797" /> reason approval is being sought for this is because it is argued decisions will issue expeditiously.  If decisions are not seen to be fair and if they are not given in an open fashion it is not proper that the House should be asked to agree to this format.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Fota Island Acquisition: Motion (resumed)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that moneys should be provided out of public funds towards the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the public.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy J. Lynch).</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to stress at the outset that I shall follow the same line as that followed by the Leader of our party last night in debating this very important matter.  Like him, I shall resolutely eschew any political argument.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to understand why the Government and the Minister for Finance will not avail of the opportunity to acquire the Fota estate.  Only once in a lifetime does an opportunity like this occur.  I want to quote now a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance last night.  Unfortunately the Official Report is not available and I hope I shall quote him correctly.  He said Fota was well down the list of Government priorities.</P>
      <P>It was laudable but selfish of Cork interests to have the Fota estate preserved for its own people but it could not be considered as a national park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the note I made.  As one who headed a number of deputations to the Minister I want to make it clear that at no time did we place emphasis on <Col N="798" /> Fota Island being used as a purely local amenity.  We assured the Minister we wanted the estate used as a national park.  We pointed out that visitors came to Fota from all over the world.</P>
    <P>Last night the Parliamentary Secretary tried to define what is meant by a national park.  He referred to education; the park must be of educational interest.  Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary was not aware that scouts and girl guides from all over the world used the Fota estate for camping holidays during the summer months. Surely that is an educational exercise for these young people.</P>
    <P>It would be as well at this stage to recapitulate the efforts made by the two local authorities concerned in trying to acquire this property.  I am glad the Minister is present and I trust he will bear me out in what I say now. On the first deputation to the Minister asking him and the Government to acquire this property we were told that public moneys could not be spent on local amenities.  Surely a demand from 250,000 people that this property be acquired as a public amenity is a demand to which the Minister should lend a sympathetic ear.</P>
    <P>On the second deputation we were informed by the Minister that he was somewhat disappointed that we had not brought with us a plan showing how best acquisition could be shared between the Government and the two local authorities.  We assured the Minister we would return with a plan, and so we did.  After long discussions with various interested bodies, including the farming community in the area, An Taisce, and so on, we returned and assured the Minister we would share the financial involvement of acquiring the property and would then give the property as a gift to the nation.  The Minister refused this offer.  I am sure the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have been in Cork and seen this property.  It is a local amenity and surely the people of Cork are entitled to this amenity.  The situation is ideal. It is no more than six miles from the city.  It is served by rail.  Deputy Lynch reminds me that the station is actually sited on the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision.  It is a last minute appeal.  We have offered £250,000.  That has not been accepted. There are three other interested parties, one of whom is from outside the State. I should hate to be part of the present Government if I were the cause of or lent any hand to anybody outside the State acquiring this beautiful property. I do not know where the two local authorities could go from here.  We have done everything possible as a local authority.  We must be cautious and avoid any further infliction on the people where rates are concerned.</P>
      <P>I want to make a very strong appeal to the Minister that he should share the responsibility and show good will to the people of the city and county of Cork and the people of Ireland who are using this property as an amenity and a national park.  When the last deputation met the Parliamentary Secretary I said that if we acquired the property the responsibility to maintain it should be his. I also mentioned that thousands of pounds were not involved at this stage in the development of the property. That kind of money is not needed. Development could be carried out over the years.  I say without fear of contradiction that an investment of about £10,000 a year is as much as would be needed to develop the estate.</P>
      <P>Last night the Parliamentary Secretary placed great emphasis on industrial expansion in this area.  I should like to remind him that the planning authority are Cork County Council. Surely if that authority invest the sum of money I mentioned they will be very cautious about the kind of development that will take place in and around the Fota estate.  If the Government become financially involved in this, I have no doubt that they, too, will be cautious about the development of the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the people of Cork will accept this as an excuse to relieve the Government of their responsibility in this matter.  Even at this late stage I am prepared to go back to both local <Col N="800" /> authorities and ask them to increase their offer, on condition that the Minister and the Government will accept responsibility for the maintenance of the estate.  I want to ask the Minister why did he tell us, when he met the second last deputation, that we should go back to Cork and come back to him again with a plan.  Why has there been a change of mind?  Both authorities thanked the Minister for giving us a chance to return to the city and county and set up a joint committee and ask them to make some financial commitment so that we could come back to the Minister and present a reasonable case.  There was a change of mind.  I do not know why.</P>
    <P>We also know that when the property first became available the Minister put a stay order on it.  Why?  We are asking many questions because we, as a joint committee of both authorities, were encouraged by the Minister to devise a plan and commit ourselves financially to acquiring the property.  All members of both local authorities, irrespective of their political affiliations, support the plea I am making to the Minister this evening. Members of his own party suggested to us that we should offer the sum of £50,000.  We have been very brave. We have gone to £250,000.  It will be a shame for the Minister and the Government if this property falls into the hands of an interest outside this country, thus depriving the people of Ireland of this beautiful amenity in County Cork.</P>
    <P>Those who are contributing to this discussion this evening represent over 250,000 people in asking the Government to have a last minute change of heart and to help the two local authorities who are now committed to acquiring this property.  Their offer is £250,000.  We have shown our hand. We have done what the Minister asked us to do.  Time is running out because a final decision must be made by the trustees of the property to dispose of it within the next fortnight.  Even at this late stage, as Lord Mayor of Cork &mdash;and I know I am joined by the other local authority, Cork County Council &mdash;I would ask him to play his part and to satisfy the desire of practically <Col N="801" /> every national organisation, not only the two local authorities, and over 250,000 people.  I plead with the Minister to involve himself now before it is too late.</P>

      <P>Further evidence of the insincerity of the promoters of the resolution is their conduct in this House in recent days and weeks when they voted against steps to collect revenue for the State.  Yet, having refused to approve necessary but understandably unpopular taxes to collect revenue of over £60 million for essential purposes, they now have the temerity to suggest the expenditure of money that they would not vote on a less than essential purpose.</P>
      <P>Again, their insincerity can be tested by their continuing opposition, as voiced in the budget debate, to the State's foreign borrowing requirements next year of £250 million to run essential services and meet essential capital requirements to maintain employment, to promote new employment, to build houses and so on.  Having criticised us, and continuing to criticise us for essential borrowing for vital purposes, they consider it more important to spend public money which would have to be borrowed abroad for this local amenity.  They criticise the Government for the size of the current deficit and yet they are demanding that the Government should not only acquire the property or join in the purchase arrangement but that the State should thereafter maintain the property thereby increasing the cost of running the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is of the greatest interest is the change of tactics on the part of the sponsors of this resolution and some of their colleagues who came on deputations to me about the matter.  The first proposal was that the State would buy and hand over the property to the local authorities in question to maintain. But obviously on receipt of very good advice as to the cost of maintaining the property, the tremendous risk involved to the arboretum by reason of the proximity to industry, advice on the condition of the house and the cost of its future maintenance, they ask, not that the State should buy it but that the State would maintain <Col N="803" /> it.  It seems to me that they have had very good advice to convince them that ultimately the cost of maintenance would far exceed the cost of the original purchase.  As members of a local authority they did not want to spend local money on something that could not be preserved except at enormous cost.  They wanted to put the State in the very awkward position of having responsibility for the maintenance of an arboretum and other features there which, because of the danger of pollution, would be at very great risk so that the State and not the local politicians would be blamed if anything went wrong and the State and not the local politicians would be asked to bear the cost of correcting the extremely costly damage resulting from industrial pollution.</P>
    <P>I do not like having to speak in these highly critical terms but it would be less than fair to the public if I did not draw attention to these aspects of the matter.  I entirely refute the suggestion of Deputy Healy that I, at any time, gave anybody to understand that the State would expend money on this project, either to purchase or maintain it.  When I first had the pleasure of meeting a deputation of public representatives and officials on the matter on 5th June, 1974, the deputation emphasised&mdash;I quote here from a note of the proceedings of that meeting which was made on that day:</P>
    <P>The deputation wished Fota Island to be preserved for Cork city and county and preserved for the local people as an amenity.</P>
    <P>The emphasis then was on its desirability as a local amenity.  I do not blame anybody in Cork for wishing to have an amenity of that kind.  It is desirable that all urban areas particularly should have lungs of greenery and rural amenities.  It has always been accepted policy that such amenities should be purchased by local authorities for themselves and that the State should not be involved in the acquisition of a property which is essentially something of local value, and particularly where the property was required by a substantial number of people in an urban environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="804" /> Such State parklands as had been acquired&mdash;other than exceptions like the Phoenix Park, which was acquired for historical reasons and did not involve, as far as I am aware, the expenditure of any money by the State&mdash; were acquired for reasons different from Fota.  Such State lands as are in urban environments were gifts.  Where you have other State parks they are in areas with a very sparse local population and the acquisition of them has been undertaken to preserve substantial areas of spectacular beauty at very small cost for the benefit of the whole nation and for tourists in particular.  What is sought on this occasion is that State funds should for the first time ever be expended on the purchase of a local park for an urban area.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputies do not see the undesirability of that development.  It would be very difficult to justify a departure from the very well-established practice that local authorities buy and maintain their own parks.  If that line were to be broken in respect of Fota there could be no resistance to an application by any local authority in any part of Ireland that the State should acquire and maintain vast acreages of parks and stately homes and so on for the benefit of urban populations.  I am a believer in local democracy and like many other members I have had the privilege of serving for many years on a local authority and in that local authority I have pressed, as I know others have also, for more parks and more amenities in parks, but never in my wildest enthusiasm did I visualise that the burden of doing so should be paid by taxpayers outside the area of my own local authority.  That is the unreasonable request that is being made tonight.</P>

      <P>The motion requests that moneys be provided out of public funds towards the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the public.  Deputy Wyse was very fair. Having chastised me at the beginning, <Col N="805" /> when he said that no deputation had ever urged that it be preserved for Cork city and county, he slipped into that notion himself, because he said he thought it was very mean of the Minister not to make the money available for the acquisition of this amenity for the people of Cork.  They are the Deputy's words and the record can prove that.  I do not blame him for that view because, naturally, he has a loyalty to the people he represents.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also chastised me for not providing money for the acquisition of an amenity for the people of Cork and the record will so show.  If it does not I will withdraw my remarks, but, in my view, the Deputy simply revealed his innermost thoughts when he made that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards what happened at the first meeting I should like to emphasise that I made no commitment whatsoever.  I drew attention to the principle I have been enunciating, that national funds were not expended for the acquisition of local amenities.  It was pointed out by the deputation that the Land Commission could possibly have an involvement here because there were, and still are, quite a number of farmers on the Cobh peninsula anxious to acquire land on Fota for farming purposes. It was also indicated that the Office of Public Works had great experience in the field of management <Col N="806" /> of properties of this kind and it was also revealed at this meeting&mdash;this is of great importance&mdash;that University College, Cork, had possibly an interest in the matter.  It was quite clear on that occasion that there had not been consultations between Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and the college authorities.  I thought it was only reasonable that such consultations should take place.</P>
    <P>I urged these honourable people who came on the deputation&mdash;I have the greatest of respect for each person on that deputation and many of them are very close and dear friends of mine&mdash;that it would be a useful exercise if they discussed among themselves the best way of dealing with Fota Island for the future because it might be possible to compromise the interests of the college authorities, the corporation and the county council. This was certainly possible at that stage and I said that if suitable agreement was reached it might not be necessary for the deputation to come back to me because at least some of the people involved in that tripartite arrangement would have had resources available to them which would not require any involvement of State money.</P>
    <P>A long time transpired before there was any response from that particular meeting and I was asked to meet a delegation on the 25th July.  At that meeting I asked the delegation what progress had been made since our earlier meeting on 5th June.  Deputy Wyse, who was the principal spokesman for the group, told me that while Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, and others, were in full agreement that the property should be acquired, they had not yet had any consultations in regard to how the acquisition should take place.  They had decided to set up a committee of various interests to devise a plan. There we had a period of six weeks during which reasonably one might have thought there would have been a working group devising a plan to act in time but during which nothing was done.</P>
    <P>I expressed my disappointment that the people who were professing such <Col N="807" /> a great interest in the acquisition of Fota should not have taken any effective steps themselves towards setting up a group to study the machinery that would have to be put in motion to acquire the property.  I pointed out that it was putting me in an impossible position, as Minister for Finance, to be receiving a delegation who had no thoughts about what should be done other than the very simple one that the State ought to buy the property for the people of Cork.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Lands put a stop order on the land and that expired on 18th July last but there is a limit to the authority which the Minister for Lands has in putting stop orders on properties.</P>

    <P>On 26th November I again met the delegation and we further discussed the <Col N="808" /> matter.  I ought to have said, of course, that when I met the group in July I made it clear at that stage, in case there was doubt in anybody's mind, that the State could not see itself involved financially in this project.  But I said that if there were any services of any Departments of State or agencies which could assist the local authorities in the matter, in relation to advice and so on, that that would be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>In November, when again I had the privilege of meeting the deputation, together with the Minister for Lands, he &mdash;if the group had not known it earlier &mdash;at that time made the group aware of the unwillingness of the Land Commission to be involved in the acquisition. We had a plan before us then which was, as I pointed out earlier, quite different from the original proposals&mdash;it was a plan that the State should maintain the property, not that it should acquire it.  The Minister for Lands understood the problems of the farmers of the area who want to acquire land and accepted also that the local authority felt that they did not need all the land on the island, 780 acres, as a local amenity and that some of it could be usefully sold off to farmers. However, the local authority did not have the machinery necessary to recycle the land and they were wondering on that account whether the Land Commission would make their machinery available in order to have the land broken up and distributed amongst farmers in the area who required it. The Minister for Lands therefore undertook again to refer to the Land Commission for investigation and sympathetic consideration the possibility of acquiring the agricultural land in the estate for Land Commission purposes. To this date the Land Commission have not expressed their willingness to be involved in this matter.</P>
    <P>On that occasion also, in November, I confirmed that in the event of the property being acquired by the local authorities, which at that time was their intention, the Office of Public Works would be prepared to provide technical advice in the preparation of a policy for the management and maintenance of the estate.  I wrote to the county secretary on 22nd November <Col N="809" /> confirming what took place at the meeting and stating once again that it would not be appropriate for the State to accept financial responsibility for the maintenance of a property which was primarily a local amenity.</P>
    <P>We in Government have set out very clearly what we consider to be the priorities in these difficult times. Priorities require, if they are to be respected, that other matters be put aside and left in abeyance.  It may suit some people to shout in triumph that the resources are not there to do something which they desire.  I do not regard that as a disgraceful admission. Indeed &ldquo;admission&rdquo; suggests some feeling of guilt.  I do not feel it.  We have said again and again, in Government, over the last year or more that the resources available to the State were not sufficient to meet existing urgent needs, but that when those resources were limited we considered that the prime claim on them was the maintenance of employment and the preservation of existing standards and that observance of those priorities would involve the postponement of some projects which did not conform to those priorities.  This project of Fota happens to be one of those which is less essential than the priority of maintaining employment.  I do not think there is any Deputy opposite who would disagree with that.  If there is any Deputy opposite who disagrees with it I should like him to say so. As things stand at present if the priorities are to be respected and observed then we will have to spend every penny we have on the preservation of employment.</P>
    <P>At present, as Deputy Lynch pointed out, a number of bids have been made and apparently negotiations are going on, the vendors hoping, no doubt, for a higher price.  It seems to me that this is the most difficult and awkward of all times, therefore, for a debate of this kind, except that it allows me to say once again in public, to put beyond all doubt, that State money will not be involved in this enterprise.</P>
    <P>There are on offer to the State, and have been on many occasions in the past, other stately homes and beautiful <Col N="810" /> parklands containing many rare and precious plants.  In fact there has been a study made of the stately homes and parklands of the country.  Very few of those have ever been acquired by the State and, when the question of acquisition arose, it was usually on terms exceedingly favourable, either by way of a gift or at a cost which was merely a tiny fraction of the whole.  It so happens that Fota, beautiful place, as it is, does not come remotely near the top of the list of homes which have been considered worthy of acquisition. That is not a denigration of Fota; it is to say that if the State is to expend money on the acquisition of such places then the proper thing to do, surely, is to acquire those which have a much greater value both from the botanical and architectural points of view.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the steps the local authorities have already taken that they consider Fota a desirable possession for themselves.  I understood from some remarks made here yesterday that apparently the difference now in price between what the local authorities have offered and what the trustees may accept is comparatively small.  If that be so, I think it is up to those who see Fota as conferring immense advantage on them as having also an obligation now to make up whatever is that deficit.</P>

      <P>I agree with speakers from this side of the House in supporting the motion that money should be provided out of public funds for the acquisition of Fota Island so that its amenities can be preserved for the public.  I was sorry to learn that the Government consider Fota Island to be a very low priority.  I was sorry also to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say last evening that Fota could not be a national park and that it could be a local amenity only.  During the debate last evening the Parliamentary Secretary stated that the reason for acquiring Fota Island, as he saw it, or as he was told, was to provide a local amenity for the people of Cork city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The deputation said that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFrench1965" hpid="Mr. French Mr. French">
      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge that has not been said. This was not put forward as the reason for the State acquiring Fota on <Col N="812" /> the occasions on which the Minister met a number of delegations which included members of Cork Corporation and Cork County Council as well as members of other interested bodies. The joint committee was formed for the purpose of exploring every possibility of having the island acquired as a national amenity.  When the committee visited the estate they were taken on a conducted tour of it.  They met on a number of occasions during the past year and issued a report to their parent bodies.  This report was adopted both by Cork Corporation and Cork County Council.  The reason given in the report for acquiring the island is that the committee consider the essential objective to be the preservation of the island as a natural heritage to be enjoyed by the citizens of the city and county and of the nation as a whole.  This is the case which the delegations and the elected representatives put to the Minister for Finance at all times.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of 1973 when it became known that the owners of Fota proposed disposing of the property, public interest was aroused immediately and this concern was reflected in the action of the local representatives in the Cork area. Early in 1974 both Cork County Council and Cork Corporation called on the Government to acquire the property for use as a national amenity. About the middle of last year when the Minister for Finance received a number of delegations he said on each occasion that the State would not purchase Fota.  About that time, too, the corporation and county council proposed to the Minister that they would purchase the estate on certain conditions. These were that the State would undertake to maintain the house and arboretum for the benefit of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On each occasion the Minister refused to play his part.  Neither Cork Corporation nor Cork County Council have the expertise, the knowledge nor the experience necessary to maintain a property of this kind but they have done everything that is humanly possible to acquire the estate.  The State is capable of maintaining the property.  I ask the Parliamentary <Col N="813" /> Secretary to talk again with the Minister in regard to this matter and I trust that the Minister will view the situation with more enthusiasm than has been the case up to now so that this estate will not be lost to the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has said it is clear that the State has no intention of assisting the people of Cork to acquire this highly desirable amenity.  The headlines in this morning's newspapers brought the bad news of the low priority of the Fota issue.  We have now had the Minister come in in a rather arrogant mood and adopt the attitude of attack being the best form of defence and washing the State's hands completely of its responsibility in the provision of amenities of the type that could be made available at Fota.  The people of Cork have done a national service in bringing this issue so far and now they are seeking some financial assistance to enable them to bring the matter to a just and logical conclusion.</P>
      <P>At a time when we are considering social outlets, especially in relation to our young people, the State should make every effort to provide suitable amenities.  Fota is ideal in this respect. It has a high educational content.  Its availability to the public could go a long way towards solving the social outlet problems of a fast-developing area.  Its acquisition would be a major our youth.  It is ridiculous to say that contribution by the State in the provision of suitable facilities for the people generally and particularly for the problem is a local one and that the State can disclaim any responsibility so far as Fota is concerned. This island is situated some miles from Cork city.  It is on a very important tourist route between Waterford and Cork.  The island is visited regularly by many people from other lands. Because of the courtesy of the owners the property has been made available to many charitable organisations for fund-raising activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The non-involvement of the Government on this occasion could result in the people being deprived of an amenity which they have been enjoying <Col N="814" /> up to now.  Not only will the Government's refusal to acquire this valuable property be a big blow to the people of Cork but it will represent a loss to the entire nation.  We will be all the poorer because of the Government's attitude to this issue.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, himself a country man, is sympathetic to the project but he must try to deal and cope with the Dublin mentality in the present Government.  He has my sympathy. I am sure if he had a free hand he would assist Cork in their highly creditable efforts to provide this national amenity.</P>
    <P>If Fota is a local problem and a local amenity, it could equally be claimed that the valuable offshore resources could be Cork property.  Cork belongs to the nation.  The facilities, amenities and resources of Cork belong to the nation.</P>

      <P>Fota Island is a national issue.  I am disappointed the Government have taken this stand and rejected the appeal to provide something worthwhile for the nation.  The members of the Government who strongly supported the cause at county council level and in other bodies this evening will support the appeal which this motion embodies.  They recognise that the people involved made a great effort and they are sympathetic to their cause.  This has been evident at corporation and county council meetings when the project was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the problem of the south coast which is a fast developing industrial area catering for nationals and non-nationals.  It is important for the nation to provide suitable and <Col N="815" /> competent social facilities for the people who come to live and work here.  All around the coast there have been developments of various kinds. If a nation can preserve areas of such beauty as Fota Island, it can do a great deal for her image abroad.</P>
    <P>All this has been said in support of Fota.  I ask the Minister to realise that this is not solely a Cork issue. What is involved here is the preservation of a beauty spot.  The local bodies have made every effort in this regard.  I ask the Minister to open his heart&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and set a headline by assisting the people of Cork. They will remember him if he provides this very essential amenity.  This has been a bad week for decisions on amenities by the Government.  The Minister for Local Government withdrew the amenity grants.  This dealt another crushing blow to people who are looking for social outlets to ensure that community efforts, our values, and places of interest and beauty are preserved.</P>
      <P>Again, I strengthen the appeal already made to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to take a second look at this project and not let this unique opportunity pass of providing an amenity for the south coast and the nation of which it will be proud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the proposers of this motion I deplore and protest against the failure of the Minister for Finance and the Government to take any serious steps to acquire this property for the nation.  I say &ldquo;for the nation&rdquo; because it is a national and not a local issue as the Minister would have us believe.  As a Deputy from the constituency in which Fota is situated, I am very concerned about the problems and I am also conversant with the feelings of the people there and in the city and county of Cork.  I can assure the Minister that it is the universal wish of the people of the city and county of Cork that this property be acquired <Col N="816" /> by the Government as a national amenity.  That wish was and is shared by my colleagues on the other side of the House from the city and county of Cork.</P>
      <P>The strongest possible appeals were made to the Minister and the Government by the corporation and the Cork County Council who represent in the region of 500,000 people.  They were supported by urban councils and other bodies and also by national organisations and individuals who were concerned with conserving and preserving the amenities of the countryside.  Despite this massive support, which proves the validity and the force of the claim we are making, we met with nothing but cynical indifferences on the part of the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>He said a moment ago that he made no commitment at any time.  I agree that he did not, and that he did not have the slightest intention of paying one farthing to us.  This was obvious to me.</P>
      <P>The Minister met deputations from Cork comprising members of the corporation and county council and their officials.  It was clear to me and other members of the deputation that he had no intention of making any serious effort to acquire the property. He still allowed us to go through the silly motions on three separate occasions of coming to Dublin to meet him.  The members and officials of this deputation made an unanswerable case.  They pointed out the unrivalled botanic merits, scenic beauty and other features of the property.  They did not leave him under any illusion but that it was unique and eminently suitable as a national park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies have described this sufficiently for the Minister and everyone else to appreciate the point I am trying to make.  This island is ideally located, as pointed out by Deputy Cronin.  It is easily accessible to the city of Cork which is growing daily in population and industry.  It is situated near the towns of Cobh, Midleton and near the area of Little Island, Whitegate and Carrigtwohill which at the moment are being highly industrialised. We all know that there is <Col N="817" /> the prospect in the near future of further very large development in these areas.  The island is adjacent to one of the busiest roads in Ireland, the Cork-Youghal road which, with the exception of the Bray road, is the busiest in Ireland.  It is on the main tourist route between Rosslare and Killarney, touching on the towns of Midleton, Youghal, Dungarvan, Waterford and so on, and fed by various by-roads which also lead to tourist areas in the south.  This island, if preserved, would be a haven for visitors as well as for the people of the area who, in what we hope will be a more affluent era, will require amenities like this in which to spend their increased leisure time.</P>
    <P>All these arguments were advanced to the Minister and they seemed to me to be acceptable to him.  He made no attempt to refute any of them and the only argument he advanced was that this was only a local amenity, that it was not a national amenity and, therefore, would not justify the expenditure of capital funds.  On one of the deputations I pressed the Minister repeatedly for a definition of what he meant by a national amenity as distinct from a local amenity.  He did not give me a satisfactory answer.  I pressed him again and I asked him by what criteria he decided what was national and what was local and he failed to answer me.</P>
    <P>Again I ask by what standards do the Government, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance measure national as against local in terms of amenities, or anything else for that matter.  What divine right or what inspiration had the Minister for Finance or the Government to decide that Fota is only a local amenity and reduce it to the status of the parish pump?  Of course this is typical of the thinking and the conduct of the Coalition Government. This is the kind of thinking that has given rise to the Minister for Education downgrading or trying to downgrade University College, Cork, as well as the Parliamentary Secretary's own <i>Alma Mater</i>, University College, Galway, and trying to reduce it to the level of a technical school.</P>

      <P>The Minister tonight mentioned the word &ldquo;insincerity&rdquo; at least four times.  I have always believed that the man who uses the word &ldquo;insincerity&rdquo; is himself insincere and because of that believes other people to be so.  There was no insincerity on this side of the House when we submitted this motion on what we believe to be, and on what the members of his party in the Cork area believe to be, a national amenity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> Deputy Liam Burke, who is in the House, will agree that this is the unanimous wish of Cork County Council, which is a National Coalition-controlled body, and also of Cork Corporation.  The insincerity of the Minister was evident when he accused us of not having our priorities right, and said that our priority should be the unemployment situation which exists at present.</P>
    <P>Surely it is a mockery for a Minister for Finance of the present Government to scoff like that across the House at the Fianna Fáil Party who built up the economy of this country which, under the mismanagement of the present Minister, has deteriorated so much that we now have 100,000 people unemployed. This is the Minister for Finance who before Christmas extorted £27½ million in increased taxation from the people of Ireland, as was done also by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs; by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, by the removal of the butter subsidy; by the Minister for Health; again by the Minister himself last week.  Together they extorted many millions in taxation.  Yet the Minister alleges insincerity on our part when we seek a paltry sum from the nation's purse of £1,300 million to assist the local bodies in Cork to purchase a national amenity, Fota Island.  Any national amenity will of course be a local amenity, but we must realise the advantage Fota would be to that area and to the country in general if, as we hope, the industrial expansion of our country continues.</P>

      <P>Knowing him to be imbued with that country partiality, I would correct two points he made last night.  He said that pollution, if industrial expansion continues, could be fatal to Fota Island and particularly to <Col N="820" /> the arboretum.  In that he was casting a reflection on the planning authority. I firmly believe in industrial expansion. In fact, I would put it first, but with certain safeguards.  I would include in that industrial expansion the amenities that Fota Island can provide. If the Parliamentary Secretary were to carry his argument to its logical conclusion and say that by accident or otherwise the arboretum could be destroyed, he is saying that we Corkonians, in the event of such accident, could be wiped out overnight. That is to carry it to a logical conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Parliamentary Secretary is referring to and I would answer in greater detail if I had the time.  However, I would remind him that our priorities must be right.  We must have industrial expansion, we must create more jobs to help solve the present unemployment problem and we must provide for the needs of the future but, within that huge industrial expansion, we must have amenities also.  The risk is small. Fota Island must be preserved and, even as a final insurance policy, there would still be a very valuable site on the verge of Cork harbour.</P>
      <P>If we do not purchase Fota Island now it will be remembered for us by future generations.  The Minister tried to put a fence around Cork county and to say it was a local amenity. Surely we have seen enough partitioning. It is a typical Dublin approach.  I would concede the point to him if, in turn, he would concede to us that all the oil, gas and offshore development in the Cork area would be used solely for the economic development of Cork.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to advise the Minister, even at this late stage, to help the local authority to purchase and maintain Fota Island for what it would be&mdash;a national amenity.</P>

      <P>When I opened this debate last evening I said I was doing so on a non-recriminatory basis.  I <Col N="821" /> hoped the debate would be conducted in an objective way, that the merits of the case would be examined fairly by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister.  In fairness, the Parliamentary Secretary approached the debate in a reasonable and gentlemanly way.  Unfortunately the case he made was rather weak but it was the best case he could make.  He started by giving definitions of the requirements of a national park in order to qualify for some definition laid down in an international convention.  We never suggested that this area be acquired as a national park but even if we did I do not see why this party or the Government should feel themselves bound to adhere to the word and the letter of an international convention in deciding whether they should acquire a desirable amenity such as Fota Island.  I will not go into that but it was obviously because of the weakness of the brief presented to the Parliamentary Secretary by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister came into the House today in his usual &ldquo;fighting cock&rdquo; attitude and he immediately started to make provocative remarks.  He started with a cynical approach about what motivated the members of this party in putting down this motion and, to repeat what Deputy Fitzgerald has said, he accused us of insincerity.  He tried to establish that accusation on the ground that only Cork Deputies had put their names to the motion and he asserted we could not find in our party one Deputy from outside Cork to add his name to the motion.  One usually starts off a defence&mdash;if one has a defence to make&mdash;with one of the strongest points of the defence.  If that was one of the strongest points the Minister could make, I can only express my regret for the quality and standards this Government have set themselves to maintain and attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any one member of this party could have put down this motion.  I put my name to it initially and I invited my Cork colleagues, as I thought it appropriate, to put their names to it also.  There would have been no difficulty whatever getting the names of every member of our parliamentary party to this motion.  To suggest our <Col N="822" /> insincerity was established by the fact that we could not get other than Cork Deputies to put their names to this motion is a measure of the contemptuous way the Minister for Finance has treated this subject.</P>
    <P>To try to suggest, because it appeared on a note taken&mdash;as I said last night presumably by a civil servant &mdash;that the Cork deputation put this case forward when they met the Minister on the basis of securing a local amenity was completely unjustified. There may have been a note to that effect; in fact, the Parliamentary Secretary read it out last night.  I was not a member of the deputation and I am glad I was not because probably I should have lost my temper at the attitude the Minister adopted at that deputation, his attitude that they should go away like good boys, work out their own plan and not bother him.  He gave evidence of that tonight by saying that the deputation were only wasting his time because they did not know what plans they were going to put forward. They came to the Minister to ask him to intervene in the acquisition of this desirable property by means of supplementing, if necessary, the price of the property with a contribution from the State.  He refused to do that.</P>
    <P>As another measure of our alleged insincerity the Minister said we had the temerity to ask him, the Minister for Finance, to make a contribution towards the acquisition of this property when last week we voted against the taxation he was seeking for necessary purposes.  We voted against taxation last week because we felt in the circumstances it was not necessary in view of the fact that the Minister was budgeting for a deficit of £120 million. The taxation he raised last week will hardly amount to £35 million, and even on that basis he still has £85 million of a deficit that we did not oppose.  It would take a small proportion of only one of these millions of pounds to supply the kind of money needed to ensure that Fota Island be acquired for the State.</P>
    <P>I regret very much that the Minister introduced this note of sarcasm and cynicism into the debate because I had hoped notwithstanding a possible <Col N="823" /> refusal by the Parliamentary Secretary last night which we got, and notwithstanding the intransigent position the Minister might adopt&mdash;which he did adopt and even exceeded&mdash;that still we might find the means whereby the State could join with the local authority in the acquisition of this property.</P>
    <P>Last night I traced the history of the island very briefly.  I said it went back to Norman times, to the 13th century, when the original Barry&mdash;from which Barrymore or Smith-Barry derived&mdash; came to Ireland as a Norman adventurer and in one way or another acquired the Fota estate.  Ultimately it became the property of the Earl of Barrymore when he was made an earl in the 17th century.  He gave it to his youngest son who developed the estate from the early 18th century.  He built the fine regency house that now stands on the estate and started the arboretum which has achieved world-wide fame.</P>
    <P>In passing I would comment on the suggestion that because of the degree of industrialisation taking place in the Cork harbour area this arboretum is likely to be wiped out overnight, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggested. It was pointed out to him subsequently that there are planning laws and requirements. In a short intervention, I pointed out to him that the bulk of the industrialisation takes place to the east of Fota Island and, with the prevailing <Col N="824" /> south-westerly winds, even if the most damaging air pollution were involved it is unlikely the arboretum would be affected.</P>
    <P>There is a notice on one of the main gates leading to Fota Island on the main Cork-Cobh road which says <i>boutez avant.</i> I have no great knowledge of French but I believe it means &ldquo;clear the way&rdquo;.  I believe the name Buttevant, with which the Barrymore family were associated in the early days, comes from that.  If we are now witnessing from the Government a cynical attitude towards the preservation of a property of the historical value and the high amenity value of Fota, if in a £1,000 million budget they cannot afford to allocate some small funds, and the sum would be very small, for the purchase of this island, if this is a measure of the aesthetic thinking of this Government &mdash;we know at the present time that the 100,000 people unemployed are a measure of their ability to deal with the economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1973: - Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 27:</P>
    <P>Before section 14 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where the Board is of opinion that a request for an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board is ill-founded or vexatious, but not otherwise, the Board may refuse such oral hearing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Molloy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall have an absolute discretion to hold an oral hearing of any reference or appeal to the Board.</P>
      <P>I have been pointing out to the House that the explanatory memorandum circulated by the Minister quite clearly indicates the reason for section 14, and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This will help the Board to deal expeditiously with cases, particularly where an appeal appears to be ill-founded or vexatious....  The Act of 1963 required the Minister to accede to the request of any <Col N="827" /> party to an appeal for an oral hearing and it seems clear that the provision was being used in certain cases.</P>
    <P>We would agree with that explanation if we were satisfied that the wording of section 14 in the Bill did, in fact, carry out the intention expressed in the explanatory memorandum, but we submit that it does not.  We also submit that the amendment in my name does cover the point made by the Minister in explaining what he wanted in section 14.  I am sure the Minister must have seen this anomaly by now and realised the importance of having the words we are suggesting included.  They are the very words which he uses himself in explaining the need for such powers to be given to the board.  We have already stated the reasons why we feel this section giving sweeping and unrestricted powers to the board to withhold the right to the holding of an oral hearing should not be allowed to stand without amendment and there has been a good deal of discussion on this section already.</P>
    <P>One point which has occurred to me is that the use to be made of this by the board could result in a drastic reduction&mdash;and it is the intention that it will result in such a reduction&mdash;in the number of oral hearings.  Up to the present the Press have been admitted to oral meetings, and the public at large have been informed of developments and the intentions of developments by the reporting of happenings at oral hearings.  If the right to hold an oral hearing is to be restricted in this way, and to be restricted very severely, I would submit, you will then have a situation in which a very important planning appeal could be lodged, possibly by a very active residents' association, a tenants' association, a community council or a group of concerned citizens objecting to a proposed development in their particular area and, to highlight their case, they would naturally demand an oral hearing at which they would present their views in order to convey their objections to the proposed development.  Up to now the newspapers have been able to <Col N="828" /> report the happenings and the submissions made at such oral hearings. In this way the community at large have been kept informed of the intentions of developers and they have had at their disposal this weapon by which to expose any undesirable developments.</P>
    <P>The newspapers have done a very great public service in reporting, sometimes in great detail, what has gone on at these oral hearings.  I submit that in many cases the only way in which the public at large were informed of developments was through the reporting of oral hearings.  Many important appeals have been held and have been reported in the newspapers and the only real knowledge of the intentions of developers the community has been able to glean has been from such newspaper reports. If, as is the expressed intention in section 14, the board shall have the right to refuse an oral hearing without stating why, without giving any reason, without having any conditions attaching to their right to refuse, we shall have a situation in which oral hearings will be greatly restricted. There will be no guarantee in cases like the Central Bank building, where an oral hearing was held and citizens were able to give their views as well as official bodies, of any public awareness of the intentions of developers. The Minister will plead that it is unreasonable to suggest that in an appeal of such importance an oral hearing would be refused.  I counter that by saying that if he is satisfied that the board should withhold the right to an oral hearing only in frivolous and vexatious cases and should grant the right in such cases as the Central Bank building and other controversial issues like that, then he should ensure that that is clearly written into the legislation. But the power being given to the board is not restricted.  That is our great objection.</P>
    <P>We have given many sound and valid reasons why our amendment should be accepted.  I make one last appeal to the Minister to accept our amendment.  It incorporates the Minister's own words and, if he accepts it, we will then be able to move on to another section of the Bill.</P>
    <Col N="829" />
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  It is just not good enough for him to say that he will consider it between now and Report Stage.  These words are important.  If the Minister does not accept our amendment then, under the Bill when passed, the Minister will be replaced by a board.  If the Minister continues into the new Act we could table questions here or put down motions in cases in which an appellant was aggrieved and had no recourse to an oral hearing.  We could seek to have the particular case dealt with in this House.  The case would be fully publicised.</P>
      <P>The board will not be responsible to this House.  They will be responsible to the Minister.  The pattern will continue: when Deputies seek information they will be told that the matter is the responsibility of the board and the Ceann Comhairle will rule out questions designed to elicit information from the Minister.  How is one to know on what basis this board may refuse a request for an oral hearing? The Press will be excluded.  Excluding the Press is a retrograde step.  Up to now oral hearings have been the method adopted by people who could not afford any other method to have their case debated across the table in an appeal.  The Minister should seriously reconsider his attitude and accept this amendment.  If the Minister were not being replaced we might not push this amendment so strenuously because we would have the alternative method of bringing the matter out here into the open by way of question or motion.  The Minister will have no control over the board and we simply cannot agree to what the Minister proposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not press this amendment if the Minister were to decide whether or not there should be an oral hearing.  The people the Minister and I represent have their public representative to come to and they know that they will be listened to; boards are a different matter. Boards have been set up and given different powers and no public representative dare make representations where these boards are concerned. <Col N="830" /> Human nature being what it is, we know that bad decisions can be made.  I am not accusing anybody of doing a dishonest turn but, if you are in a certain social group, you can make representations.  The small man cannot make representations once this has gone out of the hands of the public representatives.</P>
      <P>If the Minister sets up a board with discretionary powers in relation to oral hearings, he is doing away with representation for the small man, and I want to see that he gets a fair crack of the whip.  Various boards have been set up and public representatives cannot make representations to them.  If they do, the person is disqualified.  I make the statement categorically that representations can be made by people in the proper social group.  That is my greatest objection to this.  It is handing over power to people who are not responsible to this House and representations cannot be made on behalf of the ordinary Joe Soap.  On principle I am against this, and I am in favour of the amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  There is considerable public uneasiness over the fact that there should be any form of restriction on oral hearings.  As one who has been involved in oral hearings I know the value of them.  Representative organisations, and particularly community associations who take an interest in planning in their districts, and who at times have to formulate their appeals to the Minister, should not be denied this right.  There should be no suggestion in our legislation that they should be excluded in relation to planning appeals.</P>
      <P>Some people in this city have gone to considerable expense in furthering their objections to certain planning proposals. They had the goodwill and the help of the community in their efforts. I make a strong appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude.  I support the system as it exists whereby any request for an oral hearing can be made and granted.  The parties can come together and put forward their case.  I would ask the Minister to consider that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder who first thought of the idea of this horrible board because, apparently, we are to have an awful crowd of chancers on the board and everybody is afraid that they will be dishonest and do all sorts of queer things.  Let us face up to it. The object of this Bill is to set up a board, and this was suggested by practically everybody in this House except Deputy Callanan&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to deal with the question of appeals.  Apparently it was the desire of everybody to have this taken away from the Minister.  This is my fifth time to repeat that I am prepared to listen to reasoned argument in this House on any of the matters in the Bill.  If it can be improved, of course I will be glad to try to meet the wishes of Members of both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>As I explained earlier, the section was included to prevent two things. One was to prevent appeals put in by cranks which were made just for the purpose of holding up planning matters.  Apparently Deputy Molloy and other Fianna Fáil speakers agree that this sort of appeal should not be allowed an oral hearing.  If the volume of appeals, and particularly the volume of requests for oral hearings, continues to grow, can we deal with them?  All sorts of arguments were put up here this evening as to why we should attempt to deal with all oral hearings requested.  Deputy Molloy was reasonable enough when he said he did not feel that we should try to do that and that, in fact, there were certain types of appeal which could be dealt with in another way, but that this was not spelled out in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us back to the board. We will have a board which will have the confidence, I hope, of the House and of the country.  Can we rely on that board to decide in their wisdom whether or not an appeal is important enough to have an oral hearing or whether it could be dealt with simply by written evidence? Deputy Cunningham made a comment and I should like to take him up <Col N="832" /> on it.  He said that if the responsibility for deciding what appeals were to be oral hearings was the Minister's, this would meet his wishes.  Did I take him up correctly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that we might not push this amendment so hard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Fianna Fáil group be prepared to accept a proviso that on oral hearings the final decision would rest, on appeal, with the Minister for Local Government?  Would that meet the wishes of the Fianna Fáil Party?  Deputy Cunningham said it.  Deputy Molloy may have a comment and I will sit down to give him an opportunity of commenting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham suggested that if the decision was being taken by the Minister for Local Government as to whether or not there should be an oral hearing the Minister would be answerable here in the House and therefore there would be a safeguard and that would meet their wishes.  Supposing we write into the section a proviso that, if somebody is aggrieved by not being allowed an oral hearing by the board, he is entitled to ask the Minister for Local Government for a ruling on it, as is the case in many other matters which are decided on appeal, would that be acceptable to Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly overcomes the problem to which we have been lodging our main objection, which is that the board are a completely different animal from the Minister, and completely inaccessible to the public, and will be making decisions in an arbitrary way.  If the Minister is now suggesting that there would be some form of appeal for anybody refused an oral hearing, we are interested in listening to him.  Is the Minister suggesting that the person would be given an opportunity of appealing to the Minister?  If he is refused an oral hearing by the board, he can write to the Minister and let <Col N="833" /> him decide it?  That certainly meets our primary objection.  We are prepared to accept that.  The Minister will introduce an amendment to this effect on Report Stage?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>To add to the section the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;:provided that in the event of a refusal to hold an oral hearing the Board shall state the grounds for its decision in writing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that people may go to the Minister, it is still important that when people write for an oral hearing and are refused, they should be given the grounds for that refusal in writing.  If a board tend to feel they have no responsibility to the appellants to let them know the reason, they tend to become over-bureaucratic. They tend to make the public cynical about boards.  It should not even be necessary to have an amendment down to this effect.  It is only a matter of common courtesty, where an oral hearing is requested and the request turned down, that the grounds should be stated.  This would help to make up people's minds and would make the Minister's job easier in that he might not have so many representations seeking oral hearings if a proper explanation were given to the appellant why his application was turned down.  I think this is a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped the Deputy would withdraw the amendment in view of the discussion on the previous amendment.  If the board were to give an explanation in writing it presupposes that the explanation would be subject to query from the person receiving it and correspondence could arise which could eventually result in <Col N="835" /> the full time of board officials being occupied in correspondence.  When the amendment is put down by me for the Report Stage the situation will be that anybody asking for an oral hearing, instead of getting a reply saying &ldquo;We are terribly sorry but we do not think you are entitled to an oral hearing because ...&rdquo; will have the right to appeal to me or to my successor in years to come.  If they are not then satisfied they can get a Deputy to raise the matter by question in the House.  I should not like to see this become a matter of correspondence between the board and an applicant and I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.  If the previous amendment had not been dealt with as it was, there might be something in this amendment but I think the Deputy will agree that the situation has been adequately met.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy's side of the House have problems but <Col N="836" /> we are happy here.  The Opposition would give the impression that oral hearings were being barred.  That is wrong.  What was said was that the board would have absolute discretion as to whether they would grant an oral hearing or not.  This was reasonable although I think the word &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; should be omitted because it is a bad word.</P>
      <P>In my view people should get the reasons for a decision of the board in writing.  I think the Minister is rather unwise to put down such an amendment involving himself in the board in that way but, seeing that people have a right to go back and appeal to the Minister in that way, I presume people have a recourse and will not feel &ldquo;done down&rdquo;.  On the basis of what the Minister is doing, even though I think it is unwise and is making it a harder job for himself and his successors to deal with this double-edged weapon, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We agreed with the amendment put down by Deputy O'Brien and we intended to support him.  There is a good principle in the amendment in that it requires the board to give reasons for certain decisions they take.  We think it is a good principle that the board be required to put in writing their reasons for refusing to grant an oral hearing.  The fact that the Minister has conceded on the previous amendment that a person so refused has the right to appeal to the Minister for Local Government does not alter the general principle involved here.  I can envisage a person seeking an oral hearing and applying to the board. They refuse, and he gets a note so informing him.  That is all he knows. When and if the Minister's amendment is passed that person can appeal to the Minister against this decision. But I think the board should state why they have refused an oral hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the reasons are good and logical and if the person requesting the oral hearing accepts those reasons as valid, he could possibly anticipate the Minister's decision on appeal and not waste his time and the Minister's in proceeding <Col N="837" /> with the appeal to the Minister. It might be a help and an improvement of the whole appeal process if the board were required to explain their refusal.  In that way there would be more open legislation and greater communication between the bureaucratic arm and the community resulting in an improvement in the image of planning in general.  That is an attractive proposition and something we would support and I would ask Deputy O'Brien to allow his amendment to stand.  He should reconsider his decision to withdraw it. We would like to see it included in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a comparison with what happens at local authority level.  As a matter of courtesy a person who writes to the Department or to the board should get the courtesy of having that body's views explained to them.  It is not a planning application.  The reason why the board say the oral hearing cannot be held should be explained.  We should try to bring the people along with us on these things all the time. I have the utmost confidence in the Civil Service to adopt a brief reply setting out the reasons for the refusal. We may not accept the reasons for the refusal but we can accept that they would be courteous in their reply.</P>

    <P>Deputy O'Brien and I represent <Col N="838" /> postal areas Nos. 4 and 6 in Dublin and, as the Minister is aware, appeals abound from that area.  That is why we are so sensitive about this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view it would be in the Minister's interest to incorporate this amendment in the section. If an applicant received no explanation for a refusal he will almost certainly appeal in every case.  If the board outlines to him the reasons why his application was turned down, in my view he will not appeal.  People are cute enough and they consult a lot of people before they lodge an appeal and if they are not given a reason for a refusal of an application they will appeal every case.  Deputy O'Brien's amendment would be an addition to this Bill and it would stop appeals going to the Minister unless the applicant had genuine grounds for appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view Deputies are making a mountain out of a molehill. We discussed the original amendment and reached agreement on it.  We are talking about appeals which are mischievous <Col N="839" /> and so on but I suggest that there is a certain amount of mischief involved in the attitude being adopted by some Fianna Fáil members in this regard.  I do not think we are doing ourselves or the House any good by attempting to go back on what I consider to be an agreement made across the floor of this House in relation to section 14.  We agreed what should be done but now the suggestion is being put forward that we accept an amendment which the proposer is anxious to withdraw.  We are now being asked that the board be expected to give an explanation if they refuse to give an oral hearing.  In my view we are going further than I would be prepared to go on this matter.  We are either giving the person who has been refused an oral hearing the right to appeal to the Minister on that and all that entails&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that this would really follow logically form our decision to give the appellant the right to appeal to the Minister because if the board decide not to grant an oral hearing and give a reason for their decision then the appellant knows whether or not that reason is overwhelming and compulsive and he has no grounds.  The fact that the board would give reasons for not granting an oral hearing would give the appellant grounds to appeal to the Minister or deciding he had no case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion that the board should spend time giving reasons why they decided an oral hearing was not necessary would mean that a lot of paperwork would be involved.  Deputy Molloy, and others, talked about the difficulty of having hearing involving big industries and of the right of local organisations to appear.  In my view there is some kind of a doublethink in this on the part of some of the Fianna Fáil members.  We are talking about something that most of us are prepared to accept.  I assume that the board, being a reasonable board, would decide that an oral hearing was not necessary on a relatively simple case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to persuade some people who make an application for an oral <Col N="840" /> hearing that what they were told was the real reason for refusing an oral hearing and they would send letters backwards and forwards as long as they would be answered by the appeal board.  We have already accepted that such people have the right to appeal to the Minister for Local Government against the refusal of the board to grant them an oral hearing and he would then decide whether such people were entitled to one or not.  In this way the appeal board would not be cluttered up with correspondence over something which was not of much concern.  Otherwise, it would finish up that the appeal board would be better off granting oral hearings in every case, because it would prove less time-wasting and would require less paperwork.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Opposition, having reached what they appear to have considered to be a reasonable compromise on section 14, to allow the amendment to be withdrawn as suggested by the mover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to have written into the Bill that the Minister for Local Government shall give his reasons for either granting or refusing an appeal for an oral hearing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows if somebody appeals to me against a refusal for an oral hearing and I reply that I consider that that person is not entitled to an oral hearing because it is only an addition to a house which can be dealt with locally without a hearing then in nine cases out of ten the appellant will write back pointing out how important his case is.  That would mean that correspondence would mount up or I would have to stop answering when I would be worse off than I was in the first place.</P>
      <P>Would Deputy Molloy not agree that the simple way to do it is to say that we have decided now that an appeal to the Minister for Local Government is possible, or will be written into it and, if the person is not satisfied, he is entitled to have it raised by a public representative&mdash;if the public representative considers it important enough to have it raised on the floor of this House?  What better guarantee do we want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="841" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not want to waste too much time on this, I suppose if the matter can be raised on the floor of the House at least there is some place in which the person finally has to explain himself.  That is the principle which we have been seeking in the discussion on the recent amendments here.  I suppose, if a person is refused an oral hearing by the Minister having appealed the board's decision, if a parliamentary question is put down asking the Minister for Local Government to state his reasons for refusing to grant an oral hearing, if the House will accept it as being in order, the Minister gives an assurance that such questions will, in fact, be answered adequately here by the Minister for Local Government and the House will accept that as traditional.  then we would agree to it.</P>
      <P>But the Minister will be aware that Ministers can use a device in replying which allows them sometimes to avoid giving information which is sought by way of parliamentary question.  Only today, and, indeed, yesterday, we had the classic example of a Minister using the device and a formula of words which enabled him to refuse to impart to this House information to which the House, and, indeed, the country, rightly felt they were entitled. We, for our part, would be prepared to accept it as traditional that such questions would be properly answerable by the Minister for Local Government, at parliamentary questions and, if the Minister gives us that assurance, we can move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that if a question came to me about an appeal on which I was asked to decide about whether or not a person was entitled to an oral hearing, I would be entitled to give my reasons for refusing, if I so refused. But I can tell Deputy Molloy that if he, or the people representing the party on the far side of the House, adopted the tactics they did today, they would not get very much change out of me no more than they did out of Dick Burke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not accepting it because the section has to do with the particular nature of planning appeals and the board will not be arbitrating between parties but will be dealing with each appeal as if the application had been made to the board in the first instance.  That can be seen if one refers to section 26 (5) (f) of the 1963 Act.  Accordingly, the board may take into account any matter which seems relevant, provided it is a matter relating to the proper planning and development of the area. At present, Article 9 of the Appeals and References Regulations, 1964, provide the safeguard that such matters must be brought to the attention of the parties and they must be given an opportunity to comment. Section 15 incorporates this safeguard in the Bill instead of having it in regulations.  The effect of the amendment would be to require the board, in every case, to take into account matters other than those raised by the parties.  Obviously, (the amendment is a mistake.  If Deputy Molloy <Col N="843" /> takes a look at it, I think he will realise it is a mistake.  Therefore, I would ask that it be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I think so, because the amendments of the Minister change the meaning of it.  The point I was getting at was that it would be imperative that the proper planning and development of an area should be taken into account in deciding.  That is why I felt it was a mistake to state that it &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I felt it would be more positive to have the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but the strength of my amendment has been weakened by the Minister subsequently changing the words which followed.  Therefore, at this stage, it might be as well to withdraw that one and proceed to the other two.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 17 to 19, to delete &ldquo;relating to the proper planning and development of the area of the relevant planning authority other than those raised by the parties to the reference or appeal&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;other than those raised by the parties to the reference or appeal if the matters either relate to the proper planning and development of the area of the relevant planning authority or are matters to which by virtue of section 22 (2) of this Act the Board may have regard.</P>
      <P>amendment No. 48, which proposes a This amendment is consequential on new section enabling a planning authority when considering an application for permission, or the board when considering an appeal, to have regard to matters arising outside the planning district immediately concerned. Perhaps if I read the note dealing with amendment No. 48 it will be understood more easily.</P>

      <P>The board are required by section 26, subsection (5) (b) of the 1963 Act to deal with an appeal as if the application had been made to them in the first instance.  Accordingly the board are not confined to the issues raised by the appellant.  The purpose of section 15 is to ensure that if any other matter is being taken into account <Col N="846" /> it must be brought to the notice of the parties and they must be given an opportunity to put forward their view.</P>
      <P>This amendment here is necessary to ensure that that safeguard is extended to matters of the kind being provided for in the new section proposed by amendment No. 48.  This is a new section enabling a planning authority, when considering an application for permission or other matter, to look outside the boundary of their own district and to take into account matters which might be relevant to the proper planning and development of their own area&mdash;for example, the effect on an urban housing scheme adjoining their boundary if the county council were to permit the building of a factory on land in their area. That sort of situation arises from time to time in the area in which I live because the town of Drogheda is close to County Meath.  There is also the question of the polluting effect of effluent from a proposed development if such effluent were allowed to be discharged into a river a short distance upstream from the intake for a water supply for another area, and there is also the question of the recreational and amenity needs of the population of another area.  Subsection (2) extends the provision of the board in relation to any relevant needs.  The need for an amendment of this kind has been suggested by An Taisce.</P>
      <P>The matter has not given rise previously to any problem.  Perhaps this is because planning authorities assumed that in considering the proper planning and development of their areas they could take other matters into account.  If a case were appealed there would have been no difficulty involved because under the 1963 Act the Minister has a specific co-ordinating function.  This will not apply to the board, but as the question has been raised it is better that the position be clarified.  What we are doing is ensuring that the board will have the authority to take these matters into consideration; otherwise there would be the possibility of somebody endeavouring to have a ruling whereby the board would deal only with the matters before them.</P>

    <P>Is the Minister accepting that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As it stands, the section enables the board to make a decision at any time after the seven days allowed by the notice.  It does not enable them to make that decision without considering any submission received from a party either before the notice issued or before expiry of the time allowed in the notice.  If a submission is received from a party after the time, the board will still consider it, if they have not already made a decision.  Subsection (2) is permissive and not mandatory.  While there is no great objection to the amendment, it is mandatory in the terms that it might preclude or discourage consideration of a submission which arrived a few days later but not before a decision was made.  It would be more appropriate to have something of the kind contained in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This is complicating matters.  We are trying to work within a time limit.  This appears to be an attempt to widen the limit.  We would have the old story about the appeal that comes to the Custom House which was received the day on which it was supposed to have been posted, if the postmark is blurred. This sort of thing will blow up again. I have no objection to it or we might succeed in wording it some other way. Frankly, I do not see any great merit in it because, in my view, it merely complicates matters.</P>

      <P>To add to this section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Board may withdraw a notice served under this section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to tidy up the section.  It says that the board may serve notice and then there is a time limit.  I believe that when this notice is served there is no indication it may be withdrawn. If the necessary evidence is presented to help them make a normal decision, they would withdraw the notice served.  If this provision were included, as I said, this would tidy up the section and make the board's job easier. When a notice is served can it be withdrawn or, if they receive the information within the allotted time, can they carry on with the normal appeals situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down my amendment for the same reason.  There does not seem to be any provision in the Bill for the withdrawal of the notice. I went further than Deputy O'Brien in stating that:</P>
      <P>The Board may withdraw a notice served under this section, provided:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  that it is satisfied that, as a result of evidence submitted by <Col N="851" /> any party, there is no unnecessary delay, or that a reference or appeal is not vexatious, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that the notice of withdrawal is sent in writing to all parties to the appeal.</P>
    <P>We are both covering the same point, but my amendment lays down more conditions.  Has the Minister any comment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither of the amendments, in my view, is necessary.  The section enables the board to serve a notice where it is of the opinion that an appeal is vexatious or is being unnecessarily delayed by any party, and empowers the board to make a decision after the period specified even if the party concerned has made no submission. Therefore, there is no necessity for the amendment.  The section does not impose any obligation on the board to make a decision after the seven days or whatever period is specified.</P>
      <P>A party to an appeal can hold up progress by delays of submission, grounds of appeal or particulars which he wishes to submit in support of such grounds.  Reasonable facilities must be given to him to satisfy the requirements of natural justice.  It is difficult to draw the line.  If information comes to hand within the period specified, the appeal will proceed in the normal way.  That will also apply if the submission is late but arrives before a decision has been made.  The board could hardly refuse to consider it simply because it did not arrive within the time specified.  As it stands, the matter is fully covered.  When I looked at this first I thought I could see something in it, but when I went through it I realised that this might possibly worsen the situation, not improve it.  If I were on the other side of the House or where Deputy O'Brien is, I would have rushed in immediately to put down an amendment because on a first reading it looked like that. I am satisfied it adequately covers what we want and, I am sure, the House want.  I, therefore, ask that the amendment be withdrawn.</P>

      <P>There is a reluctance to oblige them to give reasons for their decisions.  On our side there is a desire to ensure that where the board have been given the power to make decisions they are obliged to state the reasons why they made such decisions. That difference has arisen section after section in our discussions, particularly today.  We think the least the board might be expected to do is to state their reasons for a decision. I know, having sat in the Minister's seat, that there will be a tremendous reluctance on the part of those making decisions to have to put down on paper their reasons for those decisions.  I am not sure that their reluctance will be for the right reasons.  Where a member of the public is dealing with a State board, particularly in regard to planning, he is due the courtesy of an explanation when he is refused something which he is seeking.  It is most unsatisfactory to get an arbitrary refusal and no explanation. The difference in thinking on this between Fianna Fáil and the Coalition has been quite evident today. This reluctance to write things <Col N="854" /> in comes from being in office and the more liberal approach comes from those in Opposition.  I would ask the Minister to try to cast off the burdens of office and the feeling of responsibility to protect the whole bureaucratic system and to write in a few good solid guarantees to the citizens by including a number of our suggestions.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy Molloy remembers from his time that sometimes a person makes an appeal simply for the purpose of annoying somebody or the person making the appeal may not be right mentally. There have been occasions when people have sent in an absolutely ridiculous appeal and asked for an oral hearing.  Some cases caused a lot of trouble.  For that reason, they would not be entitled to be told more than that they were considered frivolous. In fact, the person who would get the reply would almost certainly dispute it and unless there was to be written into the Bill, and I do not propose to do it, some other type of appeal from a decision of the appeal board on matters of this kind it would be ridiculous to start what I described as a long correspondence between the person who made the appeal and lost the deposit and those who were deciding the appeal.  If a frivolous appeal is made and a decision is made by the board I do not know what Deputy Molloy wants me to do. Does he want me to get the board to sit down and write: &ldquo;Your deposit has been lost because we consider that you had no right to make this appeal since you have no connection whatever with the proposed development and it does not affect you in any way and it was simply done for the purpose of causing trouble?&rdquo; If that were done what would be the next step?  Does it mean that the person then starts challenging the board to <Col N="855" /> prove he had no connection with the development?  Is it not likely, that cases would go on for a long time? If somebody is dissatisfied I am sure he would finish up in the courts. Perhaps that is the best way to do it. Deputy Molloy suggests that a safeguard should be written in so that those who submit frivolous appeals can cause even more upset and should be protected in some way.  I would not be prepared to co-operate in that at all, even if it is considered by Deputy Molloy to be a democratic way of doing it.  I do not believe it is.</P>

      <P>We are giving the board power and I think they should be obliged to explain their actions. The Minister is given the board <i>carte blanche</i> in this and a number of other sections.  We have no idea how this board will operate, whether this House will be satisfied, after they have been operating for 12 months, that they are performing their duties and functions in the manner expected.  This board could become a great monster. They could disrupt development.  They will wield a tremendous power in relation to future development.  They will be removed from this Parliament.  They will be an independent body.  We are attempting to create an independent board for the purpose of avoiding the situation where a political figure is placed in the difficult, frustrating and embarrassing position of being the person who decides appeals.  He is open to all sorts of charges, Rightly, and wrongly in many cases, charges have been made in the past.  It will not be possible for members of the public to understand decisions given by this board.  This is not the most important area of decision making in which they will be involved but it is one of the areas and they should be obliged to give some explanation.  All a person will get in the post is a letter saying they are not returning the £10 deposit so not to expect it.  He will not have a clue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply will be the decision of the appeal and it will be obvious that it was a vexatious one and, therefore, it will be easy enough to understand it.  Deputy Molloy may have been aware of the person who appealed against every development in his area, asked for an oral hearing and did not turn up.  I do not suppose such a person will now make an appeal because if there is £10 at risk he will not do it.  Because of the phraseology in the 1973 Act he was entitled to look for an oral hearing for every appeal he submitted, whether it had anything to do with them or not.  If they did that under the new legislation, it would be quite obvious if they did not turn up at the hearing.  If they applied for an oral hearing, or even an ordinary hearing, and gave flimsy evidence which showed they had no interest in the matter and wished merely to be awkward, that would be a matter on which the board would have to make up their mind.  I am aware that practically all Deputies and many people outside were anxious that a board would be set up, but now that we are getting nearer to that it appears the desire to have a board is waning.</P>

      <P>The safeguards we build in are the type of board that will be set up and the job they will do.  I do not think the decision on this matter is the most important.  As a matter of fact, I do not think it is very important at all.  I do not think that the appeals we are talking about where £10 will be forfeited are the ones that will really <Col N="857" /> matter.  In fact, I do not think there will be many, because people will be careful about submitting appeals when there is a risk of losing.  The mere fact that they submitted them will be evidence to the board that, to a certain extent, they must have an interest in the appeal.  I think that Deputy Molloy is perhaps making a mountain out of a molehill.  It is a minor matter and we should not waste time on it.  In fact, I thought we had already dealt with it and I am surprised to find that, having agreed to it earlier, we should now attempt to discuss it again as though it had not been dealt with.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to what is in amendment No. 35 as worded, but I am adding something to it.  I am asking the Minister if he will agree to add words.  We did not have an opportunity to discuss it previously. I accept that the Minister, being the Minister, would be reluctant to agree to the point I am making even though it is a legitimate point.  However if the Minister cannot see his way to accepting it, I have no amendment down in that form of words and there is no way I can press it any harder.  I can only ask the Minister to reconsider the entire matter of allowing the board away with making decisions they do not have to explain.  This is one of the weaknesses in the way we are establishing the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister has resorted to the ploy that, because we are arguing the nitty-gritty of this planning Bill, in some way we are weakening in our resolve to establish the board.  The Minister knows that kind of comment is not logical or fair. Our responsibility here, having agreed to the general principle of establishing the board, is to lay down the rules and regulations under which the board will operate.  If we say we consider certain things should apply that will ensure the board operates more to our satisfaction than it might otherwise do, it is unfair to say we are against the board.  I do not think anyone would pay much attention to that kind of comment, but the Minister has said it more than <Col N="858" /> once.  Presumably, he must believe it. It is a silly comment from the Minister and one he knows is not true.  I have asked the Minister to consider the matter.  He has not stated he would and I cannot withdraw anything.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister may by regulations specify matters which are to be taken into account by the Board before giving a direction under this section and any matters which are for the time being so specified shall, where they are relevant <Col N="859" /> to a particular appeal and the Board considers exercising in relation to the appeal a power conferred on it by subsection (1) of this section, be so taken into account by the Board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The regulations envisaged in this amendment are primarily for the purpose of allaying any fears that the board would act unreasonably in requiring any third party appellant to contribute to expenses incurred in relation to an appeal.  However, they would also give guidance to the board in relation to cases where they might be considering a direction to any other party.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a re-enactment of the provisions of section 18 of the 1963 Act, which was little used.  The purpose of that section was, first, to deter a planning authority from unreasonable use of their powers so that applicants for permission would not have to incur expense in making an appeal and, secondly, to deter persons from making unreasonable use of the right of appeal, which the 1963 Act gave to everybody, regardless of whether or not they held any interest in the property.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands a third party appellant can, if his appeal fails, be required to pay compensation to the Minister and the planning authority for expenses occasioned in relation to his appeal.  This power has never been exercised.  There have however been cases where third parties have availed of the appeals procedure solely to obstruct a neighbour or business competitor or to delay development on frivolous grounds.  Because of an oversight in the 1963 Act, it is not possible in such cases to require the appellant to make any contribution to expenses incurred in relation to his appeal.  Section 17 would remedy that position.</P>
    <P>Despite the campaign that has been carried on by various organisations, there is no valid reason to suspect that any change of policy is intended. All parties are agreed that vexatious appeals should be discouraged. Accordingly, the House might agree <Col N="860" /> to accept my assurance that no change of policy is intended and I would make that clear to the board when the board is finally set up.  It could be accepted that the board will act in a reasonable manner, as I have pointed out.  If however the House considers that some guidelines are necessary, it has two alternatives. First, Deputy Haughey's amendment enables me to make regulations but it does not specify what they should contain.  If the Deputy were present perhaps he would develop the case for his amendment; maybe Deputy Molloy will do so.  Secondly, my amendment is more specific.  My amendment has been put down to assist the House, but I should greatly prefer to have no amendment and to rely on the good sense of the board.  However I await the outcome of the discussion that will take place on the two amendments.</P>

      <P>At this stage may I say that amendment No. 36 appears to meet amendment No. 37 in the name of Deputy Haughey and is related to amendment No. 37A in the name of Deputy Molloy.  Therefore, I suggest we take amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 37A together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier I heard there was a strong body of opinion against section 14, but we found in fact that opinion was against section 17.  There are great fears in many responsible bodies that this section was built in because of pressure over the years against third party appeals.  They usually come from the ordinary man-in-the-street. As this section is at the moment it would put quite a number of people off making genuine appeals because they would be afraid of the cost.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the board is to be a judge.  We all know judges take rather strict views of things.  Section 17 states what is to be done.  Subsection (1) (b) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>in case the decision of the planning authority is confirmed on appeal, or where the decision is varied on appeal, if the Board in determining the appeal does not accede in substance to the appellant's <Col N="861" /> grounds of appeal, the Board, if it so thinks, may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to the planning authority, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the planning authority for the expense occasioned to them in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>As we know, planning authorities bring senior counsel and various experts along and this could be very costly in the case of the appellant. Paragraphs (ii) and (iii) of this subsection state:</P>
    <P>(ii)  to any of the other parties to the appeal, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the party for the costs or other expenses occasioned to him in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(iii)  to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>The judges do not make awards to themselves but this board can award money to themselves.  I do not think this section as it is will stand up in any court.  It is immoral to allow any board to award sums of money to themselves.  During an 11-month period there were 3,520 appeals.  Out of that 260 were third party appeals, 29 of which were upheld, 86 were unsuccessful and 101 had conditions attached.  All the propaganda we have heard in relation to third party appeals does not hold water.</P>
    <P>It is stated in the explanatory memorandum that sums of money can be awarded to a developer where he is held up.  The fact that this is written in law deters people from pursuing genuine grievances in court. Somebody once said about the courts that they were like the Gresham Hotel, that anybody could go in but it was only people with money who could afford to stay.  If a man hears that a factory or some other obstruction is to be put beside his residence <Col N="862" /> and he feels he should appeal he is afraid to do so because of the cost involved.  Residents' associations and private individuals are not very well represented legally at oral hearings. If they win and get costs they are of little relevance to the people who will be paying.  However, the appellant's costs could reach a very high sum and when he thinks of this he might decide not to appeal.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (i) (b) of this section the board could decide to award themselves £3,000 for their trouble.  The Minister says it was in the 1963 Act but we are now shifting the emphasis from the political arena to a board so we should be careful about sums of money which can be awarded.  If the Minister decided to do something like this he would be subject to political pressure. If he decided that in the case of a third party award £x should be awarded the pressure would be on but this board will be divorced from such a situation.  In the case of the board the judge can decide that the third party held up a contract and that he is awarding a certain sum of money.</P>
    <P>I believe section 16 is a very good one.  Everybody is concerned about frivolous appeals.  Some of them cost a lot of money but section 16 can deal very quickly with these frivolous appeals.  In this section we are now pointing the finger at the man-in-the-street and saying that he can be charged £x if he brings his case to an appeal.  Deputy Callanan said that this matter will drift out of the political arena and when it does we will not have much say in it.  I believe we should ensure that the man-in-the-street is not victimised in any way because of this.  Planning authorities usually do what they consider is in the best interest of planning.  They have helped to hold back destruction in a lot of areas around the country. We should look very seriously at anything which would deter a third party appellant from making an appeal. Section 17 is a very important section, although it is a section I fear.</P>

      <P>I realise that but I wanted to make this point.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter very seriously.  This is the one section where the man-in-the-street has a chance to go and make an appeal against the big man.  When he wants to make an appeal we should ensure that he is not afraid to do so.  The fear is there if one reads the explanatory memorandum and this section.  I would not be surprised if there were no more third-party appeals.  It would be a sad day not to have third-party appeals. We must encourage them, but if they are frivolous section 16 will deal with them very quickly.  There is a genuine fear not on the part of any one group but on the part of NATO, An Taisce, people who are concerned with the man-in-the-street.  I appeal to the Minister to look at the section again. I may be out of order, and I thank you, Sir, for giving me the time to make my point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, section 17 is similar to section 18 of the 1963 Act except for the change in relation to requiring appellants to pay to parties other than the planning authority or the board&mdash;Minister then and now the board.  Many people have queried this question of the board being authorised to levy expenses on appellants to be paid back to the board.</P>
      <P>I accept that the provision in the 1963 Act enabled the Minister to levy expenses to be paid to the Minister, but again there is the subtle distinction in that the Minister, being who he is and a Member of this Parliament and answerable to it, is in a different position when it comes to responsibility for his actions.  There is a good deal of disquiet about this question of giving the board power to levy expenses to be paid to themselves. Some people think it is unique. It possibly is.  Maybe the Minister could quote precedents where boards have been empowered previously to do this.  It would be a help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Haughey's amendment is ...covered by the Minister's one, and the amendment I have down&mdash;the <Col N="864" /> three are being taken together&mdash; merely elaborates on this question of regulations and asks that: &ldquo;As soon as may be the Minister shall cause a copy of the regulations to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and to be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>, and a copy to be sent to each Planning Authority.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would hope that the operation of section 17 will not act as a deterrent against legitimate planning appeals in particular coming from third parties, the people the Minister is trying to get at.  It has been expressed by a number of bodies that quite a large number of vexatious appeals have been lodged in the past by third parties which have delayed for many months, sometimes longer, very substantial developments with the consequent cost in interest rates on capital borrowed for these projects, the loss of employment, the general delay in development and the overall effect it would have on the economy if this device were being used excessively.</P>
    <P>However, the situation has changed, because we have passed a new section, section 16, which, the Minister must agree, deals fairly adequately with vexatious appeals.  This was not provided for in the earlier Act and possibly he would consider that the changes already agreed upon by the House may be adequate to act as a deterrent to vexatious appeals which have caused so much difficulty in the past.  There may not have been that many of them but certainly those who were affected by them were dealt with very unfairly and have a legitimate complaint about the Planning Act that it did not provide at that time against such a happening.</P>
    <P>We are hoping to cover that now in what we have done, and many people wonder if there is need for this elaborate section.  I would go along with the Minister in thinking that that power should be given, but I would like further explanation concerning the right of the board under subsection (3) (b) which reads:</P>
    <P>(b) in case the decision of the planning authority is confirmed on appeal, or where the decision is <Col N="865" /> varied on appeal, if the Board in determining the appeal does not accede in substance to the appellant's grounds of appeal, the Board, if it so thinks proper, may direct the appellant to pay &mdash;</P>
    <P>and then subparagraph (iii) reads:</P>
    <P>(iii)  to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>This may frighten a lot of people away but the board has that absolute discretion to levy compensation to themselves on appellants.  I think we can withdraw amendment No. 37 in Deputy Haughey's name, and I should like to hear from the Minister if he intends accepting amendment No. 37 (a) which, I think, is a logical enough follow-on to his own amendment No. 36.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion so far has been reasonable enough and represented what appears to be the views of certain people outside of this House.  It will be noted that they do not seem to have made much impression on the Members of the House, because I have not had a very big lobby from the Parliamentarians about this.  I did notice Press reports. I have always held that bodies set up have the right to express views on any matters they feel they are competent to express views on.  One thing I dislike is when people express views on matters in relation to which they do not take the trouble to check the facts.  It is amazing how often even national bodies fall into the trap of holding forth on matters and misstating facts which it would be quite simple to check but they do not take the trouble to do so.  Worse still, an officer of a national body will make a statement as representing the views of that body, and it may turn out afterwards the body did not know he was making the statement and many of them may be aware of the real situation and may not hold the same views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, while I agree entirely with the right of people&mdash;maybe they do not want to be called pressure <Col N="866" /> groups&mdash;to express these views, particularly when legislation is going through, it is odd that people who dash into the public Press do not take the trouble of sending a letter to the Minister for Local Government or to some of the representatives in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Molloy referred to the situation under the existing legislation.  Here there seems to be a complete ignorance of the facts on the part of some people outside this House.  I hope you will bear with me, Sir, because I should like to quote section 18, which is a little bit lengthy, as I want to make points on it.  Subsection (1) of section 18 says:</P>
    <P>Where an appeal is made to the Minister under this Act or under any order under this Act against a decision of a planning authority&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Minister, if he so thinks proper and irrespective of the result of the appeal, may direct the planning authority to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to the appellant, such sum as the Minister, in his absolute discretion specifies as compensation to the appellant for the expense occasioned to him in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to the Minister, such sum as, in his absolute discretion, he specifies as compensation to him towards the expenses incurred by him in relation to the hearing of the appeal;</P>
    <P>(b)  if, but only if, the appeal fails, the Minister, if he so thinks proper, may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to the planning authority, such sum as the Minister, in his absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the planning authority for the expenses occasioned to them in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to the Minister, such sum as, in his absolute discretion, he specifies as compensation to him towards the expense incurred by him in relation to the appeal</P>
    <P>(2)  Any sum directed under this section to be paid shall, in default <Col N="867" /> of being paid, be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>That is the 1963 Act.  The number of people and organisations who were not aware of the fact that that provision was there has amazed me.  At the time the Minister for Local Government promised the House this would not be used except in very exceptional circumstances and that promise was honoured.</P>

      <P>There is really very little difference except on what Deputy Molloy might regard as two major points: No. 1, it is a planning board and (2) the question of compensation. Instead of the Minister awarding it to himself it is a planning board. On the question of compensation Deputy Fergus O'Brien fell into the trap set for him and, indeed, for many like him who are interested in this matter, by those outside who should know the facts but have not gone to the trouble of checking them.  I do not blame Deputy O'Brien at all for taking up the point made publicly by very learned legal people as if it were a fact and, apparently, it has not been contradicted.  I want to contradict it now.  The claim is that, if section 17 is adopted in its present form, every appellant will be faced with the possibility of an open-ended award against him, not alone with the legal costs of other parties but with any figure the appeal board choose to state as their own costs, plus any other expenses occasioned to any other party in relation to the appeal.  The point is this could include the loss of profits suffered by a developer during the period taken by the appeals board to consider the matter.  This, of course, is entirely wrong.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17th January.  It is an article by Michael Viney, environment correspondent, and it is claimed by Mr. John O'Loughlin, director of An Taisce, that section 17 of the Planning Bill involves a serious erosion of individual rights and an obvious divergence from past traditions of Irish law.  It was examined by the parliamentary committee and the Incorporated Law Society and let me say that the parliamentary committee and the Incorporated Law Society have made no protest to the Department on this.  I mention the fact because I think it is wrong that anybody should represent something as being a fact when it is not a fact.  There is no question of loss of profits suffered by a developer during the period taken, as it is put here.</P>
      <P>It has been contended that section 17 (1) (b) (ii) would enable the board to direct a third party appellant to pay a developer for loss of profits during the period taken by the appeal or other interest charges on land which could not be developed during that period.  The provision, as drafted. will not enable the board to award such payments.  It relates to costs or other expenses of an appeal.  It does not cover costs arising because of or by reason of the appeal.  It was never envisaged that the section should cover such costs.  The legal advice available to us&mdash;it is fairly high legal advice&mdash;confirms that it does not, in fact, do so.  Here we have a section of one Bill which, apart from the fact that we have changed it from giving costs to the Minister, gives costs to the board and we have, in fact, added this section that the expenses of the board, if they so think proper, and irrespective of the results of the appeal, may direct the planning authority to pay:</P>
      <P>(i)  to the appellant, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the appellant for the expenses occasioned to him in relation to the appeal,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation <Col N="869" /> to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal;</P>
    <P>(b)  in case the decision of the planning authority is confirmed on appeal, or where the decision is varied on appeal, if the Board in determining the appeal does not accede in substance to the appellant's grounds of appeal, the Board, if it so thinks proper, may direct the appellant to pay&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  to the planning authority, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the planning authority for the expense occasioned to them in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(ii)  to any of the other parties to the appeal, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion, specifies as compensation to the party for the costs or other expenses occasioned to him in relation to the appeal,</P>
    <P>(iii)  to the Board, such sum as the Board, in its absolute discretion specifies as compensation to the Board towards the expense incurred by the Board in relation to the hearing of the appeal.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any sum directed under this section to be paid shall, in default of being paid, be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I have an amendment to this and the amendment is as follows:</P>
    <P>In page 9, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The Minister may by regulations specify matters which are to be taken into account by the board before giving a direction under this section and any matters which are for the time being so specified shall, where they are relevant to a particular appeal and the board considers exercising in relation to the appeal a power conferred on it by subsection (1) of this section, be so taken into account by the board.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The situation is that we are making <Col N="870" /> a slight change, not a Draconian one, as has been suggested, in the existing legislation.  The amendment is put in for the purpose of improving the existing legislation.  Yet, we have this furore outside the House about it. Within the House we did not appear to have the same approach.  I do not object, I repeat, to interested parties having an appeal.  I think it would be a pity if individuals and groups interested in these matters did not have the right of appeal and I shall do everything I possibly can to ensure that that right is maintained.  On the other hand, they should at least accept the fact that this House is not out to try to make them pay through the nose for exercising that right.  They must know that and it is wrong that a cry should go up that we are doing things we simply are not doing.  For that reason, I feel that my amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>The Minister said I may have fallen into a trap.  If one reads the last portion of the explanatory memorandum one finds the following:</P>
      <P>This section is similar to section 18 of the Act of 1963 except that provision is now made for payment by appellants to parties other than those previously covered e.g. to a developer who, having obtained permission, is being held up or obstructed by unwarranted use of the appeals machinery.</P>
      <P>The ordinary layman reading that, if a developer is held up and obstructed by unwarranted use of the appeals machinery and an award is made against a third party, will conclude that the developer will be looking for some compensation for an overdraft on which he is paying interest, or because of the fact that he is paying workmen on an unproductive site.  It is easy for people to fall into that trap reading that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, an order was never made against a third party appellant since 1963 awarding costs against him. I do not see the need for this because from 1963 to 1975 no award has been made.  Not only are we now using the 1963 Act, but we are bringing in additional <Col N="871" /> people who may claim.  There may be a furore and there may be misunderstandings, but the bottom portion of the explanatory memorandum to section 17 causes me concern. It could be construed to suggest that this would be possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I explain it to Deputy O'Brien?  One of the reasons why this mistake appears to have been made is that some people have been reading the two parts of the explanatory memorandum to section 17 separately. If Deputy O'Brien will go through it with me, I am quite sure he will agree that, while it may appear to say one thing if it is read in one way, if it is read in its entirety it means exactly what I have been saying. It says:</P>
      <P>This section enables the Board to direct a planning authority to pay appeal expenses to the appellant or to the Board.  Where an appellant is unsuccessful, he may be directed by the Board to pay appeal expenses to the planning authority, to any other party to the appeal or to the Board itself.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Appeal expenses&rdquo; are the words.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>Sums payable are recoverable as a simple contract debt.  The section is similar to section 18 of the Act of 1963 except that provision is now made for payment by appellants to parties other than those previously covered e.g. to a developer who, having obtained permission, is being held up or obstructed by unwarranted use of the appeals machinery.</P>
      <P>The error is being caused by the fact that appeal expenses are not carried from the first part of the explanation of the section to the second part.  In fact, it refers only to appeal expenses and no other expenses are involved. Deputy O'Brien would be the first to agree that that being so it is not the type of section which some people have tried to put it across as being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority or any large developer can muster the best legal advice and the third party appellant generally comes in with at <Col N="872" /> best a solicitor or maybe a junior counsel.  He is up against it from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; because of the expertise mustered against him.  If the case goes against him, the third party appellant has much more expenses to pay by virtue of the guns used against him than he would get in the event of winning his case.</P>
      <P>This section is loaded against the small man and not against the big man.  That is my objection to it.  I hold strong views about the fact that if the person who can afford to get the best legal advice loses it does not cost him all that much, but if he wins the third party appellant may have to pay.  I realise that it has never happened before but things are changing.  It is going into a new arena now.  The chairman may look at it differently.  I am certainly unhappy about the situation.</P>

      <P>In giving an explanation to Deputy O'Brien on the point he made, the Minister quoted from the explanatory memorandum the words &ldquo;appeal expenses&rdquo; which appear in the second line of the explanation of section 17.

      <P>The important thing is that we must protect the third party even if this causes a little delay.  We must protect the ordinary man in the street.  It is important that we should thresh and tease this out.  This is in the 1963 Act and it was never used. It is superfluous.  I agree that there were frivolous appeals and scandalous hold ups and people lost considerable sums of money.  The third party should be allowed to have a free rein. He is not concerned with frivolous appeals.  An Taisce are a responsible organisation and they may have made that statement without checking certain facts.  They do a lot of good work.  The residents associations and these groups are the backbone of our society and anything which would deter them would be bad legislation. We must ensure that the third party appellant will not be harassed and surcharged considerable sums of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier on the Minister was not quite fair to Deputy O'Brien because this is a new area which is being covered now.  It was not covered in the 1963 Act that a third party, a person, can be obliged to pay expenses to parties other than the planning authority or the Minister.  This is what is new in the section and the Minister's explanation stated that.  This is where the fear has arisen.  It is easy for a third group to understand the type of expenses which a planning authority or the Minister's officials may run up but what they baulk at is the type of expenses which a developer may run up if this is the person against whom they lodge a third party objection.  I, as well as Deputy O'Brien, would be happier if the Minister would write in, in greater detail, that the expenses would be confined <Col N="874" /> to appeal machinery expenses, that there would be no question of the developer afterwards claiming compensation for loss of profits or for high interest paid over a long period awaiting an appeal decision on a third party plea against him.  I should like to see that clearly written in&mdash;not now, but I would like an indication that he would agree to include it on Report Stage.  We merely need a record of it&mdash;there are so many things to be included on Report Stage. It will be a very long Stage when we get to it, and it will be like going through Committee Stage again but the Minister will have the advantage that we shall be confined to one speech and unless we have all our thoughts assimilated beforehand we shall not be able to make long contributions. This is not really our intention which is to get the best deal we can for the community we serve.</P>
      <P>There is this fear of something new. The guarantee should be given in words and given clearly.  I think it was Deputy Blaney who, as Minister, brought the 1963 Planning Act before the House and during the discussion then, as the present Minister has already said, a guarantee was given that section 18 of that Act would not be used except in very exceptional circumstances.  Can the Minister now give a guarantee that the board will only use these powers in very exceptional circumstances and can continue that tradition?  The Minister's word was honoured on the previous occasion.  I do not think the Minister was able to quote any case where compensation had been charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no case.  In fact, it was never used.  If we had the assurance that a similar approach would be adopted by the board it would be of great help.  We are asking the Minister to speak now for a group which when appointed may become quite independent and like to speak for themselves and interpret the Act as it is laid down here.  So, we are asking that the black and white should include this prohibition <Col N="875" /> on any expenses otherwise.  Expenses can be high even as it stands if a lot of foreign specialists on whom the Minister was very keen the other night are brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not keen on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was asking for special exemption for foreign specialists so that they would not have to go through any competition to get the job of acting as consultant to the board.  If a developer decides to bring in persons he and the Minister considers are specialists, with greater expert knowledge, their fees can be quite substantial and you could frighten off third party appellants.</P>
      <P>Very strong views have been expressed to the Minister, as they were expressed to me when I was there, by developers against groups lodging appeals against them when they had got permission from the local authority.  Once the local authority granted permission they felt free to go ahead and were annoyed if some other group outside the planning authority or the Minister appealed the decision and caused them delay, expense and the inconvenience of having to present a case to justify a development about which they had already convinced the local authority. There may be an over-reaction against the few vexatious and frivolous appeals but I am sure that a proper survey of third party appeals would show that some of them served the community well.  Even if the percentage is small it is an important aspect of planning that the ordinary citizen is entitled to have his views taken into account despite what the official view may be and that he should be able to argue his case cogently, logically and, perhaps, bring about a change in the official stance.  There have been cases where the local authority decision has been reversed following a third party appeal.  I accept that was not the norm.  Even if the percentage is small, still a service was being provided there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to balance things out the <Col N="876" /> Minister has been asked to put down in a form of words in the Bill something that will meet everybody's point of view.  That is what we are trying to do.  While I am satisfied generally, I would ask that some additional words be included to give that greater guarantee and also if he could give some assurance that the board on appointment would give the undertaking that this section would be used only in very exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>Is there to be any procedure for claims for compensation?  If a developer who is granted permission has a third party appeal against him and wins and that costs him a good deal of money and he is entitled to compensation, is there any procedure by which he can lodge a claim?  Or, is this to be a matter that will be solely the prerogative of the planning board and for them to decide?  I know the developer could write a letter asking the board to consider granting compensation but we should have all these things tidied up while we are dealing with the Bill.  Perhaps in the regulations proposed in amendment No. 36 a line or two laying down some procedure might be of assistance.</P>
    <P>In arriving at this compensation could the Minister give some examples of how the amount would be assessed?  Could he give some more details on the regulations he proposes under amendment No. 36?  What type of consideration is it expected or proposed should be taken into account by the board in arriving at compensation?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Both sides of the House seem to be agreed on something I have repeated at least a half dozen times, that the whole object of this debate is to ensure that we get a planning Bill that will work properly. I am glad it appears to be accepted that the planning board will behave reasonably.  As regards my comment about foreign experts, I was not very anxious to bring them in but I wanted to ensure that if it were necessary, particularly in regard to atomic energy or some matter like that about which we may not know very much here, and we required experts from <Col N="877" /> outside, we should not preclude them from being brought in.  I should not like to be misinterpreted on this point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney gave an assurance when he introduced the previous measure that this provision would not be used except in very exceptional circumstances and, of course, I am prepared to agree that I should make clear to the planning board that that is the proposal, that this is what we want done.  I do not believe anybody thinks we are trying to prevent third party appeals from being processed in the normal way.</P>
      <P>When the question of introducing this Bill in its present form was being considered a number of matters were under discussion.  For instance, when we talk about expenditure the question of the cost to local authorities and, therefore, to the ratepayers of the country arises.  Huge expenses are incurred when some firms make a planning appeal bringing experts from all over the place and the cost has to be borne by the ratepayers.  I seriously considered attempting to ensure that this cost be put on the back of the people who would benefit by the planning appeal, but, perhaps, wiser council persuaded me that it was not the proper way to do it and that is the reason it is not included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Everybody will have sympathy with the idea that people who want to have these things done should pay a certain amount towards their cost.  I would hate to think that a third party objector, no matter who he might be, should be prevented from making his objection because he was afraid of the expense at a later stage, providing the objection was on a reasonable basis.  We know of objections which have been raised by people who have no connection with the development and this is dealt with under another section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to ensure that if the necessity arises, if there are exceptional circumstances as was intended in the 1963 Act for such an appeal, we should have it included here.  Deputy Molloy posed a number of questions and talked about the developer who, <Col N="878" /> having obtained planning permission from the local authority, felt he was put to a lot of expense because of a long delay over an appeal.  That has nothing to do with this at all.  Such a person cannot claim any loss has occurred because of a long delay.  All that can be taken into consideration is the expense of the appeal and this is spelled out in the section.  The expense incurred by holding lands or paying a high rate of interest does not arise and is not included.  I am sure some people may feel aggrieved by this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  We are talking about expenses relating to an appeal and nothing else.  In my view it is clear, if we want to see what is in it.  Deputy Haughey was of the opinion that we should have it dealt with in a different way.  When I was in Opposition I always objected to legislation by regulations&mdash;as has been suggested by Deputy Haughey here&mdash;because I felt there was a danger that the House might not know what was intended.  Having come over here I am still satisfied that it is not the best way to do it but in view of the proposals being made here I have put in an amendment which suggests something on the lines of what Deputy Haughey put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Opposition are prepared, particularly Deputy Molloy, to accept either my amendment or my assurance that I will tell the new board what is intended with regard to this section we have reached the necessary <Col N="879" /> agreement because this is exactly how it was handled when the 1963 Bill was going through the House.  It would be unfair to hold this section much longer.  I agree there appears to be a lot of emotion from certain organisations outside about this but I can assure them, and the House, that there is no intention of preventing them appealing.  Even if there was they have the right of appeal.  One of the groups who felt this would prevent them taking an appeal because they might have to pay certain costs have taken two High Court actions against me as a result of a decision I gave.  I do not think it is reasonable to assume that this will deter them. They are entitled to do this and they will continue to make their appeals. I would hate to think that anyone would be prevented from making an appeal because of a fear of something like this, a fear which they should not have because this was not intended in the Bill and the Bill does not read as if this was intended.</P>

      <P>That is a difficult question.  The only reply I can give to the Deputy is that I assume that it would relate to the cost of taking certain evidence at the appeal.  I do not see how anything else could be included.  The board would have the absolute discretion to decide how much of the legal advice and expert evidence was necessary.  I understand that on some occasions people brought in a battalion of experts to give evidence when one or two people would have done the job just as well.</P>

Cork County Council granted planning permission for the smelter and the company appealed some of the conditions but there were many third party appeals from organisations in the Cork area.  The array of experts presented by the company and the expense that would have caused would amount to an astronomical figure. <Col N="880" /> What Deputy O'Brien, and the House, are anxious to avoid is a situation where residents objecting to something of a large scale which would be supported by large sums of foreign money would be frightened away because of the possibility of being landed with a bill for the expenses involved later.</P>

Deputy Molloy has referred to a case where there was enormous expense and where an order could have been made against that firm.

      <P>I do not know.  If we have confidence in the board&mdash;and we must have; otherwise we are damned fools for allowing a board to be appointed&mdash;they will have to be responsible people.  We expect that if they are told by the Minister for Local Government &ldquo;This is not something you can use lightly.  You are not entitled to use this, or you should not use this except in very <Col N="881" /> exceptional circumstances&rdquo; they will carry that through.  Surely wording to that effect should ensure that there would be no danger of something occurring.  As I have said, it has not occurred with a Minister.  Perhaps the Minister might be quicker to do that sort of thing than the board.  In most cases probably the Minister would get more kudos for doing it than the board.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to be doubting Deputies' attitude to the board.  I have the height of confidence in this board.  The board will be an independent body, judging and investigating cases.  The Minister says this will be done in exceptional cases only.  I believe that exceptional cases will have been dealt with before they ever get to the board&mdash;that is, under section 16.  But, assuming they go to the board, if I am representing a client, as a Senior Counsel&mdash;the hearing is over and, at a later stage, a decision is made&mdash;I would be writing, on behalf of my client seeking expenses and quoting the relevant sections of the Act, stating that under the Act it is my view that I am entitled to expenses for my client.</P>

      <P>A claim against the appellant.  But he is now, say, dealing with a cold, calculating board.  I would have the height of confidence in this board.  Were I on that board and a request was made by a Senior Counsel, the fact that he quoted the <Col N="882" /> relevant Act would impel me to look at it and say &ldquo;Yes, there are indeed reasons why&mdash;and it is written into the Act&mdash;I should award moneys against the third party appellant because in the view of the board his case was not good.  It may not have been frivolous but it was not very strongly put and it was the view of the board that it delayed development for an undue period of time. Therefore we feel that at least the expenses of the appeal should be levied.&rdquo; I could well foresee a board doing this as their duty.  As I have said, this board will be an impartial body; there will be no outside influences whatsoever on it.</P>

      <P>Is there any hope of agreement here?  I thought we were very close to agreement some time ago.  In my opinion there is very little difference: it is simply whether or not we can persuade the board to do exactly as was being done by the Minister under the appeal machinery up to now.  I assume that is what is intended.  If Deputy Blaney's assurance was accepted and honoured, I see no reason why the same procedure should not be adopted now.  If that is so, then we have disposed of the matter without amending the section at all.  If that is not acceptable, would Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Brien consider either my amendment or Deputy Haughey's&mdash;the question of making regulations&mdash;though, as I have said, I am not one in favour of legislation by regulations.  If it can be spelt out, I should much prefer that that be done; or there is the third <Col N="883" /> alternative, which is not a good one, the suggestion that we might go back and see if we could change the wording. I do not see any way of improving the wording of this that would effect the difference we want.  I should prefer that we leave the section as it stands and insist that the board carry out the same procedure as is being done under existing legislation.  If that were acceptable and we could dispose of it this evening, we should have made some progress.</P>

      <P>I tried to spell it out earlier but it is extremely difficult.  I would imagine that the regulations would have to deal with the particular way in which the whole question of expenses would be handled.  I am not too happy about this way of dealing with it at all.  I would much prefer that it was done in the way in which it was dealt with previously.  However, I think the whole question of bringing it back and putting it through this House is nonsensical.  I would much prefer to have it written into the Bill itself rather than try to bring things as a separate entity into the House.  I do not think that is the proper way to do it.  What I propose doing in the regulations, as far as I can, is to specify matters which the board must take into consideration before directing a person to pay a sum under section 17, <Col N="885" /> which is what Deputy Molloy was talking about.  I should like to be able to say to the board: &ldquo;Except in very extreme circumstances you are not to deal with it in this way at all.&rdquo;</P>
