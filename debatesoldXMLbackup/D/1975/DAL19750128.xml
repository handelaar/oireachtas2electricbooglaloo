    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government had any contact with the British Government during the recent ceasefire; and, if so, the nature and purpose of the contact.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It would not be in accordance with practice to reveal details of such contacts between the two Governments. I may say, however, that the purpose of the contacts was to keep the Government informed of the situation as it developed, and to ensure that, in turn, their views were known to the British Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if the nature of the representations made to the British Government were designed to ensure, or try to insist, that the British Government would make some move to assist in the continuance of the ceasefire, as was mentioned at that time?  Was it on these lines the representations were made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice to reveal the representations made but, as I mentioned in the reply, part of the exchange was for the purpose of ensuring that the British Government were aware of the views of the Government here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach why no prosecution was brought in connection with a road accident on the 1st June, 1973, at Curraghbeg, Skibbereen, County Cork, resulting in the death of a person (name supplied).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General, having given full consideration to this case, directed that a criminal charge in respect of the manner of driving of the motor vehicle involved was not warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there were serious lighting defects in the car in question and also serious defects in respect of at least one tyre and, if so, would he say why a prosecution was not initiated under the Road Traffic Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, it is not the practice to give reasons why a prosecution is taken or why a decision is taken not to prosecute and, in the circumstances, I cannot add anything further to the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the matter and in view of the fact that a man lost his life, would the Taoiseach not think it worthwhile saying why it was decided that proceedings should not be initiated in this particular case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate what the Deputy says and the circumstances he mentions in connection with the case but he will, I think, on reflection, appreciate that it has never been the practice to give reasons why a prosecution is taken or, on the other hand, why a prosecution is not taken, and to depart from that practice could interfere with the principles of natural justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that invariably when life is lost as a result of an accident there is a prosecution even though the blame may be assessed on a degree of responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy is correct in saying &ldquo;invariably&rdquo;.  I suppose it generally happens, but the Attorney General considered all the facts of this case and decided that a prosecution did not lie.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the file, but this is not a matter for me to express an opinion.  It is the Attorney General who is the appropriate officer in this regard and is not a question of what my opinion is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if this was the Attorney General's decision and not a recommendation from or the decision of the local Garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary state if the practice of the State contributing to the social insurance fund will be abandoned in the new legislation coming up next month?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance pointed out in his budget speech, over a six-year period there will be a phasing out and, as the Tánaiste stated in the Dáil some time ago, the whole financing of social services and social welfare is under examination at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary say whether at the end of this six-year period the cost of contributions to workers and employers will be increased by £6 million to £10 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with the Deputy's estimation.  As I said, the whole financing of the health services and the social welfare services is under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not appear from what the Minister for Finance said in the course of his budget statement that the financing will now rest mainly on contributions paid jointly by the workers and the employers, and does that not imply that the State will cease to make any contribution to the cost of the stamp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I recollect, the Minister for Finance said that the object would be to bring the situation more into line with what is normally the position in the other EEC countries. I can assure the Deputy that, when the full examination of the financing of the social services is completed, there will be ample opportunity for all interested parties to comment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a clear indication in what the Minister for Finance said in his budget speech that the State will no longer contribute to the cost of the stamp for insured workers and, therefore, that will mean an extra burden on workers and employers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>As my Department does not maintain a register of children's allowance claimants on the basis of post office of payment, I regret that I am unable to supply the information sought by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gave the exact same answer?  Surely there is an obligation on his Department to ascertain the circumstances in which these moneys are paid.  If he has not got the exact figure, has he an approximate figure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very difficult. My information is that it would be necessary to examine individually some 400,000 records of claimants in order to establish at which post office the payment was made.  I think the Deputy would agree that the work involved would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything which would eliminate the hardship which these ladies have to endure before they get this money would be justified.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the manner in which it is paid but, as the Deputy is aware, children's allowance does not have to be collected at a particular time or on a particular day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I am pointing out the difficulty.  If everyone arrives at 10 o'clock in the morning to collect children's allowance, it is not possible to have everybody paid instantaneously.  That does not apply only to children's allowance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy describes as hardship is, in fact, some delay in trying to deal with a relatively large number of people who arrive simultaneously for payment. The only way I could see to eliminate that would be to have an individual <Col N="1066" /> officer for every individual claimant.  Every possible effort is made to ensure that payment is made as speedily and as courteously as possible within the realm of practicality.</P>

      <P>The frequency of attendance required of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit claimants varies according to distance from the appropriate local office of my Department.  Generally speaking, daily attendance is normally required only of persons residing within a two-mile radius.  All other claimants within a range of six miles attend either once or twice a week.  The general arrangements for attendance to sign a register as evidence of unemployment are not regarded as unreasonable and are considered to represent the minimum safeguard for the prevention of abuses.  I should like to add, however, that whenever special factors, such as exceptional numbers of claimants, are likely to create hardship in queuing or to otherwise impair standards of service to the public at a particular office, authorisation is given for relaxing the general signing arrangements on a temporary basis according as the local circumstances require.</P>

In view of the confidential nature of their duties it is considered that branch managers should not be known adherents of a political party or be members of county councils or other local authorities.  Furthermore it is regarded as most important that branch managers should not be left open to charges of political bias in the discharge of their special functions on behalf of the Department.</P>

      <P>The decision of the Government was that we should set St. Patrick's Day aside as a day of national commemoration and to commemorate on that day all who died for Ireland.  There are two different ways of doing it and the way I have outlined is the way the Government have decided on.  In my view the setting aside of that day as a day of national commemoration was, in present times, a wise decision.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to a previous question last month, the sail training committee decided to make inquiries from appropriate independent specialists about certain aspects of the plans before tenders for the construction of the proposed new sail training vessel were invited.  The inquiries have been completed and, at a meeting before Christmas, the committee decided that tenders should be sought as soon as possible for the construction of the vessel which, as recently announced, the Government has decided will be named &ldquo;Brendan&rdquo;.  Such tenders will be sought by my Department at a very early date.</P>
      <P>It may not be possible to have &ldquo;Brendan&rdquo; completed in time to compete in the transatlantic race of the Sail Training Association which is due to commence in May, 1976.  A recent survey of &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; has revealed that very extensive repairs would have to be carried out if that vessel were to be used again for sail training.  The sail training committee is, therefore, considering the question of getting another vessel to continue such training, pending the building of &ldquo;Brendan&rdquo;, the vessel to compete in the transatlantic race if &ldquo;Brendan&rdquo; has not been completed by then.</P>

Further works planned but not yet commenced include: (1) additional billet accommodation at Finner Camp and improvements to dining and cooking facilities there, (2) the installation of central heating in Rockhill House, (3) extensions to the dining and canteen facilities at Connolly Barracks, Longford and (4) the construction of a new military barracks at Monaghan and major building works at Dundalk on which I have commented in my reply to the previous questions.</P>

The information I have is that when oil spills occur, particularly at sea, the position is that a large number of small boats, such as, for example, trawlers, which could approach it with a dispersant is more effective than, say, one large boat.  Therefore, arrangements are being carried out and the Naval Service will co-operate to the full.</P>

The incubation period of Lassa fever is approximately 20 days, but in some countries it is 17 days.  Within the period from the 10th January to Monday last, it would be well nigh impossible to trace the various people with whom he had contact, with the exception of his immediate family.

    <Title>Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is a further step in the Government's programme of tax reform. In the Government's view the existing tax system is inequitable and indefensible in that huge tax-free capital gains can be made by people of means while less fortunate people are inescapably obliged to pay significant slices of their regular income in tax. Under this Bill it is proposed to tax realised capital gains.  Whether a capital gain is fortuitous or as a consequence of deliberate design, the maker of such a gain can reasonably be expected to pay a proportion of it in tax without hardship.</P>
      <P>As things stand at present, a person with means surplus to current needs can easily arrange to invest in low yielding investments with a view to converting them in due course into substantial tax-free capital gains.  Clearly such gains are postponed income and in equity should be liable to tax as long as other incomes are so liable.  The purpose of this Bill will be to collect tax at the lowest income rate of 26 per cent when such gains are realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the greatest hinderances to tax reform is the fallacious assumption <Col N="1101" /> held by many that the <i>status quo</i> is better than anything which could replace it.  Regrettably the notion that &ldquo;the devil you know is better than the devil you don't know&rdquo; has been the foundation of much of the lethargy surrounding the unreformed Irish taxation system.  But when, as is apparent, a tax system creates or maintains social imbalance and economic inefficiency, it is time to alter that system.</P>
    <P>As I have frequently acknowledged, amendment of the tax system is a complicated and perilous task.  The provision of concessions and exemptions, measures to avoid anomalies and provisions to prevent avoidance and evasion perforce result in complicated legislation.  This Bill unfortunately is no exception to this general rule.</P>
    <P>The Government were elected with a mandate to design a system of capital taxation to replace death duties, which are due to be eliminated as from April next.  Because of the difficulty of establishing conclusively the detailed effects of any proposed tax changes on social justice, business motivation and economic efficiency the Government published, as the House is aware, in February last a White Paper on Capital Taxation.  It was pointed out in the White Paper that death duties, the only form of capital taxation in Ireland, have two major defects: firstly, that they are imposed at a time of family bereavement on the family assets left by the principal family breadwinner and that because of past failure to revise the rates and thresholds of tax they are in many cases penally confiscatory.</P>
    <P>On the other hand while death duties can certainly tax capital gains made during life if the maker of the gain has not taken avoidance action, liability to death duties can be easily avoided, and in fact has most frequently been avoided by timely anticipation and various sophisticated measures by people with the most means.  Equity clearly demands that if income tax be inescapable, capital taxation be equally inescapable.  There is no merit in maintaining a tax system in which one tax is compulsory while the other is voluntary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> As indicated in the Capital Taxation White Paper published last February the Government see a capital gains tax as improving the equity of the tax system.  The taxing of such gains in many countries reflects the widely held conviction that such gains, even though irregular and though arising from different circumstances, should be treated as a form of income, and, as such, liable to a tax related in some way to the normal income tax.  The absence of any tax on capital gains in the 'sixties and 'seventies gave rise to injustices in so far as those who realised capital gains, particularly from dealings in land and property, were placed at a considerable advantage compared with the great majority whose rising incomes were subjected to the full impact of income taxation.  The White Paper indicated that the new charge to capital gains tax would commence from 6th April, 1974.</P>
    <P>The views of interested persons and organisations were invited on the White Paper proposals for a new system of capital taxation and I am happy to say that the invitation was well received.  Many helpful and constructive representations were made by the main representative organisations and by considerable numbers of private business and individuals. During the period of consultation I met deputations from various organisations and discussed the proposals and their implications for different sectors of the economy.  Perhaps the most significant aspect of the representations which I received was the general acceptance of the desirability of introducing a capital gains tax. Such points of dissent from the Government's outline proposals as were made related in the main to rates and exemptions.  The two significant changes in the capital gains tax outline are, firstly, a reduction in the rate from 35 per cent to 26 per cent in line with the reform of the personal income tax structure, made in my 1974 Budget, and, secondly, the complete exemption from tax of gains on the sale of a principal private residence and ancillary grounds of up to one acre instead of the first £15,000 <Col N="1103" /> gain on the disposal of such a residence.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill as circulated to Deputies before Christmas reflected the benefits of the consultative process and suggestions from many interests on the operation of the new tax.  Many of these changes are rather technical in character, but there are two which might be mentioned at the outset:</P>
    <P>(1)  gifts are to be treated as disposals for the purpose of the capital gains tax.  It has been necessary to treat gifts in this way as otherwise gift arrangements could be fabricated to avoid capital gains tax. Under section 9 of the Bill, however, it is provided that disposals of assets by way of gift prior to the date of publication of the Bill, namely, 20th December, 1974, will not give rise to chargeable gains or allowable losses.</P>
    <P>(2)  in addition to the exemption in section 27 which follows generally the White Paper proposal, of all gains made by an individual of 55 years and over on the disposal of a farm or business to one or more of his children or, as I will provide later on, to a nephew or niece in deserving cases, if the consideration does not exceed £150,000, it has been decided as an extension of this relief to provide for the exemption of gains on retirement disposals of farms or businesses to any person where the consideration does not exceed £50,000.  This is provided for in section 26.  Needless to say any individual who benefits under section 27 cannot also benefit from the relief under section 26.</P>
    <P>I will now go briefly through the various provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 2 is concerned with the various definitions used in the Bill. Section 3 is the main charging section and levies a tax of 26 per cent on all chargeable gains accruing in 1974-75 and subsequent years of assessment. However, an alternative basis of charge for individuals is provided for in section 6.  Section 4 applies the tax <Col N="1104" /> to all persons, including companies, unincorporated bodies and trusts as well as individuals.  Persons resident in the State will be liable to capital gains tax on all gains realised on the disposal of chargeable assets, wherever those assets are situated. Non-residents will be liable only in respect of gains on the disposal of real estate, mineral rights, or business assets within the State or of exploration or exploitation rights on our Continental Shelf.  Non-residents will also be liable when disposing of unquoted shares which derive their value from such assets.  Under section 5 the due date for payment of the tax is either three months after the end of the tax year in which the gain accrued or two months after the date of assessment, whichever is later.  This means that no revenue from this new tax will fall due for payment before the second half of 1975.  Section 6, as I have already mentioned, deals with an alternative basis of charge available in certain circumstances to individuals. Under this section an individual will be able to have half of the first £5,000 of his capital gains and the whole of any excess over £5,000 treated as income for income tax purposes.  This alternative should prove attractive to a taxpayer whose income from other sources is relatively modest.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that in general all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of the tax, whether the property is situated inside the State or outside it, including incorporeal property generally.  Section 8 deals with disposals of assets.  Disposals will include all changes of ownership of assets whether by sale, exchange, transfer or gift.  Section 9 provides that the acquisition and disposal of an asset will be deemed to be for a consideration equal to its market value.  Where assets are transferred otherwise than by a sale on the open market, the market value of the asset must be substituted for the consideration, if any, given or received. Section 10 indicates the time at which a disposal and acquisition are deemed to be made and provides specifically for such transactions as conditional contracts, compulsory <Col N="1105" /> acquisition of lands and hire-purchase contracts.  Section 11 deals with the computation of chargeable gains and applies the rules embodied in Schedules 1 to 3 of the Bill.  Under section 12 allowance will be given for losses, which will be computed on the same basis as chargeable gains.  As a general principle a loss will not be allowable if a gain on the same transaction would not be a chargeable gain.  Allowable losses, not before 1974-75, may be carried forward for set off against subsequent capital gains, to the extent that they have not already been allowed.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that the gains and losses of a husband and wife will be aggregated and the husband will be liable for the tax on the total gains.  A husband and wife may, on application, be assessed separately on their individual gains but this will not have the effect of reducing the total tax liability. Disposals of assets between spouses will not give rise to a charitable gain or to an allowable loss.  Section 14 deals with situations arising out of deaths.  It provides that death shall not constitute a disposal.  The legatee will be deemed to acquire the assets at their cost to the deceased and any gain on a later disposal will be calculated by reference to that cost.  The section also provides that where an individual dies with a net balance of allowable losses, these may be carried back, for up to three years of assessment before death. Section 15 deals with the treatment of trusts and trustees.  The trustees of a settlement will be treated as a single and continuing body of persons and will be chargeable on the disposal of any trust assets on this basis.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, covering sections 16 to 24, deals with exemptions and reliefs from the tax and provides exexemption for certain bodies as well as exemption for certain types of assets and transactions.  Section 16 provides for the exemption of gains not exceeding £500 a year in the case of an individual. Section 17 exempts from tax sales by individuals of chattels where the proceeds do not exceed £2,000. Chattels would include such items as paintings, jewellery, silverware.</P>
    <P>Section 18 exempts from tax <Col N="1106" /> tangible moveable property which is a wasting asset such as a motor car. Sections 19 to 21 and section 24 indicate the types of assets which will be exempt.  Examples are Government, local authority and statesponsored body securities, land bonds, prize bonds and sweepstake winnings, life assurance policies, superannuation funds, compensation for personal injury.  Sections 22 and 23 indicate the bodies which will be exempt, namely, charities, local authorities, trade unions, friendly societies and the Central Bank of Ireland. Section 25 exempts gains accruing to an individual on the disposal of his principal private residence including grounds of up to one acre.  Section 26 and 27 will grant relief from tax in the case of certain disposals of farms or businesses by persons of 55 years and over.  This relief is being given in order to encourage the early transfer of business to the younger generation and also in recognition of the fact that part of the realisation price of such farm or business represents the provision for old age of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 26 is a general relief as it applies to transfers to any person but the relief is confined to a consideration of £50,000 or less.  Section 27, on the other hand, applies where the owner disposes of his farm or business to one or more of his children and, in this case, the limit on the consideration is £150,000.  I intend to extend this provision to cover the case of a disposal to a nephew or niece who stands, as it were, in the shoes of a child and who has been involved in the running of the business or farm for at least five years before the disposal.  For this purpose, I propose to introduce a Committee Stage amendment.  Where the consideration referred to in these two sections exceeds the limits indicated, marginal relief as explained in the Bill will be given.  To prevent abuse these reliefs can be availed of only once in the lifetime of an individual and, in the case of the relief for the sale to the immediate family, this will be withdrawn if the farm or business is subsequently sold outside the family <Col N="1107" /> within the following ten years.  I may add that provision is being made under section 30 to exempt from the consideration received for disposal of a farm, payments made to a farmer under the European Communities (Retirement of Farmers) Regulations, 1974.</P>
    <P>Under section 28 it will be possible to claim deferment of tax in respect of gains made on the disposal of certain specified business assets provided the proceeds of sale are spent on new business assets for use exclusively in the business.  In addition to trades, professions and farming, this relief will also be available to public authorities, woodlands managed on a commercial basis, non-profit making bodies, trade associations, and athletic and amateur sports bodies.  The period within which the new assets may be acquired for the purposes of relief under this section will extend from 12 months before to three years after the date of disposal of the old assets.  Discretion is being left to the Revenue Commissioners to lengthen these periods in individual circumstances.  Section 29 allows deferment of the charge on compensation money received in respect of the damage or destruction of an asset where the money is used in restoring or replacing the asset.  The charge is not imposed until the asset or the asset replacing it has been disposed of.</P>
    <P>Section 31 sets out the general rules for applying the tax to unit trusts. Distributions of capital from the unit trust assets will be treated as part disposal of units by the receiver and taxed accordingly.  Where the gains made by a unit trust are gains which would not be chargeable in the hands of the unit holders or where assets of a unit trust are all non-chargeable assets, such as Government securities, then the gains made by the unit trust will not be regarded as chargeable gains.  Section 32 goes on to provide special arrangements whereby a unit trust registered in this country with a large public participation and provided certain conditions as set out in the section are satisfied may enter into arrangements with the Revenue Commissioners so that the effective charge <Col N="1108" /> to tax on the trustees is confined to the chargeable gains not distributed to unit holders.  In this way the unit holder will get the benefit of reliefs applicable to individuals.</P>
    <P>Sections 33 and 37 contain certain measures to deal with tax avoidance, such as transactions between connected persons at artificially low prices, transactions involving disposal of assets in separate lots, transfer at under-value by controlled companies or by the transfer of assets to companies and trusts abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 38 empowers the Government to enter into arrangements with the Governments of other States to provide relief from double taxation on capital gains similar to reliefs now applicable in the case of income tax. Under section 9 in certain circumstances, as I have already indicated, the acquisition and disposal of an asset will be deemed to be for a consideration equal to its market value. However, section 39 provides that in the case of disposals to the State, to a charity, or to certain other national institutions and public bodies such as the National Gallery, the section 9 provision will not apply and the tax will be charged by reference to the unadjusted gain.  Losses, however, will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill&mdash; sections 40 to 51&mdash;contain miscellaneous provisions dealing with the assets of insolvent persons, the position of company liquidations, the treatment of funds in court, the position where gains accrue abroad but cannot be repatriated and also where consideration money is paid by instalments over a period exceeding 18 months and where assets are switched or extinguished.  Another of these miscellaneous provisions is that debts, apart from loan stocks, will not be a chargeable asset in the hands of the original creditor.</P>
    <P>Section 47 deals with options, section 48 with the rules for determining the location of assets which might otherwise be difficult to determine, while section 49 deals with the determination of market value with particular reference to shares and securities.  Section 50 brings capital <Col N="1109" /> gains tax within the ambit of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which would enable a change in the rate of the tax to be made by a financial resolution of the Dáil.  It also places on the Revenue Commissioners the same responsibilities to account for capital gains tax as are imposed on them in relation to other taxes.  The final section of the Bill&mdash; section 51&mdash;applies the Schedules and enables their provisions fixing the amount of consideration in a transaction to have effect before 6th April, 1974 where it is necessary to compute a chargeable gain by reference to circumstances before that date.</P>
    <P>Schedules 1, 2 and 3 contain detailed rules for the computation of capital gains and Schedule 5 sets out the rules and procedures governing the administration of the new tax.  As regards Schedule 4 which lists certain securities which will be exempt from the tax, I have decided on reconsideration to withdraw this Schedule and to deal with these exemptions in general terms in the body of the Bill. To this purpose I propose introducing a Committee Stage amendment.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my recent budget statement, the yield from the proposed new capital taxes which are being introduced instead of death duties is not likely to be large in the initial years.</P>
    <P>Given that the capital gains tax will apply only to gains accruing since 6th April, 1974, given the expected problems associated with the introduction of any new tax and allowing for the present depressed state of the stock exchange and property markets, I can say that the net yield in the current year is not likely to be significant. However, eventually I am confident that the capital gains tax will make a useful and fair contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the draft Bill now before the House contains a fair and reasonable scheme of capital gains taxation.  It contains modifications and improvements introduced to meet the representations of the various groups, organisations and individuals who accepted my invitation to <Col N="1110" /> furnish their views.  I intend to maintain the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme by appropriate adjustments to the thresholds which would cater for inflation.  These will be in addition to the built-in allowance which has been made for it by the application of the lowest rate of income taxation to capital gains.  It represents part of the package of capital taxes to replace estate duties and is a long overdue reform of our taxation code.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>When one is dealing with a Bill entitled a Capital Gains Tax Bill and when one has regard to the present state of the economy.

Of course this is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the last Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis there was a resolution in regard to capital gains and those who were present will recall that, when replying to the debate, I ended up by saying that if the Ard-Fheis passed the resolution I would take it that what they wanted was a capital gains tax that would be effective and would be directed against speculators.  In fact, the resolution was narrowly defeated almost certainly because I was obliged by the exigencies of the situation to talk also about the iniquitous wealth tax proposals of the Government. It may well be that because of that the delegates were so appalled at what the Government proposed with regard to wealth tax that some may have thought they were voting against <Col N="1111" /> that.  The fact of the matter is that we are clearly on record as saying we are not opposed to capital gains taxes in principle but we want them to be effective and directed against speculators&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House what is the situation.  No doubt Deputy Collins will enlighten us as to his attitude in due course.  We will be glad to hear what he has to say, particularly in regard to the principles involved in this Bill, a matter on which I should like to say a few words.</P>
      <P>First, I am glad to note that some of the major flaws in the Government's original proposals in the White Paper have been dealt with, at least partially.  For example, a man's house is not now to be liable to capital gains. Some steps, although not enough in our view, have been taken to ease the injustice of the alleged capital gains on family businesses or farms that have been built up by hard work and skill during the years.  However there are still a number of major flaws in the Bill, quite apart from numerous points of detail we want to take up with the Minister.</P>
      <P>In considering the principle of capital gains, it is fair to say that to do something in the name of a more equitable distribution of wealth which in practice inhibits genuine enterprise and therefore, the generation of wealth, is to perpetrate injustice.  For that reason I strongly urge the House, and the Minister in particular, to subject this Bill to a rigorous examination and to adopt a flexible approach to suggestions made in order to ensure that this Bill does not inhibit genuine enterprise as distinct from speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would very roughly define speculation as fairly quick profits with little or no economic input.  That is the kind of thing we really want to get at, and that is the kind of thing that is getting off rather lightly under this Bill.  At the same time, genuine enterprise which is generating wealth and employment is being subjected, in the <Col N="1112" /> view of this side of the House, to unnecessary penalisation.</P>
    <P>In our view, pure speculation on the lines I have indicated should be taxed much more heavily than this Bill proposes to tax it, while ordinary capital gains, particularly those resulting from a person's hard work and skills over the years, should be taxed much less.  I do not for one moment pretend it is easy to do this.  If it were, it would have been done many years ago.  One thing I can say with certainty to the Minister is that this Bill does not do that.  It seems to me that the Minister appears to have started out from the basic premise that all capital gains are intrinsically evil and should be penalised. Only grudgingly has he departed from this doctrinaire approach, under pressure from this side of the House, and as a result he has agreed that such things as, for instance, a person's home should not be subjected to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>To give the impression that one is going after speculators when one is really going after the hard-earned gains of the small man may be good party politics, but it is not good Government. Having regard to the inherent difficulty I have mentioned in devising a method of distinguishing between speculation on the one hand and genuine enterprise on the other, a difficulty compounded by the Minister's basically wrong approach to this problem, any proposals for improvement of this Bill will not be perfect.  I acknowledge that at the outset.  Nevertheless, in Fianna Fáil we have made an effort to produce proposals designed to make the Bill more equitable.</P>
    <P>I propose now to outline those proposals. First, a major factor in determining the rate of capital gains tax should be the length of time for which the asset has been held before the gain is made.  This principle is recognised in a number of EEC countries, but it is not recognised in this Bill.  We suggest therefore that there should be a sliding scale over a period from one year to 15 years after which no capital gains tax would be payable.  On a gain realised within one year of realisation of the asset we suggest that the rate of capital gains should be 50 per cent and not the 26 per cent proposed by the Minister. <Col N="1113" /> Within two years we suggest it should be 45½ per cent and so on, descending by 4½ per cent for each year for which the asset has been held.  If the gain were realised within 11 years of acquisition the rate would be 5 per cent.  Thereafter the rate would go down by 1 per cent for each year so that a sale within 12 years would be liable to 4 per cent and within 15 years to 1 per cent.  After 15 years there would be no capital gains tax liability.</P>
    <P>In addition, in an effort to ensure that the capital gains tax would not be a deterrent to economic activity, which would of course generate expansion and employment, we propose that the rates I have outlined would be halved in the case of a farmer or a businessman who had been engaged full time in the operation of the farm or the business.  We are not of course tied absolutely rigidly to the period of years or to the rates of tax suggested. This is obviously a matter on which different people can have different views, but we are tied to the principle involved.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to this kind of approach. As I have indicated, there is ample precedent for it in some of our EEC partners.  I believe that, when one examines the situation, it makes sense. It would result in a much more effective method of getting at pure speculation and would, on the other hand, recognise and give encouragement to genuine enterprise, which this country needs now more than it ever has.  We feel this should be a basic principle in dealing with capital gains.  Therefore, on the basis of the Bill before the House, we must disagree very substantially with the Minister.  However, we hope he will give our proposal serious consideration.</P>
    <P>There is another major flaw in this Bill&mdash;the Minister referred to at the end of his speech but he has not dealt with it&mdash;the fact that there is really no provision in this Bill for adjustment in line with inflation.  I shall come back in a moment to what the Minister said about this, but first I should like to consider the imposition of capital gains tax on the basis of an increase in monetary value of an asset between <Col N="1114" /> one given date and another.  Is it not clear, given the rate of inflation from which we are suffering, that what one is doing is imposing capital gains tax on apparent monetary gain but not on real gain?  Indeed, it should be clear that in some cases this could easily amount to confiscation.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that the figures for different rates which I have suggested, and in particular the rates of tax our party have suggested which are higher than those provided for in this Bill, are put forward on the assumption that the Bill will be amended to adjust for inflation; otherwise we believe a very grave injustice will be perpetrated.  The Minister stated in his speech today:</P>
    <P>I intend to maintain the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme by appropriate adjustments to the thresholds which would cater for inflation. Those will be in addition to the built in allowance which has been made for it by the application of the lowest rate of income taxation to capital gains.</P>
    <P>I have only had an opportunity of looking at that very quickly, but I must confess the latter sentence does not mean anything to me: &ldquo;These will be in addition to the built in allowance which has been made for it by the application of the lowest rate of income taxation to capital gains&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister would explain that when he is replying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just add: &ldquo;instead of applying rates progressively&rdquo;. In other words, they will not be rising from 26 to 35, to 45 and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But surely what the Minister is proposing to do is to apply a rate of 26 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): The Minister is making no provision at all for inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the rate of inflation, he will be applying 26 per cent.  I do not think in all seriousness he can suggest that that contains any provision for inflation. However, what he does say in addition <Col N="1115" /> to that is that he intends &ldquo;to maintain the fairness and reasonableness of the scheme by appropriate adjustments to the thresholds which would cater for inflation.&rdquo;  With all due respect to the Minister, that is not good enough.  It would not be good enough in the case of any Minister for Finance at a time of inflation at 20 or more per cent.  We all know the difficulties that arise for a Minister for Finance if this is a matter for discretion for him at the time of preparing his budget and if he is subjected to all the pressures which are normal at the time of the budget and which are abnormal for the Minister in present circumstances.  In particular it is not good enough with the present Minister for the very reason that this argument about adjustment for inflation was urged on him very strongly in relation to income tax allowances, and amendments providing for this were put down to the last Finance Bill, and they were resisted by the Minister with the same arguments he has here.  What happened was that he did make some adjustments, but they did not match inflation, and there can be no guarantee whatever that if you do not build it into the Bill, there will be regular and appropriate adjustments for inflation. For that reason, when you are dealing with a tax of this kind, where you are basing the tax on what are called capital gains, it is absolutely essential&mdash;it is not a matter of &ldquo;it would be desirable or advisable&rdquo;&mdash; to build into the legislation a provision which will ensure that any tax levied under this Bill will be a tax on real capital gains.  I would hope that the Minister and those behind him, who know very well that what I am saying is true, will adopt a reasonable approach in this matter.  It is probably more important in this Bill than in any other Bill that it should be done because of the nature of the tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further matter with which we are very concerned in this Bill is the provision that a person who is subjected to compulsory acquisition of his property by a local authority, a State <Col N="1116" /> body or some body which has statutory authority to acquire property compulsorily, should find himself not alone forced to give up his property but, in addition, subjected to capital gains tax on that unwished-for disposal of property.</P>
    <P>We recognise that practical difficulties would arise for local authorities, in particular, if one were to exempt completely all compulsory acquisition transactions from capital gains tax, and as a minimum we would urge that, in cases of compulsory acquisition, provision should be made whereby the person subjected to the compulsory acquisition would be allowed to purchase a comparable asset or piece of property and to deduct the cost of that purchase before any assessment of gain arises under the capital gains tax legislation.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note in the Minister's statement today that he proposes to introduce an amendment or amendments on Committee Stage to include nephews and nieces in addition to sons and daughters in the relief provision he has in the Bill.  This is a matter on which we felt quite strongly, knowing the pattern of life in this country, particularly in the case of farmers but also in the case of other kinds of businesses.  I have not had an opportunity of examining in detail what the Minister said about this, and in any event we shall have to see the amendments he puts forward. At a quick glance it seemed to me it might not meet what is required, but it is a step in the right direction and we welcome it.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I had intended to refer and to which the Minister did refer in his speech, but I would ask him to spell out the position a little more clearly; that is, the extent to which the legislation before us departs from the provisions of the White Paper in relation to gifts.  The White Paper seemed to make it quite explicit that, having regard to the Minister's other proposals for capital acquisitions and so on, gifts would not be subjected to the capital gains tax.  However, he now proposes to subject gifts to capital gains tax.  He gives an anti-avoidance reason in his speech, but <Col N="1117" /> presumably the situation has not differed from that which obtained when the White Paper was issued. The Minister owes the House a more detailed explanation of the radical departure from what was indicated in the White Paper to what was provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred at the beginning to the economic situation and to people, perhaps reasonably, asking in the context of this Bill, what capital gains. In so far as it is proposed to levy the capital gains tax on business assets, it is not unreasonable to say that it is being introduced at a most inappropriate time, and that it is also not unreasonable to say that the enactment of the Bill, as it is drafted anyway, is bound to have an adverse effect on investment decisions which are already, because of the economic climate, seriously inhibited.  There is a good case for saying that as far as the economy in general is concerned it would be advantageous and make good sense to include a provision in this Bill which would postpone the operation of the tax on business assets until an appointed day which would be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Again, I would strongly urge the Minister to give consideration to that suggestion having regard to the difficulties being experienced by business at the moment, difficulties with which he must be very familiar, and the consequential drawbacks arising not only for the owners but for the employees who are being laid off at such an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>If I might revert for a moment to the proposed relief in regard to children and the introduction of an amendment to include nephews and nieces, I would ask the Minister to clarify the position of adopted children under this provision.</P>
    <P>I should also like to ask him whether it is the intention that life assurance funds would be liable to capital gains tax under Schedule I, 2 (1).  If it is intended to subject such funds to capital gains tax that would appear to be contrary to paragraph 88 of the White Paper.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify this matter and, if necessary, we can <Col N="1118" /> pursue it on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to make clear&mdash;I hope he can do so; if he cannot it will be another matter to pursue at a later stage&mdash;that no gains liable to income tax purposes will be liable for capital gains tax.  There is a general proposition which is particularly important in relation to share option schemes.  If a company becomes liable to capital gains tax on the sale of an asset and the proceeds of the sale are distributed to the shareholders, it would appear on the face of this Bill that a second charge to capital gains tax arises on the proceeds in the hands of the shareholders. If that is so this would, of course, greatly increase the effective rate of capital gains tax in such cases and I would ask the Minister to clarify precisely what will happen under his proposal in such cases.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to clarify one very important matter in which there are two possible interpretations of the provisions in the Bill. Will the IDA induced foreign industry become liable to capital gains tax? The Minister will remember that such industry was induced to come here on the basis of an undertaking that export profits would get full relief from taxation and it is a matter of record that many, if not the majority, of these foreign industrialists have retained the profits they earned here and used them for further re-investment and expansion.  Where these profits are repatriated in capital form they would appear to be subject to capital gains tax and, if this is so, then it would certainly appear to be a breach of the undertaking given by the IDA on behalf of the Government and this House and a serious disincentive therefore to such companies to continue to retain profits for reinvestment here.  I would ask the Minister to explain clearly how he sees the Bill operating in this regard, the thinking behind it and, in particular if the position is as I have outlined, to explain how he reconciles it with the undertakings given to such companies.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister responded to pressure, particularly from this side of the House, in regard <Col N="1119" /> to imposing capital gains tax on a person's home.  But he has provided in the Bill that no capital gains tax will arise on the sale of a person's house situated on land up to but not exceeding one acre.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that provision.  He will be aware that section 33 of the Finance Act, 1961, and section 45 of the Land Act, 1965, both specify a figure of five acres with a house as being exempt from certain other requirements.  This would appear to be the statutory definition: one may have up to five acres and they are part of the house and, beyond that, one is getting into farming proper or a commercial enterprise.  If that is the statutory definition there would seem to be a good case for applying the same provision in this Bill.  It may be that there is a very good reason for departing from these previous enactments, but I am not aware of any such reason.  If there is any such reason perhaps the Minister will tell us what it is.  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to give consideration to the existing statutory limit of five acres and, if it is necessary to apply the one acre limitation, then it should apply only in relation to future acquisitions and not in relation to existing acquisitions.  I do not think that is an unreasonable proposition and I hope the Minister will consider it.</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to clarify the position in regard to the charge of capital gains tax on UK residents.  Again, it seems to me there are provisions in the Bill which can be read in two ways and I have had two views expressed to me as to what the Bill means in this regard. One view is that the charge on non-residents does not extend to residents of the United Kingdom who are exempt from Irish income tax under the double taxation agreement.  I am certainly not clear on this and it is important that the Minister should spell out what he intends and where he thinks what he intends is achieved in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is another provision in the Bill that if a farm is left by will, the disposal of the farm on the death of <Col N="1120" /> the owner will not produce liability of itself for capital gains tax, but that the person who gets the farm under the will will, in due course, if he sells the farm, become liable to capital gains tax, but that the assessment of the gain will be on the difference between the price at which he sells and the price at which the dead man bought, which could be going back 30 years or more. I should like the Minister to explain the thinking behind this provision because, on the face of it, it does not appear to me to be equitable, particularly in the case of a farm.  I can see considerable inequity arising out of this provision.  I am not at all sure that the provision should not be that the market value of the farm, or whatever the asset is, at the time the legatee gets it is the appropriate base date from which to work.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in regard to unit trusts and what I said in regard to companies may well apply to them, in that liability to capital gains tax may arise twice on the one gain.  There is a provision to enable the Revenue Commissioners to enter into a special arrangement with unit trusts which meet certain conditions.  On the face of it, it does not seem possible for any unit trust to meet the conditions laid down.  If that is so, I presume the Minister will make some effort to amend that provision.</P>
    <P>Of course, most of this legislation is based on and, indeed, copied from similar legislation in Britain.  There are some differences, and some of them are significant.  Since he has copied most of the legislation the Minister should explain to the House why he has made the change he has made?  One example of this is in regard to the capitalisation of interest.  In Britain when a company borrows money for the construction of a building and charges the interest to capital, the interest capitalised is deductible in calculating the gain on the disposal of the building.  I cannot find any corresponding relief in this Bill.  If it is not there, I wonder would the Minister explain when replying why it is not and what is the thinking behind its omission.</P>
    <P>There is also an operation in regard to shares which goes on in Britain and which is known colloquially as the bed <Col N="1121" /> and breakfast operation.  It is basically disposing of shares and re-acquiring them within a very short period in order to convert an accrued loss into a realised loss.  The provisions of the Bill before the House are different from those in Britain.  I am inclined to think they should be but I should like the Minister to spell out in more detail why he has departed from what the British are doing in this regard.  It is important to have it on the record.</P>
    <P>There is another difference between the legislation here proposed and that operating in Britain.  I understand that in Britain where an individual provides a house free of charge for a dependent relative he may dispose of that house in addition to his own residence free of capital gains tax.  That provision does not appear in this Bill and again I will ask why it is not there.</P>
    <P>In regard to partnerships, the admission or retirement of a partner or a change in profit sharing ratios would seem to constitute disposals and acquisitions between the partners as defined in the Bill.  I understand that in Britain, as a matter of practice, the Inland Revenue ignore these types of transactions for capital gains tax provided that no cash consideration changes hand.  I should like the Minister to spell out whether it is proposed to follow the same practice here.  I should also like to know whether the liability to capital gains tax will extend to exempt artists who dispose of copyright for a lump sum, or companies whose royalty income from patents is exempt.</P>
    <P>It would also be possible to argue from some of the provisions in the Bill that a foreign domiciled person who is resident in Ireland and in the UK may be subject to a double charge on gains on certain assets.  Again, if the Minister could clarify that situation, it would be appreciated.  In regard to the question of residence there is a very important matter which the Minister must spell out. The Bill provides that persons who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland are liable to capital gains tax, but &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not defined. There is no doubt at all that <Col N="1122" /> very great practical difficulties will arise in establishing the scope of the charge unless &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is defined.  As the Minister knows &ldquo;resident&rdquo; is pretty well defined in law and in court decisions, but not &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to direct the Minister's attention is that, as he knows, the stock market was at a low level in April, 1974, and share and property values have fallen very substantially since that date.  Despite the recent little flurry values are way below those of April, 1974.  Serious problems are likely to arise for persons who wish to take assets out of private companies. The assets may originally have cost more than their market value on 6th April, 1974, and substantially more than their present market value.  On a transfer of the assets to the shareholders, the cost under the Bill to shareholders will be the market value at the date of transfer.  If the assets subsequently appreciate substantially, and are sold, a very substantial chargeable gain may arise even though the proceeds are less than the April, 1974, market value or the original cost.  If that is so, it would seem on the face of it to constitute an inequity which ought to be remedied during the passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 26 I should like to direct the Minister's attention to a different approach in this Bill from that operating in Britain.  In the Bill the criterion for chargeability is the amount of the consideration.  In Britain the criterion is the amount of the gain and, on the face of it, the British approach appears to be more logical than the one in the Bill because, for example, a person might buy a farm for £10,000 and sell it far £45,000.  The amount of the capital gains tax that he will pay on £35,000 gain under the Bill is nil but on the other hand a person may buy a farm for £45,000 and sell it for £55,000 and he will be liable for capital gains tax on the £10,000 gain.  I suggest that it seems more logical to approach the liability being dealt with under section 26 on the basis of gain rather than the <Col N="1123" /> amount of the consideration.  There is a provision in section 6 which gives an option, an election to the taxpayer, but it imposes the obligation on the taxpayer to make the election.  I understand that the provision in Britain is that it is the Inland Revenue who make the option and they have to do it on the basis of which is the more advantageous course to the taxpayer.  I do not think it is reasonable to expect that any ordinary individual will have read, studied and understood the provisions of this Capital Gains Tax Bill and, therefore, there is a strong case for doing what I understand is done in Britain&mdash;impose on the Revenue Commissioners the obligation to give the taxpayer the benefit of whichever course is more favourable to him.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Minister has moved in the right direction&mdash;although not far enough&mdash;in providing the relief under section 26 but the provision includes a requirement that the person in question must have been in full-time working as a director in a company or on a farm for the ten years preceding the disposal and he must have reached the age of 55.  There does not seem to be any provision for a person who is prevented, for example, by health reasons from being a full-time working director during the ten years ending with the disposal.  In fact, in real life what happens in cases like this is that a man becomes ill and carries on for as long as he can and eventually recognises, or his doctor does, that it is not possible for him to carry on and then he has to make arrangements.  I think the Minister will find there are very many genuine cases of this kind that will come up and that provision should be made for such cases in section 26.</P>
    <P>Another matter in regard to partnership is that the Bill provides that gains on the disposal of partnership assets are to be charged to the partners separately but there appear to be no rules provided in the Bill for allocating the gains to individual partners.  This, for those concerned, is a very serious omission.  Perhaps the Minister will explain why they are not provided or would undertake to provide the necessary rules to effect this operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> Very briefly I direct the Minister's attention to section 8 (2) (a) (ii) and section 8 (2) (b).  They appear to be meaningless in conjunction with each other.  On the face of it 2 (b) would need to be redrafted and perhaps the Minister would have a look at it before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There is a small difference in the charging section of this Bill and what is in the corresponding British Act. The provision in this Bill is in section 3 (1).  It is slightly different from the British provision.  In this Bill the words are &ldquo;that is, in respect of&rdquo;.  In Britain it is &ldquo;that is to say&rdquo;.  It may seem to be a minor matter, and may be minor, but would the Minister explain, when replying, what is the significance, if any, of the difference of the wording considering that most of the wording in the Bill is the same as in the British measure?</P>
    <P>The provision in regard to losses in section 12 seems on the face of it to be unduly restricted.  Section 12 (7) restricts the allowance of losses, except in the year of death of an individual, to the year of loss or a later year but under this arrangement a person may be taxed on gains and within a short period afterwards suffer serious capital losses, for instance on a forced disposal of an asset.  I think there is a case for saying there should be provision to carry back losses for at least the two preceding years of assessment as the capital gains tax is, by its nature, a long term one.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions in section 12 (4) it is not clear where there is any right of appeal provided, if there is any.  If there is not any effective appeal procedure this subsection in practice would provide no worthwhile relief and would probably leave the claimant in a hopeless position especially in regard to intangible assets and shares in unquoted companies.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Minister should give an interpretation of the word &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; in this subsection.  It is a very relative term.</P>
    <P>In regard to the computation of gain and the treatment of interest, under Schedule 1 it would appear that interest is expressly excluded as an <Col N="1125" /> item in calculating acquisition costs to the person chargeable even where such interest may not have been allowed in computing tax on income derived from the asset or in computing any other tax.  If interest is incurred and is correctly capitalised as an element of cost in acquiring or holding an asset, on the face of it there does not appear to be any logical reason why it should not be allowed.  It is important for us to note that this provision applies even to business assets.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to either explain&mdash;I hope satisfactorily &mdash;the thinking for disallowing the interest properly capitalised or, alternatively, to undertake to amend the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister if, in relation to section 28, subsection (5), ships and aircraft are covered by the classification &ldquo;plant or machinery&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Another matter, though not of major importance but of some importance from the point of view of administration having regard to the position of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners, arises in regard to capital distributions under Schedule 2, paragraph 1.  It would appear that where a shareholder receives a capital distribution, no matter how small, in relation to the shareholding a charge to capital gains tax arises, subject to the exemptions for individuals. This could well involve a great deal of time wasting on trivial items. I understand that in Britain in cases like this they treat distributions which are small in relation to the shares held as a reduction of the cost against future disposal.  If this was done here the Minister would save a great deal of unnecessary work on the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>A major omission from this Bill is the absence of any spelling out of relief for companies within a group, that is in relation to whether capital gains will arise on the transfer of assets between one company and another, all of them being within a group of companies.  This is a matter on which I am certain the Minister has received representations.  It is a <Col N="1126" /> matter which is dealt with in detail in the corresponding legislation in Britain, but it would appear that there is no provision in this Bill in relation to it.  It may be that the Minister intends to deal with it in the Corporation Tax Bill, but it is important that the manner in which it is proposed to deal with this problem is spelled out in this House as fast as possible so that the people will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>At this stage of the Bill we are not intended to take the Bill section by section and I have not attempted to do that because it is a lengthy and very technical Bill, particularly having regard to the provisions of the Schedule.  I have tried to indicate some matters of detail to the Minister so that it would be of some assistance, if the Minister can deal with it in reply, in speeding up the Committee Stage proceedings.  I should like to summarise our approach to the principles involved in this Bill by saying that we think the Minister's approach is the wrong one.  We think that the capital gains tax should be directed against speculators and where this can be done the rate of tax should be higher than it is here.  I have outlined the different basis of approach which would be far more effective in getting at speculators than this Bill and at the same time would be of assistance in encouraging genuine enterprise, which we need so badly at present.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to feel tied to his own proposals in this regard. Unless he can show that the approach I have outlined is defective in principle &mdash;if it is a number of our EEC partners are defective in their principle and approach to it&mdash;I urge him to accept at least the general proposition of this basic approach to capital gains which I have outlined.  I am convinced it is wrong to approach it on the basis that virtually anybody who makes a capital gain, subject to the exemptions of the Bill, should be taxed at the same rate whether he got it from pure speculation with no economic input or whether the gain is the result of 40 years of hard work by him.</P>
    <P>That is a wrong approach which we should not perpetrate in this House. <Col N="1127" /> One should have regard to the nature of the gain and how it was made.  It is not easy to do this; it is difficult.  But I suggest that the approach which I have outlined on behalf of this party&mdash;this matter has been discussed in some detail by this party&mdash;is one that goes a good deal of the way to achieve a really effective capital gains tax and one that is primarily directed against speculators.  That has always been the position I, and this party, have adopted in regard to capital gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that we should keep in mind the background which led to the introduction of this Bill.  It was a background against which many people suffered from penal taxation in a number of forms, generally under the heading of death duties.  It was a system which, especially in the last decade, brought about unfortunate disposal of farms and businesses by families because they had to pay death duties.</P>
      <P>In introducing the White Paper on capital taxation, laid by the Minister for Finance before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28th February last, the Government took what could only be considered a major reforming step in our taxation structures, a step of which I fully approved.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I support the Bill.  What annoyed me a little was the fact that, when Deputy Colley was speaking, he decried speculation, quite rightly so, and the damage speculators did to our society especially in the past 20 years.  Such damage was considerable and the ordinary citizen felt that the structure of society favoured those who had money or the use of it.  That was so and it is right to decry such a system known to be equitable and seen to be inequitable.  But what this House should note is that for 16 long years while this speculation in land banks, in property and in all the other areas written about in the Press and seen on television was rife, the Fianna Fáil Government did nothing about it.</P>

      <P>That speculation, and I mean speculation as opposed to investment, gnawed at our society in a very invidious way.  The ordinary worker in the factory, the farmer, the shopkeeper saw thousands upon thousands of pounds being made on speculation. He was feeling it in his VAT returns, his PAYE returns, his turnover tax returns, his wholesale tax returns at expense to himself.  He paid his taxes down through those years of inflation when he felt he was being unjustly hit, and I agree with him.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill marks also the end of death duties taxation in two months' time.  I am sorry that death duties were not abolished a year ago because people who have suffered deaths in their families since then feel aggrieved that they have to face such duties.  One of the possible flaws in this Bill is that people who have died within the past year and whose families will have to pay death duties are faced also with the prospect in the future of paying further capital taxation, perhaps in the form of capital gains tax which to them, and I feel rightly so, appears to be an invidious form of double taxation.  I would suggest to the Minister in his examination of the Bill going through the House that he examine also the whole question of double taxation of the estates of people who have died within the past year or even extend it back further if possible.  After all, the effects of the Capital Gains Bill have been felt, in theory, since April last.  But there does exist a serious problem of the double taxation of the <Col N="1130" /> estates of people who died within the past year which I would ask the Minister to investigate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying that this is an opportune time under this Bill to ensure there will be no double taxation of estates of people who died, especially in the last year and, possibly, in previous years.  I realise it may mean a loss of revenue to the State but there are good social grounds for so doing.  I thought Deputy Colley <Col N="1131" /> spoke tongue in cheek.  However when I reflected on the fact that he referred to his party's Ard Fheis not being in favour of capital taxation, I realised that he was in an awkward situation to have to speak on behalf of the party while being in favour of taxation on speculation.  It is interesting to note that Fianna Fáil are against capital taxation in the form of a capital gains tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the distinction between the position of the Ard Fheis and his own position on this matter.  He was right to have done so.  However, it is interesting to note the official position of Fianna Fáil as pronounced at the Ard Fheis as against Deputy Colley's position as spokesman for finance for the Oireachtas Fianna Fáil Party. However did the Tánaiste not refer to official and provisional speakers in that party?  No doubt Deputy Haughey will be putting forward his point of view on this Bill later.  I am proud of the social progress being made in this Bill. This is apart from the contribution within the package deal to abolish death duties.  Provisions of this kind are some of the reasons for my being in politics.  This party are endeavouring to change iniquitous and social injustice.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I have reservations regarding some aspects of the Bill.  The first of these relates to the rates of taxation proposed.  It is my opinion that the blanket rate of 26 per cent should be changed.  I suggest that the rate be higher on short term capital gains, in respect of which, say, a 50 per cent tax should be applied. Deputy Colley referred to such gains as speculation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> On medium term gains&mdash;gains on assets held for a period of, perhaps, 15 years&mdash;I would suggest a 25 per cent or 26 per cent tax, but for gains on investments for longer periods I would suggest a 10 per cent tax.  I know that this system would lead to major administrative difficulties, but there are sound social grounds for a sliding scale of this nature.  There is the danger that in certain circumstances investment decisions may be upset by the introduction of a capital gains tax, but that is not of major importance in so far as genuine long-term investments are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is the problem, too, of distinguishing between real capital gains and financial capital gains which at times of inflation may not be very real.  I am glad to note that the Minister intends to increase the threshold levels to take account of inflation.  To do this on a proper basis would be difficult, but I hope that a just scheme will be provided so as to ensure that one pays on real capital gains rather than on financial or monetary capital gains.</P>
    <P>The question of the date of valuation&mdash;6th April, 1974&mdash;is of interest in that at that time the stock exchange was at a relatively low level.  Indeed, it has dropped further since.  If one accepts that the level at April 6th, 1974 was, say, 60 per cent of a level two years previously, there should be a mechanism to allow for different values of shares, especially, and of property for the two years prior to that date.  I say this in view of the improvement envisaged in western economies during this year and in the expectation that towards the latter part of the year, stock exchange values should revert to their pre-1974 levels.  It should be easy to do this because the values then were fairly well known.</P>
    <P>The exemptions envisaged in the Bill are welcome, especially that in respect of the sale of a house and up to one acre of land.  The provision in relation to chattels, which allows for the exemptions from tax of such items as relatively unimportant household furniture and goods, is sound and will avoid unnecessary administrative expenses. Socially this policy is correct <Col N="1133" /> too, as also is the exemption in respect of gains of up to £500 in any one year. I do not think a Bill of this nature could be administered so very closely. We would not welcome the Revenue Commissioners availing of privacy any more than is necessary, but by allowing these exemptions and reliefs the Minister is avoiding a possible trap. The provision in relation to inter-family transfers is sound and the inclusion of nephews and nieces in this regard is very welcome.  I wonder if, in certain cases, a transfer to a brother or sister especially a transfer from an older to a younger brother may not also be allowed.  This should be encouraged.  As liberal an interpretation as possible should be allowed to these transfers in order to encourage the movement of businesses and farms to another generation.</P>
    <P>The exemptions transferring the farm or business to children and allowing the limit of £150,000 are very wise.  I hope this will be adjusted to take inflation into account.  The roll-over provisions are, perhaps, more important than they appear in the Bill. Small firms and farmers of less than 80 acres should be allowed these roll-over provisions when they sell a smaller unit to buy a larger one.  I would not like this transaction to be looked at by a taxation expert as bringing money into the coffers.  As I said, the roll-over provisions are welcome.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley made a good point when he spoke of compulsory acquisition. Steps should be taken to alleviate taxation in these circumstances.  When replying I should like the Minister to explain administration.  Will there be separate annual returns?  Does one make a return when one makes a capital gain?  How detailed will the return be?  What measures have the Revenue Commissioners in mind to prevent avoidance?  This major Bill will considerably change the present taxation structure and the House in my view is entitled to a full explanation of the procedures to be adopted by the Revenue Commissioners in collecting this tax.</P>
    <P>Many shopkeepers are disgruntled sending in returns from VAT and <Col N="1134" /> PAYE and rightly so.  At some stage the Government should allow them to retain a small percentage of the revenue collected to cover the costs of collection.</P>
    <P>I have a few more points which are more appropriate for Committee Stage.  I support this Bill and the principles behind it.  This Bill is designed to eliminate the iniquitous system of death duties.  I am sure this Bill will be welcomed not only in this House but also throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the principles of the Bill but not with the terms which, in my view, should be devoted mainly to the speculators who are making a fast buck in the shortest possible time, and without giving employment. The speculators came down the country and bought land at a high price which the farmer could not afford.  The farmers often needed the land to bring their farms up to an economic holding.  Allowances should be made for the person who spent 15 or 20 years building up his farm.</P>
      <P>When a breadwinner dies suddenly and leaves a young widow and small family, she may have to sell the business or farm because she would not be able to continue with the business.  She should be exempt from death duties.  If the man was a wage earner he would be insured under the national health.  Sometimes in private business a person may not be covered by an insurance scheme.  As a result, his widow is victimised and has to pay this tax at 26 per cent.  The Minister said the tax should be at the lowest rate.  He also said he was tying it in with the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, which would enable that charge to be increased if necessary by resolution of this House.  This is very significant and only the thin end of the wedge.</P>

      <P>I got the message.  The Minister need not worry.  I hope plenty of other people did too.  Deputy E. Collins mentioned nephews, nieces and young brothers.  Orphans who have come to live with relations should also be included.  They may be living with the families but are too old to be adopted under our Adoption Act.  If these children have been reared as members of a family, they should be exempt and treated as a son or a daughter.  I am sure such cases are few and far between but we should still provide exemptions for them.</P>
      <P>Provision should be made for inflation. With inflation running at 20 per cent per annum, in four years a property worth £100,000 will almost have doubled in value.  If this property is disposed of the Minister will collect £26,000.  Provision should be made to safeguard the real capital gain involved. On that point the Bill is sadly lacking.  We propose a very high capital tax gradually decreasing down along the line and exemption after 15 years.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government (a) to seek immediately those changes in EEC Directives 159 and 160 which are necessary to permit the survival of the smaller farmers of Ireland; and (b) to introduce a scheme of financial assistance for those farmers who have been forced to sell young cattle at totally uneconomic prices, or who are trying to hold their cattle, or both, and immediately introduce a floor price for all young cattle.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to have this discussion on what must be considered very important aspects of the agricultural scene.  It is a pity this discussion is confined to three hours because I know many Members would like to participate in the debate, particularly those who represent rural constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very fair motion.  It would <Col N="1136" /> not be too difficult to forecast the speech of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries having regard to the amendment in his name.  However, I understand I have the right to reply at the end of the debate tomorrow evening.</P>
    <P>At a time when other sectors of the community are receiving substantial salary increases it is now evident to everybody that farmers have suffered a massive drop in their incomes.  The average family farm income has dropped by over 20 per cent.  While some farmers in milk and grain production may have maintained their income level it is obvious that many producers of small cattle have had their incomes cut by more than half.  Of course it is, as usual, the small farmer who has suffered most.  Even if most of the money intended for the beef farmers has ended up in the pockets of people for whom it was not intended those farmers have had some kind of guaranteed price.  On the other hand, the calf and store producer has had no floor price whatever.  The Minister said this could not be done for practical reasons despite the disastrously low price of small cattle.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the same effort that was put into bringing the farmers within the tax net could now be put into helping smaller farmers to survive.  Farmers feel frustrated by the lack of Government action and the failure, for the most part, of the EEC aids to reach them.  This is demonstrated by the protests we have seen around the country. The following measures might be taken.</P>
    <P>The various EEC schemes, particularly the disadvantaged area scheme, should be implemented immediately. At this critical stage the promise of a scheme in the future is useless to farmers who are desperately short of money.  In the 1974 budget the Government were able to introduce a scheme for taxing farmers and to implement it practically overnight.  Can they not show the same speed and effort at present in helping the farmers who have suffered most?  In the present crisis farmers have had to use any cash they had to feed their stocks.  Because of <Col N="1137" /> this sales of non-nitrogenous fertilisers have fallen to a fraction of sales in previous years.  This almost guarantees another farming crisis in the coming year or at least a substantial reduction in stock, both disastrous from the national viewpoint.  The Government's refusal to introduce a fertiliser subsidy is incomprehensible.  Any funds used in such a scheme could not be employed more productively or profitably. This is so important and the time is so short we should implement it immediately and not go running to the EEC for permission to do so.  We can do it if we have the will to do it.</P>
    <P>The Government have been asked to set up a scheme to pass part of the slaughter premium to the store producer. Beef farmers have already indicated that they are willing to pass half the slaughter premium back to the store producer.  The Minister said that such a scheme is not feasible but that the disadvantaged area scheme should help those farmers.  I am glad the Minister is here because I would like him to comment on the thousands of farmers outside such areas.  Perhaps the Minister can tell them where they are to get the money to pay their bills.  The feed voucher scheme of subsidised loans is, to my mind and to the minds of many, totally inadequate.  The £500 loan with limited subsidies is too small and for too short a period in present circumstances.  It is no secret that the payment of these will fall due just when farmers will be faced with a backlog of other bills.  I would suggest that there should be a moratorium of at least a year on those loans to enable farmers to get back on their feet.  The recent increases in the Agricultural Credit Corporation interest rates could hardly have come at a more inopportune time.</P>
    <P>The enormous interest rates paid by Irish farmers put them at a serious disadvantage as compared with their European counterparts.  Increases in the cost of borrowing could and should have been delayed for at least six to 12 months.  The whole question of monetary compensatory amounts should be thoroughly examined. Because of those payments Irish farmers have suffered needless <Col N="1138" /> hardship.  The monetary compensatory amounts have been the main cause of the world beef problem reaching crisis proportions here and while this is being rectified some immediate action must be taken to readjust the green £.  The belated revaluation taken last year has already been partially eroded.  Farmers were promised at that time that further action would be taken in the following months to maintain the value of their exports.  They now demand that this should happen.  It seems from the present negotiations that Brussels is trying to back out of this in some way.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that our farmers get a fair deal in this regard.</P>
    <P>The failure of the EEC to introduce a sheep policy is a scandal and seems to contradict the whole idea of a community.  We have been told by M. Lardinois that he is awaiting the outcome of the British referendum. This is a ridiculous excuse and if carried to its logical conclusion would ensure that no decisions were ever taken in the EEC.  It seems more likely that some member countries are well suited by the absence of such a policy and are using pressure to maintain it that way.  It is the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to see that a policy is introduced without delay for a trade which is so vital to many of our farmers.  Our biggest market for mutton and lamb is France but this outlet can be closed down overnight. In those circumstances farmers and factories cannot plan their production. The result of this is unsatisfactory prices and it prevents the expansion we would like to see in our sheep numbers.</P>
    <P>There is a view abroad that most members of the Government have no idea of the hardships which are being experienced by small farmers at present.  I say this without any wish to provoke any kind of political narkiness.  This was confirmed when we read statements not long ago by members of Fine Gael that no sector of the community could look forward to a more prosperous 1975 than the farming community.  If the Minister <Col N="1139" /> wishes I can give him the source of this statement in my reply.  Farmers would like to see some worthwhile initiative from the Government to rescue those people engaged in farming who, through no fault of their own but by following the advice of members of the Coalition parties, now find themselves in financial ruin.</P>
    <P>As it stands the farm modernisation scheme militates against the survival of smaller farmers, many of whom are regarded as being in the transitional category which is more clearly understood as the small farming group.  The present classification into the three categories, commercial, development and transitional farmers, is based on comparable income levels. For instance, many farmers in the western, north-western and south western counties are classed as transitional because of the physical disadvantage of the small size of farms.  Consequently they receive lower subsidised loans or grants than the development farmers and they do not get any guidance premiums. Therefore, with the passage of time their position will become even worse than that of the development farmers.</P>
    <P>There is one hope, namely, if the scheme for disadvantaged areas is implemented immediately.  In that event, headage payments would be due on cattle and sheep and these would raise the income of the farmers concerned for the purpose of income assessment under the farm modernisation scheme.  This would improve their chances of being classed as development farmers and of further improving the added benefits that apply to development farmers.  In addition, both transitional and development farmers would get higher interest subsidies and loans because they were in disadvantaged areas.  It is essential that this scheme be introduced immediately and I urge the Minister to do his utmost to get it into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another point that could be made in relation to Directive No. 159 is that the comparable income levels should be introduced to allow more transitional <Col N="1140" /> farmers into the development category.  The net income level of £1,800 per labour unit each year applied in 1974.  This level is to be increased in 1975 to £1,875, in 1976 to £1,950, in 1977 to £2,025, in 1978 to £2,100 and in 1979 to £2,200.</P>
    <P>The increases are projected on the basis of expected increases in inflation and wages in the non-farming sector. The problem in the Irish situation is that farm incomes in general have suffered in the past year much more than the non-farming sector.  Secondly incomes in the Dublin area are well above the rest of the country.  These raise the average non-farming income substantially and make it more difficult for the transitional or small farmer to qualify for development status. Comparable income levels which exclude Dublin City would be more realistic in provincial areas, and certainly in the western, north-western and south-western areas.</P>
    <P>Directive No. 159 will create a situation in a period of six years where all farmers will be categorised as commercial farmers.  Any farmer unable to obtain the commercial status will have the option of trying to survive on his farm without grants or aids or else trying to seek a livelihood in industry.  The vital question is: will farmers who leave argiculture be gainfully employed in the industrial sector?  I do not think it is necessary for me to remind the House that the employment situation has been deteriorating since the Coalition took office approximately two years ago to a situation where there are more than 100,000 people unemployed.  I hope this is only a temporary phenomenon and will not continue for long but it shows the futility of hoping we can absorb into industry those who are leaving agriculture.</P>
    <P>The second point with regard to the farm modernisation scheme is that the poultry and pig production enterprises that have been so helpful in the past for the small farming community will not be eligible for any aid.  It is not right that these industries should be written off in this way and I ask the Minister to try to reverse the situation if possible.  The <Col N="1141" /> pig industry will get aid if investment is more than £4,620.  In this instance the small man is left out and is not being considered.  The man classified as a small farmer will exist only to 19th April, 1977.  The transitional or small farmer is penalised when he reaches the age of 55 years and grants are reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent.  Many of these farmers have young families and they should be on a par with the development category and not penalised when they reach 55 years.  This is a valid point and I hope the Minister will ensure that the present provision is changed.</P>
    <P>At present the comparable income limit is £1,800.  This is too high and it should be reduced to £1,000 per annum.  This would be more realistic when one considers the results of the farm management survey carried out by An Foras Talúntais in 1972.  It showed that if the comparable income of £1,800 is taken 75 per cent of Irish farmers will be excluded from getting incentives and preferential aids under the farm modernisation scheme.  We must not forget that for every £3 spent by the Exchequer on the implementation of the scheme, we benefit to the tune of only £1 from Brussels.</P>
    <P>The documentation relating to the farm modernisation scheme is believed by many to be very complicated. It appears it should be simplified so that agricultural advisers will not spend valuable time in their offices rather than in doing the work they are trained to do, namely, to give advice regarding agricultural matters on the farm.  The documentation concentrates too heavily on the financial aspects of farming.  Having regard to the problem of farming and the inconsistency of the industry, it is difficult to see how figures over a period of a few years can have any relevance, never mind figures projected over a six-year period.</P>
    <P>With regard to the small farmer, the Minister should make an immediate statement on his plans for this category as from 19th April, 1977. The Minister knows that this matter has been raised in the House on more than one occasion in the last 18 months.  The time has now come when <Col N="1142" /> he must make a definite statement on what his intentions are.  It is important, in relation to the income of £1,800, to evaluate how the non-farm sector could provide employment for people who are forced out of farming for economic reasons.  With the situation where we have an unemployment figure of 100,000 and over, the prospects at the present time are far from being bright for employment outside of farming.  If there is unemployment in the non-farming sector a very strong case can be made for slowing down structural changes in farming. If a man can be unemployed outside farming it certainly makes sense to retain him in farming if he is making a net contribution in that sector.</P>
    <P>There is a need in the present disastrous economic circumstances for a holding operation in regard to structural reform.  A policy should be flexible enough to permit such action in the farm modernisation scheme, whereby development farmers and those adhering to an approved plan would become commercial within a period of six years.  Is it being realistic for this farmer to draw up a plan for 1980 showing how much he will produce and earn in that year?  I should like to hear the Minister give a specific answer to that question.  I refer him to statements made by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, in the House recently when he could not even forecast for 12 or 18 months ahead, never mind forecasting for the 1980s.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to predict the financial situation in farming over a certain number of years.  From the early 1960s, to the late 1960s, with consistent economic output, it would have been impossible.  But in the last two years, having regard to the situation in the Irish economy, such predictions are not possible.  It would be much more desirable to know the increases in cattle or pigs numbers or the number of additional acres of tillage or grain which a farmer might be able to produce than the amount of financial data which is required in the documentation relating to the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>All aids to farmers under this scheme are based on the level of income, so <Col N="1143" /> the keeping of farm accounts is one of the essential requirements of this scheme.  This is a welcome development. It is important for all farmers to keep accounts but all the financial data required might not be necessary. The keeping of accounts should be in relation to increases in stock, tillage and grain.  The orientation should be in that direction and away from the financial requirement because, to be quite honest, Irish farmers are a little suspicious that the financial requirement will be used for taxation purposes rather than to benefit them in the long run.  I know the Minister has done his best to try to allay that suspicion but it is important to realise that it is held.</P>
    <P>The documentation will change the role of the adviser.  It will reduce his role to that of an office boy because of the volume of documentation involved. I am sure the Minister realises that the implementation of the farm modernisation scheme is in a dreadful mess.  The number of applications finally processed and ready to go ahead is so small in comparison with the total number of applications that it appears that even with the advisers working at full steam the best they can hope for is to process one-and-a-half applications in a week.  Those of us who represent rural constituencies know that unless something dramatic is done by the Minister and his Department to provide enough staff to deal with the applications and have them processed finally, then we will be in a very bad situation and we will not have the benefits under the scheme as it stands apart from the amendments I suggest.  I know the committees of agriculture have asked the Minister to consider favourably allowing them to have additional staff.  Proposals for increases of 50 per cent and 100 per cent in advisory staff have been put forward.  I know the cost involved and the trouble the Minister will have, but the problem is there and he has the responsibility to do something about it very quickly.</P>
    <P>In general it seems that the farm modernisation scheme is based on production commodities whose prices are expected to remain fairly stable. <Col N="1144" /> These production commodities will have a better chance of acceptance under this scheme rather than a plan based on products whose prices are likely to fluctuate a good deal.  A farm plan based on milk as against one based on cattle will probably have a much better chance of being accepted for qualifying under this scheme. Since the amount of investment aid is based on the value of investment the scheme also favours a high capital intensive development as against a low capital intensive development.</P>
    <P>Another point in relation to the farm development plan is that the farmer can only vary his investment programme to some extent.  His farm operation can be varied only with the approval of the advisers.  If he does not obtain this approval he will lose all future investment aid and possibly he may even have to repay past aids. The question is how departures from the plan should be treated.  Where the farmer convinces the adviser that the change is desirable there is no problem, but because of price uncertainty it is desirable that a farmer be given a certain amount of flexibility to respond.</P>
    <P>There are two main types of farmers who would qualify for development status leading to commercial farming status.  First there is the 50 to 100 acre farmer with good management and intensive operation on his farm.  Secondly, the bigger farmer with a large acreage who can attain the targets laid down with a much less intensive operation.  In both cases you would have an increase in output, but it does not seem very fair to give the same aid to the first category of farmer who needs to work hard to achieve his output and to give preferential aid to a farmer with a very large fertile farm who has a much less intensive operation.  It could be argued that the owner of a large farm might attain a commercial standard of income despite bad management and low income per acre because of the low capital charge on the land&mdash;2 per cent on 500 times the rateable valuation of land, which is about £5 or £6 per acre&mdash;while, on the other hand, a small farmer with high income per acre might find it <Col N="1145" /> impossible, because of the actual size of his operation.</P>
    <P>In drawing up Directive 159 I am convinced the aim was to get the best return from labour rather than from land.  In Ireland there is a pressing need to expand output in agriculture and to create employment.  In Ireland land and capital are the scarce resources rather than labour, which was a scarce resource in Europe when Dr. Mansholt originally introduced the structural reforms now embodied in the farm modernisation scheme. This is a very important point.  In the Irish situation it makes sense to use land and capital intensively rather than labour.</P>
    <P>I understand between 14,000 and 15,000 farmers have applied for categorisation under the farm modernisation scheme.  I appreciate the difficulties and realise it is too early yet to estimate the percentage of applications which will be approved.  Taking the figures on farm income in the 1973 farm management survey of An Foras Talúntais it would appear that 35 per cent is the maximum upper limit of the number of farms which would eventually become commercial.  That leaves 65 per cent of farmers on farms in the Irish Republic as transitional or small farmers on farms that will have no future or identification after April 19th, 1977.  Again I would appeal to the Minister to make a statement immediately on his plans for those farmers, at least 65 per cent or perhaps 75 per cent of all those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the transitional farmer receives less favourable treatment than the development farmer.  For instance, the transitional or small farmer, for investment in permanent buildings, would get a certificate of approval confirming that any investment in permament buildings is essential to the continuance of the present level of activity on the farm and that such buildings would be passed with structural changes in future.  Also the small farmer is not entitled to a guidance premium but the development farmer is, and because he receives less favourable treatment his competitive position relative to the development farmer naturally will be worsened.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> The farm modernisation scheme is very likely to make it harder for the small farmers to expand their enterprises, because development farmers receiving more aid may outbid them for such things as land and extra stock, while the transitional farmers might be in more need of land and stock in order to expand their income.  They might not be able to purchase the land on the open market because they could not borrow sufficient money, as they might not be able to afford the repayments. As well as that the development farmer has priority access to land released by those availing of the new voluntary retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>I would regretfully suggest to the Minister that he ask one of his Departmental aides to check the records of this House to see where the Minister himself denied that this was so at Question Time, admittedly at Question Time cross-fire, many months ago.  Anyway he is on the record as saying that this is not so.  I am satisfied that the small farmer, the transitional farmer, should have priority access to this land.  As I have already mentioned, there is unemployment in the farming sector.  Therefore there is a very good case indeed for retaining labour in agriculture, and if the transitional farmer is a hard-working man using his limited sources to the best advantage, it would be economically inefficient and inequitable to treat him less favourably than a person with a large fertile farm who could make development status without a high intensity of operation on his land.  It would seem the small farmers will have to go their own way and do without investment grants.  They must either opt for the retirement scheme, or try to eke out a living the best way they can, or try to get some unskilled employment opportunity in the industrial sector which, as I have said, is impossible at present.</P>
    <P>Directive 160 provides annuities for people willing to retire from farming. This would apply to farms under 45 acres, so that the average amount of land made available for this scheme would be a maximum of about 25,000 acres.  This is wrong.  This would give only a marginal amount of land for <Col N="1147" /> structural change.  Under Directive 160 land owners who have let their land may not be eligible under the retirement scheme, that is, if they have been letting their land within two years previous to the introduction of this scheme.  If a transitional farmer has to get additional land in order to be categorised, he can only get additional land by either borrowing or getting it from the Land Commission, and it will be more difficult for them because land which is bought will impose an additional financial burden on the small farmer.</P>
    <P>In summary, in trying to improve the farmer's welfare, I would submit that there is a very great need for flexibility in the existing farm modernisation scheme.  Stringent adhesion to the six-year plan with the financial data required is unrealistic in farming conditions of uncertainty and inconsistency. Farmers who wish to achieve development categorisations by acquiring additional land with borrowed capital have to generate a higher income per acre to cover the higher capital allowance for such land, because there is higher capital output on land which is bought in as additional land.  This would make it very difficult for those who try to make a living from farming on a small acreage to qualify under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The structural measures specified under the scheme are unsuited to Irish conditions due to the scarcity of our farm employment and due to the high unemployment situation in industry.  Structural changes are economically forcing people off the land into the industrial sector where we already have this fantastic number unemployed.  This is economic suicide for our country.  A holding operation here is imperative, because there is a lack of non-farming opportunities for unskilled and semi-skilled people leaving the land.  It would be well for the Minister to take into account that at least 65 and possibly 75 per cent are estimated to be in the small farmer category under the present terms of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The lack of alternative employment for transitional farmers, the higher capital charges on land obtained from <Col N="1148" /> the Land Commission, or by borrowing, and the exclusion from the retirement scheme of those who had ceased to work on their farms, will limit the scope for adjustment within the farm area.  Under Directive 159, in the Irish dimension, investment aid is dependent on being able to obtain a comparable income, whereas the ability to manage the farm is a more appropriate criterion if agricultural production and exports are to expand.  Given the scarcity of capital and the chronic unemployment situation in the industrial sector, it is undesirable to substitute capital for labour in farming at this time.</P>
    <P>A holding operation is imperative until the EEC come up with an effective regional policy.  Structural changes should be brought into being immediately, because the present policy is unsuited to Irish conditions, and under any circumstances the Irish Government should seek EEC approval for modification of this farm modernisation scheme.  In particular, the granting of aids and incentives on the basis of rate of return on capital resources of the farm rather than what the capacity of the farm is to generate comparable income would allow greater support for an intensive farmer with a few cattle at the expense of the larger farmer, the gentleman farmer, who has large cattle resources.  If EEC aid is conditional on structural changes, it should be based on criteria which would take account of the obtainable earned income outside of farming, because the average farmer who is economically forced off his farm is not able to earn the average income in the industrial sector; he is normally unskilled or at best semi-skilled, and this comparable income should be based on the obtainable earned income.</P>
    <P>As regards the dividing of the country into various regions where some are more fertile than others and some have greater disadvantages than others, I believe the disadvantaged areas scheme, which held out great hope for many small farmers, should be got off the ground immediately, because, the morale of the farmer, particularly in the west, the south-west and the northwest, is at the lowest level it has been <Col N="1149" /> for many years.  During the course of this debate the Minister will hear genuine comments from members of this party on the situation in the west.  I know the Minister is an extremely busy man but it would be worth his while to go down to the west and meet the people there and discuss with them their problems and see how they and their families are affected.  Things are at such a low ebb that it is difficult to imagine that even the implementation of the disadvantaged area scheme as quickly as possible will get them back on any sort of decent level.  The Minister and his colleagues should see how things are for themselves.  Our contributions to this debate will not be for the purpose of gaining some political advantage but rather for the purpose of urging the Minister and the Government to do their best for people who badly need help.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute the following:</P>
      <P>(a)  notes that the schemes introduced in this country to implement EEC Directives 159 and 160 provide new and improved benefits and opportunities for small farmers and requests the Government to ensure that those schemes are adequately promoted and that farmers are not misled by false and inaccurate statements being circulated concerning their aims and effects; and</P>
      <P>(b)  approves of the various measures introduced in support of the cattle industry; notes the improvement in cattle prices which has taken place in recent weeks; and asks the Government to continue its efforts to safeguard the interests of producers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the way in which Deputy Collins has approached the problems under discussion here.  In my contribution I hope to give the maximum information in relation to the operation of the 159 EEC scheme and my colleague, the Minister for Lands, will deal with 160 because that is his responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> I have tabled my amendment in order to emphasise that there is a positive and, I would say, much better approach to the difficulties under discussion, an approach that sets out to give assistance, support and encouragement as against further highlighting the problems and adding to the lack of confidence.  The lack of confidence and the peculiar pessimism that appear to exist arise mainly from the depression in the beef and cattle industry.  This depression has hit the small farmers particularly badly.  Some people blame the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Government and some blame the European Economic Community, but there is one point I would like to emphasise: were it not for our membership of the EEC the position would be ten times worse.  I hope this is widely appreciated.</P>

      <P>Because of membership of the EEC one of the things we have been able to do is to take 500,000 cattle off the market into intervention at reasonable prices.  It is, of course, true that all of this money did not get back to the producers and I suppose it is fair to ask me what I have done or tried to do in the circumstances. It is fair to say that the middlemen made excessive profits.  We all recognise that.  I did what I could to make contact with these people who were making these excessive profits and I asked them to co-operate.  I got some co-operation but I did not get enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there are all sorts of things that could be considered in circumstances of this kind. We have given an undertaking that we will try to set up an inquiry to see how we could arrive at a situation in which there would be a more equitable distribution of profits as between the producers and those who provide the service.  Arising out of my efforts to get co-operation from these people we got some money from them, money that would otherwise have gone to swell their profits and this money <Col N="1151" /> went into the starting of the food voucher scheme.  That scheme has been criticised.  Every attempt made to rectify the situation has been criticised, perhaps unfairly.  When the food voucher scheme finishes the farmers will have got approximately £3,250,000 by way of direct grant.  Someone said it was not worth a damn.  All I can say is that I would like anybody to try insulting me with a £30 subsidy on food; they would be a long time trying to insult me.</P>
      <P>This scheme is a good one.  The only drawback is that we did not have enough money to benefit more farmers but we are now able to extend the scheme.  Of the total applications 85 per cent are from the west so we have at least proved that the assistance is going to the right people, the people in greatest need.  The scheme is being responsibly administered.  In addition to that, we have extended the loan subsidy scheme for another six months. Many Members looked for an extension of this scheme and farming organisations did likewise and we have now agreed to extend it for six months. It was only a couple of days ago we got permission to do this from the EEC. There was considerable difficulty about getting permission.  But we have got permission for both these aid schemes and I believe they will be a considerable help to farmers in the poorer areas who are short of fodder and short of money.</P>
      <P>Our efforts to assist these people have not been confined to these two schemes.  We must have regard to the fact that in 1974 £9.4 million was spent aiding the beef industry under the beef incentive scheme and approximately half of this sum went to the west of Ireland.  In addition to that we have provided in the Estimates £6 million towards the hill and handicapped areas scheme.  A fairish amount of money is being channelled into the west.  I have not mentioned the increases in social welfare benefits but they are an additional expense on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe a fair effort is being made to help these people.  I know they are in serious trouble.  I know the bigger farmers and those who finish cattle got the benefit of intervention and of <Col N="1152" /> the various slaughter premiums provided. As Members know, it is part of the package proposed on prices in Brussels that there will be 30 units of account per animal as a sort of headage payment provided.  I do not know whether we will get agreement on that but I have raised the possibility of paying that directly to the farmers at a younger age.  If it is accepted, I do not know how far down we will be allowed to go.</P>
    <P>People talk very glibly about a floor price.  Farming organisations have talks about a floor price.  The Opposition have taken up the cry for a floor price.  The party in Opposition were in Government for a long time but they never introduced a floor price.  Having talked about a floor price for a long time, nobody has indicated how this would be provided, at what stage it would be paid, and how it would be administered.  It is an extremely difficult job however you look at it.  Even if we had the money tomorrow, it would be very difficult to find a way to get down to the level of a man with a five cwt. or six cwt. beast, and he is the person who has been hit worst.  How do you give him a price?  How do you get to his cattle? Do you weigh them or assess them? A fleet of people would be needed. The cost of administering such a scheme would be very high.  These are all very serious problems and I can assure the House they are being looked at seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins spoke at some length about the importance he attaches to the introduction of the hill and handicapped area scheme at the earliest possible date.  I can assure him that his anxiety and concern are not greater than my own.  When we had our recent discussions in Brussels on a possible price package, some member states wanted this separated from the price package.  They felt it was a separate matter and that it should be discussed separately.  I refused to accept that and Mr. Barry, speaking for Ireland, refused absolutely to accept it.  At least the scheme is still there.  It is my hope and expectation that it will be possible to get it agreed as part of the package.  If it is agreed as part of the package we <Col N="1153" /> will implement it with the least possible delay.  It should provide very substantial assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided £6 million in the Estimates for this. When we add what we get from Brussels, we will be putting money into the west of Ireland, money which is badly needed in the west. As Deputy Collins rightly pointed out, if we get this scheme under way, it will be possible to bring more of these people into the development category when we are working on the modernisation scheme.</P>
      <P>I mention these things in some detail because it is very easy to give the impression that everybody is ignoring the plight of these unfortunate people. Nobody in the Government is ignoring or is prepared to ignore the plight of these unfortunate people.  We have gone a long way in trying to provide assistance, and we are making every effort to arrive at the point where these people will be in very much happier circumstances.  Nobody wants to see people who have worked all their lives suffering hardship.  As I say, it is very easy for people to talk glibly about a floor price.  Fianna Fáil were a long time in office and I am sure all the difficulties were confronting them when they looked at it.  It has never been done.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that when there was a guaranteed price for barley and pigs it was James Dillon who brought it in, not the Fianna Fáil Government. I would be very glad to introduce this if I thought it was feasible and if we could guarantee that it would not cost the Exchequer more than we could afford to provide for it.  That could happen very easily if there were a very bad slump in the cattle and beef trade.  This is what has caused all the trouble.  This slump is not peculiar to Ireland and it is not peculiar to Europe.  All over the world there is this difficulty at present.</P>

      <P>Putting down the boot never gives me any pleasure.  I only put down the boot when there is no alternative.  When things go too far we have to consider what can and what should be done.  We have had a serious depression in cattle and beef prices.  I maintain that the Government did the maximum in the circumstances. Never before in the history of this country were one million cattle processed and never before had the job to be faced of getting 500,000 cattle into intervention storage.  I cannot speak too highly of the people in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries who undertook this task and carried it through extremely successfully.  It should be recognised publicly that people in the Department were working practically night and day.  I should like to acknowledge what they have done because they did a first-class job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pass on from the difficulties in that area to the second part of Deputy Collins's speech which was devoted to the 159 scheme. Deputy Collins made certain statements which I would describe as <Col N="1155" /> fliers.  He made those statements in the <i>Farming Independent</i> on Saturday. He described the whole thing as being an absolute shambles and said all sorts of things about people in the Department, their failures, and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

Obviously he misunderstands the situation and I want to give him any information about it that I can.  Before 31st December 19,786 applications were received and for 9,264 of those applications eligibility had been determined. We are talking of approximately half the applications received before 31st December.  I should like to get home to Deputy Collins that when eligibility has been determined work can proceed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I just cannot lay hands on it at the moment but I am <Col N="1156" /> giving you the position generally.  I dealt with the position in Limerick particularly because I knew that Deputy Collins was moving this motion and I saw all the criticism in the paper.  The number of applications on 31/12/74 was 840.  In 372 of those eligibility had been determined.  The number classified was 142 and the number planned, 35.  Again, I must emphasise that in cases where eligibility was determined they can go ahead and there is no reason why they should be held up.  From 1st January 144 cases were fully planned compared with the 35 planned up to 31st December. I point this out just to emphasise the extent to which dealing with the problem has been speeded up.  They have become accustomed to dealing with it and the throughput has been more than doubled.  From 1st January 144 cases were fully planned compared with 135 planned up to the 31st December.  This shows the CAOs and advisory officers are beginning to find the job easy; it was difficult to begin with.  Any new scheme is difficult to get under way and people must become accustomed to dealing with it. The CAO has reported that applications are being processed twice as quickly as they are being received.</P>
      <P>This is important.  For the first six months after February when the scheme was introduced the advisory services were not giving co-operation in the operation of it and a backlog built up but we have the evidence here from the CAO in Limerick that he is now catching up on this backlog and that in three or four months he will have it completely cleared.  That is in contrast to what Deputy Collins said.</P>
      <P>He also spoke of the difficulty of staffing.  Incidentally staff have been increased quite substantially in my short time as Minister and the offices have been told that if they need extra clerical staff they are free to get them. I do not think we shall have any difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points made by Deputy Collins in his criticism was that they would be diverted from other work and that this was a pity.  I think the insinuation was that their job would <Col N="1157" /> now be downgraded, that they would be messenger boys.  Nothing of the sort will happen.  The advisory personnel are now embarking on far more valuable work than ever before because if they are to set up programmes for farmers to reach full development status, they are being put on their mettle: their knowledge is being tested.  Consequently, they will do their work carefully.  They will watch the results of their own advice and their own work.  Certainly, it is far from a waste of time.</P>
    <P>There is quite a substantial staff in Limerick, the present quota of instructors being 22&mdash;no small quota for Limerick.  Two were added in 1974. I do not want to go into any more detail about Limerick but it is going pretty well.  Of course, there are things wrong with the scheme.  I recognise this but I did not set up the scheme and had no part in it.  It was all done before I arrived.  Without doubt, at a later date we can make a case for the revision of the scheme but as I have often said there is no point in rushing in saying that we find this and that wrong with a scheme and want it changed now because immediately you will be asked how long you are operating the scheme and if you have found these complaints in practice.  They know the answers themselves.  We have not been really operating the scheme.  We are only attempting to operate it now for six months.  We would have to operate it for at least a year before making a case for the type of changes that will become obvious in the course of working the scheme.</P>
    <P>We have a good deal of difficulty about the matter of comparable income. We would like to see a lower comparable income and we have tried very hard and are trying at present to secure it but it is not being accepted. Unfortunately, there are people still here who think that I have only to go to Brussels and bang the table and get what I want and come back and implement it.</P>

      <P>We have set aside £6 million for the scheme in the present year.  I have gone into the operation of Directive 159 in very considerable detail in the Seanad and I have put all the data in relation to it already on record.  I think it is hardly necessary to go over this again but one thing I want to emphasise is a matter that is being misrepresented all the time: people are being given the impression that they are now somehow worse off than before the modernisation scheme was brought in. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister for Lands will deal with that later. Deputy Collins talked about the fertiliser subsidies and the drop in fertilisers. He felt that we should be doing something about this.  There is a fertiliser subsidy scheme in existence here but there is none in any other EEC country.  We are on very dangerous <Col N="1159" /> ground if we start to talk about new fertiliser subsidies; we could lose what we have and I do not want to lose that.  I agree with what the Deputy said about the green £.  In my view the green £ is the most important thing for Irish farmers in a prize package and we have emphasised that over and over again.  It is true to say that much of the benefit we got last October has since been eroded by the further devaluation of sterling.  This is one of the things we are fighting very hard on, and while I cannot guarantee we will be successful I hope we will be.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins felt that the MCA system should be abolished but in my view it cannot.  Unfortunately, it cannot be abolished until we have monetary and economic union and that is obviously quite a long way off. Deputy Collins also spoke about Brussels trying to back out of this but in my view they are not really trying to back out but they will resist any approach for anything special of this kind.  We have to try to make our case and fight our way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was agreeable to allow the Minister finish what he was saying but he ought to have been aware that we are all on a tight schedule.  I was waiting for the Minister to give his response to the cogent case made by our spokesman on agriculture, Deputy Collins, to deal with a situation which must be called a crisis situation, but the Minister has not said anything at all about it.  One would be very niggardly if one did not admit that the Minister made a very brave try to put some kind of complexion on the agricultural situation as it is at present.  The Minister reminded me of the old jingle about Brian O'Lynn:</P>
      <P>And the bridge fell down and we fell in; there is ground at the bottom says Brian O'Lynn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> That was the type of framework that was behind the Minister's contribution tonight.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a valiant effort to put up a smokescreen over the situation that has obtained in Irish agriculture over the last 12 months.  It was an effort to talk to the people, probably the majority of Irish farmers, who were seen to be subjected to treatment of the kind that is accorded to Indians on a reservation in the United States.  This party will not regard the farmers of Ireland as Indians on a reservation; we will not participate at all in even the partial removal of the farmers from the living they are entitled to.  We assert that our membership of the EEC guarantees, in the Treaty of Rome, the availability of assistance to farmers especially in the areas at the extremities of the Community, Ireland and southern Italy.</P>
    <P>The fact must be faced that the Government since taking over the operation of our participation in the EEC have failed signally to acquit Ireland's rights in the Community.  We have been treated to a very highly efficient programme of public relations. Every time the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries went to Brussels he returned with some kind of a triumph and the one before Christmas was the most hollow of all. One of the Dublin daily newspapers carried the banner headline: &ldquo;Sugar Bonanza&rdquo;.  I have forgotten how many million pounds the writer of that headline put on that bonanza. The bonanza was that in the context of a serious shortfall in sugar supply in the European Community the quotas allotted to the sugar beet growing countries were increased.  The quota of Belgium was increased by about 40 per cent while the quotas of Germany, Holland and France were increased a great deal more than ours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time an undertaking was given by the EEC to subsidise sugar to the British consumer. I believe we got an increase of 40,000 tons of sugar in our quota. We saw in more recent times the <Col N="1161" /> serious developments that have taken place since then and the precarious situation in which our vital sugar industry is in at present.  I am citing that case as the latest in the catalogue of these phoney triumphant returns home on the part of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. I appeal to the Minister to drop this attitude because it is doing this country very serious harm, apart from the fact that it is very misleading.</P>
      <P>During the Cork by-election a lot of campaigning was done, by the Fine Gael Party especially, arising out of the fact that members of my party opposed the partial devaluation of the £ proposed by the Commission and put into effect on 7th October last, the 11.4 devaluation that took place. We opposed this devaluation in the knowledge that this was of no value whatever to us because nothing less than a full 15.3 at that time would have eased the movement of cattle from here.  This devaluation ought to have taken place 12 months ago.  I am certain that if the Government at that time had approached the Commission for this devaluation of the agricultural £ they would have had their request gladly acceded to.  This is beyond question and I was informed about this by the Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion coming from me that we should devalue the agricultural £ was treated <Col N="1162" /> with ridicule.  By June we were told that the matter was receiving consideration. Then the poorest of our farmers, the holders of young cattle, had perforce to sell them.  To say &ldquo;sell&rdquo; is really to give it a wrong tag.  They gave them away.  They sold them for £5 a cwt and less.  The reason given for their having to do so was the bottleneck that took place in the off-take of finished cattle.  This bottleneck will continue until we begin to get cattle on to the Continent of Europe.  The Government failed.  It was not the fault of the EEC, it was not the fault of the Commission. It was the fault of the Government and nobody else.  I think it a very reprehensible thing on the part of the Government to seek, collectively, at any rate, to shove off the blame for this on to the EEC, because there is a subtle campaign going on, being aided and abetted by certain members of the Government, to denigrate our membership of the EEC.  Anybody who knows anything about the economics of exporting agricultural produce, even over the past five years, will know that had we not been a member of the EEC for the past couple of years, our situation would have been far worse.  But the Government, collectively, in order to avoid accepting the blame they should have accepted, are seeking to shove it over onto the Commission, sometimes even to the degree of identifying people in the Commission who ought be blamed.</P>

      <P>That cattle herd was being developed, the numbers were increasing and the quality of the cattle was improving because use was being made of good quality bulls. There was good quality insemination at the insemination stations.  What is happening now?  The numbers of inseminations at those stations at present are dropping drastically and whatever number of cows are being put in calf are being serviced by scrub bulls.  In turn, the heifers they will breed will have a ruinous effect on the quality of Irish cattle.</P>

      <P>In the last 12 months more than three times the number of cows were slaughtered in factories than in the previous year and, of those, a great many were in calf when they were so slaughtered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The future of our daily complexes, of Avonmore, Ballyclough, Mitchelstown and so on, is dependent on an increasing supply of milk.  There has been installed recently at Avonmore an ultra-modern cheese plant.  In order to finance that plant Avonmore must have an increasing supply of milk.  I think the reality is that there is going to be a drop in creamery intake next year because of the slaughter of cows and of the fear and failure of farmers to put cows in calf.  Firms, such as the one I have mentioned, will find themselves in difficulty because they will not have a sufficient through-put <Col N="1164" /> to make their modern and expensive plants economic.</P>
    <P>We have even heard talk in this House, from the Government benches, of a situation in which it was said we had too many cattle.  This is absolute nonsense.  Had the Government taken the vital steps to ensure that the produce of our herd was marketed when it was fit to be marketed things would have been different.  But, because the Government dithered&mdash;because there was a split between the Labour Ministers and those of the Fine Gael Party who did understand the vital necessity of getting our finished cattle out of the country and receiving payment for them&mdash;and came up with a half devaluation which, I am glad to say, Fianna Fáil voted against in the European Parliament, on 7th October, that was of no value at all and did nothing to rescue the people about whom we were talking in this new technical language of ours &ldquo;in the disadvantaged areas&rdquo;, the Indians in the reservation of Connacht.  I want to say to the Government, to the Minister, that we will never think of our people in the west as people to be treated as Indians in reservation.  That is the way the Government are treating them and nobody else is responsible for having got them into that situation at present.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister to try to persuade his colleagues of the central fact that the most important thing in our economy is our cattle herd.  Anything that damages it damages the whole country and everybody in it. It is the sorry record of the Government that in the past 12 months they have played hop with this herd that was developing especially rapidly in the late sixties until Fianna Fáil went out of office.  On this side of the House we are compelled to seek floor prices for cattle.  The Minister asks in dismay: &ldquo;How on earth can one operate a system like that?&rdquo; Let me tell the Minister that the British Government have been operating a minimum price system for decades.  It is not by any means inoperable.  What one does is that one determines a reference price each week and the deficiency is made up, as it had been for decades, by the British Government.  But I would not recommend that.</P>

      <P>I would not recommend that as a permanent feature of our cattle economy because it need not be if finished cattle were taken off systematically and the arrangements for their marketing was systematic.  There is a very large market for Irish store cattle in northern France.  There is a very large market for cattle, both live and dead, in the Low Countries and in Germany but we cannot get in there because of monetary compensatory amounts.  And those are prohibitively high because the Government failed to devalue the agricultural £ sufficiently. Therefore, let that responsibility rest where it belongs.</P>
      <P>Looking back over the sorry performance of the Government during the past 12 months I am not very sanguine in asking them to adopt an emergency measure even now to get a floor price for small cattle.  We are not asking that this become a permanent feature of the cattle economy; we are talking in emergency terms but we want the cattle trade to carry itself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>As our spokesman on Finance has said, we agree in principle with the idea of a capital gains tax.  In any free society it is not healthy that some people can make money very easily at the expense of others while the working person is taxed highly, over-taxed in recent times, on the income he earns. Such a situation enables some rich to become richer at the expense of others who are not as clever or as slick as themselves.  Socially, it is bad and causes grievance and envy among those who, for one reason or another are not able to gain similar advantages.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum tells us that the object of the Bill is to give effect to the White Paper proposals. I believe that the White Paper caused considerable damage to potential energy, initiative and confidence among the enterprising and energetic. It is not possible to assess how many people may have been deterred from enterprise because of what they believed to be on the cards and neither can we assess the degree to which the publication of that document may have helped to slow down the economy.  We support the principle of just taxation.  Our spokesman has put forward some suggestions on the lines that we consider to be more equitable and more beneficial than those being adopted by the Minister. We are questioning the proposal of a flat level of taxation.  In adopting this proposal the Minister may be overlooking the earlier history of this country.  It is not much longer than 100 years ago since people were driven out of Ireland because of privation, discrimination and hunger. Even up to the late 'fifties many of our people were giving their energy and their enterprise to other countries. However, I doubt that it is the intention of the Minister to discourage enterprise but it is our conclusion that the proposals before us would have that effect.  I should hope that the Government would not wish to deter individual energy and enterprise in an economy such as ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider the Government to be erring in relation to the level of tax proposed in that there is no provision <Col N="1167" /> for dealing with the exploitation of people and property by slick merchants whose only aim in life is to be in the market place making easy money.  When approaching a subject of this kind it is of the utmost importance to bear in mind the fact that the individual who makes money easily on the stock exchange, who engages in a sort of business of buying and selling property&mdash;perhaps land, the value of which increases rapidly because it is needed for development&mdash;should be made contribute to society and to the economy.  It is important, also, that we should tap the energy and the enterprise of people who wish to make a success of life, who are willing to work hard in order to make a success for themselves and, as developers, to make a success indirectly for those for whom they provide employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should take a second look at that aspect of the proposals. I would remind him of the many efforts made by all Governments since the establishment of the State to bring about the development and the expansion of industry.  This policy was begun in the 'twenties and it was accelerated considerably by the late Seán Lemass. Tremendous efforts were made by him particularly but also by those on all sides in general to bring life into what one might describe as a relatively derelict economy, to generate confidence among the people and to get them off their knees economically.</P>
    <P>Those years of hard work, risk and effort brought about many changes, changes which we can see around us today.  They even resulted in many thousands returning from abroad to find work here who had earlier been forced to emigrate.  As the Minister said, it is right to collect tax in as equitable a manner as possible.  Our spokesman put a good case for a different level of tax to be imposed on the get rich quick merchant as distinct from the hard working individual. Is this not reasonable.  If a couple of men or women set up an industry, develop it, provide employment and put five or ten years into that enterprise, the level of tax for these people should not be the same as that imposed on <Col N="1168" /> those individuals who, as we have seen in the last few years, were able to buy quick in a market, sell within a year or two and make very large sums of money.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that in putting our case we may be exposing ourselves to interpretation that we are on the side of the rich.  It is futile to argue with people who think like that.  In putting reasonable alternatives forward in the area of capital gains tax our main concern is fundamentally in the interests and expansion of the economy. I believe it is equally in the interests of the Minister and the Government to ensure that enterprise is not deterred.</P>
    <P>It may be possible to arrive at different proposals to those put forward by our spokesman.  He suggested a time limit of perhaps 15 years and a fall in tax over that period.  I am sure the Minister would say that no method of taxation is perfect but I am very concerned that we continue to encourage investment, particularly by individuals, in business, industry and farming.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that a person with means surplus to current needs can easily arrange to invest in low yielding investment with a view to converting them in due course into substantial tax free capital gains.  I should like him to give a couple of examples when replying, because it strikes me that that is what the Post Office is doing at the present time.</P>
    <P>People who have surpluses and no means of providing for retirement do this.  In most cases their intention is to try to find some kind of investment which will at least keep pace with inflation. In the case of this type of long-term investment to which he refers, will inflation over ten or 15 years be taken into account?  I am not sure from what he said whether it would be or not.  For example, a person may invest in this way and have to sell if the investment terminates.  I gather from the Schedule that certain stocks are excluded.  There could be other types of stock which might have the same level of capital gain as one would find in Exchequer stocks which terminate in so many years.  If it is that type of stock to which the Minister <Col N="1169" /> is referring, it seems to me to be entirely unjust.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that the low yielding investments he has in mind will at least be covered by inflation.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister again that our aim is in the best interests of the economy to encourage the creation of jobs.  I have another query to put to the Minister relating to the valuation of shares dated 1st April, 1974.  As most people know most securities over the past two or three years have fallen by as much as 60 to 65 per cent. If an individual purchased shares five or ten years ago, is the purchase price to be taken into consideration in the event of disposal at any time? Or the value as at 1st April, 1974? This is important to a number of people.  It would be unjust if the idea were to take the valuations not as of date of purchase but of 1st April last.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that one of the dilemmas arising from our recent economic recession has been, in some cases, not the creation of wealth by a few people but the ease with which some people have been able to manipulate the market and make easy money either through the purchase of development land or the buying and selling of different farms.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that the creation of wealth through expansion and development of resources, that is the creation of real wealth, is essential to any community because until wealth has been created through some kind of enterprise there can be no benefit for the community. To discourage a system of wealth creation through enterprise in that way in our society, simply because wealth for its own sake is seen as bad, is short-sighted.  I believe that would be the effect of the overall flat level of tax being proposed.  The implementation of the level suggested here could result in a slow down in economic growth.  This could have the effect we talked of earlier referring to a previous occasion when employment was not available here and people had to leave.  It could have the effect of exporting the most valuable resources any nation can have&mdash;energy and enterprise.  People with these qualities <Col N="1170" /> want to achieve success and if they cannot do so here will try to do so elsewhere.  If it were to have that effect it could only result in a more impoverished community.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would repeat that I, and I believe everybody on this side of the House, agrees with the Minister when he says that huge tax free capital gains are simply not defensible. I would agree that the maker of such a gain should be reasonably expected to pay a proportion of it in tax without hardship.  I should like to assure the Minister that I am not concerned really with the question of hardship to an individual who has succeeded in making a substantial amount of money through some enterprise, particularly a development enterprise.  I am concerned with the effect this type of taxation may have in deterring or discouraging that kind of enterprise.  I hope the Minister will look carefully at that aspect before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Because of the difficulty of establishing conclusively the detailed effects of any proposed tax changes on social justice, business motivation and economic efficiency the Government published, as the House is aware, in February last a White Paper on Capital Taxation.</P>
    <P>The important thing here is business motivation and economic efficiency. If you tax somebody who has worked very hard for a considerable number of years in the same way as you would the person who makes money very quickly you will not contribute to the economy at all.  You may slow down the economy, you may discourage people, you may create a feeling of lack of confidence in the prospects of getting involved in worthwhile enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope that when we come to the Committee Stage the Minister will have considered seriously what is being said from this side of the House in regard to that aspect of capital gains tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I should like to reiterate <Col N="1171" /> what has been said by Deputy Colley in regard to the principle of capital gains.  I have always held that profits on speculation should be subject to a tax of some kind.  We know it is the intention of the Government to abolish death duties as from 6th April, 1975.  I agree this will cost the Exchequer a certain amount of revenue and I believe this revenue should be collected in a particular type of taxation. The abolition of death duties inspired the White Paper on Capital Taxation.  I, for one, welcome the abolition of death duties.  I have always considered death duties an unfair type of taxation imposed at a time when the family is at its weakest. When speaking on Finance Bills I have always said there was a terrible injustice in death duties.  However, we were issued a White Paper which included the present capital gains tax. It also included a gift tax, which will commence on 28th February, 1975; an inheritance tax, which will commence on 1st April, 1975; and a wealth tax, which will commence on 1st April, 1975.  Therefore, in effect, we will have four taxes which the Minister said would just about cover the amount of death duties.  The amount of death duties today is £13 million to £15 million.  I believe those four taxes will bring in amounts far in excess of that. The Minister told us in his budget speech that the wealth tax proposals will come before the House shortly. Today we must confine ourselves to capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said we welcome this Bill with certain reservations.  We believe that short-term speculation should be taxed.  In fairness to everyone people who make substantial profits and contribute nothing to the economy should not be allowed to escape the tax net.  There is need to revise the tax system in order to alleviate poverty and to distribute wealth in an equitable way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Poverty can be created in many ways.  There is poverty caused because of sickness and old age and this can be helped by way of social welfare <Col N="1172" /> benefits.  The social welfare service was designed to help in such cases and this is how it should be used. There is also the poverty caused by unemployment and this is rampant in our society today where there are more than 100,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>When we speak about poverty and unemployment, automatically our minds turn to the availability of capital.  Without capital it is not possible to create the jobs that are necessary.  In his budget speech the Minister spoke about an investment of £400,000,000 in the coming year.  We welcome this because this is how we can alleviate a certain kind of poverty.  However, we must be careful when we introduce taxation that we do not create more poverty.  Although we welcome in principle the Bill before the House we are opposed to certain details in it.  We must ensure that the legislation is used in a proper way and that we encourage investment rather than discourage it.  The Bill is being directed towards a certain group who can deploy their wealth in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to say who will be affected by this Bill, I should be inclined to put them into three categories. There is a certain group, people who might be called the merchants of the world, who have no allegiance to any country.  They will move their wealth to whatever country gives the best return and that section of the business world may be found everywhere.  Generally, we have encouraged some of these people to come here.  They have the best expertise available and they have no inhibitions with regard to pulling out their wealth if they find a haven that will give a better return.  One does not have to delve too closely into the workings of their minds to realise what they are capable of doing.  However, I think they are an asset to the country and the wealth and expertise they bring can create jobs and contribute to the economy.</P>
    <P>The IDA gave grants and tax free allowances to these people to come here.  I do not think that many came for the love of the country but were <Col N="1173" /> encouraged to do so by the incentives offered by the IDA.  Exporting companies will be subject to capital gains tax as a result of this legislation and Deputy Colley mentioned earlier that he was not sure if there was a breach of contract on this aspect.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with this point later.</P>
    <P>There is another section who will make provision for this tax.  These are the people who intend to remain in this country.  In many instances they are families who have had a stake here for hundreds of years.  They are the people who made provision for death duties in the past.  They will take out insurance policies and in their future endeavours they will take account of the fact that 26 per cent of their returns will be subject to tax. I hope it will not inhibit such people with regard to the expansion of their businesses because they have a real interest in the development of the economy and they intend to remain here.  The suggestions put forward by Deputy Colley were intended to deal with this type of person, not the merchants I spoke about earlier who move their finances from one end of the world to the other.  The people I am concerned about have been involved in the business world in this country for many years.</P>
    <P>There is another section who will not make any provision to meet this taxation.  They will drift along as if this Bill never went through the House.  Eventually they will be faced with the prospect of having to sell their businesses and they will realise they have not the assets they thought they had.  There is a danger that when they realise they are faced with this kind of taxation they will hold on. Anyone having experience of the stock exchange knows that when shares drop there is no selling on the exchange. It is the normal instinct to hold on in the hope that things will improve.  The same will happen with certain businesses where the owners will hold on hoping there will be an improvement but, ultimately, because they hold on too long things will get worse.  It would be much better for the State if the individual or the company <Col N="1174" /> concerned sold on the first occasion to an enterprising person who could develop it, generate more wealth within the State and create more employment. These are the three sections of people that this capital gains tax will apply to.  The last man you will find will hold on to that particular business, whether it is a factory or a company and not alone will he lose money but the same benefits will not accrue.</P>
    <P>Before we start going into the details of this Bill we should see the broad implications of it.  We must make sure that in no way do we inhibit the expansion of an industry or a business because what we might gain in the short term we could very well lose in the long term.  It is important to give this initiative to people in business and see that they receive a proper return for the work they put into their business. I have already stated that our party are in favour of capital gains with certain reservations.  We must ensure that too much capital which is accumulating within the country for a capital nature is not brought into the Exchequer and used in the current budget.  If a scheme could be devised where capital gains could accrue to the capital budget I would see some merit in it but I believe that taxation from capital gains to be spent by the Minister for Finance in his current budget is not helping the State. I am quite convinced that it helps in the distribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>Wealth is not distributed by taking it out of the economy and spending it in the current budget.  If you sell a company at £100,000 that means that there is a capital gains tax of £26,000 on it.  If a system could be devised to give that money back to the employees of that company, that is distribution of wealth.  It is not distribution of wealth if you take £26,000 capital gains tax and spend it in the current budget.  If we could devise some type of sharing the wealth of the country among the workers of companies and giving them shares in those companies that is what I would call redistribution of wealth. Until such a time as we devise a system whereby workers share in the profits of companies and have shares in those <Col N="1175" /> companies we will not have redistribution of wealth.</P>
    <P>In section 3 (2) the Minister deals with the rate of taxation which will apply.  He has stated that 26 per cent should apply right across the board, irrespective of how the capital gains is made or over how long you hold the property.  This is one of the major errors in the Bill.  There are some good points in it but I believe that section and one or two other aspects which I will refer to later are a big mistake. The Minister should have a serious look at this section.  Let us take the case of a man who comes into this country, whether a foreigner or somebody in the know.  He acquires property in a particular place in Dublin where he knows in advance about development that is to take place.  There is nothing unusual for such a person to make a profit of £100,000 in 12 months.</P>
    <P>Let us also take the case of a small business man who acquires a property on the 6th April, 1974, who gets married, settles down, rears a family and spends 20 or 30 years working in that business.  There is nothing unusual for such a man to work 16 hours a day expanding that business or company. That person very seldom looks for benefits from the State.  During the time he has expanded the business he has paid his income tax on profits from the business.  Surely it is totally immoral to base the taxation at 26 per cent on the man who can make £100,000 in 12 months and the other man who has spent 40 years' hard work in expanding his business or company.  We put forward a very practical proposal in regard to this issue.  We believe that capital gains on short-term speculation should carry a rate of 50 per cent.  Any man who comes into the country and makes a quick gain has not contributed anything to the country.  He has created very little employment.  The Minister stated today:</P>
    <P>As things stand at present, a person with means surplus to current needs can easily arrange to invest in low yielding investments <Col N="1176" /> with a view to converting them in due course into substantial tax-free capital gains.  Clearly such gains are postponed income.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister had in mind short-term gains.  I thoroughly agree with him on that but I believe the rate is too low for that type of person. I do not believe the Minister had in mind the man who works over 40 years for the State.  He should not be classified in the same category of taxation with the man who comes in and makes a quick profit.</P>
    <P>We have put forward a practical proposal that short-term speculation should come in at 50 per cent, that it should be on a sliding scale over 15 years, and that after 15 years it should not be subject to capital taxation.  If the Minister went along these lines the amount of revenue he would collect in the long-term would be just as large as what he is trying to collect on the basis of 26 per cent across the board.  He would be getting 50 per cent from the person who makes a quick deal.  One of the Minister's own colleagues, Deputy Edward Collins, agreed with this proposal, and said some distinction should be made between the businessman who spends his life in the country and the short-term speculator.  We also propose that if a person is employed full-time within a company, half these rates should apply.  These suggestions will give an incentive to the man who intends to live in this country and to expand his business.  Not alone will this be of benefit to himself but also to the country.  He will be bringing up his family here; he will be contributing taxes, and giving employment. That is the type of taxation which must be devised if the economy is to progress.  It was short-sighted to take a round figure of 26 per cent and apply it to all categories of people.</P>
    <P>The Minister had made no provision in his Bill to cover inflation.  In passing, he said that by taking the lowest rate of income tax, not raising it to the higher rates, he is taking account of inflation.  This is not true. Last year inflation ran at 18 to 20 per cent.  It does not take long to calculate that, if a property is valued at <Col N="1177" /> £100,000 on 7th April, 1974, and inflation runs at 20 per cent, in five years that property will, due to inflation, be worth £200,000.  If the cost of living rises by the same rate as last year, and the other expenses such as insurance and so on continue to increase, the man who sells his property in five years' time at £200,000 is not one penny better off than if he sold it in April, 1974, at £100,000.  In effect, the Minister is taking £26,000 on £100,000, which he considers to be a capital gain.  That is not a capital gain.  The purchasing power of £200,000 will be equivalent to £100,000 in five years' time if the present rate of inflation continues.  If the Minister makes no provision for inflation, and if inflation continues at its present rate for 20 years, he will have the whole property within the State.  The Minister may say he will do this or have a look at that, but that is not sufficient.  So that there can be no dispute there should be a provision in the Bill that adjustments will be made from year to year according to the cost of living index.  It would create too much doubt to depend on any Minister for Finance, whether he be a Fianna Fáil or a National Coalition Minister.  I hope that on Committee Stage the Minister will insert some clause to take account of inflation. Eight or nine years ago inflation might not have played as big a role as it does today, but there is no guarantee under world conditions what the inflation rate will be next year.  It could be 25 per cent for all we know. If you taxed capital gains on that rate of inflation, with the cost of living running proportionately high, the result would be false, and the £13 million or £14 million the Minister is seeking in lieu of death duties would be made up tenfold.  Not alone that, but it would undermine confidence and have a detrimental effect on the economy whose expansion we are trying to encourage.</P>
    <P>I am wondering how the Revenue Commissioners operate the valuation provisions.  The Minister has provided in the Bill that 6th April, 1974, will be the operative date for the value of property.  I can see injustices arising. <Col N="1178" /> A man may have a business valued at only £40,000 in 1973, and he may have spent £30,000 building it up during 1973.  At the start of 1974 its value will be £70,000.  The Revenue Commissioners, in order to calculate the assets and assess the value, will require balance sheets and business accounts, but that business will not have developed its full potential until 1974-75.  Some concession should be given here, because if that man had invested that £40,000 in a business in 1971, its full potential would be seen in 1973.</P>
    <P>The person who invested £30,000 would be subject to capital gains tax on the results of that investment, which could be as much as £70,000. Some type of concession should be given to a man who invests that kind of capital prior to the introduction of this Bill.  Otherwise he will be unfairly hit because, had he deferred this investment until 1974, he could claim against the valuation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will have another look at this in relation to those cases in which it can be proven conclusively that the money was invested in expanding the business.  A great deal of capital is ploughed back into business.  People might sell shares and invest the proceeds in business. They might have other means.  What proof will the Minister want that the £20,000, or whatever it is, did not come from the business?  What proof will he want that a man invested £30,000 after 1974 in expanding his business?  Will receipts from builders and people like that suffice?  Will it have to be shown in his tax accounts? People who have money left to them very often plough that money into a business.  I hope the Minister will make some provision for those who expand their businesses when it comes to revaluation some years later.</P>
    <P>There are provisions governing the disposal of property.  This is akin to the provisions which encourage farmers to dispose of their farms when they can no longer run the farms themselves.  It is a good idea but here again there will be borderline cases.  There may be people who through ill-health will be forced at 45 years of age or 50 years to sell <Col N="1179" /> their properties.  A father with four or five children might find himself unable through ill-health to carry on and might be forced to dispose of his business; he will be subject to capital gains tax.  There should be special provision made for people like him. Again, a widow might not be able to carry on her late husband's business and be forced to dispose of the business. She might have six or eight children.  If she disposes of the business and she is caught in this particular net, as she will be as the Bill stands at the moment, she will be subject to capital gains tax.  I know it is difficult to cover every case, but there are certain categories which should not be penalised.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision governing transfer of a business to a family after the stipulated ten years' possession, I should like to know what the situation will be in the case of a man who wants to transfer half or three-quarters of his property to a son after five years' possession?  Will he be subject to capital gains tax? This is the sort of situation that could arise.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has clarified the position in regard to the transfer of property to a niece or a nephew. Very often a childless couple rear a niece or a nephew.  Had this provision not been brought in we intended to table an amendment along these lines.</P>
    <P>Compulsory acquisition was touched on here this evening.  This is something that will inevitably arise in the course of time.  The Bill makes no provision in relation to the man who is forced to sell his property to the local authority. He may have spent 20 or 30 years on the property and it is now being acquired for road widening or development.  By and large, the majority of this property is acquired from people who have no choice in the matter of selling to the local authority. This will be subject to capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I took a different interpretation from that section.  I will take the Minister's word for it.  Otherwise it would be completely unfair.  People are forced to sell their property against their will and it may not always be possible for them to re-invest their money after compulsory acquisition. The situation is different when a person sells his property willingly.  He probably has some investment in mind. Quite often he buys another property before he sells his property.  When property is taken over compulsorily, very often people do not go back into business. A considerable length of time will have to be allowed to people like that to re-invest their money.  An elderly couple probably would not have the initiative and the drive to go back into business again.  They could have a son or a daughter who was not in the business at the time and if it were not compulsorily acquired they could will it to the son or the daughter.  In effect, they are being subjected to a tax to which they would not normally be subjected.  In certain cases of compulsory acquisition leniency should be shown to people who are not in a position to re-invest the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is very much a Committee Stage Bill, a technical Bill.  It contains certain anomalies which I hope the Minister will take into consideration on Committee Stage.  He will certainly have to consider the question of the inflation clauses and give an undertaking <Col N="1181" /> to the people generally that capital gains will not absorb the entire assets after 20 or 30 years which it will if it is left in its present form.</P>
    <P>The rate of 26 per cent should be looked at.  I am not speaking from a political point of view but from a businessman's point of view.  If a man spends 20 or 30 years of his life building up a business, expanding it and paying his taxes to the State, he should not be classified in the same category as a speculator who makes £200,000 or £20,000 of easy money. The suggestions we put forward would meet that type of situation.  The Bill would be far more welcome if it were framed in that fashion.  We are not particularly concerned about the number of years, or how the Minister decreases the percentage charge, once he applies the principle that if a man has worked in a business for 15 or 20 years he should be exempt from capital gains tax.  Otherwise we will be putting a penal tax on him.</P>
    <P>We always seem to model ourselves on the British system.  By and large, there is very little difference between this Bill and the British legislation on capital gains.  When the Minister was framing this Bill he should have looked at the tax systems throughout the EEC countries.  I read somewhere recently that in France and Denmark they built in provision for capital gains and that provision is reviewed every so often.  We are trying to encourage capital into the country.  We are not a rich capital country like the industrial countries of Western Europe, countries with a history of development of their industrial arm. Germany has the wealth of the Ruhr. We cannot classify ourselves as a rich country like that.  Our aim must always be, combined with a fair type of taxation, to encourage capital into the country, to encourage businessmen to come here and bring their expertise. To generate more employment we must design our taxation along these lines and forget about taxation systems as they exist in other countries.  We must form our own opinion as to what is best for this country.  We should be politically mature enough to be able to do that.</P>
    <P>We welcome a Bill on capital taxation. <Col N="1182" /> I have always held the view that a person who makes easy money without contributing anything to the State should be taxed at a very high level. We mentioned 50 per cent.  The man who spent his lifetime contributing to the State should get the benefit of the doubt.  By all means get the money from the speculator.  Capital taxation should be channelled into a capital budget to expand the economy.  I know that when the Minister puts his hands on this type of taxation it will automatically find a home in his current budget.  This White Paper will not distribute any of the wealth of the country. That is not distributing money. That is not the way to divide the wealth of the country.</P>
    <P>If you want to distribute wealth take £20,000 from a company and give it to the workers.  That is what I call the distribution of wealth.  If such a scheme could be applied it would generate a good healthy economy.  We know the amount of money wasted in current budgets and that is non-productive. Today we are going into another deficit of £125 million.  That is non-productive.  Let us hope that if this capital taxation is to work it will work in a practical manner for the benefit of all our people.  Let it work to create new jobs, alleviate unemployment. By doing that more wealth will automatically be made available for social welfare benefits to give to the old age pensioners and the disabled. These are the people for whom we should really design our social welfare benefits.  Unemployment benefit is only a short term benefit for which the social welfare scheme should never be designed.</P>
    <P>Our attitude should be to generate wealth and employment and give people a good standard of living, and that is what I hope will be achieved. I do not see that capital taxation will do a great deal in that respect, but we must keep these objectives in mind. Generally, we must keep in mind that any type of taxation introduced will not inhibit our economic expansion and will in fact encourage economic expansion and it must be designed on those lines.  Otherwise, the country will get into a worse situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> I hope that the Minister, on the Committee Stage, will be generous in dealing with the suggestions we made. I think if he canvassed his own backbenchers' opinions they would agree that the built-in clause for inflation is a practical one, one that would be expected in the raging inflation we are experiencing.  The other point is that we think 26 per cent across the board is wrong.  Let us adjust the short-term speculation rate upward to 50 per cent; let us bring down the genuine man who, as has already been mentioned, has contributed something to the State to 1, 4, 5 or 3 per cent.  I do not care what percentage the Minister has in mind provided we change the principle and that the short-term speculator is not taxed at the same level as the man trying to expand his business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a somewhat similar business background to that of the previous Deputy I feel I should make some remarks on the Second Stage of this Bill.  Like the vast majority of people, I detest taxation and I do not particularly like capital gains taxation or wealth taxes, but I welcome this Bill for a simple reason that has been overlooked in much of the debate about tax since the present Government came into office.  The Government had a commitment to reform the tax structure and there was a particular commitment by the National Coalition Government in the abolition of death duties.  In the welter of publicity&mdash; there was some valid criticism but there was more that was much less valid and much more malicious&mdash;there has been a complete lack of objectivity in the debate in the taxation arena which is an area where it is desirable and possible to be precise and to quantify to a much greater degree than in many other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about reform of the tax structure and getting rid of death duties, let us revert to the welter of debate three, four or five years ago especially among the interests we are talking about, the business <Col N="1184" /> community and the farming community in an era of rapid appreciation of assets in our farm land, about the supposed appalling injustice of death duty taxation.  It seems obvious to me that the Minister in addressing himself to the problem, if he is serious about getting rid of death duties&mdash;which he is and which he guaranteed many months ago would happen on the 5th of April this year and is in fact going to happen&mdash;it is his obligation as custodian of the purse to seek the areas in which the State would get the funds to allow for the abolition of death duties.  To that effect, the Government introduced the White Paper on Capital Taxation about which there was a great deal of debate.  That was a very healthy exercise because it forced people to crystallise their views on taxation and think fairly fundamentally about these issues we are discussing, such as capital gains taxation. The response I had from interested parties when that paper was produced was a broad acceptance of a capital gains tax proposal provided it was a reasonable one and infinitely more criticism from many of the same people of the wealth tax proposal.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that capital gains taxation is inevitable.  Statistics shown to us of other European countries indicate it is happening in the vast majority of those countries and it is interesting that wealth tax, introduced somewhat more controversially, applies in about half those countries. I believe the arguments in favour of introducing this type of taxation to be indisputable.  Let us reflect on what death duties meant.  They were a most penal and inequitable form of taxation, completely loaded towards odd circumstances and chance as to whether an individual lived or died in a certain number of years or had the good fortune and circumstances to be able to pass on his assets.  The result was that many families, people holding very substantial assets in the country, had no liability whatever in the area of death duty taxation.  The inequality came into it.  It was like playing Russian roulette.  There was a small proportion of families in this category who happened to pull the <Col N="1185" /> wrong trigger and as a result were salted to a degree that in many cases it meant the breaking up of families, disposal of assets such as business property or farm land, division of estates. It was completely unjust and penal. We must remember this and stop talking about the present Government being anti-this, or anti-commerce or against progress or socialist to the degree that we are going to fleece the business community.  This is not true; we are merely improving the equity of the tax system by this measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction contained in the more recent proposals for the rate of taxation in the capital gains area from 35 per cent to 26 per cent. I welcome the exemption of private residences from taxation and I also welcome the clause welcomed by Deputy Fitzpatrick regarding nephews and nieces.  This was a sensitive area in regard to which there was a good deal of criticism in respect of the original proposals.  Nephews and nieces are obviously part of the broader family and of the family link. I think the Minister in his speech referred to nephews and nieces in deserving cases.  I believe this needs to be expanded.  There is need for a liberal and broad approach, looking on nephews and nieces as part of the family structure, which is strong and close and tight-knit in this country. The Minister should consider allowing such provision.</P>
    <P>I welcome also sections 26 and 27, which relate to the disposal of farms and businesses by persons aged 55 years and over.  It will encourage an early transfer of business to young people, something that is desirable. I am aware that at a later stage we will be debating this Bill section by section and I hope that then the Minister will expand his remarks about inflation because he spoke of adjustments to the thresholds to cater for inflation.  In my view this is an inherent weakness at present in any proposals in the taxation area.  We are living in this age of rampant inflation which must be taken account of.  If somebody has an asset which in 1970 was valued at £10,000 and which in <Col N="1186" /> 1975 has a value of £15,000 it does not by any stretch of the imagination mean that the profit of the difference between the value and the sale of the asset has been made.  Traditional attitudes to this question of allowing for inflation and the validity of low profits as profits are being questioned and there is likely to be a change in traditional practice there.  The Minister, on Committee Stage, should have regard to this issue and be lenient. Since my election to this House I have always found the Minister for Finance to be a good listener.</P>

When we are in Committee some areas will have to be tackled. <Col N="1187" /> A capital gains tax is a measure of taxation which, in broad terms is acceptable and has to be acceptable. I referred in some detail to the abolition of death duties, a penal, vicious and inequitable form of taxation and about which there was an outcry some years ago.  The key to this debate, and to the debate subsequent to the issue of the White Paper on Capital Taxation, is the objectives of the Government in so far as taxation and the amount of taxation they expect to get from these measures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that we should have regard to general objectives in discussing the wealth tax and the capital gains tax issue for the reason that after the production of the White Paper the most valid criticism of it was the computation of the tax accruing to the State as the result of the measures then suggested.  From some fairly authentic sources it seemed that the taxation accruing to the State was greatly in excess of that lost by the State in the death duty area.  I am glad that in the subsequent speech made by the Minister in which we had a significant dilution of the wealth tax proposals&mdash;the reduction of the rate by half and the doubling of the threshold.  This reduced very effectively and to an acceptable level the type of tax that might be paid which might be the equivalent of an insurance policy to guard against the death duty issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are talking about equity of the tax system we are suggesting that the Government are seeking from these new areas of taxation, capital gains and wealth tax, an approximate amount to that which came in from the area of death duties.  If we are attempting to pitch it at somewhere near this level <Col N="1188" /> we are having what I would call equity and a reasonable situation.  It would be an entirely more just situation than that which had been obtaining until these issues were introduced and which will, after 5th April, no longer exist. This is my view on equity and it is an approach which might be adopted on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy with a commercial background I should like to give the lie to the snide comments we get from certain quarters that this Government in their taxation, fiscal and industrial policy are in any sense the world of commerce, the world of business or industry.  We have had too much of this.</P>

      <P>That is a reflection on the criticism being offered by Deputy Fitzgerald.  Statistics show that we are having the highest level of industrial development and investment. We have had the highest rate ever of industrial exports, largely produced by companies controlled by foreign interests.  If what the Deputy is saying is true it means that many non-nationals have a lot more confidence in this country than some of our national critics in the commercial area.  That is a sad reflection on those critics in the area of commerce where they can be precise.  When they come to tackle this Government they make these broad snide criticisms without applying the same standards they would in the commercial world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill relates to capital taxation and is proposed, we believe, as one of three measures which would create a new form of capital taxation.  We are in the very unsatisfactory position today of discussing one of those measures, and one only, without any knowledge whatever, other than the very broad knowledge we gleaned from the White Paper that was amended subsequently, of what will be the proposals or provisions in relation to the remainder of capital taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the new system of capital taxation is to be under three headings, in my view, it is unrealistic to try to discuss one-third of it without knowing what will be the other two-thirds. Those three Bills should have been introduced and circulated more or less simultaneously, so that no one of them would have to be taken while we were in the dark about the provisions of the other two.  There is no doubt that inevitably there must be some element <Col N="1190" /> of overlapping in these matters.  We have it in this Bill in the introduction of the gift concept as a disposal for the purposes of chargeability to capital gains tax.  We were told that the gift tax, or the capital acquisitions tax, was a separate matter altogether and would be dealt with separately in a Bill of its own.  Here we have it brought into the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  It is very difficult to take a global view of the Government's proposals for capital taxation on a Bill which deals approximately with one-third of the topic while we are unaware of the provisions in relation to the other two-thirds.</P>
    <P>We have been told a number of times that death duties are to be abolished on 1st April next.  I think we have been told that for the past year or thereabouts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In spite of the fact that we have been told it for one year, we are now getting very close to the 1st April, 1975, and we have only one of three Bills that apparently are necessary to provide a substitute form of capital taxation.  If death duties are to be abolished on 1st April&mdash;and I think the &ldquo;if&rdquo; should be printed in capitals&mdash;we would have to have these other Bills immediately, because if they are to be anything like this one they will not get through this House by 1st April unless what happened in this House, unfortunately, last summer happened again; in other words that they would be guillotined through without any discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is very complicated.  We have been talking about it today in general terms only.  Its real discussion will take place on Committee Stage. The Bill runs into 78 fairly large, closely printed pages.  The Schedules alone run into something over 30 pages.  Has the Minister read the Schedules?  Does he understand the technicalities of them?  I find the Bill, to say the least, very difficult to follow.  To debate that Bill properly on Committee Stage would require approximately ten full sitting days. I cannot see it being done properly <Col N="1191" /> in less than that.  But, after we have been about two days at it I can foresee a situation where the Government Whip will be coming in here kicking up rows about it.  We shall have progressed only to about section 10 or section 12 when the guillotine will be introduced, as it was on a most complicated Finance Bill last year, the bulk of which went through without any discussion at all.  It is not good enough that these Bills are produced very late in the day, very close to a deadline that has been set.  This Bill, unless it gets at least ten full sitting days on Committee Stage, will not be discussed properly and will not be understood by even a fraction of the Members of this House.  I should like to put the Government on notice straightaway that we will require at least ten full sitting days on the Committee Stage of this Bill and another day or so on the Report and Final Stages.</P>
    <P>I imagine that the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill, if they are to be gone ahead with, will be as complicated.  If they are, they will require the same sort of time. I do not know how many sitting days are left between now and 1st April but there cannot be that many and there is a great deal of other business that has to be dealt with in this House also.  We are going to have a situation in which our whole capital taxation structure will be radically changed, not by discussion in this Parliament but by the repeated use of the device so beloved of the Government, the guillotine, and which they used to put through the last two Finance Bills.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that there was a delay of over three months in producing the Finance Bill last year, with the result that there was virtually no time in which to discuss it.  We ran into the end of July and the Government guillotined it through.  These Bills are very important.  They are about the most important Bills that go through in any parliamentary year. They receive a fraction only of the attention to which they are entitled. Instead, the House has to spend long, tiresome, useless days discussing Estimates that are of limited value only, <Col N="1192" /> when these Bills and similar business will not be ordered.</P>
    <P>Our position with regard to taxation of capital gain is that, in principle, we see nothing wrong with it, provided it is clearly recognised there are numerous different types of capital gain, some of them much more worthy of taxation than others.  But unfortunately, this Bill does not recognise that fact at all.  It imposes one single, blanket tax on all forms of capital gain.  It was demonstrated this evening by Deputy Fitzpatrick and earlier by Deputy Colley and others who spoke from this side of the House, that it was most unsatisfactory, unjust and inequitable that all forms of capital gain should be taxed in precisely the same way.  Deputy Colley, when he spoke this afternoon, set out an alternative, sliding scale of tax which we feel is a fair method and which I think some of the Government backbenchers who have spoken agreed was a fairer method of taxing capital gains than what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to define speculation in the sort of way that would be appropriate to a Finance Bill or a Bill such as this.  But, from a point of view of unworthiness of profit, if I may put it that way, the shorter the period for which an asset is held and whose disposal results in a gain, then the greater the degree of unworthiness there is attached to that gain and the greater the justification for a substantial higher rate of tax on such a gain.  Deputy Colley set out this afternoon a perfectly simple, sliding scale: that the top rate of capital gains tax should be 50 per cent; that it should apply to gains made within a year of acquisition of the asset and that the scale should decrease by 4½ per cent per annum until it disappeared altogether at 15 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave examples here this evening which were perfectly valid.  I do not need to give others. Deputy Fitzpatrick gave the example of a man who had built up a business, perhaps through the greater part of his lifetime, and who disposed of it. He may be assessed for a huge capital gain because, technically, there may be a huge capital gain there.  But he is <Col N="1193" /> assessed at exactly the same rate of tax as a man who bought mining shares in some Canandian or Australian mine, or perhaps hopefully in an Irish mine if the present situation was clarified, and who made perhaps £1 million in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>We had an example recently in Ireland of precisely that situation.  A million pounds made in that way should attract a much higher rate of tax than the capital gain of a businessman who has spent his entire life building up the assets of his company and who, as has happened very often, has not drawn from that company the kind of salary and benefits that he would be entitled to draw throughout his working life but who saw the company as something he was building up to the stage where he could sell it when he wished to retire when the benefits he did not draw during his working life would accrue to him and would ensure that he and his wife could live in reasonable comfort in their retirement. The ground has been taken from under the feet of such a person by these provisions.  It is not that it is wrong to impose some form of capital taxation on him but it is very wrong to charge him exactly the same rate of tax and the same amount of tax as would be the case in respect of a similar gain made by a complete speculator who never contributed any capital or effort to anything but who made a similar amount of money on the stock exchange in, perhaps, one to three months.  That situation is wrong in principle.  It is wrong in social justice and the Government should not seek to support it now that it has been pointed out clearly by several speakers, including a backbencher from the Government side.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this Bill which disturbs me and to which I referred earlier is the fact that a gift has now been brought into the provisions.  This was not envisaged in the White Paper of 1974 and properly not envisaged because if and when the Bill to provide for a gifts acquisition tax is brought before the House and passed people will have to pay on the double.  Presumably, they would have to pay the gift acquisition tax and the donee of <Col N="1194" /> the gift must pay capital gains tax on the acquisition of the gift.  This brings me to the problem to which I drew attention at the outset, that is, that it is impossible to discuss the merits of this aspect of the Bill without knowing what are to be the provisions of the capital acquisitions tax Bill.  It may be that some provision will be made for the avoidance of double taxation as between the two forms of tax but we do not know that.  Presumably, and especially if the gift were to a near relative, the rate of capital acquisition tax would be considerably less than the 26 per cent rate which the gain element would attract by reason of the provision here.</P>
    <P>However, apart from drawing attention to that point I cannot develop it since I do not know what are the provisions in the other Bill.  Therefore, we should not be asked to debate one-third of this package in a vacuum.  So far as gifts are concerned it seems strange that acquisition by way of gift is regarded as a disposal for the purpose of capital gains tax but that acquisition by way of death is not so regarded.</P>
    <P>There has been a tradition in our more recent fiscal legislation that older people be encouraged to give up their property at an earlier age to their children or closest relatives, as the case may be.  There are many provisions in our Finance Acts down through the years attempting to encourage that very desirable social necessity because, unfortunately, we have a tradition, particularly in rural areas, of people tending to retain their property almost to the grim death.  This is because some people believe that to get rid of their assets would put them in a weak position and that they might have to go into a county home or some such place. The result is that very often a productive asset such as a farm or cash that could be used for investment is retained by people in an unproductive way for a long period when it could have been given to a much younger person and used productively not only for that person's benefit but for the overall national benefit.</P>
    <P>There is in this Bill the very antithesis of what has been the tradition <Col N="1195" /> in our recent fiscal legislation.  There is here an encouragement to people to hold on to property in order to avoid capital gains tax because the passing of the property, as a result of death, will not give rise to a claim for tax whereas the passing of the property by way of gift will be liable for tax. The social consequences of this thinking are bad and run counter to what various Governments down through the years have been aiming at.</P>
    <P>One popular form of gift, although it has always been regarded in law not as a gift as such but as a valuable consideration, was the marriage settlement. This had the double advantage, first, that when property was handed over by way of a gift in consideration of a marriage, it did not bear any stamp duty and, secondly, the property became and remained free of liability for death duties.  In recent years the amount which could be handed over tax-free was limited but the provision was a useful encouragement to people to hand over their property.  I cannot find in the Bill any provision to take account of this long established right, almost, that people have enjoyed in regard to marriage settlements and gifts made in consideration of marriage.  However, that is not to say the provision is not here as the Bill is a long and complicated one.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals only with the gain element in gifts and the tax is not on the gift.  However, with inflation at the rate it has been since this Government took office, the likelihood is that in a few years' time the gain element in any gift, as against 6th April, 1974, will be the very large proportion of the value of the gift.  That brings me to the question that has been referred to by Deputies Colley, Fitzpatrick and others, that is, that this Bill fails totally to take any account of the rampant inflation being experienced by us.  If, say, in 1970 my house was valued at £10,000 but in 1980 it was valued at £20,000, the probability is that the house would be worth less in 1980 than it was worth in 1970 because £10,000 in 1970 would have had greater real value than £20,000 <Col N="1196" /> would have in 1980.  Under this Bill I would be regarded as having had a capital gain as from the 1974 value to the 1980 value which might, perhaps, be £6,000.  In the example I have given&mdash;I should not have used the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; but an &ldquo;office&rdquo;, farm or some other asset&mdash;I would have been expected to pay 26 per cent on that £6,000 even though I would not have been better off in real terms but probably worse off.  That, to my mind, is another aspect of the unjust and inadequate approach of this Bill. Again I emphasise that I do not see anything wrong in the principle of taxing a capital gain.  These factors about which I have been speaking must be taken into account.  This Bill fails to do that.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to exempt from capital gains tax all Government, local authority and State board securities. This will, of course, be a considerable encouragement to investors. Large sums of money may be invested, which might not otherwise have been invested.  This is good.  At this time industry is very heavily under-capitalised.  If all Government and public securities are to be exempt from this tax, the Minister should exempt if not all Irish equities or ordinary shares, at least any new money raised from now on on the public market in Ireland for Irish companies to be expended here on productive matters and in a productive way.</P>
    <P>The amount of money raised on the Irish stock exchange for industrial or commercial purposes is nil.  In today's paper there is a prospectus by a firm inviting the public to buy shares.  This is the first prospectus to appear from an industrial or commercial company on the stock exchange for the past 15 months.  The only other prospectuses which have appeared during that time have been Government securities. Nobody has attempted to raise money on the stock exchange because he knows he would not get it.  People also know that they could not get anyone to underwrite their efforts to raise money.  Today's prospectus is not a very good example because it is not really a commercial transaction but an <Col N="1197" /> appeal aimed mainly at horse breeders to take a stake in this company for sentimental rather than financial reasons.  Financially it is not very attractive.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were to accept my suggestion that attempts to raise new money by Irish industrial or commercial firms for productive investment here were to be exempt also from this tax, he would not lose very much because these securities will not make rapid capital gains.  Hopefully over a longish period when the investment begins to come to fruition, it may be ten or 15 years, they will show some capital appreciation.  In the short term the Minister will not be at any loss.  He might do a great deal to encourage money which is lying about at the moment in unproductive places to be put to valuable use.  The creation of employment must surely be the principal objective of any Irish Government.  At present there are more than 100,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>Very strangely neither here, in the budget nor elsewhere have we any estimate from the Minister of how much this tax will bring in.  Members will recall that in any budget speech the various suggested taxation changes have always noted the amount they will cost the taxpayer or the Exchequer, the amount they will save or raise, as the case may be.  Here we have a system of taxation in which the Minister has refused, over the past year, to give any estimate of what it is likely to raise.  He said near the end of his speech&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I can say that the net yield in the current year is not likely to be significant.</P>
    <P>I agree with him.  It is likely to be very insignificant.  Apart from the last week on the stock exchange, I doubt if there were 50 people who had a capital gain since 6th April last when everything was going down.  It may be that certain people got in and out in the past week on certain Irish shares which happily did very well.  Some of them could have made up to 80 per cent of their money in a week.  If they did that, it is regrettable that they will be charged only 26 per cent while the <Col N="1198" /> man who slaved all his life will be charged exactly the same rate on his capital gain.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to talk about this tax or the general capital taxation proposals of the Government broadly, unless one knows what they will bring in. Then one can compare them with death duties which last year yielded over £16 million, a very small amount of money out of the total budget.  That money was raised with very little difficulty on the part of the Revenue Commissioners because it is the easiest tax to collect. It causes hardship in a very limited number of cases.  It is usually only by the sudden deaths of young men that hardship is caused.  Most older people if they have a significant amount of property have already passed on their property.  This is socially a very desirable thing to do.  We are led to believe, although I find it hard to do so, that death duties will be abolished on 1st April.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to confirm that these three Bills will go through the Oireachtas with proper discussion and not with the guillotine as we had last year.  It is very important to tell us exactly when they will be published.  We are now coming to the end of January.  Easter Sunday comes before the end of March so we have less than two months before the end of this session.  I wonder will all this complicated and novel legislation be passed by this House and, if it is, will it be passed by guillotine? It is not good enough that these new forms of taxation should be brought in at the last minute and pushed through.  The Minister would be better advised to suspend the operation of these new forms of tax for another six or 12 months, and have those Bills properly examined because obviously they are very complicated.  Many anomalies, difficulties and injustices will arise out of them and we need a lot of time to go through their provisions very precisely.  This Bill runs to 78 pages and that is only one-third of what we are told to expect. I do not know whether the other Bills will be more or less complicated or lengthy but I suppose they will be approximately the same.  It is not something that Deputy Colley in particular, <Col N="1199" /> as our spokesman on Finance, looks forward to, I am sure, over the next few months.  He will have to endeavour to deal with all those Bills in great detail.</P>
    <P>Some very useful suggestions have been made from this side of the House today.  They will, if accepted by the Minister, and Deputy Staunton told us what a good listener he is, improve this Bill and make the system of a capital gains tax a much fairer one than what is proposed under this Bill. The Bill will meet with far greater public acceptance than if it went through unamended.  The degree of social justice which will be achieved by the Bill will be very significantly higher if the suggestions made by Deputy Colley and others on this side are accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot believe the Minister is serious in introducing this Bill or, if he is serious, I fear he is again unware of what he has in his hand.  It occurs to me that the Minister does not understand the Bill he has presented to the House.  This has been evident in much of the business which has been presented to this House by him on previous occasions.  The net result of this is a lack of confidence in this country on the part of outside investors.  I hope the Minister will take a hard look at this Bill and try to appreciate that the contributions made by Fianna Fáil speakers today were not made for the purpose of looking for political advantage but were made in the interests of the future development of this country in the commercial sphere.  Fianna Fáil have been accused constantly of being against capital tax. This is not so and any impartial observer who reads the contributions made today will realise that the contributions from this side of the House have been very fair.  For a long time there has been an outcry against the speculator, the man who comes in and makes a quick &ldquo;kill&rdquo;, either on the stock exchange, through land speculation or in some other way.  I believe this criticism is justified.  I believe that a person who, without any investment of his own capital and without any work but because of a tip-off or some other information makes himself <Col N="1200" /> £100,000, £200,000, £500,000 or £1 million, should not be allowed to get away with that kind of gain and it is not an injustice to ask such a person to hand over at least half of that gain to the Exchequer.  I cannot see any reason for the Minister to disagree with that and I hope he will assure the House that this is an approach which he is ready to consider.  There are members of his own party who are engaged in commerce in this city and it would appear to me that their advice has not been sought in relation to the preparation of this Bill.  It was normal practice when Fianna Fáil were in Government for any Bill to be fully discussed at party meetings before it was presented in the Dáil.  I wonder was this Bill discussed with the members of the Minister's party.  There must be many members of his party who are very dissatisfied with it as it stands. The point made by Deputy O'Malley in relation to a business that was, say, purchased for £10,000 and after a period of 10 years, because of inflation, is now valued at £20,000 and sold for that amount was a good one.  He said that such a person would have to pay as much as £6,000 in tax even though the purchasing power of the £20,000 would not be as great as that of the £10,000.  This is a cogent argument This Bill is full of anomalies.  This debate will open up a discussion among the public.  The Minister is frequently quoted as saying that he welcomes suggestions from all sections of society and that the public should make submissions. Time must be given for people, on the basis of the debate that has taken place today, to submit their views because their attention will have been drawn to anomalies in the Bill.  I wonder to what extent the Minister has already consulted outside bodies about this.  I find it difficult to believe he has done so.  Where a property is compulsorily acquired by the State or by a local council the owner will have to pay capital gains tax on what he gets from the sale.  He is forced to sell against his will and then has to pay a portion of what he gets to the Exchequer.  This is something that will have to be looked at closely on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the cries in the country <Col N="1201" /> recently has been that it is a crime to succeed.  We must continue to encourage people to invest, we must encourage them to succeed in business. The people we want to catch in a Bill like this are those who succeed in business without trying&mdash;if I might use that phrase.  Those who are interested in building up their business, thereby creating employment, must be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Our country must be seen as a land of opportunity.  Formerly if a person was a success here he was hated but a failure was loved.  In America the reverse obtained: if a person was a success he was loved but the failure was hated.  The reason for the attitude in Ireland where there was jealousy with regard to a person's success was that for a long time opportunity was limited to a few people.  However, since the early 'sixties opportunities have opened up for more people and we are getting to the stage that we laud success.</P>
    <P>We must encourage people to come here and establish businesses.  Many companies have come since the industrialisation programme and they did so in order to make a profit.  If they are unable to make a profit they leave; they are not here because of a sentimental attachment to the Irish people.  They came because they were interested in setting up businesses to make a profit.  I am thinking of such industries as the cosmetic industry that supplies the Irish market.  I am not referring to the companies that export only and who do not pay tax on their exports.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to have another look at the Bill and to accept the suggestions made by this party in the constructive spirit in which they were meant.  We should not take the criticism of this Bill in a personal way but consider it in the interest of our future development.  It is important to stress that the suggestions for the alterations made by our party were not made because of political opportunism. They were made in the interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I would stress again the justice of ensuring that the person who makes <Col N="1202" /> a capital gain in a short period, for instance, in one year, pays much more in capital gains tax than the man who has worked hard during the years to build up a business.  I credit the Minister with sufficient feeling and instinct to recognise that there is a certain justice in this argument and I hope he will confirm this in his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil must be in favour of the Bill because so little has been said against it.  A capital gains tax should have been introduced long ago and Fianna Fáil should bow their heads in shame that they did not do so 20 years ago.  It was badly needed, particularly with regard to land speculation. They cannot complain too much at this stage.</P>
      <P>I am not referring to the man who makes £1 million quick profit on the purchase or sale of land but when taxation is collected from other sources we must ask how much will be used for social benefits?  How much will be eaten up by State bodies?  CIE have lost £14 million.  How much will be used by civil servants or nameless people who spend half of the money in order to collect the total amount?</P>
      <P>A tremendous amount can be said for the taxing of shares.  Hitherto there was an unequal position here because the worker who could not afford to buy shares had little chance to make any money free of tax.  On the other hand, the man buying and selling shares did not pay any tax.  With regard to capital gains generally the Minister is correct in the figures he mentioned. Fianna Fáil referred to a starting figure of 50 per cent, reducing by 4½ per cent per year so that in 11 years there would be nothing.  In order to attract money here we must have a lower rate of capital gains tax than in England or elsewhere. The Minister was correct to take advice from the various business people, the FUE and the chambers of commerce whom he met.  He was correct to reduce the tax figure to 26 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Colley that the rate should be reduced by 4½ per cent every year so that it would be <Col N="1203" /> nil in 11 years' time.  Neither do I agree with Fianna Fáil who stated that compulsory acquisition should not be taxed. If that were done people would not sell land but they would wait until a CPO was put on their land.  The corporation would not be able to build houses because land would not be available.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that when a person buys a premises and keeps the business going for 20, 30 or 40 years he should not be liable for capital gains tax.  I realise that the Minister had said he will give an allowance each year to cover inflation.  Let us consider the 11 years suggested by Fianna Fáil and take as an example a premises such as one of Mooney's publichouses that might be worth £200,000.  Inflation is going up at the rate of 20 per cent but it is a general opinion in western Europe that it may be reduced to 10 per cent or 8 per cent.  Twenty per cent of £200,000 is £40,000 and at 11 years it is £440,000 by which the premises will have increased in value.  That means the Government can take 26 per cent when the premises are sold.  I could see the point if the premises were sold as a development property.  If that property were sold for development as an office block, flats or something else, I could understand the 26 per cent being added but that is a superfluous profit.  It is not the normal inflation on that business. The way this place should be valued rather than having the £200,000 and the Minister adding so much per annum to it, is on how much it would cost to build it tomorrow morning. The value put on it should be what you could replace that building for. A brick is worth a certain figure today but in 20 or 60 years' time it will be worth something different.</P>
    <P>A person with a property over a certain figure is liable to acquisition tax but is not liable if the property is given to the man's son.  Perhaps in 100 years' time or 200 years' time you would be taking 26 per cent off £2 million or £3 million.  There should be something more definite than just saying 26 per cent and the capital gains <Col N="1204" /> over the value today plus what the Minister adds on.  There should be a better way of doing it.  It should be on the actual cost of replacing it.</P>
    <P>A good businessman has to take risks which people in secure jobs do not have to take although they will not get the same benefits as the businessman who succeeds.  Those business people deserve something more than their basic profits which are normally taxed.  The person whose business runs into trouble and eventually he has to sell, perhaps at a bad time, will pay off his creditors and will end up with very little.  He may make some capital profit on the price he paid for his business and he has to pay something out of it.  It is a different thing if he gets nothing out of it and the property has to go to the liquidator.  This man is forced to sell but by doing so he has got nothing with which to restart. It is very wrong to squeeze this man at both ends.  We want those people more than those who take secure jobs and who sit down and let somebody else do the worrying.</P>
    <P>After a certain number of years there should be no capital gains tax. I do not mind what the number of years is.  The Minister mentions that there is £150,000 allowance.  Is that to each child or to one person in the family?  Is this the same as the gift tax?  I prefer gift tax or acquisition tax to death duties.  A person with over £150,000 who has one child may leave up to £300,000.  Up to 55 per cent acquisition tax will have to be paid on that.  On top of that 26 per cent capital gains tax will have to be paid on the difference between the present value and the value of the property when he dies.</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be getting back to the position the Minister wanted to get away from, the hardship caused by death duties.  There should be a limit here.  I am very much against death duties.  When a man dies, his widow has to pay death duties on top of her grief and she has to rear her children.  Very often she has to sell the property.  The widow left with a debt hanging over her usually had to get the confidence of the bank manager to enable her to pay it off.  This <Col N="1205" /> was a very bad method of taxation. Deputy O'Malley said death duties never amounted to a lot when one considered the total budget.</P>
    <P>The Government will get more from the other tax.  In the case of a farmer, where a big debt was involved, it meant dividing up the farm.  I know that some tax has to be collected and I am generally in agreement with this Bill which will enable the Minister to collect this tax.  Very often one found that when a man made a big profit on a property deal he did not pay death duties because he had his money invested in some company and got away with it.  As the Minister said, most business people are in the main agreeable to capital gains tax. You have to pay it even after 50 years and I am not sure if that is right.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years many people made large profits.  Builders, property dealers and speculators made a lot of money.  In the share business particularly we had people backing an individual whose shares would come down and the return would be 1 per cent.  If the profit of the company went up the dividend on the shares also went up.  Some of those people made a capital profit which was free of tax.  They did not pay anything on their income because there was practically no profit.  People who had knowledge about a takeover bought up the property and made a lot of money.  We should get after this.  We also had professional people who got information, to which the ordinary person did not have access, in a golf club or some place else, and bought shares in a particular company and made a capital profit.  If an ordinary person knew about this deal he bought the wrong shares, usually those which gave a big return but in the long run were worth nothing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick gave a good example.  I want to speak of a business which I know quite well, a publichouse. If a person sells his premises as the same business as he bought it, it may appreciate because of the cost of rebuilding. Maybe the site has gone up in value because of costs generally.  That house may have been worth £20,000 <Col N="1206" /> 20 years ago but it is worth £200,000 because all values and wages have gone up.  Therefore, there should be no tax on that.  However, if that premises were bought for the purpose of building an office block, that is bringing another value into it.  It is the difference between the value of a public house premises and that of a property for other development.  That to me is a capital gain.  I do not think the other is.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned the case of a son taking over a business. If it is over £150,000 he will have to pay £50,000 tax.  If a man is educated and becomes a doctor or a solicitor, he can earn fees, but there is no capital gain there, except where he invests money.  It is not like years ago when the dud got the farm and the others went off to business.  It is not right to hammer the person who continues in the same business or if he sells out and has to buy another one.  It is a disgrace that, say, a civil servant can earn £7,000 or £8,000 a year and just have to pay income tax, whereas the man may own premises which may be worth something but from which he is getting very little.</P>
    <P>We have seen the situation in England due to price controls.  Very often there is a very low rate of return for a business, 4 or 5 per cent. Businesses have good periods but they also have bad periods.  Because of price control in England liquidity has been taken away even from small retail businesses.  If liquidity is taken away employment is lost.  As I say, where a business is sold out and there is some other development that should be subject to capital gains tax, but where it is a business passed on from father to son the capital gains tax should not operate.</P>
    <P>Take a person who owns a publichouse. That person improves the place and builds it up.  It is worth quite a bit of money, but he has done without this amount of money in his lifetime, whereas he could have been enjoying it.  This, again, is a man who is investing in his own ability.  Eventually this man dies and leaves the business to his son.  If the father gives the property <Col N="1207" /> away in his lifetime acquisition tax has to be paid and also capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that has to be allowed, but it is very hard to explain what that is and to what extent it applies to the premises.  On some premises it could be 50 per cent; on other premises it could be 10 per cent.  It varies very much.  I agree with the Minister in regard to the gift tax and the acquisition tax, and with the allowance of £150,000 it is more equitable, and trust funds and so on cannot avoid it.  Everybody will have to pay it eventually.</P>
      <P>The Minister is providing that a private house with one acre should be free of capital gains tax.  There is difficulty in suggesting a limit, because, if there is a development opportunity, that should be taxed accordingly or there should be some hold on it for a number of years.  A person can have five acres around a house and the five acres can be a liability; or a nuisance.  You cannot build on it and you might need a gardener to keep it.  There are certain houses in Howth where, apart from the piece of ground around the house, the land is all rocks.  Will that person be caught because he has more than one acre? There is also the opposite.  A person might have a private house around Ballsbridge and somebody might pay him £100,000 for it.  If the ground has development potential as well as containing the private house, it is unfair that the person with four acres of rock should be caught while the man down the road with an acre of ground on which two houses could be built is exempt.</P>

It could be four acres of ground in respect of which no building permission can ever be granted.  There could be a house on it or something like that, but it would be no use for development purposes.</P>

      <P>That would mean the tax would be for greater.  On anything over £150,000 per person the donee would pay gift tax but handing over £150,000 in <i>toto</i> he would have to pay capital gains tax.  That would nearly bring it up in line with what the original death duties were.  If the property appreciates in the same way as property has appreciated over the last ten or 12 years we would reach that stage.  It would also mean that it would be wrong to encourage a person to give his money or his property away while he is alive instead of on his death.  That would be particularly so in the case of a farm.  Now in any vocation, whether it be farming or industry, or anything else, it is important to get young people interested while the father is alive instead of putting it on the long finger and it should, therefore, be by acquisition rather than attracting gift tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two things the Deputy may have overlooked. First of all, the capital gains tax would tax only the element of gain in the consideration and the gift tax would tax only that element in excess of £150,000 per donee.  Taking these fractions then, the end figure is very much less than the figure of estate duty which runs at 45 per cent on £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it would depend on the period.  Take the last two decades, or take from 1955 to 1961, say, when the value of property and salaries and wages compared with today was much less than it is now and, if a person were to give away property or money in that period, there would be very little difference.  What would happen would be that the donor would be inclined to put it off until he dies because he would not then have to pay capital gains tax on what he transfers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, I agree in the case of compulsory acquisition because, without that, one would not get any land.  The Minister mentioned trusts and trustees; trustees would be treated <Col N="1210" /> as a continuing body of persons and charged on that basis.  Am I to take it from that, that a trust would be treated as an individual rather than as at present or the person who set up the trust?  Would he not get the same allowance?  In other words, if a parent set up a trust fund before now will he now be in the position that the trust will not be treated as a parent but treated as another person? In that case he would be giving his money away as if he were giving it to an outsider altogether instead of to his family or will the trust be treated from the point of view of provision for his family?  For instance, if I set up a trust and there are three or ten trustees, that trust is treated as another person.  We all know the pattern where a person takes out a huge insurance policy&mdash;probably a one payment policy&mdash;to cover himself for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in the provision with regard to woodlands run on a commercial basis.  There could be abuses.  Timber is, of course, a thing of beauty.  This is a long-term investment and there should be some allowance against gift tax and acquistion tax, if at all possible, in addition to exclusion.</P>
    <P>I know the difficulty in the case of charities.  However, this is a good Bill and many of the provisions in it should have been incorporated into legislation long before this.  However the provision dealing with capital gains tax on the quick sale of a property is too harsh.  This should be treated by way of replacement value because the Minister may lag behind in the actual appreciation, or lack of appreciation, particularly in regard to the site.  However, there are cases in which it is right to have a capital gains tax and I certainly do not agree with all that Opposition speakers so far have suggested.</P>

      <P>It appears that the alternative site for the new school at Easkey, County Sligo, is in the rear portion of the field which was originally proposed as a site for the school.</P>
      <P>I am unable to say at present when a report will be available from the Commissioners of Public Works regarding the suitability of this site but it is hoped that it will be possible to make arrangements to inspect it in the very near future.</P>
