      <P>On the Order of Business, I would refer the Taoiseach to item No. 11 on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement establishing an International Energy Programme.</P>
      <P>That motion appeared on the Order Paper as far back as last November. It was actually introduced for debate on last Wednesday week.  It was represented to us&mdash;it is, in fact, written into the agreement&mdash;that it had to be passed by Dáil Éireann before 1st May.  Does the fact of its not being ordered now indicate that the Government are not prepared to ratify this agreement or is there some change in the terms of the agreement which requires to be passed by adhering Parliaments before 1st May?</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 23:</P>
    <P>In page 22, subsection (2), lines 21 to 23, to delete paragraph (c) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(c)  A gaming machine shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be available for play unless&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied and so certify in writing, that by reason of&mdash;</P>
    <P> (I)  the inaccessibility to the public of the place in which it is stored, or</P>
    <P>(II)  the state in which it is, it cannot be played by the public, and </P>
    <P>(ii)  it remains stored in the place aforesaid or remains in the state aforesaid.&rdquo;. </P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are being discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's amendment, a gaming machine shall be deemed to be available for play in certain circumstances. <Col N="715" /> In explanation last night the Minister stated that a second machine could be substituted if a machine were unplayable. He accepted this apparently as reasonable enough.  Because of the increase in the licence duty on the premises plus the heavy duty of £50 per annum per machine, the Minister ought also to take into consideration some system of rebates on machines out of action for a certain length of time.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the frequency with which these machines can become ineffective. I would ask him to have a look at this and introduce some system of rebates.  The duty of £50 per annum is quite a sizeable levy particularly when coupled with the increase in licence fees.  Will the onus be on the proprietor to prove a machine is not functional?  If there are 75 machines and the licence extends to 50 operable machines, is the onus on the proprietor to prove the others are not functional or will the Revenue Commissioners come along and declare which are functional and which are not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley's amendment which is being discussed in conjunction with the Minister's amendment seeks the deletion of paragraph (c)  in its entirety.  There is no doubt as to the faults we find with the Minister's amendment and the deletion of paragraph (c) would be an important step forward.  The section it is proposing to delete indicated that it was the Minister's intention that a machine, operating or otherwise, was deemed to be available for play and to be liable for duty notwithstanding the fact that it was not fit for play if it was positioned in such a way that it could be played.  The Minister mentioned that the Revenue Commissioners could put a seal on a machine and I presume that would involve the Revenue Commissioners putting tape on the machine indicating that it was out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is welcome in that it does away with the proposed paragraph (c).  There is the difficulty of detail as to the capacity of the amusement caterer to put in a replacement <Col N="716" /> machine when a machine is out of order under the existing licence but I do not think that enters into the matter at this stage.  It is no harm to have spelled out that a machine which is not available to the public and is not seen to be available to the public for playing need not be taxed. I can see a slight problem arising in relation to that portion of the amendment which deals with the condition of the machine and where it is stored. It is obvious that the proprietor of an amusement arcade will be anxious to get a machine back into action as quickly as possible because he makes his money on such a machine.  The problem I see is that when the Revenue Commissioners call they will see that a machine is not operable because a number of component parts are faulty but it would be disastrous if when they returned they claimed that they should be taxed on the basis that it was not left in the &ldquo;aforesaid state&rdquo;.  In addition, in relation to the place where it should be stored, the Revenue Commissioners, being suspicious of a particular caterer, might say the machine has been moved and technically because it was moved it should be taxed.</P>
    <P>It was natural that the Minister should be anxious to replace paragraph (c) but the straightforward amendment of Deputy Colley's should have been accepted without the inclusion of the qualification headings introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (c) in subsection (2) was, as we pointed out on Second Stage, totally unreasonable and unworkable.  It was for that reason I put down amendment No. 24.  The Minister's amendment is designed to delete that subsection and to substitute the words in the amendment.  To that extent I welcome the amendment and I also welcome the fact that the Minister now recognises that paragraph (c) was unreasonable and probably unworkable.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 not moved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> In page 23, line 11, subsection (6), to delete &ldquo;be issued&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;remain in force&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment which is self-explanatory.  It was recommended by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there some particular significance in the period for which a licence remains in force being different from the period for which it is to be issued?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The parliamentary draftsman requested that this be made and he said it was the appropriate language to be used in respect of a licence which is issued in circumstances of this nature.  The licence states the period for which it will remain in force and it will remain in force for that particular period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a major point and I was just interested in the nuance of difference in it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 is in the name of Deputy Colley and amendments Nos. 27, 28 and 29 seem to be cognate.  They may be taken together or separately as the Members wish.  Shall we take these amendments together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 23, line 12, to delete &ldquo;£12.50&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6.25&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My amendments are designed to have the proposed charge to be levied in respect of each gaming machine to which the licence relates.  In many cases the people concerned are not in a big way of business and are to a great extent depending on a short season.  The cost for them of their normal overheads is increasing at a substantial rate.  There is a danger that some of the smaller business people may be put out of business if the amount of the licence duty involved is too great.  The Minister referred to the amount payable in similar circumstances in Northern Ireland but I believe he was somewhat misled in regard to the position there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="718" /> The Minister will find that if he compares the position in the North with what is proposed in these amendments he will see that they are not too much out of line.  The Minister's proposed increase is substantial and could result in some people being put out of business thereby causing a certain amount of unemployment.  I would not say it would be a major contribution to our unemployment figures but at this stage we ought to do everything we can to prevent any contribution to our unemployment figures. For that reason I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment and the others which follow the same line and to recognise the fact that the consequences of what he is proposing to do in so far as revenue is concerned cannot at all compensate for the adverse consequences in the way of people being put out of business and some unemployment being caused.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tabled an amendment to tailor the duty according to the occasions on which the machines are played.  The amendment in question is amendment No. 30 which provides that if a machine is played only on Sundays and public holidays the licensee may obtain a licence at a rate of only two-fifths of what the rate would otherwise be. This takes account of the small operator who operates seven days a week for only part of the year and only at weekends for the remainder of the year.  But, there are some gaming halls, in Dublin for instance, where the machines are operating all day, every day, and we have to try to strike an appropriate duty for such machines and for machines that are used only occasionally during most of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular duties which we now have, provide for a different rate of duty according to whether machines are played for one-fourth, one-half or three-fourths of the year or a full year, with a special rate for machines played only on Sundays and public holidays taking account of the different circumstances of the different proprietors of the machines and that is the most appropriate way to do it rather than to reduce the duty on all <Col N="719" /> machines including machines which produce a very handsome reward to the owners of them because of the fact that they are played virtually non-stop.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment comes to the kernel of the new law, as it were, in this Bill.  We have seen the licence duties increase.  This, in fact, is a new tax.  The Minister may state that later amendments which he has tabled may do something to ease the situation, nevertheless, this is a new tax and we ought to take cognisance of the fact that it might be too severe.  The amendment as tabled by our spokesman would be more realistic and would be in line with what the representatives of the Amusement Caterers' Association of Ireland desire.  If I may quote one sentence from them on the subject of the Finance Bill, with specific reference to the point:</P>
      <P>We respectfully suggest that the maximum tax on a gaming machine should be £25 for a full year with corresponding adjustments for a lesser period.</P>
      <P>The amendment as tabled by this side of the House meets the requirements of this association.  In passing I would say that the Amusement Caterers' Association of Ireland has a high reputation and very strict rules of membership which they enforce.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to remember that this is a new law with a new levy and I would urge him to have another look at the rates of levy and to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very patiently to the Opposition.  I must agree with the Minister in regard to the amount of profit involved in these machines.  Anyone who suggests that £50 on a slot machine is too much must not know the profit that is involved. It is generally accepted that on average these machines show a net profit of £500 and many of these machines show a profit far in excess of this figure.  A tax of 10 per cent is very little today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the <Col N="720" /> previous speaker to indicate how he arrived at the figures of net profit? It is a pity that the Deputy was not here last night when we dealt with the various types of machines and I went to great length to distinguish between what I would term a slot machine and the machine that is emotionally described as a one-armed bandit.  Would the Deputy substantiate the figures he has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Murphy in the business or has he any knowledge of the business?  The explanation is not so simple but the figures I have given are for a two-penny machine. It is very difficult to say that one machine makes so much and another machine makes so much more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I put down these amendments I put them down on the basis of the Bill as it stood, on the case we made on Second Stage and on <Col N="721" /> the Minister's reply to that.  In substance, the case we made in this regard was that there were very many people operating in a small way and many people who operated only for very limited periods, sometimes only at weekends, and that the proposed rates of tax were so crippling that they would put them out of business.  The Minister in his reply to that case did not accept that that was so and, indeed, as I indicated earlier, was misinformed or misinformed himself in regard to the comparable position in Northern Ireland.  The fact that he has himself put down the amendments to which he has referred is clear acknowledgment by him that what we were saying is correct and that he has now found it to be so.</P>
      <P>I would certainly concede to him that the amendments to which he has referred which he put down and which were put down after mine, go some of the way to meet the case we were making.  I do not think that the Minister's amendments cover all of the difficulties involved but I do acknowledge that they go some of the way to meet the difficulties which arose clearly on the ground of the Bill and which were put down, as I say, after the amendments we are now discussing were put down by me. In the circumstances it is rather difficult to identify precisely those of the Minister's amendments which will give the necessary relief and those which will not.  I agree with him that it is better, if one can avoid it, not to give relief in the case of those who are making very substantial profits.  At the same time, it is essential to give relief in the case of those who, if not given it, would be forced out of business with the consequential results I referred to earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances it seems to me that the best thing I can do is to ask the Minister to examine further the case already made to ensure that, as far as possible, the amendments which he has down will meet the reasonable requirements of the smaller operator. I do not expect he will be able to do anything across the floor of the House but it could be that he might find it necessary to amend somewhat further <Col N="722" /> the provisions of this Bill in order to meet what he has acknowledged by his own amendments to be a legitimate case.  I ask him to examine the matter further before the Bill is enacted into law to see if some further amendments can be devised which will meet the legitimate case of the smaller operator.</P>
    <P>The amendments to which the Minister has referred go some of the way we were trying to get him to go but I think there are still gaps left in the requirements.  In the circumstances, having regard to the fact that the Minister's amendments go some of the way we were trying to get him to go and some of the way this and the associated amendments were designed to produce, I am willing to withdraw this amendment if he undertakes to look further before the enactment into law of the Bill to ensure as far as he can that all the reasonable requirements of the smaller operator are covered by his proposed amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The request from the amusement caterers in the first instance for a halving of the proposed duty was understandable as there is hardly anybody who is subject to tax who does not wish that the tax be reduced. Furthermore, I think it was presented in the context of the absence of any special provisions which would allow a moderated duty in respect of machines which are usually played only on Sundays and public holidays in premises which are only opened at that time.  I think we have gone a long way towards meeting that particular difficulty but if there are any other areas of special difficulty which come to notice we certainly will be ready to consider that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, due to mental fatigue suffered on both sides of the House, the figure of 20,000 gaming machines being in the country was mentioned. That figure is not correct.  The estimate is that there are about 2,000 gaming machines in the country in licensed amusement halls.  Since the budget proposal was first announced quite a number of representations have been made complaining about gaming machines in premises licensed <Col N="723" /> for the sale of alcoholic liquor and in clubs.  It is permissible in certain circumstances to have such gaming machines in premises in Northern Ireland and in Britain but it is not permissible in the Republic.  Any person who operates gaming machines in any place other than in a licensed amusement hall or in certain circumstances in a travelling show or circus is committing a serious offence and is liable to be prosecuted, convicted and punished.  It is desirable in the public interest and in the interest of people being misled into placing such machines on their premises to issue a warning that the presence of such machines in premises licensed for the sale of alcoholic liquor will not be tolerated.  I am certain I have the support of all sides of the Dáil and Seanad in giving that notice to people who may have been led to believe that it was permissible to have such gaming machines in their premises but it is not.  This legislation will produce revenue which is necessary for essential purposes.</P>

It is a matter for the courts in each case to determine the suitability of premises for the purpose of carrying on gaming but gaming on premises which are licensed for the sale of intoxicating liquor is expressly forbidden by section 9 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's warning to non-licensed people. Would he also give the same undertaking for the licensed amusement arcades that operate illegal machines? By such machines I specifically refer to 5p machines which are illegal. Would he also give an undertaking that the Revenue Commissioners will take very strong measures to see that those machines do not continue in the country?</P>

      <P>The responsibility for enforcing the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956, is primarily a matter for the Garda Síochána.  The Revenue Commissioners are charged with the responsibility of collecting such duty as may be payable in respect of licences issued under that Act or any other Act.  The House may be assured that the Garda will be rigorously enforcing the law, first of all, because Oireachtas Éireann has already laid down the conditions under which gaming and lottery should be conducted and it is desirable in the public interest that those conditions are observed.  Now that the licensed operators of gaming machines are called on to pay duty in respect of each machine, in fairness to them it is desirable that the law should be rigorously enforced against any people who <Col N="725" /> may be committing breaches of the law.  We want a situation in which, if gaming is carried on in licensed premises, under proper supervision, it will be on the record.  We do not want to have a situation develop in which gaming is conducted in unlicensed premises on machines on which the proper duty is not being paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 23, before subsection (7), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) (a)  A gaming machine licence may, pursuant to a request contained in the application therefore, be expressed to relate only to Sundays and holidays in the period specified in the licence for which it is to remain in force and, where a licence is so expressed&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the duty of excise imposed by subsection (6) of this section shall be charged, levied and paid on the grant of the licence at two-fifths of the rate at which it would have been chargeable if the licence were not so expressed, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  the licence shall be deemed, for the purposes of subsections (3) and (9) (b) of this section, not to be in force on days in the period aforesaid other than Sundays and holidays. </P>
      <P>(b)  In this subsection `holidays' mean days which are public holidays for the purposes of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to this amendment when speaking on the previous one.  It is designed to allow gaming licence holders to take out a gaming machine licence which would be valid only in respect of Sundays and public holidays during the period for which it is taken out.  The rate of duty chargeable on such a licence will be two-fifths of the rate chargeable on a full gaming machine licence, that is, a licence which would extend over all days of the week.  This is to meet the situation in which some proprietors of licensed <Col N="726" /> amusement halls and fun fairs open, only at weekends, or rather, on Sundays and public holidays, during the off-season although in fact they may operate on a full-time basis during the summer months.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of this amendment, if it is accepted, and section 42 and other sections of the Bill, such people who operate amusement halls and fun fairs at holiday resorts will be able to take out a full licence for such period of the year as suits them, so that they may operate every day of the week during such peak period. They may then opt, if they so wish, for a Sunday and public holiday licence for the remainder of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment certainly goes some of the way to meeting the difficulties to which we drew attention on Second Stage.  Therefore, we welcome it.  However, there are one or two small points I should like to put to the Minister.  The first one is how was the proportion set out in paragraph (a) (i) of two-fifths arrived at?  The second question is whether the definition in paragraph (b) of &ldquo;holidays&rdquo; as public holidays for the purposes of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973 is sufficient, having regard to the fact that I presume there are parts of the country still in which a public holiday might well be a Church holiday rather than one of the holidays referred to in the definition and where this problem could arise. I am not saying this with authority; I do not know this positively of my own knowledge.  But I rather suspect that it is still so in parts of the country. Therefore, I wonder whether the definition in subparagraph (b) is sufficient for the purpose the Minister intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are satisfied that it is.  &ldquo;Public holiday&rdquo; is defined in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973. They are the days which are officially recognised public holidays as distinct from days which may be local or traditional holidays but not what I might call State-recognised public holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked why the proportion of two-fifths was taken. <Col N="727" /> Presumably, he is wondering why the proportion of two-sevenths was not taken.  Any general knowledge of trade and activities would recognise that each day of the week does not carry an equal volume of traffic and that the peaks in the particular activity tend to be on Sundays and public holidays.  In those circumstances, having regard to the fact that those are the days on which most profit might be expected to be made, it was considered appropriate that the proportion be higher than two-sevenths and nearer to two-fifths. In fact the situation could arise in which a person might have a licence for a whole week and do two-fifths or even half of the business on a Sunday and a tiny fraction of business only on each of the other five or six days of the week.  I think the proportion is a fairly fair one having regard to the fact that most business is likely to be done on a Sunday, even by a person who is operating for the full week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get it on the record as to how it was arrived at. I do not wish to pursue this matter too far because I am not absolutely certain of my own knowledge what is the position.  I do know that some years ago, in parts of the country, particular Church holidays were of more importance than what are commonly called bank holidays.  I wonder if that is not still the position in some parts of the country and, if it is, does this amendment meet the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In any cases where there might be exceptional local holidays&mdash;I am talking now at random and from my own knowledge&mdash;they tend to be in the summer season in any event, in which case the amusement caterers would probably have a licence to cover them.  For instance, I am thinking that 15th August is a great day in Wexford, as we all know, but it is not a recognised public holiday. I would be very surprised indeed, if gaming machines in any of the resorts in Wexford were not operating under a full licence at that time of the year.</P>

      <P>In page 24, subsection (13), line 15, to delete &ldquo;May&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;June&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was originally intended to have the commencement date of the excise duty on gaming machines as 1st May.  That was because we ambitiously hoped the legislation would be through before that date.  We know now it will not be through before 1st May and, in order to allow adequate notice to be given to the amusement caterers and allow applicants to make application for licences and so on, we now propose 1st June.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 42, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section I want to refer the Minister, first, to subsection (2) (a), paragraph (b), on page 22, lines 16 to 20, where it says:</P>
      <P>A gaming machine which provides more than one individual playing position shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a number of gaming machines equal to the number of individual playing positions provided on the machine.</P>
      <P>I presume the Minister has received representations in regard to this matter.  Certainly I have and I want to confess that I have never seen the kind of machine which is creating the problem here.  Therefore, I am in some difficulty describing the problem to the House.  But I am led to believe that, if the definition or provision in paragraph (b) is adhered to, the cost of duty on quite a number of machines will become totally prohibitive and they will have to be scrapped. Machines costing perhaps £3,000 might well be liable to duty of that amount.  Therefore, in regard to that matter, I want to know whether the Minister has received representations and, if so, what is his reaction to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to verify the position with regard to subsection (4) (a) namely, that it covers the necessary <Col N="729" /> number of machines, that if one machine were replaced the existing licence would cover the total number of machines.  I want to verify that it is not confined to specific machines but to the number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I take it the Deputy has not been inside an amusement arcade for some time. There are quite a number of machines that can be operated by a number of players, each of whom has a slot into which money is inserted.  These machines are very popular and it would be inappropriate to levy the same duty on a machine that is operated by only one player at a time.  In effect the duty will be related to the income the machines will earn.  For instance, if there are six points where money can be placed in the machine, the income will be six times higher than in a machine with only one intake point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say it would be inappropriate to charge the same duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate to levy the same rate on a machine operated by one player as that levied on a machine that could be played by six people.  The income earned from the latter machine would be six times greater than that obtained from the former.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might clarify the matter further.  I understand that in a machine that has six playing positions each of those positions has a choice for the player, that he may back six different things.  He may choose one, two or even the six options.  I understand it is theoretically possible, although unusual, for more than one person to use that place.  Is each one of the six options treated separately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Colley clarified that point.  When I read subsection (2) (b) I understood it to mean the reverse.  When the Minister replied earlier to a question a certain anxiety crossed my mind <Col N="730" /> because some of these machines have up to 48 intake points and they can cater for six or eight players.  Now that Deputy Colley has pursued the point it is clear that the slots are treated as one unit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many varieties of this form of multiple machine.  Some are the direct slot type and in others a very small amount of skill is involved.  I am thinking of a machine that would have playing space for eight people; for instance, the game where people roll a penny and hope it will enter the correct spot.  Will this be in the same category as the machine where people insert a coin and wait for the machine to operate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Deputy's description correctly, the apparatus to which he has referred requires some skill by the player.  It would not be regarded as a gaming machine.  The Amusement Caterers' Association invited the Revenue Commissioners to tour their premises recently and the Revenue Commissioners were glad to avail of the invitation.  I am glad to say the caterers offered the Revenue Commissioners the stakes with which to play so there was no net gain or loss to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>At any rate some agreement has been reached on what are regarded as gaming machines and what are not so regarded and I do not anticipate any difficulty.

      <P>Will the Minister verify the point I put forward with regard to subsection (4) (a) namely, that the licence relates to a number of machines and not to particular machines?  If a machine is replaced, although the total number remains the same, am I correct in assuming the licence will cover the total number including the replacement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  This was discussed at length last night and I am happy to confirm what the Deputy has said.  The licence will be issued for a certain number of machines.  For instance, if it is for 50 machines, so long as only that number of operable machines are accessible to the public the law is being complied with.  Any of the 50 may be taken out and replaced with an equal number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to subsection (5) (b) which states:</P>
      <P>A holder of a gaming machine licence who causes or permits one or more gaming machines in excess of the number specified in the licence to be made available for play on the premises to which the licence relates shall be guilty of a separate offence in respect of each gaming machine so caused or permitted to be made available for play and shall be liable...</P>
      <P>On the face of it that appears to mean that if a man has a licence covering 25 machines and if he is found to be operating 27, he becomes liable for a penalty in respect of 27 rather than of the two machines.  That may not be the intention but that is what the paragraph is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph states: &ldquo;... shall be guilty of a separate offence in respect of each <Col N="732" /> gaming machine so caused or permitted to be made available for play...&rdquo;  As is stated in this subsection what is involved are the machines in excess of the number specified in the licence.  A person causing two machines in excess to be played would be liable to two penalties of £300 each and the forfeiture of the two machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that is the intention and how it is thought it will be executed.  It does seem to me that there is a certain ambiguity involved in this.  However, if the Minister is satisfied that the intention he has in mind is being clearly carried out I will not pursue the matter.  I am just drawing his attention to a possible ambiguity in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy but I do not think it exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Time will tell.  Of course, the Minister appreciates that if it is found to be uncertain the effects may be to rebound on the Revenue Commissioners, not on those committing the offence.</P>
      <P>Let me now refer the Minister to subsection (8) which provides:</P>
      <P>On the application of the holder of a gaming machine licence, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to such conditions as they think fit to impose, permit the transfer of the licence from the holder to another person.</P>
      <P>On principle, I am unhappy about phrases like &ldquo;such conditions as they think fit to impose&rdquo; in regard to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners. Does the Minister not think that wording like &ldquo;such conditions as may be reasonable in the circumstances&rdquo; or some such phrase would be far more appropriate?  Why give this kind of blanket power to the Revenue Commissioners who, I am sure, do not want it anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall an earlier debate we had regarding the legal interpretation of the phrase &ldquo;think fit&rdquo;.  The courts have held that the thought processes of the <Col N="733" /> Revenue Commissioners must always be reasonable and if they think unreasonably, then the courts will intervene to protect the person against whom an effort is made to impose unreasonable conditions.  They may only think fit within the fitness which is appropriate to this Bill and that is to ensure that gaming machines are operated in accordance with this Bill and to ensure payment of duty which is fixed by this Bill.</P>
      <P>There will be cases obviously from time to time where premises are sold or where they could be destroyed or damaged or where transfer would be necessary following the death of the holder of the licence.  Such circumstances must be provided for so that the machines may continue to be operated without new duty having to be paid by a new licence holder.  While a casual reading of the phrase might suggest to a lay person that it is too extensive, in truth it can only be operated within the legal constraints which already exist and are, indeed, well recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the legal constraints exist, I also contend that the level of legal constraint imposed by the wording in this section, as distinct from wording of the kind I have mentioned, is different.  It may be a subtle difference but I think there is a difference in the interpretation that would be applied to it by the courts.  However, as the Minister said, we have argued this point at some length on another section and I do not propose to repeat that except to say that I am unhappy with this kind of phrasing in a Bill of this kind, in particular when the Minister says it has the same effect as the kind of wording I suggested.  I think it would be preferable not to have this apparently blanket power given to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I would now like to refer the Minister to subsection (11) which reads:</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners may make regulations to secure the duty of excise imposed by this section.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister give an outline of the kind of regulations that are envisaged?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give any detailed account of the regulations which are envisaged.  The power to make regulations to enforce the law is given from time to time to the Revenue Commissioners so that in the light of experience they may lay down conditions under which the activity which is liable to pay duty is carried on.  The kind of regulations which may arise here would be in matters which would require inspection by the Revenue Commissioners, their right to inspect and the obligations which lie on the holders of gaming machines to allow such inspections, the placing of a seal on premises where machines are alleged to be inaccessible to the public, the placing of seals on machines which would prevent them from being operated without the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners and so forth.</P>

      <P>The proposal in section 43 is to increase the annual licence duty payable in respect of a dog from 25p to a £1 and to increase the annual licence fee which covers any number of dogs kept by a licensee from £10 to £25.  The representations asking for this increase have come from the following associations: the IFA, the ICMSA, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, Muintir na Tíre, the ICA, the Irish Veterinary Association, Bord na gCon, the ISPCA, the Cavan and Roscommon County Committees of Agriculture, Waterford City Council, The Dublin Cats and Dogs Home and the Animals Home, Cork. The reason why representations have been made requesting the increase is that these organisations consider the existing duty to be derisory and, on that account, to be of no assistance in ensuring an adequate record of the owners of dogs.</P>
      <P>The animal protection societies have been very concerned about the increase in the dog population.  The various other organisations, particularly those associated with farming, are concerned about the large numbers of uncontrolled dogs.  All of these organisations believe that the increased fee will be associated with stricter enforcement and also that it will provide a fund which can be used to ensure better arrangements for dealing with the problem of stray and unwanted dogs.</P>
      <P>I mention the organisations which have sought this change because some people seemed to think that the amendment was nothing more than a giggle.  When responsible organisations have pressed for such change, their views deserve to be responded to and treated a little more seriously than some of the commentators have been prepared to treat them up to now.</P>

      <P>I represent a constituency in which much damage is caused by stray dogs.  Consequently, I welcome the increase in the fee from 25p to a £1 and I trust that this will result in tighter control in so far as packs of ravaging dogs are concerned, dogs which cause so much injury to <Col N="737" /> sheep.  There is also the problem of stray dogs in housing estates.  I am pleased that the Minister has been able to respond to the representations from the various creditable organisations mentioned.</P>
      <P>Regarding the substitution of £25 for £10 for a pack licence, I wonder whether this will represent an imposition on people who maintain kennels as a business or on greyhound owners and trainers.  The people involved in this business would not be the ones who would cause concern in regard to stray dogs.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, too, a concession might be granted to old age pensioners whereby they would not have to pay any licence fee for a dog.  Very often a dog is the sole companion of an old age pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point, if a person has fewer than 25 dogs he would be likely to opt for paying the £1 licence in respect of each dog.  It would be inequitable to increase the licence fee for each dog from 25p to £1 and not to increase the charge for a licence covering a large number of dogs.  I understand that such a licence is taken out by people who have a very large number of dogs&mdash;for instance, greyhound breeders and those who keep packs for hunting. Having regard to the fact that the licence is being increased from £10 to £25, these people are getting off lighter than those who must now pay a £1 instead of 25p for each single dog.</P>
      <P>Guide dogs used by blind persons are exempt from this duty.  There is a difficulty in extending the number of people who might be given licences free of duty.  There would be the question of control and the possibility of licences being sought in the names of old age pensioners who would not have dogs.  Having regard to the value of money today compared with 1925, the charge is very small.  The duty was introduced in 1925 because it was regarded as a necessary element in the control of the dog population.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to confirm the Imposition of Duties (No. 216) (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Order, 1975, and to provide for <Col N="739" /> appropriate repayments which may arise because of that order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the amendment to amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>To delete &ldquo;S.I. No. 350 of 1974 Imposition of Duties (No. 214) (Mineral Hydrocarbon Light Oil) Order, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The effect of my amendment would be to refuse to confirm the order imposing an additional 15p a gallon on petrol, the notorious increase imposed by the Minister.  I do not propose to go on at any great length on this matter.  The amendment is put down in the hope that the Minister will have learned&mdash; apparently he did not know it at the time he did this&mdash;of the vital importance of taking every step open to him to reduce inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the increase which this order confirms was one of the items which led to a record increase in prices in the quarter ending mid-February, an increase of 8 per cent in that quarter, of which 40 per cent was a direct consequence of action by the Government including this increase of 15p a gallon on petrol. Recently, in different places and from different people, the Minister will have learned that there is now general agreement&mdash;indeed, there was a good deal of agreement long ago&mdash;that the first economic priority should be to attack inflation in any way open to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> One way open to the Government would be to refuse to confirm this order which imposes an increase of 15p a gallon on petrol.  This contributed substantially to an increase in the cost of living.  That was carried over into wage claims.  The Minister justified the increase largely on the basis that it was keeping us in line with other consumer countries in Europe, and in the EEC in particular. He must admit now that there is no obligation on us to do that, and that we ought to relate our approach to this matter to our own circumstances. If it is necessary to restrict consumption of petrol, there are other steps open to him.</P>
    <P>As I said, I do not propose to labour this point.  The position is quite clear. Of itself this order is notorious because of the enormous increase in tax it imposed and because of the effect it had on the cost of living.  In this amendment we are giving the Minister an opportunity to strike one blow, at any rate, in the battle against inflation.  He can do that by accepting this amendment and thereby reducing the price of petrol by 15p a gallon.</P>
    <P>Of course, he will say there would be a substantial loss of revenue if he did that.  There would be.  There is no doubt about that.  At the moment we do not know the total overall position as regards revenue and expenditure, although we may have our ideas. Therefore, we are not in a position to say how this problem might be tackled.  We were in a position to say so before the budget, and we did say so, but the Minister did not take our advice and we are now working in a situation created by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, having imposed this increase and thereby having imposed a burden on the community, not just of the increase but of the effect on the cost of living carried into wage claims, the Minister must now see that the overall economic requirements are that he should do anything open to him to reduce prices rather than increase them.  This is a notorious example of this Government's disregard for increases in the cost of living brought about by their actions.  I hope that by <Col N="741" /> now the Minister will have realised the vital importance of taking steps to reduce inflation.  We invite him to accept this amendment with a view to taking one step on that road.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all economic arguments, this has two sides and I will give the other one.  This duty was imposed for two purposes: first, to discourage an increase in the consumption of petrol.  On the basis of the information available to us since the imposition of this duty, it is having that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been other factors too, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The growth in the consumption of petrol which had been a feature of our economy for many years past stopped first of all when, as a result of the price increase charged by the oil consumers, the price went up.  Towards the third quarter of 1974 the effect of that increase began to wear off and consumption began to increase again, with the result that our balance of payments position would have been very seriously worsened if action had not been taken by the Government to correct it.</P>
      <P>The unpopular increase in this tax led to a reduction in consumption.  It nipped in the bud the tendency towards increased use which otherwise would have arisen.  In our own interests we should decrease our consumption of foreign energy which has to be imported at exceedingly high prices, thereby jeopardising our balance of payments and also, as a consequence, increasing our living costs.  If additional money has to be expended, it is better that that money should be paid by way of a transfer within our own community from the better off group to a less well off group, rather than that the same amount of money should be paid to foreign suppliers of energy for oil which we purchase from abroad to suit our own convenience and our own pleasure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increased tax which has produced revenue for necessary purposes has all been spent within our economy. If the same amount of money had been spent on the purchase of additional <Col N="742" /> petrol from abroad, the money would have gone abroad, and we would have had to borrow more money from abroad to replace it. That, too, would be most inflationary. Last autumn this Government said in the White Paper on National Partnership that any additional indirect taxes which transferred resources from the better off to the less well off ought not to be used as a basis to seek income increases because that would negative the benefit which could flow to the community by a transfer of such resources.</P>
    <P>A number of countries, including Denmark, have a different base for the calculation of wage claims other than the consumer price index.  They deliberately eliminate from the base all indirect taxes.</P>
    <P>I have asserted on several occasions, and as recently as last Saturday in Killarney, that it is unwise for us to be using as a base for income calculations an index which includes several items of indirect taxes on non-essentials. True, an amount of petrol is used for essential purposes, but all petrol is not used for essential purposes.  I have no doubt it would generate a re-echo of bellicose laughter if I were to point out, as I pointed out last December, that all motoring is not essential.  There are apparently people of a different view who maintain that all motoring is essential.  I saw in today's paper someone expressing the joy of having walked last week and saying he feels the better for it.</P>
    <P>The effect of accepting this amendment would be to encourage people to believe that energy is cheap, that it can be consumed without harm to the economy and that excessive consumption is itself in no way inflationary. That would be most damaging to national morale and to the need for a sense of national discipline at this time.</P>
    <P>The increase last December was not by any manner of means a significant increase as a result of tax impositions. On a previous occasion when the duty on petrol was increased in May, 1969, <Col N="743" /> the tax element was 66.7 per cent. Those who are now preaching to us imposed in May, 1969, taxes as a result of which 66.7 per cent of the price of petrol was attributable to tax. Today only 53.7 per cent is attributable to tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The misleading comment comes from Deputies opposite who want to try to convince themselves that the percentage of the price of a gallon of petrol today which goes in tax is much larger than it was in 1969.  The fact is that it is much smaller than it was in 1969 when Fianna Fáil, long before an energy crisis, long before this incontrovertible necessity to reduce the consumption of energy, so increased the tax on petrol that 66.7 per cent of the total price represented a tax element.  When all is said and done, we have in this Republic&mdash;remember, we are further away from the oil fields than any other European country&mdash;one of the cheapest petrols in Europe.  I am not certain what variations there may have been in petrol prices since last December in other countries but, if we have not the cheapest petrol, we are certainly the second lowest in price in all Europe.  It is significant that the price of petrol in Northern Ireland is three pence to four pence per gallon dearer than it is here and, even though we were chastised for doing what all other countries found it necessary to do, Britain has found it necessary to increase the price of petrol by more than the increase in the price of our petrol since last December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not, of course, popular to increase taxes on any commodity. Petrol is regarded by many now as a necessity.  I do not deny it is a necessity on certain journeys and for certain purposes, but we cannot escape from the unpleasant constraints <Col N="744" /> that apply to us and, if we want to survive these difficulties, we have to exercise more self-discipline than we have been wont to do.  If we are to meet necessary outgoings and the demands made by people, including the present Opposition for further public expenditure on what they regard apparently as essentials&mdash;they have been demanding the expenditure of hundreds of millions here within the last month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will deal with that at six o'clock this evening.  In the meantime we will deal with the harsh realities of the modern world, realities which dictate that we be less wasteful in the national interest of costly imported energy.  Deputies opposite do not apparently like the way we went about discouraging people from using petrol.  They would have wanted Ireland to be the only country in the world to introduce petrol rationing.  What are the circumstances so peculiar to Ireland to justify petrol rationing in Ireland?  I would like to hear them.  Why should we have had petrol rationing when every other country used the price mechanism rather than the imposition of a costly administrative wasteful procedure?  No doubt Deputies <Col N="745" /> opposite would have wanted to employ more inspectors, to engage in more paperwork, to build up an expensive and inefficient administrative machine in order to allocate petrol according to the whims and dictates of different categories so that a huge black market could operate.  Several countries, including our own, considered the problem and it was quite clear that at a time of plenty&mdash;the supply is plentiful&mdash;and at a time of peace society would not accept rationing of a commodity like petrol. Had we introduced rationing, all we would have done was create a magnificent bureaucratic mechanism which would have produced nothing except frustration and annoyance. This mechanism could only have been established by charging the cost of it to the consumer, the consumer who would be frustrated by the operation of a mechanism he resented so much. That is the reality.  If Deputies opposite think we were wrong, then I should like to hear their advice which I will gladly convey to all the countries in the world so that they can see that they are all out of step except the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is engaging in his usual simplistic and misleading arguments.  I do not intend to waste time on them.  To argue as he has done that what is really important to the man-in-the-street is the percentage of the price of petrol taken in tax is sheer nonsense.  To imply, as he did, that it is of no importance to people really that he was increasing the price per gallon by 15 pence or 3s per gallon in 1969 terms, is also sheer nonsense. Would the Minister stop insulting our intelligence because he knows as well as we do that that kind of argument is totally unreal.  He makes a somewhat similar argument when he talks about the necessity to hold down the consumption of petrol in this country.  We have been telling him the necessity to do that and have regard to the effect on our balance of payments for well over a year but virtually nothing was done by the Government about it. Finally, he comes along and imposes this enormous increase just to get the revenue, not to save consumption.  That <Col N="746" /> is the kind of unreal argument we are faced with.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks as though there were no other way of holding down consumption.  He referred, in passing, to rationing, which is one possibility, and to a two-tier price, which is another possibility but that does not exhaust all the possibilities.  He ignored completely the consequence of what he did in that collection and other collections on the cost of living.  If he wants to talk about comparing us with other countries and say that this party are out of step with everywhere else in the world, would he mind making the comparison in the cost of living? Would he mind comparing the cost of living in this country, with a rate of inflation at 25 per cent, with that in West Germany today and then tell us that we ought to take the same line of approach as West Germany?  There are many other countries where the same comparisons could be made but the Minister chooses to compare when it suits him.  If he wants to compare the performance of these countries with ours, let him compare across the board.</P>
      <P>I am talking and was talking about what was required in our circumstances, particularly having regard to the rate of inflation.  The Minister totally ignored the effect of what he did on inflation and the argument put forward in that regard.  I did not expect him, quite honestly, to do anything else but it is important that it should be pointed out now, when it is so clear to everybody, surely even to the Minister for Finance, that the first priority is to tackle inflation.  When that is so, it is not good enough for the Minister to engage in these simplistic misleading arguments when he is talking about these things.  However, he has imposed this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment gives the Minister an opportunity to take it off and thereby contribute to a reduction in the cost of living.  He does not choose to do so and he tries to justify his refusal by the silly arguments he has put forward.  One cannot, I suppose, expect anything better and we are stuck with the Minister and his approach to the management of the economy for the moment.  I hope it will not be for too long.  The sooner <Col N="747" /> his grip on the economy is broken the better or we will end up with more and more of this kind of economic nonsense which is producing inflation at 25 per cent and more and unemployment of unprecedented levels.</P>

      <P>In page 24, before section 44, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 1 of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (e) of the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>`(ee) where a customs duty on goods of any particular description&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" />  (i)  is terminated by the order and, in the opinion of the Government, the whole of the duty was of a fiscal nature or there was a fiscal element in the duty, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  is varied by the substitution for the rate at which the duty was chargeable of another such rate and there was, in the opinion of the Government, a fiscal element in the duty before such variation and the substituted rate is equal to the rate for which it was substituted less so much thereof as, in the opinion of the Government, was the fiscal element in the duty, </P>
    <P>impose, whether with or without qualifications, limitations, drawbacks, allowances, exemptions or preferential rates, and as from any specified day, on goods of that particular description imported into the State an excise duty at a rate equal&mdash;</P>
    <P> (I)  if, in the opinion of the Government, the whole of the customs duty was of a fiscal nature, to the rate of such duty, and</P>
    <P>(II)  if, in the opinion of the Government, there was a fiscal element in the customs duty, to the part of the rate of such duty that, in the opinion of the Government, was the fiscal element therein, </P>
    <P>and the references in paragraph (e) of this section to any excise duty and in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section to any duty shall be construed as including references to any duty imposed under this paragraph and a duty imposed under this paragraph shall be deemed, for the purposes of the said paragraph (h), to be a customs duty and an excise duty;'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under Article 38 (3) of the Act attached to the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities we are obliged to convert our present customs duties of a fiscal nature or the fiscal elements of such duties into internal <Col N="749" /> taxes by the 1st January, 1976.  The customs duties in question are those on spirits, beer, wine, tobacco, cider and perri, matches, table waters, oils, motor vehicles, parts including tyres and tubes.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the provision in Article 38 (3) is that in accordance with the provisions of Article 17 of the Treaty of Rome customs duties of a fiscal nature have no place in the common customs tariff which contains only customs duties of a protective nature or charges under the common agricultural policy.  Over the transitional period Ireland is bringing its protective customs duties into line with the common customs tariff.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the decision of the Commission taken under Article 38 (3) of the Act to the Treaty of Accession any protective elements in our fiscal customs duties have been identified.  These protective elements must be treated in the same manner as other protective duties.  The remaining fiscal elements must, as stated above, be converted into internal taxes.  To comply with Article 38 (3) it is proposed to convert these fiscal customs duties into excise duties chargeable alike on imported and home produced goods.  This is in keeping with the proposals for harmonisation of excise duties on a Community level.</P>
    <P>The basic problem is, therefore, that of a legal change in the nomenclature of the duties while at the same time leaving intact legal and administrative machinery for collection and management.  It is necessary to replace the existing legally separate customs and excise rates, exemptions and so forth by a single excise rate applicable to a particular commodity with the same exemptions.  At the same time, we must retain existing excise laws for the control of, for example, home brewers and distillers, for the purpose of securing the revenue on home produced commodities.  Similarly, existing customs laws must continue to apply to imported goods, even though subject to the new excise duties, for the purpose of revenue control and prevention of smuggling, false declarations and so on.  Application of existing laws would entail, of course, continuance of existing penalties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> An order made by the Minister for Finance or the Government would appear to be the most appropriate means of effecting the conversion. Otherwise, it would be necessary to introduce, by means of a Finance Act, voluminous legislation bringing about what is in essence a change of form rather than of substance.</P>
    <P>The Attorney-General has advised that the European Communities Act, 1972 is not adequate to permit of a ministerial regulation to be made to give effect to the change.  He has advised that the most suitable course would be the introduction of an amendment to the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 which will empower the Government to make by Order the necessary changes in the legal status of the customs duties in question. The need for amendment of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 arises from the terms of section 1 (h) of that Act which at present precludes the application of the relevant provision of customs law to an excise duty on imported goods.</P>

      <P>This section deserves more than passing attention and there are some unique features in the Act itself.  It appears as a part of the Act.  I am not clear as to what the function of dividing an Act into parts is, but the system has been adopted. This section is unique in the sense that it comprises Part (III) of this Bill under the general heading, &ldquo;Death Duties&rdquo;.  The note in the margin reads: &ldquo;Abolition of death duties&rdquo;. The Minister's statement a few moments ago confirms this.  Incidentally, death duties are a name for certain duties or taxes that were imposed on a succession through death, the transmission of property through death, whether through a will or an intestacy.  These death duties comprised estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably these are the duties which the Minister says he is abolishing. It is important that we are clear on what we are doing in this section both substantively and procedurally.  I submit it is so serious a matter that we cannot afford to indulge in either political by-play or frivolity.  We are dealing with a matter which has a bearing on the function of this House and legislation.  The Minister's statement here seems to be completely in line with what he said in answer to a question put by Deputy Colley on 30th <Col N="752" /> January, 1975.  I should like to quote the Minister's reply which is contained in Volume 277, column 1466 of the Official Report of that date:</P>
    <P>I cannot be any more specific than to say that we are going to get rid of the whole wretched system of death duties that has given rise to those complaints, to these hardships, to these delays, to these impositions on family fortunes, and nothing could be more effective for getting relief to the people than to get rid of this iniquitous system which ought to have been got rid of long ago.</P>
    <P>Again at column 1467 of that volume the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I am saying we are abolishing death duties and that is the most effective way of dealing with the problem.  We are not answerable for Fianna Fáil's mistakes and failure to adjust the whole capital taxation system.</P>
    <P>I take it the Minister does not wish to disown those statements.  Therefore, I am entitled to interpret the Minister as saying that he is abolishing death duties.</P>
    <P>This is so serious a matter that I wish to take it in the most objective and responsible way possible.  I do not wish to take any advantage of the Minister, nor do I wish to make it a political debate.  If what I have stated is accurate the fact is that technically in this Bill the Minister is proposing to abolish death duties but, having regard to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, which presumably will be passed, death duties are not being abolished. What the Minister is providing for is a continuation of death duties.  I accept that there is adjustment and I do not want to be taken as considering that some of the Minister's proposed amendments at a later stage are not desirable.  However, it is a complete misrepresentation to pretend that we are abolishing death duties; we are not.  Legacy duty, succession duty and estate duty are death duties. They are going, but they will be replaced by an inheritance tax or taxes, and that also is a death duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> If it is allowed to go out of this House that we are abolishing death duties it will be a misrepresentation.  I am deliberately restraining myself when I do not describe it in stronger terms.  I say it is a misrepresentation for political purposes that does not accord with the truth, that it is a resort to a technicality which does not accord with the actual practice as it will impose itself on the taxpayer.  For that reason the device is adopted by the Minister to pretend that he is abolishing death duties, because death duties is a general term that applies equally to the inheritance tax that will carry on the same without any hiatus.</P>
    <P>Even here a minute ago the Minister was careful to point out that the death duties still owing and collectible will continue to be still owing and collectible, and the taking over under the name inheritance tax does not abolish anything in fact.</P>
    <P>I am careful to give and wish to give the Minister credit but this, unfortunately, we have on another Bill. He certainly is making adjustments, but I do object strongly for the good name of the Government, the good name of this House and our honesty to the public and to the voters who put us here&mdash;I do object to the type of thing that pretends in this Bill that we are doing something that we are not doing in fact.  That is the basis on which I think this section is an unworthy one.</P>
    <P>If I may say so, I am at some disadvantage in the method the Minister takes of doing this.  I do not wish to break the rules of order and to go into the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill where everything is put back with effect, with modification, from the same date, without any gap in date.  This is where the misrepresentation occurs.  I do not impute it in any impertinent sense but I will say there is lack of honesty rather than dishonesty. I am trying to be responsible and restrained in my language, but there is a lack of frankness, a lack of honesty, in this.</P>
    <P>Why, for instance, could this section not be in its proper place?  You can argue technical points but if you <Col N="754" /> wanted to deal with this whole thing and facilitate debate in the House and comparison, why is section 45 in this Bill, why is it not in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, where it appropriately belongs and where it would naturally appear in all the legislative principles of this House as a repeals section?  Why is that procedure not adopted?</P>
    <P>Am I going too far, am I being unreasonable, if I suggest that the political propaganda and the talk of the Minister and people like him about abolishing death duties in the past have influenced this and instead of doing the thing the straightforward way having regard to the quotes I gave, this device is being adopted? In short, lest there be any misunderstanding, what I am saying is, yes, you are abolishing the existing death duties in so far as they are classified as estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  You are consolidating them into an equivalent tax called inheritance tax, and that is as much a death duty as anything else, and that is what I am saying here.</P>
    <P>I am also saying, of course, in fairness to the Minister, that in the course of doing this he is bringing in certain reforms and there are certain provisions for which he should get credit in this reform, but I am also saying&mdash;and I would like to be told where I am wrong&mdash;that when he has technically abolished what at the moment are loosely described as death duties but are specifically described as estate duty, legacy and succession duty and replaced them with inheritance tax, he has widened his tax net in this area; it is a wider net and he has narrowed the mesh.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of the way I will go with the Minister but I am objecting to the lack of frankness.  I am objecting to the resort to technicality.  Again I have to restrain myself from words I might use.  I am objecting to the resort to technical devices for window-dressing purposes.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other questions that I want to ask the Minister on this section.  I have quoted the Minister on 30th January:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> We are going to get rid of the whole wretched system of death duties.</P>
    <P>As I said, in substance, he has not because, without any gap in date, on his own preliminary statement here, death duties are going back but the existing three are being consolidated in one, in effect, called inheritance tax but it is wide enough to catch the whole lot of them.  The inheritance tax comprises legacy duty, succession duty, estate duty and the lot, all in one.  Not only is he doing that, he is not fundamentally, as far as I can see, changing procedures and I want to ask a question here.  Is the Estate Duty Office going to continue as it is?  Is there going to be an abolition of or change in the Estate Duty Office? Under the new Act where these death duties will continue the net is wider to catch gifts <i>inter vivos</i> called a gift tax.  This will entail a good deal of administration.  Is the Estate Duty Office and its procedure to be changed, to be abolished.  I say it is not, but I am open to correction.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm for us to realise what the subject of this section is.  Perhaps the House will bear with me if I give a brief summary of what is involved. As I say, there are death duties comprised of three taxes, estate duty on the gross estate, legacy duty on specific bequests and succession duty.</P>
    <P>As I understand it, the procedure at present through the Estate Duties Office is that the party seeking a grant, or the person responsible, starts off by filing an inland revenue affidavit, in pursuance of which the Revenue Commissioners make a provisional grant assessment&mdash;colloquially referred to as a PGA&mdash;which is a provisional assessment of estate duty which is payable forthwith.  When that provisional assessment is paid a receipt is either given or endorsed on the affidavit, or whatever document exists, and those are the primary documents.  Only when one has done that does one go to the probate office and take out a grant of probate, if there is a will, or of administration in the case of intestacy.  There then follows a certain <Col N="756" /> investigation.  As I have said, the provisional assessment was made on the gross estate as set out in the Inland Revenue affidavit.  When the matter is being pursued at this stage, the Valuation Office usually comes into it, or whatever is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is getting a little afraid of my pointing out&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there has been an awful lot of repetition for months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the procedure by which death duties are collected at present.  If death duties were being abolished, presumably, the procedure would go with them.  I shall come back to that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyway, if the Minister does not like it, I shall cut short what I was saying and continue and say simply that when final assessment happens, after probate, there is a corrective affidavit, final payments and so on. There is, finally, a certificate of discharge from the Revenue Commissioners when all payments have been made.  In spite of what the Minister has said, what have I pointed out?  Obviously, the Minister saw what I was getting at but he will not stop me because, not only has he not abolished death duties but, under the very Act he has mentioned, as far as I can see, he has reimposed all of the same procedure I have outlined. He has not even changed basically the procedure.  The Minister says he is abolishing death duties, and he can get his reference from his own Act&mdash; his Inland Revenue affidavit remains with the same name.  There is a provision for corrective affidavits; grants <Col N="757" /> will not issue before the provisional assessment is met; there is a provision for receipts and for a certificate of discharge.  They have not even changed their names.</P>
    <P>It might have been better had the Minister allowed me take it in the way I was doing.  I was very restrained and trying to be very objective on this.  But, if the Minister wants another approach, he can have it and I will not pull my punches.  If the Minister will allow this Parliament to function in a responsible way, understanding that I have been carefully giving the Minister credit, I have been careful to avoid personal imputations but, if the Minister wants it that way, I will use the words that should be used.</P>
    <P>The relevance of what I have said is this: these death duties do not fall into the hands of the Revenue Commissioners automatically.  There is a mechanism for their collection.  If they are being abolished it is fair to ask what is happening the mechanism that goes with them.  It was for that reason that I outlined here the procedure from Inland Revenue affidavit to provisional grant assessment, to corrective affidavit, to final assessment and to certificate of discharge.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister is the Estate Duty Office remaining as it is. I think it will; it will have to remain as a section whether or not its name is changed.  The Minister may change its name, as he changed the name of the death duties.  He may make reforms of procedures.  I hope he does, but even the wording is kept in his new Bill&mdash;Inland Revenue affidavit, corrective affidavit, discharge, corrective discharge.  Those words remain. Therefore, I do not think I am wrong when I say that this is simply a repealing section that should be in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, which simply readjusts the whole question of death duties.  In plain language, they are not being abolished.  They are being revised and, to some extent, the procedure is being revised with them.</P>
    <P>Also I think I am in order in saying that I think it poor treatment of a Parliament that legislation be so fragmented, <Col N="758" /> bringing in one section in one Bill and the remainder in others, rendering complete discussion of the subject difficult and, on the technical rules of order, often impossible.  I do not think I am out of order in registering that protest.  Again, I am anxious to approach this objectively. I am sorry the Minister saw fit to intervene in the way he did because I assure him I was trying to take this in an objective way.  I can understand the political temptation; I know the Minister is a politician; so are we all. But our political proclivities in the less worldly sense of the term &ldquo;political&rdquo; should be restrained in this House. We should be able to rise to our political responsibilities at the appropriate level as representatives of the people.  This we are failing to do manifestly in so far as this section&mdash;I repeat&mdash;is a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts.  We are not abolishing estate duty; we are not fundamentally changing procedures; there is no hiatus.  Yes, we are reforming the code and&mdash;as I have said before&mdash; in fairness to the Minister, let me repeat, in some ways, in a very desirable manner.  It is a pity we cannot discuss this now, which would make myself and the Minister much closer in our approach.  But that is the fact. I did not bring in an outline of the procedures involved merely as a red herring or out of order.  It was exceedingly relevant.</P>
    <P>There is a third point regarding procedures that is relevant.  It is a difficult point to make because, unfortunately, it is the type of point one makes and, instead of the blame or reflection resting on the area where it should, it rests on another.  In other words, the reflection in this is on the Government and on the Minister, not on the Estate Duty Office.  I have made detailed inquiries from solicitors' offices as to the position of work in the Estate Duty Office and I can tell the Minister that office has been over-loaded. It has a reputation among solicitors of this city as being a most helpful and co-operative institution and I can say from my own experience that the staff of the Revenue Commissioners office give all the service they <Col N="759" /> can in a most courteous manner.  They serve the public and the solicitors as best they can and nobody knows that better than the Minister.  He must also know they have been swamped with work.</P>
    <P>There are delays and difficulties.  I know that until recently there was a backlog in dealing with estates of more than £30,000.  I can give the Minister examples of corrective affidavits and the history of cases going back to last October.  The staff have difficulty in coping with the demand to get out the volume of PGAs. There is difficulty in finalising matters because of the technicalities and the complexity of the law, the administrative system forced on them and because of their resources in personnel.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, we must consider the tasks we are giving these people to do.  They have the job of making the legislation work, legislation which we pass so glibly in the House.  Are the Minister and his top advisers satisfied that the implementation of this section as well as the transition is reasonably within the capacity of the Department who have to deal with the matter?  That is why I asked about the future of the Estate Duty Office.  It is obvious there will have to be re-organisation.  There are benefits for some people but I pity the taxpayer who does not know the law.  Deputy Esmonde is an expert lawyer in this field and I do not think he will disagree with me when I say the problems of our fiscal law in this area are formidable.  On top of that, the unfortunate taxpayer is presented with this kind of legislation to mislead him further.</P>
    <P>It is not only that.  We have a Government and a Minister for Finance who proceed rashly to impose a load on the administrative organisation who have to make this legislation work, without adequate consideration for their problems.  I hope I am wrong to some extent; I know I am not wrong entirely.  I suppose that in substance this section will have to appear in one Bill or another but I would ask the Minister, <Col N="760" /> before we leave this section, to come clean on this matter.  He should be absolutely frank with the public instead of giving a rather diplomatic introduction to the section, telling us the Government are abolishing death duties but that estate duty will continue to 1st April, 1975 and arrears will be collected.  Of course, there is no reference to the fact that after that date it will continue under the heading of the inheritance tax subject to revision.  The Minister should put us right and he should put this section in perspective.  I should like to think that nobody in this House will try to fool the public by pretending we are abolishing death duties.</P>

He has ridden that animal hard and fast this morning and he has warned us he will ride again.  Personally I hope he does because I always enjoy listening to him.</P>
      <P>We have faced the reality.  We are abolishing death duties.  We are abolishing estate duty which is a tax charged on all property that changes hands at time of death.  There is no other legislation before the Dáil that proposes to charge a tax on all property that passes at a time of death. The abolition of death duties does not change the law so far as the handling of the estate of the dead person is concerned.  There will still need to be an executor or an administrator; someone will have to be given legal title to the property of the dead person and such title can only be given by the Probate Office.  Even if there were no capital acquisition tax, it would still be necessary to have an assessment made of the estate left by a person in order that a probate or a grant of administration might be given in respect of that estate.  I am sure Deputy de Valera will not disagree with me on that point.  It is an absolute necessity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has suggested it is wrong to say the Finance <Col N="761" /> Bill, 1975 abolishes death duties because it will still be necessary to have an assessment made of the estate of the deceased.  That was necessary before estate duties were introduced in 1894. There must be an assessment made of the value of an estate in order that authority could be given to some person to administer that estate.  It is not anything shocking.  It is not a denial of my assertion that death duties are being abolished to say that, of course, that exception will be made and it will be made as a matter of convenience by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, any charge to tax in future will not relate to all the property left by a deceased but will relate when and only when a particular beneficiary exceeds the thresholds which may be set out by law.</P>

That, to my mind, is abolition and it is not stretching language too far to call it abolition.  If anybody is kneeling before the altar of technicality it is Deputy de Valera.  At present estate duty is chargeable on all estates with a value of over £10,000 irrespective of who the beneficiaries may be.</P>

If such a person were to leave £600,000 today the duty chargeable would be 55 per cent.  Of course we are abolishing that tax and abolishing it <i>in toto</i> and it is not correct to assert, as Deputy de Valera and others asserted, that there is not an abolition but simply a change of nomenclature.  There is a total abolition of the concept that all property left by a deceased person will be liable to tax.</P>

    <P>There will not be the same amount of paperwork in the administration of the estates of deceased persons in future.  At present there has to be a very detailed examination of all estates because of the very low figure at which liability arises and because of the multitude of different types of property which can appear on a revenue affidavit.  It is quite frequently necessary to file a corrective affidavit because the tax liability applies to <Col N="763" /> all the property and so corrective affidavits are quite normal because there is a variation in the ultimate valuation.</P>

      <P>In the initial stages of an administration in future the beneficiaries will be identifiable.  The question of any liability to tax will be ascertained at an early stage and it will be quite clear whether or not there is a need to reassess the situation and the values which are originally assessed.  The work of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the administration of estates will be much less in the future than in the past. Deputy Colley will know from his experience that the amount of investigation of small estates is negligible compared with the amount of investigation on large estates, the reason being, I will not say <i>de minimis non curat lex</i> but the principle is applicable. The Revenue Commissioners are not concerned with variations in value on small estates which are not liable to duty at all, and as the thresholds have now been raised beyond all recognition the volume of detailed examination that will have to be conducted in future will be negligible compared with what had to be done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Estate Duty Office will have to <Col N="764" /> operate for some time to come as it has in the past because it will be dealing with the estates of persons who died prior to 1st April, 1975, but in the course of time the number of non-administered estates which are liable to estate duty will become less and less and the load of the office will, to that extent, become less and less.  The people who have been engaged in this work will be transferred to other capital taxation work which may arise in the future.</P>

      <P>What I said was that three taxes were, in a technical sense, being abolished and replaced by inheritance tax.  The Minister seeks to escape that by a technicality.  The Minister made the suggestion that the recipient of the gift was the point at which the charge lay.  Under section 47 of his new Bill it is a charge on the property.  That is a distinction without a difference.  He talks about estate duty.  His section 47 makes it a charge on the property.  That is not good enough.  Secondly, who is an accountable person?  This is a continuation of the misrepresentation.  But this is where I may be out of order by having to refer to a Bill that is not before the House.</P>

      <P>I apologise, Sir. The Minister talks of who may be captured. In the old Finance Acts there were schedules of exemptions.  Under the new procedure a spouse will not be assessed but this provision is put in in the same way as has always been the case&mdash;a schedule of exemption.  It is not frank to pretend that the net is less wide than it is.  I realise the Government's problem.  Also, I am concerned about the problems of the Revenue Commissioners but I was reluctant to refer to the difficulties of the Estate Duty Office lest it might be construed as a complaint against them because all my inquiries from solicitors' offices and other such places have elicited nothing but praise for that Office.  I understand that the burden on them is becoming intolerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> The Minister talks of the abolition of estate duties.  Technically we may be abolishing estate duties but in substance we are replacing them by inheritance tax which in its first form is phrased so cleverly as to show a type of calculated artifice&mdash;representing something which it is not.  When we come to dealing with the question of accountable officers we must ask whether there are not to be more people with legal liability now than there were before.  Let us not try to cover up the fact that in a technical sense we are abolishing what up to now have been known as death duties. Procedures will remain the same although I accept what the Minister said regarding the intention being to reform.  I regret that this section did not appear in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill where, perhaps, it would have enlarged the scope of both revisions to the betterment of the law. At a Committee Stage we should be endeavouring to form the best law possible.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera tells us that this Bill is being misrepresented, that the public are being fooled.  Regardless of what the Bill may be called, the people will be interested only in ascertaining how it will affect them.  The electorate are not stupid.  In the case of a widow and three children, there would be no charge on estate valued up to £600,000.  In this context I might refer to a case of a widow and her two children whose husband, a cousin of mine, was killed in a car crash some months ago.  He was 42 years of age and left estate valued at about £35,000. Both children are under five years of age and the Revenue Commissioners are taking about £9,000 from the widow.  This is a disgrace when one considers that this woman must look after the welfare of those children for the next 20 years or so.  If the Bill we are discussing were in operation, she would not have to pay anything.  It will be seen, then, that this Bill is much better than any previous one of its kind but, perhaps, some relief might be given in regard to the property of persons who died in the past <Col N="766" /> year and whose children are very young.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera referred to the net being widened.  Both he and Deputy Colley must know that if one goes to Jersey he will see there companies with such titles as Killiney, Ltd., Dalkey, Ltd. and so on.  These are companies owned by people who made their money here on the fruits of Irish labour but who, having made that money, decided to get out.  This Bill is designed to catch such persons.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned persons calling in an expert like Deputy Esmonde and paying him a tremendous amount of money.  There will be no need to call in anybody unless there is a huge amount of money involved, at which stage one could afford to call in somebody like Deputy Esmonde.</P>

I do not wish to take away from the reassessments that appear in the Schedules of the later Bill.  I do not want to detract or to appear to detract from the value of this.  That is not my point.  There is a point on the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill which I think it would be out of order to make, unfortunately, but it is very relevant.  I will not make it.  I should like it to be recorded that I have made that remark on this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not debating the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill.  It will be dealt with on its merits.  I am dealing with <Col N="767" /> this section in this Bill.  I am dealing with the popular misconception because of statements made by the Minister and borne out by the actual form of this Bill and the marginal note in particular: &ldquo;We are doing a great thing.  We are abolishing death duties.&rdquo;  We are not.  We are effecting reforms in certain ways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton seemed to misunderstand completely the point I made.  I could fault the Minister technically as to why it should be in this Bill.  I fault him on the apparent content of the statements he made which, in substance, I submit in all sobriety, are not a frank representation of the facts in relation to this Bill.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to get involved in this discussion but the contrivances of Deputy de Valera and Deputy Belton forced me to my feet. As a lawyer, I have always adopted a very sound rule which has prevented my doing an unnecessary amount of work or worrying unnecessarily about legal points.  It is this.  When a Finance Bill is introduced, I look at it but I do not analyse it.  I wait until I see its final form.</P>
      <P>There is an atmosphere abroad and, rightly or wrongly, people are seeing dangers and ghosts and imaginary situations.  I am not accusing Deputy de Valera of doing that.  Speaking as a lawyer, I want to make it clear that people are taking a very gloomy view of the financial instruments which have come into this House this year.  From discussions I have had with lawyers and officials whose duty it is to administer our fiscal measures, I can say that there is very little ground for this pessimism and the fears generated in people's minds.</P>
      <P>I would describe section 45 as the most far-reaching fiscal measure or section in any Act of Parliament dealing with finance which this Parliament has passed since the foundation of the State.  This is an historic moment for the House.  We are setting about the abolition of estate duties, the nasty death duties which are visited upon families when the breadwinner dies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> The reason why people are concerned about fiscal measures is this. Deputy de Valera and Deputy Belton were correct in part when they referred to my position as a professional man in relation to the existing taxation laws.  I have to confess, as every lawyer must, that I spend a tremendous amount of time in advising people how to tax farm.  The phrase is quite current and usual.  People were indulging in taxation avoidance on a very large scale indeed.  As the wealth of the country improved the demand grew for technicians, lawyers and accountants to assist and advise people.  Because the taxation law was unjust it was an incentive to the ordinary person of property to go rushing to his lawyer or accountant.  Very artificial contrivances were arrived at.  As Deputy Belton pointed out, the domicile of many companies, the owners of which made their money out of this State, was changed to other countries.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the general approach of all countries is to stop this false flight of the control of capital to other countries.  When the money has been made in a particular country that country is now setting about protecting itself.  People should direct their energies towards an economic path rather than a tax farming path.  On many occasions a property transaction has started off by a simple offer and finished by a simple acceptance.  Nothing was put on paper but six months or 18 months later that simple transaction ended up in about 12 different transactions and in at least three different countries with I do not know how many teams of lawyers or accountants involved.  No document in that transaction told you what the effect of the transaction was.  The whole purpose was to avoid being caught within the tax net.  Unfortunately, this had the effect of greatly delaying economic progress.  In this country a great deal of development was held up because of the unfairness of our taxation laws.</P>
    <P>Section 45 does what this country had been crying out for for a long time.  The net effect of this section and the other Acts referred to by <Col N="769" /> Deputy de Valera will be that over 90 per cent of the people who heretofore either paid capital tax in the form of death duties, or who were liable for capital tax, will be completely free and absolved from any liability in relation to capital tax. That says enough for it without going into the finer technicalities of administration. These are lawyers' matters. I do not think they are really germane to the discussion of this section.</P>
    <P>I see the points raised by Deputy de Valera but I do not think they are reasons or grounds for any criticism of this section.  As I say, this is an historic section.  This is an historic moment.  It is good to be here while it is taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the greatest regard for Deputy Esmonde, not only professionally but also personally, and I agree there is much in what he says.  I would agree with him in regard to the importance of the section if it did what it is purported to do.  But it does not do that.  The Committee Stage is the stage on which we go into legal technicalities.  If you replace a section like this by a section that puts on a tax with a new name, admittedly limited to the recipient, if you like, and in the next section go on to widen the scope and, in a later section still, make a charge on the property and, in another area, open up the accountability, surely then the balance is in favour of my contention and the point being made that the removal of estate duty as such is a mere technical quibble and not a reality.  If that is the position, where then is the change?</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, in previous Acts there were exemptions and there were rates of tax incidence in the Schedules. That situation will not be changed. Full credit to the Minister for the revision of the scales but, remember, the law will remain essentially the same.  There may perhaps be some streamlining and there will certainly be scope for the Revenue Commissioners to plug loopholes but the position, if the section is passed, will remain essentially what it is with just what amounts to a revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> At one stage I was going to ask the Minister could he not take this section and put it into the Capital Acquisitions Bill.  If he did that a great deal of the acrimony would disappear and we could debate the matter more homogeneously.  To take the section at its face value here and say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; is a misrepresentation.  There will not be one hour in which any one taxpayer can escape the law.  There is absolute continuity.  There will not be one hour in which liability is removed. What will happen is that on a particular date certain exemptions will be given.  The scales are revised.  The reliefs are given.  We are here making the law and I am surprised that Deputy Esmonde should try to make the case that to go into the law here is un-becoming. We are making the law and it is specifically on Committee Stage that we make the law.  If the Deputy adverts to that point he must agree with me that, in contemplation of law, the general liability is universal.  I am not overstating the position when I say that simultaneously the net is widened and the net is narrowed.  That will be the overall position applicable to everybody.  What will happen then is that under the Schedule and specific provisions certain reliefs and exemptions are given.  It could not be otherwise because, if it were, it would be wide open to evasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister must not take me now as criticising.  I am merely trying to put things into perspective.  I do not want to be misrepresented by people trying to pretend I am criticising the reliefs and the reforms the Minister will effect under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  We will come to that in due course.  There are things in that measure for which I will commend it. That is not the point at issue here.  The point at issue is that this section, standing alone in the Bill, will not for one moment effect what the marginal note would claim it will effect.  That is the first thing.  Secondly, because of the propaganda and because of the two quotations I gave from the Minister's answer to a question on 30th January last, there has been a certain misrepresentation abroad about the effect of what we are doing.  Do not <Col N="771" /> let us confuse this with the merits and demerits of what the Minister is proposing in later legislation.</P>
    <P>I can see technical arguments for the Minister leaving the section here but, if he were absolutely frank, I do not think he would have evoked high horse indignation or any other kind of indignation; had he simply and frankly said it is necessary to put this section into this Bill to do what he wants to do but, of course, a subsequent measure will be doing it, that straightforward attitude with the public would have done none of us any harm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton instanced a particular case of which he has personal knowledge.  I think he said it was the case of a relative of his.  Estate duty will be payable and Deputy Belton thought that it should not be payable. I agree with him.  I think most people would agree with him.  I refer to the matter because this whole discussion goes back to something much more fundamental than would appear from this section.  It goes back to the last general election when this party undertook to do a fundamental reappraisal of the whole death duty system and the parties now in Government undertook to abolish death duties, which is what the marginal note to this section proclaims.  This whole artifice arises out of that commitment by the present Coalition Government.  If what one is doing is a fairly major review of the death duty system, with very substantial relief in many cases and with, perhaps, the introduction of a gift tax, one could do this without the abolition of death duties.  The Minister and his colleagues were committed politically to the abolition of death duties.  If they did not know at the time they made the commitment, they certainly found out afterwards that that was not feasible. Consequently, they applied a great deal of ingenuity to producing something which appeared to be abolishing death duties but, in fact, was not.  That was the object of this exercise.  That is why we have this section in the Bill.  I think Deputy de Valera tentatively suggested it should be in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  I will go further. <Col N="772" /> I have no doubt that is where it should be and that it should not be in here at all.  It is in here as part of this artifice, which is added to by the side note &ldquo;abolition of death duties&rdquo;.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Estate duty shall not be levied or paid in respect of any property passing or deemed to pass on the death of any person dying on or after the appointed day.</P>
      <P>That would be a much more honest statement if it had added to it &ldquo;but inheritance tax shall be payable in respect of such property&rdquo;.  The Minister knows as well as the rest of us that over the years a large body of legislation has been built up in connection with estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty but very significantly you can search this section from beginning to end and nowhere will you find the repeal of one portion of that legislation.</P>
      <P>This section does not repeal the legislation which imposed and extended estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  The significance of the failure to repeal that legislation is enormous.  That, of course, is why Deputy de Valera was able to point out that the whole paraphernalia, which has operated in relation to death duties, will continue fully.  We find, in order to continue this artifice, forced for political reasons on the Minister because of the commitment he and his colleagues made to abolish death duties, there is a very peculiar provision between subsection (3) and (4).  Subsection (3) states that legacy duty and succession duty shall not be chargeable on any legacy or succession in so far as the duty would, apart from this section, be payable in connection with any event mentioned in subsection (4).  That subsection lists a number of items.  Anybody who believed that death duties were being abolished would say that the provision should simply be that where legacy or succession duty would, but for this section, be chargeable it shall not be chargeable as from the 1st April.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible to do it in any simple way.  It has to be done in this complex way because the whole object <Col N="773" /> of the exercise is to maintain the existing death duty legislation and to use it.  It is not being repealed.  No amount of shallow argument by the Minister or any of his colleagues can alter the fact that that legislation is not being repealed.  All of this is not a matter of technicality but one of plain, straight politics.  It arises because the Minister and his colleagues undertook to abolish death duties and they are not doing so.  They are at their wit's end and using a great deal of ingenuity to try to conceal that fact.  Apart from the side note to this section and the statements made from time to time by the Minister and his colleagues on the 1st April this year, there was a big hand-out from the Government Information Service celebrating the disappearance of death duties.  Even Deputy Esmonde, who should know better, spoke about this being an historic occasion.  If death duties were being abolished, would the legislation not be abolished? Would it not be repealed?</P>
    <P>The legislation is not being repealed. That is the kernel of the whole argument that knocks the bottom out of all these statements by the Minister, hand-outs from the Government Information Service and so on.  It is proposed to have substantial reliefs as regards the people who will be liable for inheritance tax who would also have been liable for death duties. Clearly substantial reliefs would have occurred under any review of the death duty system.  In regard to the reliefs the Minister found himself doing the kind of things that would have been expected under the Fianna Fáil commitment in the last general election but the last thing he could do was to pretend that was what he was complying with.  He had to pretend he was keeping his own undertaking, which he is not, because he is retaining death duties.</P>
    <P>Those who have spoken about the exemptions proposed under the inheritance tax system are, in effect, talking about the kind of reliefs that would have been expected but they have not adverted to the kind of reliefs that are not being given.  The Minister made some statements <Col N="774" /> earlier which were factually incorrect in this regard.  Under his proposals people will be liable for inheritance tax, which is the new name for death duties, where the sum received is over £10,000 if it goes to a brother, sister, nephew or niece unless in special circumstances. That is not just inheritance but one adds any gifts given for the past five years or any time in the future to the inheritance.  If it then comes to over £10,000, duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>That system will be operated and effected on foot of the existing legislation which is not being repealed.  I suggest that this section is really a confidence trick, that it should not be in this Bill at all but should be in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  It is put in here to try to get people to look at it in isolation and to imagine that the Coalition Government are fulfilling their promise to abolish death duties.  It is all a most elaborate operation to try to mislead the public. This will not succeed once people realise that the whole paraphernalia will continue in operation without, as Deputy de Valera said, one hour's interruption. In many cases the liability will be even greater than it was under the old system.  The reliefs given are those which clearly would have been given without any nonsense about the abolition of death duties but simply with a change in the death duty system which is what the Minister is doing, changing the thresholds.  It is not true, as the Minister is trying to say, that there are fundamental changes in regard to the categories of persons who become liable because, as he knows, under the existing death duty system there are categories of consanguinity in the case of widows and children which bring about fairly substantial exemptions.  They are fairly substantial but by no means enough especially with the way inflation has gone.  The Minister has not given relief to those coming under the existing death duty system even to compensate for inflation.  Some such people are being treated very badly because of the Minister's failure to afford them relief.</P>
    <P>The Minister's concentration <Col N="775" /> appears to have been almost entirely on this operation, this artificial operation of trying to make people believe that death duties are being abolished when they are not.  We also have a very peculiar provision in subsection (6), one the Minister should explain.  That subsection states that the appointed day means 1st April, 1975.  The appointed day has been referred to in subsection (1).  The Minister knows that in the normal way where there is such a provision the definition of appointed day is usually the day on which an order shall be made bringing the section into force. I cannot recall ever seeing a section which refers to the appointed day and then defines the appointed day by a specific date.  Would the Minister explain why that, on the face of it, very peculiar form of drafting is used in this section?  I am sure the Minister would agree that it is so unusual it calls for explanation.</P>

      <P>When all is said and done, two examples will give the reality of the situation and then we will leave it to the people to decide whether they are having their liability to death duties abolished or not.  If a man died in 1974 leaving estate worth £500,000 to his wife and three children they would have to pay £275,000 on that estate.  That amount would have been taken from them before they would have received any share in the estate.  That kind of thing happened in small businesses and farms and many of them had to be broken up or massive borrowings had to be made, in many cases doing serious damage to viable businesses. On a death occurring after 1st April this year no tax whatsoever will be payable.</P>

      <P>It does not.  It proves we have abolished estate duty of £275,000 and that after April, 1975, no duty is payable because we are not imposing death duties.  As a result of this Government's wisdom which the Deputies opposite are frustrating with their technical comments the saving to such people will be £275,000.  If a man had £600,000 to be divided equally between his wife and three children and he died before 1st April of this year the liability would be £330,000 but after that date there is no liability.</P>

Apparently we are going to have into the long hot summer passionate orations on behalf of comparatively lucky people who will have the good fortune to receive from the next-of-kin assets in excess of £150,000.  If the Opposition say that in respect of such people we have not abolished death duties and, therefore, we have failed to fulfil our promise, I will give them that and acknowledge they have won that debate.  They have won something less than 1 per cent of the debate and they may have a present of that, go to the polls and seek the support of the people in whose defence they are holding up the business of this House.  The masses who have obtained the relief will express their support for those who gave them the relief while others only wanted a pyrrhic victory in a debate.</P>

We are making law and are concerned what the content of the law is <Col N="778" /> and it is wrong to proceed with the type of political diatribe the Minister has gone on with.  The Minister is giving reliefs and nobody is questioning what is being done in the Schedule of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill but that is not the point.  The point is that death duties are not being abolished in spite of the marginal note.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the proposals he has for (a) the building of primary schools (b) the provision of additions to primary schools (c) the provision of additions to post-primary schools (d) the provision of extra teachers to reduce pupil-teacher ratios in both primary and post-primary schools (e) the provision of extra finance for the running of post-primary schools as requested by parents and the Catholic Headmasters' Association, in County Roscommon; if he has made any decisions during recent weeks on those proposals; and, if so, if they will all be implemented before the end of the current financial year.</P>

      <P>In relation to (a) and (b), primary school buildings, the position is that there are at present 114 new schools and 61 extension schemes in progress and a further 132 new schools and extensions are at advanced planning stages and could begin before the end of the current financial year.</P>
      <P>In regard to (c), post-primary building, I have already given particulars of 60 major projects for 1975 in reply to Question No. 32 on 15th November, 1974.  In regard to (d), extra teachers for primary and post-primary schools, I have already indicated in Question No. 41 of 29th April, 1975, that I will be making a statement at an early date in regard to the matter when examination of it has been completed. In regard to (e), extra finance for post-primary schools in County Roscommon, I am not yet in a position to add anything to the statement which I made on this matter generally in connection with the motion in this House on 16th April, 1975.</P>

      <P>It may be that this answer was formulated before the Minister spoke yesterday, but certainly he added something substantial to his statement yesterday, in reply to the <Col N="793" /> motion.  Would the Minister agree this is so?</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated he is not in a position to add to the answer he gave to the motion on the financing of secondary schools but yesterday, under questioning in the House, he said that the payments would be made before June.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>An extension of the route as suggested by the Deputy is not feasible as the roads in the locality are regarded by CIE as too narrow and hazardous for the large bus which is engaged on this particular transport service.</P>
      <P>I am having the matter further examined, however, to see if it may be possible to meet the transport problem in relation to these children in some other way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On 5th November the Parliamentary Secretary wrote to me on this matter.  He is aware that the school which this child attended was closed and amalgamated with the school at Clonegal which is six miles from the child's home.  At the moment the child has to travel 2.3 miles to reach the bus.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that what I have offered here is a viable alternative?</P>

      <P>I agree with the statements <Col N="794" /> made by the Deputy in the first part of his question.  However, CIE who advise us on transport matters have stated the roads are too narrow for extension of the regular service to go nearer this family's house.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I will do everything possible to find some other solution which is consistent with the advice of CIE to enable this family to get an improved service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation still obtains that this child lives only half a mile from Roundwood national school which is a perfectly good national school.  As in the case of parents in any other situation if they want to send their children to any other school they are perfectly free to do so but it is to the nearest school that transport will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is all right in the case of situations which arise but ought not be a hard and fast rule in the case of existing situations.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary bear in mind that the parents simply wanted continuity in the child's education?  It means now that the child must wait in Bray town from 4 p.m. until 7 p.m. for a bus while the school bus which has seats available leaves Bray at <Col N="795" /> 4 p.m.  The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that there is no shortage of numbers in Roundwood national school as Moneystown national school is going to be phased out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that some members of the family had transport irregularly for some time while there was room on the bus but that this was due to a misunderstanding and to laxity on the part of some of the people directly involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>

In a recent survey of the Carrickatleave area no child was found to be eligible. Eligible children are those between four and ten years of age who have a distance of at least two miles to travel to the nearest suitable school while for children over ten years of age the minimum distance is three miles. Accordingly, the provision of a transport service to cater for this locality is not warranted under the terms of the scheme.</P>

      <P>We are becoming tired of this stock reply.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to admit that these rules are capable of being bent, that they have been bent in many cases particularly in relation to Protestant schools?  Has he any knowledge of what is involved in the request I have made on behalf of the 12 children who must walk along a bleak lonely mountain road for a distance of more than two miles and three of whom are beginning school? If transport is not provided they will not be able to go to school.  Other children who live closer to the school can avail of free transport.  Is it not time that this whole question of measuring miles was changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the proposals he has to provide money to health boards for payment of home-care allowances; if he is aware that the health boards cannot accept any more applications for home care as they have already overspent their allocations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the home-help service in his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of any health board having overspent its 1975 allocation for this service.  The final details of expenditure on the service in the current year have not yet been worked <Col N="809" /> out and will be the subject of further discussions between officials of my Department and the health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that.  It contradicts what I have been told.  I was told that one board exceeded their allocation for the year by £60,000.  I was told there is some difficulty about the prescribed relative's allowance.  It looked to me as if there was a complete shortage of money.  I did not put down the question until I was told there was a shortage of money, that there is some difficulty with the officers who carry out the means test in relation to the prescribed relatives' allowance and that there have been delays of over two months in payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is satisfied that  number of homes which care for  people is adequate to meet  demand; and if the standards in  homes are adequate to ensure  care for the residents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied  the accommodation for the aged fully adequate to meet requirement but schemes have been in progress  some years to provide extra accommodation and improve the facilitie for the aged throughout the country.</P>
      <P>New geriatric units have been provided to replace old unsuitable premises, and others have been adapted and new extensions built.  In all, some 4,200 beds in new or improved accommodation have been provided over the last nine years.</P>
      <P>In addition, 48 new welfare homes, each with 40 beds, have been approved in principle.  Of these, 18 are completed and in use, two are completed and about to be occupied, five will be ready for occupation this year or early next year, six are at tender stage and the remainder are at various stages of planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The standard of accommodation in the new geriatric units and the new welfare homes is very satisfactory. <Col N="811" /> Accommodation is not so good in some of the older institutions but improvement schemes have been carried out at many centres in recent years, and this process is continuing.</P>
    <P>Many old people are maintained in private geriatric homes of varying standards but, in general, they are of a reasonable standard and are inspected under the Health (Homes for the Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if an assessment has been made recently of the merits of boarding out old people in private homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>An assessment has been made in my Department of the merits of a scheme of boarding out old people in private homes.</P>
      <P>Health boards are empowered to operate such a scheme under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, and organised arrangements for the boarding out of elderly persons have been developed in Dublin and Westmeath. In Dublin, 23 such persons are boarded out with private families.  In Westmeath, the number is 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to careful placement procedures being used by health board staff and subject to regular inspection procedures being brought into operation to safeguard the interests of the <Col N="812" /> elderly persons concerned, the scheme has merits.  It offers an additional method of providing suitable accommodation for older members of our community and this is to be welcomed. It should, therefore, be seen as a service which is complementary to other, more traditional, methods of providing suitable accommodation for elderly people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the Minister but he will appreciate that this is Committee Stage and we are making law and in spite of Deputy Esmonde's remarks it is important to look at the legal content. Earlier I said that in substance death duties were not being abolished.  I said they were being modified and that death duties were being brought in, without any hiatus in time, under another name, inheritance tax.  I also made the point that procedures will remain substantially the same.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question about something I am not clear on but which might help me to dispose quickly of the points I want to make.  A certificate of inland revenue will be given.  Heretofore, a provisional assessment was made at that point and duty was paid on that provisional assessment.  A grant did not issue until the duty was paid and the receipt was issued.  Can the Minister inform me will the same procedure hold as from 1st April, 1974?  Will there be what will amount to a provisional assessment and must that be paid at that stage before a grant, or does the payment of tax wait until the grant is made and the property vests in the successor?  This is a point of some importance for the debate.  Will the property vest in the successor before payment of any tax or will there be the equivalent of the present position where a provisional assessment is made and tax is payable on foot thereon, correctable later on a final assessment?</P>

      <P>The tax will be payable at the point at which the property vests in the beneficiary save in such cases where the <Col N="815" /> Revenue Commissioners have reason to believe that tax might be avoided unless it was collected beforehand.  In the vast majority of estates the probate will issue before the payment of capital acquisition tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say without the least hestitation that that is an important reform of the law.  Can we take it definitely that that is the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It will no longer be necessary to have a provisional assessment on foot of an inland revenue affidavit before a grant of probate or a grant of administration is issued.  At the moment one must have these as primary documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  An executor invariably has to borrow money in order to discharge estate duties prior to the issue of the grant of probate which then confers entitlement to intermeddle with the deceased's estate but in future the liability to pay tax will not arise until after the issue of probate.  If, however, in a case where the beneficiary is outside the jurisdiction the Revenue Commissioners would have the obligation to ensure that the liability to tax was not avoided and they would require payment in advance.  In so far as people resident here are concerned and the assets are here in the normal course of events the duty will be paid after the issue of the grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, where the property comes into the hands of the successor.  It is not clear that the taxable inheritance is in the first instance liable in the hands of the successor but then there are such provisions which I can understand such as section 47 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill which will safeguard the revenue by a lien on the property. The property is chargeable.  There are also the portions of the Bill which relate to accountable persons.  I asked that question because it affects the analogy with estate duty and it is an important point to be clear on. Although what the Minister said here is not evidence it is certainly evidence of <i>bona fides</i> and I take it that the Minister would not make such a responsible statement unless he was sure of the content of what he has said. This raises the question of what the valuation date is.  Is the valuation date to be before or after the grant of probate or letters of administration? Will the Minister answer that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, we are getting once more into a debate on the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and not the Finance Bill which abolishes death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point and if he refuses to give me an answer I will proceed with the point I was making.  It was in order to be sure of the situation that I put the question because the Minister has claimed to have abolished estate duty. If the Minister does not wish to answer my question I concede that he has every right not to but it does not help the type of objective discussion I was trying to embark upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an important qualification in what the Minister has said.  The inheritance tax which Deputy de Valera is rightly contending is another name for death duties is payable on the valuation date and the valuation date in most cases is the <Col N="817" /> date on which the successor becomes entitled to the property which is, in the normal case, before the obtaining of a grant of probate or administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was given certain answers to my question.  They are on the record and I hope are carefully recorded.  Those answers have also been heard elsewhere.  The Minister contends that estate duty has been abolished and I contend that death duties remain in another guise. I concede the improvements the Minister is making in the Schedule and the reliefs he is giving but they do not amount to the abolition of death duties.</P>
      <P>Subsection (1) of section 45 states that estate duty shall not be levied or paid in respect of any property passing or deemed to pass on the death of any person dying on or after the appointed day.  The Finance Act of 1894 states:</P>
      <P>In the case of every person dying after the commencement of this Part of this Act, there shall, save as hereinafter expressly provided, be levied and paid, upon the principal ascertained as hereinafter provided of all property, real or personal, settled or not settled, which passes on the death of such person a duty, called &ldquo;Estate duty,&rdquo; at the graduated rates hereinafter mentioned, and the existing duties mentioned in the First Schedule to this Act shall not be levied in respect of property chargeable with such Estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the definition of estate duty. My question is has that been abolished or not?  Passing from my contention that in all reality the changing of names with qualifications as to exemptions and application does not amount to an abolition I say that in point of law estate duty is not abolished.  If one reads the section I have quoted in connection with subsection (1) of section 45 of the Bill before the House, one will see that that subsection states that after a certain date after the appointed day in respect of any person dying then duty shall not be levied.  However, <Col N="818" /> estate duty remains in our law and it is active and applicable to cases before that date.  It could not be otherwise without introducing an extraordinary amount of chaos.  There is not a scintilla of time hiatus involved in the taxability in principle of all property within the concept of this fiscal law.  Therefore, in substance and in fact, estate duty has not been abolished.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the Minister's opening remarks in support of that contention.  Subsection (2) of section 45 states:</P>
    <P>The duties referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the First Schedule to the Finance Act, 1894, shall not be leviable in connection with the death of any person dying on or after the appointed day.</P>
    <P>The First Schedule of the Finance Act, 1894 states:</P>
    <P> 1.  The stamp duties imposed by the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, on the affidavit to be required and received from the person applying for probate or letters of administration in England or Ireland, or on the inventory to be exhibited and recorded in Scotland.</P>
    <P>2.  The stamp duties imposed by section 38 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1881, as amended and extended by section 11 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1889, on the value of personal or moveable property to be included in account thereby directed to be delivered.</P>
    <P>3.  The additional succession duties imposed by section 21 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1888.</P>
    <P>4.  The temporary estate duties imposed by sections 5 and 6 of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act, 1889. </P>
    <P>Those referred to in that Schedule as existing duties refer to existing duties.</P>
    <P>They are, however, made not to be leviable&mdash;and there is a distinction&mdash; in connection with the death of any <Col N="819" /> person dying on or after the appointed day.  So, there is no abolition there.</P>
    <P>Now let us move to subsection (3):</P>
    <P>Legacy duty and succession duty shall not be chargeable on a legacy derived from a testator or intestate dying on or after the appointed day nor on a succession conferred on or after the appointed day nor on any other legacy or succession in so far as the duty would, apart from this section, be payable in connection with any event mentioned in subsection (4) of this section.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that that subsection (3) has some relation to paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the 1894 Act which I have mentioned but there is no need for me to pursue that point.  Again, there is a chance here. It is not to be &ldquo;chargeable&rdquo; is the word used but of course, if your inheritance tax is limited at all&mdash;a thing I dispute&mdash;it is in effect another name for your legacy tax.  If the interpretation which the Minister is putting on it is adopted then the Minister should be logical and say: &ldquo;I am simply imposing legacy duty under the name of inheritance tax.&rdquo; Which-ever way the argument is, it certainly is not the abolition of a death duty. Here I take word by word, section by section, subsection by subsection the alleged abolition in this section and there is no abolition.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) deals with the occasion on which a happening may occur and this has to be related.  We are back on the old roundabout.  If I were to go into the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill the Minister would undoubtedly hop up and say that I am dealing with another Bill.  We can deal with it on that Bill.  The appointed day means 1st April, 1975, which simply makes my point that there is no hiatus whatever.  In the face of that, how can the Minister maintain that death duties are being abolished?  Remember that death duties, as I conceive them, is a general term to cover tax payable on the devaluation of property of a deceased person.  That is a broad, colloquial description of what death duties are. To try to wriggle out of the position <Col N="820" /> that inheritance tax and all the provisions afterwards are not death duties is bad enough but to try to pretend that this section in its own right&mdash;and I am surprised at Deputy Esmonde falling for it&mdash;actually abolishes these taxes is, as I said earlier, less than frank.</P>
    <P>Estate duty, succession duty, legacy duty remain part of our law and remain an active part of our law.  As long as there is an estate pertaining to a deceased before the appointed day mentioned in this section, it is a live issue. It even remains law in theory as it is.</P>
    <P>I am not so unreasonable as to say to the Minister abolish them, do a clean job and abolish estate duty, legacy duty, succession duty.  I can see the morass and the complications that that would involve.  It would not be going too far to ask the Minister to put an honest marginal note to the section and to say &ldquo;abolition of death duties&rdquo;.  Again, as a nice technical answer, death duties are nowhere defined but even if they were not defined as such I can find no abolition of death duties whatever in this section.</P>
    <P>On those three points: on the substance, which I perhaps laboured, I certainly did my best to make clear. On the point of procedure, where the procedure remains the same&mdash;and I am very interested in what the Minister says&mdash;if a grant can be taken before payment on a provisional grant assessment, then there is, I think everybody will agree, an improvement, notwithstanding&mdash;a point I can understand&mdash; that there is a safeguard both in the definition of &ldquo;accountable person&rdquo; and in section 47 which makes it a charge on the property, or will in the new Bill. Nevertheless, the procedures remain essentially the same.  On the legal arguments such as a court may be expected to take cognisance of, which I have attempted to outline here, it is impossible to sustain the case that there is an abolition of death duties.  That is the case I am putting to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Finally, it is a pity that the Minister should have approached the matter in this way because there is much in his Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, the Schedule for instance, the reliefs that are being given, perhaps the revision <Col N="821" /> of procedures, to be commended and much grounds upon which this side of the House could co-operate with the Minister in making that a better Bill and really achieving a reform of the death duties code.  It is easy to promise to think of or to talk about abolition of death duties while not being prepared to get rid of them across the board.  Deputy Belton has dealt with some of that aspect.  If they must remain, then let us face the fact that they must remain but let us do the job honestly and face what is involved. That, in a nutshell, is as I see it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I agree with the views that have been expressed by Deputy de Valera and expressed earlier by Deputy Colley in relation to this section or this purported or alleged abolition of death duties.  The side-note to this section, which is dishonest and blatantly and demonstrably untrue, does not, under our Interpretation Act, form part of the section.  It cannot be taken into account by a court in construing the section.  Nonetheless, because it appears there and also in the index at the beginning of the Bill, it leads people to believe death duties are being abolished.  On two grounds they are not; first of all, on the legal ground and, secondly, from the factual financial point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I might deal briefly with the legal aspect which has been dealt with in detail by Deputy de Valera and with which I need not deal in any great detail.  If the Minister or this House were to provide for the abolition of death duties, there would be a section in this Bill, or more appropriately in one of the Capital Taxation Bills, to the effect that the Finance Act, 1894, and all amendments thereto are hereby repealed with effect in respect of deaths occurring on or after the 1st April, 1975. It might be necessary to put it a little more elaborately than that but that would be the bones of it, if the proposal was to abolish death duties but, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, the proposal is not to abolish death duties.  The proposal is not to levy death duties in respect of deaths on or after the 1st of April, 1975.  It is <Col N="822" /> a very different matter.  It means that the whole corpus of our death duty legislation from 1894, indeed, under subsection (2) here the pre-1894 legislation in so far as it is relevant, remains in existence and part of our law.  An analogy I might make to the House in income tax would be if the Minister for Finance for some reason were to decide that things were very bad in the country and in order to give everyone a bit of a boost he brought in a section in a Finance Bill saying that income tax shall not be leviable for a period of six months from the 1st April, 1975, to whenever it would be.  That would have the effect that people would not pay income tax in that period.  But all the income tax legislation would remain and come back into effect when the six-months' period, or whatever it was, had expired.</P>
    <P>If this section is passed, as presumably it will by people who have no interest whatever in this debate but who merely march in and out occasionally to vote, there is nothing to prevent the Minister coming along next year, or even in a few months' time, and producing a Bill of one section which would say: &ldquo;Section 45 of the Finance Act, 1975 is hereby repealed as and from the 1st of December, 1975.&rdquo; Without more ado, it would mean that the whole corpus of death duty legislation from 1894 onwards would come back into effect because none of it was ever repealed on our statute books and will not be repealed by this section.  The death duty legislation is voluminous.  In fact, it was only the other day I consulted the volume got out by the Revenue Commissioners which contains every unrepealed statutory provision since 1894 and some earlier relevant ones.  It runs to almost 1,000 pages.  It is almost as large as the corresponding volume on income tax. They are the statutory provisions only. In addition, there are hundreds and hundreds of decided cases which stand side by side with the statutory provisions, literally hundreds in Ireland alone apart from relevant ones in Britain.  A genuine, <i>bona fide</i>, abolition of death duties would entail the <Col N="823" /> setting out in a section in this or another Bill, more suitably in another, of a provision repealing all of those things.  I do not think it would be necessary to get them all out individually. I presume it could be expressed in some way, such as that the 1894 Act is repealed and all amendments thereto but that is not done.  There is no attempt whatever to do that; there is no attempt made to repeal or abolish death duties.  What is being done is a non-levying of duty in respect of deaths from 1st April, 1975 onwards.</P>
    <P>In order to bring the whole corpus of death duty legislation back into immediate effect, all that would be necessary would be the repeal of section 45.  If it is proposed permanently to abolish death duties, why not say so?  We are entitled to be suspicious about this, particularly when the side-note to the section is demonstrably untrue, and I think I have shown it to be so.  It is not abolishing death duties.  It says:</P>
    <P>(1)  Estate duty shall not be levied or paid in respect of any property passing or deemed to pass...</P>
    <P>That is on the legal side of it.  There is no question but that what Deputy de Valera and I have said in that respect is correct.</P>
    <P>On the practical side of it, it is fair to suggest that, while death duties may no longer be leviable from the 1st April, 1975, they are replaced by a vast, complex series of taxes which taken as a whole can be no less onerous and, indeed, in many cases, would be far more onerous than what they replace.  Certainly, from the overall, national point of view they have a far more detrimental effect on the economy and country generally than death duties ever had.  Of course, there will be individual people who will be better off but there will be many other people who will be a lot worse off.  Leaving individuals out of it for the moment, it is undeniable&mdash; in the light of what we have seen in the last year or so&mdash;that the total package of four taxes being brought in allegedly to replace death duties, <Col N="824" /> must have a serious effect on the economy as a whole and have been shown already, even before their enactment, to have had that effect, with large sums of capital, by common consent, going out of the country.</P>
    <P>In case anyone would think that the inheritance tax, which is one of the two capital acquisitions taxes, was the only replacement of death duties, it is only right to point out that there are four taxes allegedly replacing it. There is the wealth tax; the capital gains tax; the gift tax and the inheritance tax.  Instead of the death duty system we have had in operation since 1894&mdash;and which I might add it was open to the Minister to amend in any way he wanted over the last two years if he thought it needed amendment; and it would still be open to him to amend it&mdash;and with which everyone is familiar, we have four different, complicated taxes introduced.  I am in no doubt that, from an overall national point of view, death duties would be preferable and far less harmful to the economy than these four taxes introduced in substitution.  In the case of many individuals, they will probably be better off under what is substituted, but an awful lot of other individuals will not.</P>
    <P>One aspect to which I should like to refer&mdash;and which I think has been referred to already, to some extent, by Deputy Colley&mdash;is the question of a whole lot of reliefs which exist at present under the death duties system which apparently, from one's reading of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, will not exist under the new system. An interesting case was brought to my attention in the last few weeks to the effect that under the death duty system succession and legacy duty were payable by the spouse of a beneficiary at the same rate as that which would have been appropriate to the original beneficiary if he had been alive.  In other words, if a testator left property to his daughter-in-law she stood in the same relationship to him for succession and legacy duty purposes as her husband would have had he been alive, and even if he was <Col N="825" /> alive, she stood in the same relationship.</P>
    <P>There are many instances where a testator had one or two children who pre-deceased him and if they were his only children he might wish to leave the property to their spouses, which would be a prudent thing to do. Assuming there are no grandchildren and that the property is left to a son-in-law or to a daughter-in-law, apart from any other taxes that would be payable, the inheritance tax alone would be payable at the rate set out in Table IV of Part II of the Schedule to the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  This would be the rate applicable to strangers in blood.  Assuming the amount of the legacy or the succession was £13,000, the son-in-law or the daughter-in-law will pay inheritance tax at the rate of 25 per cent on that amount.  That is a monstrous imposition on people who would not have to pay anything under the present system.  There are dozens of these examples if one had the time and the inclination to go through them and pick them out.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of the inheritance tax alone <i>vis-à-vis</i> death duties would seem to indicate that the people who will be better off are the spouse of the testator and his children.  It seems to be geared in such a way that extremely rich people will get away without paying any duty because they are able to divide their estates between their immediate family.  If we take the example of a man who is worth £750,000 and assume he is survived by a wife and four children, he can leave the entirety of that sum in slices of £150,000 to his wife and children without the payment of one penny in inheritance tax.  It may be that some of them will become liable for wealth tax or for capital gains tax, in respect of which a death is regarded as a disposition, but payment would not arise so far as inheritance or gift tax is concerned.  In principle it is wrong that somebody is able to pass on £750,000, even though it is to his immediate family, without one penny being taken from him.  On the other hand, a man who tries to pass on £13,000 to his daughter-in-law will find she will have <Col N="826" /> to pay 25 per cent inheritance tax, quite apart from anything else she may have to pay.</P>
    <P>There are many serious anomalies in this package of alternative legislation. There are many other reliefs in relation to death duties and I am not going to go through them all but the majority do not appear to be carried into the alternative capital taxation system now proposed.  There are items such as quick succession relief and special exemptions for certain shares in Irish companies under a number of Finance Acts.  There are many items that do not arise very often but they are there to prevent injustice or unfairness and they were found to be necessary and desirable during the years. The provision for relief for a surviving spouse exists under the death duty system but it does not appear in that form in the alternative package of four new taxes.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary thing about the purported or alleged abolition of death duties and their replacement by four new separate taxes is that the Minister has not told the House or the country what will be the estimated revenue, although he has been dealing with these matters for more than a year.  There have been many guesses about them; at one stage they were to be about the same as death duties, then it seemed they would be less, then more, but it ended up that none of us was given a precise figure.</P>
    <P>The introduction of other taxes in this House&mdash;we dealt with some of them yesterday&mdash;has always entailed giving precise estimates of the increase or decrease in revenue as a result of the change in tax.  For example, we had it yesterday with regard to betting. The Minister was able to tell me to the nearest £1,000, according to himself, what the increase in betting duty will bring in, but he cannot tell us what four new taxes will bring in.  We are asked to make a judgment between what is there at the moment&mdash;we know what the revenue has been in the last few years&mdash;and a radically different situation with four new systems of tax being introduced.  Nobody can honestly make that judgment unless he has the figures.  The Minister cannot honestly make that judgment unless he has the <Col N="827" /> figures.  Perhaps he has them and does not want to give them to us, but when a Minister for Finance is considering changing the law my experience of the Revenue Commissioners is that they are able to tell him extremely quickly how much more would be got in by an increase in tax or how much would be lost by a deduction in tax. Here we have a situation where a whole system of capital taxation is abolished and four new systems are brought in.  It may be difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to judge with their normal preciseness exactly what will be the produce of these four new taxes, but I have no doubt there are many men in the Revenue Commissioners who are able to give, to the nearest million anyway, an intelligent approximation of what the likely revenue from those four sets of new taxes will be.  They must have given such an approximation to the Minister. He has never given it to us. What the reasons for his failure to do that are I do not know.  I can only speculate on them.  It may well be that the Revenue have pointed out to him that the wealth tax, as proposed, is virtually uncollectable and that the cost of collecting it will exceed what will be got in from it and that, in their view, it is, therefore, a futile exercise.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of all those Bills except one has been passed and that is coming near the end.  The Committee Stages of all of them will presumably begin within the next few weeks.  We should be able to see a clear picture as between the old system and the new, but we cannot. We have never been given the figures. We can only guess, and the guess of many of us is that the amount that is likely to be raised by the four new systems of capital taxation will probably be a great deal more than what was raised under the death duties system.  That is fair enough if it is so, but the really damaging aspect of it is that the nature of the taxes is such that they are a disincentive to investment and, irrespective of whatever amount may be got in, we are in the difficulty that we cannot validly make <Col N="828" /> a comparison.  Neither can the Minister validly make a comparison unless he is prepared to tell us what figure it is proposed to raise by this.  If he is just stabbing at this in the dark, if he does not know, I would regard it as a deplorable situation because he does not know what way the thing will end up.  If any Minister for Finance wants to introduce taxation in this House and give no idea what the revenue will be then his whole approach to balancing his budget is one of irresponsibility.  I suppose in these days of deficits of £125 million, £150 million and £180 million that in itself is sufficient proof of irresponsibility and it does not matter a damn if one is £20 million or £40 million wrong one way or the other.  It is all equal nowadays.  It is burned up in inflation anyway.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the alleged abolition of death duties and point out again that it has been clearly demonstrated from this side of the House, and it cannot be contraverted by the Minister, that the only thing that is being done in relation to death duties is not that they are being abolished but that they will not be levied or paid in respect of certain deaths after a certain date.</P>

      <P>It is not at all clear, where there is a settlement prior to 1st April under a will, whether or not succession duty is payable if there are successions arising out of that particular settlement or legacy duty if appropriate.</P>
      <P>No attempt is made to repeal any of our death duty legislation by this section.  Not one line of it is repealed and I defy the Minister to deny that. Still he says he is abolishing it.  Of course he is substituting for it four different systems of taxation.  We do not know what the yield is.  The Minister says he does not know what the yield is.  The Minister cannot validly make a comparison for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any of us can validly make a comparison.  The Minister nonetheless has been brash enough to go around making speeches to Fine Gael clubs or branches or whatever they call them in Rathmines East, <Col N="829" /> North or South or wherever it is, clapping himself on the back about the abolition of death duties and saying that what is being brought in is so much more preferable and fair and equitable.  It is certainly equitable for the man with £750,000 who wants to divide it between his wife and four children.  There is no doubt he is on a winner.  We must be the only country in the world in which somebody with £750,000 can give it all away on death or otherwise and not pay one penny in taxation.  Those people are very well looked after and I congratulate them on their good fortune, but there are many other people who have not the same good fortune under this proposed arrangement and who might feel themselves a great deal better off under the existing system.  What is more important than the cases of individuals here and there, I am in doubt that irrespective of the yield of those four new taxes the country as a whole and the economy of the country would be infinitely better off under the old system of tax with whatever amendments the Minister wanted to make to it.  Let him put up big thresholds, let the taxes start to be payable at £100,000 or £150,000 if that is what he wants, but the old system would not have caused all the problems, all the outcry and all the outflow of capital we have had over the past 12 months with the consequential enormous damage to our economy which was already under severe pressure as a result of a whole series of factors, some external and some internal, under the control of the Government but which they have failed to control.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the situation of particular individuals there is no question that substitution of those four capital taxes has severely damaged the economy, has lessened confidence in the economy and has taken up a great proportion of the time and energy of the officials in the Department of Finance at a time when our economy was rarely in such bad straits and when all the efforts of that Department should be concentrated on trying to get us up off the ground and to get this country going again.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to support what the other speakers on this side have said in the last few hours.  When I first heard that death duties were to be abolished I welcomed it.  We on this side would have done the same thing.  We intended to abolish death duties also.  However, when we see the capital package now put forward by the Minister to replace death duties we question very much the wisdom of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We must look closely at what the Minister is legislating for and at the amount of money that is involved.  If the amount was very large there might be some justification for the legislation but what is in question is an infinitesimal sum in terms of the current budget.  The last figure available for death duties was £13,277,000, or 2.5 per cent of the total budget of two years ago.  Our current budget amounts to £1,200 million and we may assume that death duties would represent about 1 per cent of that amount. That is the sort of money we are talking of in the Bills before the House, Bills that have taken up the entire time of the House practically since Christmas and which are likely to continue to be discussed until the Summer recess.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Both Deputies Colley and de Valera have pointed out that death duties are not being abolished but are being given a different name.  Members of the legal profession can see the implications of these proposals far more clearly than I can see them. I am talking merely about the legislation being put before this House for the sake of £13 million, legislation that has had a damaging effect on the economy already.  If all that was involved was the abolition of death duties we would not have four Bills before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the situation in respect of those who died before 1st April especially in relation to the abatement. On last year's Finance Bill we tabled an amendment seeking an increase in the rate of abatement in respect of both widows and children, but as we all know only about one-quarter of that Bill was discussed and that was at 4 o'clock in the morning. The estates of those who have died during the past 12 months and even up to days before 1st April are being assessed at the old abatement rates. This is totally unfair and requires some adjustment but the adjustment should have been made last year. There is also the problem of inflation in this context.  Down through the years adjustments were effected in <Col N="832" /> regard to the abatements for widows and children.  I note from the Revenue Commissioners' report that at 31st March, 1972 the abatement for a widow was £1,500 and £750 for each child.  In the report for the year ended 31st March, 1973 we note that these figures were increased to £2,000 and £1,000 respectively.  That was keeping in line with inflation which at the time was about 7 or 8 per cent.  The report for the year ended 31st March, 1974 shows that the figures were increased further to £4,000 and £2,000 respectively.  At that time inflation was running at, perhaps, 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners will have to implement this Bill as they find it.  Therefore, widows and children of those who have died during the year up to the 1st April will find themselves in a very unfortunate situation in regard to death duties.  That is why I say that the Minister should bring in an amendment at Report Stage which would increase the abatement figures.  Taking current inflation into account the abatement for a widow should now be £8,000.  A sliding scale should have been introduced last year to bring us towards the abolition of death duties.  It is unfair that if a father died on, say, 31st March this year, his family would be subject to the entire impact of death duties whereas if he died a day later they would be exempt completely.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the case of the father of a family who, on publication of the White Paper last year, transferred half of his property to his wife and children but who died in February this year.  It is my information that his widow and two sons will be caught for death duties.  Such families could be helped either by increasing the abatement rates or by at least making them retrospective to the last Finance Bill.  Although we knew last year that death duties were to be abolished we could see what would be the consequences of not adjusting the abatement rates upwards.  Since then large properties have been sold at high rates due to inflation.  As I have already said, this was very artificial but the facts of inflation are there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> I believe that if the Minister were not abolishing death duties, in this Finance Bill there would be a substantial increase in the abatements. There would have been an adjustment in the abatements last year.  Evidently the Minister decided: &ldquo;We are abolishing death duties and is there any sense in adjusting the abatements at this time?&rdquo; That was a mistake.  If a person died before 1st April, 1975, the White Paper makes no difference to his family.  The Minister might consider bringing in an amendment on Report Stage to increase the abatement for the widow and children.</P>
    <P>Under the present abatement a widow with no children is allowed £25,500.  That is roughly the amount of property which is exempt today for a widow with no children.  This would hardly buy a private house today, not to speak of a business.  That figure may have been of some value four or five years ago.  You could not purchase a huckster's shop or a grocer's shop for that figure today.  A widow with one child can inherit property to the value of £32,333 and in the case of a widow with four children the figure goes up to £46,200. These figures are of no significance with inflation running at from 18 to 20 per cent last year and projected to run at 25 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would cost the Revenue Commissioners very much if the abatements were increased.  Many assessments have not yet been made. No assessment has been made in the case of people who died five or six months ago.  Their families are anxious to see will the Minister do anything for them in this Finance Bill.  The families of people who died since the White Paper was issued should be no worse off than they will be under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  I hope the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners will give a sympathetic hearing to the point I am raising and see the merit in it.</P>
    <P>By and large we welcomed the fact that death duties were to be abolished. I have always said in this House that they were a most unjust form of taxation. They were a burden on a family at a time of greatest weakness, after the father had died.  The widow had <Col N="834" /> to find a substantial amount of money to pay death duties.  We would welcome the abolition of death duties if it were carried out as we thought it would be.  When the Minister promised that death duties would be abolished, many people sincerely thought they would be exempt from the new duties which the Minister introduced.  They had no idea that new taxes like inheritance tax, or gift tax, would be introduced.</P>
    <P>If we were abolishing death duties we would never dream of bringing in such complex legislation.  It could have been done in a compact Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill which would have avoided all this confusion.  The Minister says the new taxes will not bring in more than the figure quoted of £13 million.  I am quite sure the Revenue Commissioners are capable of devising a simple Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill which would carry out the same reforms as the Minister is trying to carry out in four elaborate Bills.  These Bills will create an additional amount of work for the Revenue Commissioners. I doubt that they will be able to implement them.</P>
    <P>The estimated cost of the collection of £13 million in death duties was £288,000.  That is the latest available figure and it applies to 1972-73.  That is a very large figure.  When these four new Bills have been on the Statute Book for five years, I should like to know how much it will cost to collect £13 million?  I doubt that it will be collected for £288,000.  When you are introducing legislation you must be pragmatic.  There are two ways of doing everything: a simple way and a complicated way.  The Minister has opted for the most complicated way of all.</P>
    <P>The majority of the people do not understand these four Bills.  Many people here do not understand their full significance.  They have bogged down the business of this House.  There are many important pieces of legislation to come before the House.  There are many Estimates to be discussed.  It would be far more important to us, and far more beneficial for the country, if we were discussing an economic policy to get us out of our present situation, or if the Minister brought in <Col N="835" /> a policy document on how we can solve our economic and unemployment problems. At this time when the economy is sagging, when we have mass unemployment, when we need a positive approach to boost the economy and to get an injection of capital, the Minister brings in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central</i>): It is very difficult to separate the other taxation Bills from the one before the House.  With the economy sagging the Minister should not have brought in all these Bills.  There are numerous families throughout the country whose estates have not yet been assessed.  If people who died within the past three weeks had lived for another three or four days, their families would have avoided having to pay death duties.  The Minister should increase the abatements retrospectively. In all fairness, the relatives of people who died within the past 12 months should be no worse off than if they had to pay capital acquisitions tax.  I would like the Minister to consider one of those two proposals.  There is an obligation on him to do something about the people who are subject to death duties for the past 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make an appeal to the Minister on the lines on which Deputy Fitzpatrick has made one.  Is there any possibility of having retrospection for those people who are hard hit because somebody belonging to them died at the wrong time? I know of cases where increased value, because of inflation, has been put on farms.  Everybody knows what happened last winter. I know of a case where the father died at the end of 1973.  That place was in debt during almost all that man's life until his son cleared the debt before his father died.  There was no debt on the place at the time that man died.  The duty on that small farm was assessed at over £4,000, which was completely out of reach of the person to pay.  The result is that the place is left there.  If there <Col N="836" /> are any taxes put on that person during his lifetime he will have to pay them but he is not getting anything from the removal of death duties because his father did not live until the 1st April, 1975.</P>
      <P>A lot of people have come to me pleading that something be done in regard to the hardship cases.  One might say: &ldquo;Why not go back ten years?&rdquo; At that time the price of land was very low.  Inflation only occurred during the last five years. Owing to it the value put on farms of land is completely out of proportion. Those are the people who have left their places idle.  The Revenue Commissioners will never be able to collect the money.  I think what Deputy Fitzpatrick brought up is very relevant throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can easily understand the feelings of people who have been affected by the hard luck of one of their next-of-kin dying before the 1st April, 1975.  There will always be disappointed people on the wrong side of the divide no matter what the cut-off date is.  Were it possible, which it really is not, to push the date back to some earlier date you would simply generate another group of disappointed people who would be just on the wrong side of the earlier date. If it was the 1st April, 1974, rather than 1975 and you had next-of-kin who died in March, 1974, they would be disappointed because they are beaten by a matter of days.</P>
      <P>We have now arrived at the point of merciful deliverance in which the vast majority of people will not be called to pay any tax as a consequence of property passing on death. That is something for which we can all be grateful.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick underlined the fact that the section we are dealing with abolishes death duties when he spoke about the hard luck of somebody whose next-of-kin died in the week immediately preceding the 1st April who, if he had survived would not have created the liability to tax.  That liability is gone as a result of this section.  It is that consequence which matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the fact that any <Col N="837" /> change would simply generate a new group of disappointed people there are many cases of death occurring in the last year where estate duty has already been paid and the estates administered. In the majority of cases that is so.  In the vast majority of cases estate duty is assessed and paid within three or four months of death. There would be great difficulty in handling such cases and making repayment to them even if it was considered to be the proper thing to do. We simply have to face the fact that there are bound to be disappointed people, whatever the new moment of relief may be.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the date was not earlier. It could not have been earlier because time was required to draft the new body of capital taxation, which was necessary to avoid situations arising where massive possessions of wealth in this country would not pay any tax at all.  Time had to elapse in order to enable the legislation to be prepared, to enable, first of all, the White Paper to be drafted and discussed and for consultations to take place on foot of that White Paper. Time was asked for by the people who felt they might be affected and time was given, so it is hardly fair now to say that the State was wrong not to move faster.  Even now, when I am endeavouring, as best I can, to bring the discussion to a finality, to have the Bill discussed relevantly and as expeditiously as possible, in order that uncertainty may be removed&mdash; that is something that is called for by people on all sides&mdash;I am being accused of trying to rush things through.</P>
    <P>Goodness knows since 28th February, 1974 the Government's detailed proposals have been on the Table.  In so far as there have been changes since then they have been mainly for the benefit of the taxpayers. I suggest we concentrate our time now on relevant discussion without any emotion, without any repetitious charges of the kind that have been made and in that way together we can produce the best job for the country. I appeal to the House at this stage to pass this section and let us proceed <Col N="838" /> to the conclusion of this Finance Bill, which has been discussed in Committee on more days than any Bill since 1970.  I have only figures since 1970 and this is already our sixth day on the Committee Stage.  In those circumstances I suggest, with respect to all Deputies, that now is the time to move on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very touching to hear the Minister appealing for our co-operation.  As he knows there has been no filibuster on this Bill but it has got a detailed examination and will continue to get it.  If, when he and his colleagues were in Opposition, they did not do their job, he need not blame us for that.  I repeat there is no filibuster on this Bill nor will there be on any of those capital taxation measures.  The Minister would have ensured a much speedier passage, particularly for this section, if he had not tried to use it as a device to get him out of the political difficulty in which he found himself, having promised to abolish death duties and finding he could not do it.</P>
      <P>I will not go back over all that ground again, but I will not allow the Minister's glib statement to go on the record uncontradicted.  That is the situation.  The Minister would have got a much faster passage for a section having the same effect if he was not guilty of putting a misleading explanatory note on the margin, of putting it into this Bill instead of where it should be and trying to restrict us in dealing with it in its context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick put a case to the Minister which is extremely reasonable.  I adverted to it briefly earlier today and Deputy Callanan gave his experience of the need for this case being met.  Deputy Fitzpatrick put forward two possible ways of approaching this.  I do not think the Minister has indicated that either of them is impossible.  The first one Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested was in the case of estates of persons who died subsequent to the publication of the White Paper the treatment should be the same as for those coming under the inheritance tax.  There are arguments <Col N="839" /> for and against this but it is a tenable case.  There is a clear date available on which liability for new tax, gift tax, was imposed and when there is a date on which a tax is being imposed it is a date on which one can stand to apply reliefs.  I do not think there is an impossible difficulty there for the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister finds it impossible to do that or if he is unwilling to do it I do not think there is any answer at all to the course suggested by Deputy Fitzpatrick which was that the abatements for widows and children ought to be stepped up in the way they would have been stepped up if the Minister had not been introducing inheritance tax.  I assume that if the Minister had not been introducing inheritance tax he would have stepped up those abatements having regard to the level of inflation today.  That is a reasonable assumption.  There is no good reason that I can see and I do not think the Minister has attempted to put forward any reason, good or bad, as to why at least an adjustment in line with inflation as a minimum should not be applied to the exemption limits.  I urge the Minister to accept that proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I omitted to refer to the fact that the Minister stated that in a number of cases duty has been paid and such provision would entail repayment.  That is true but the Minister knows well that that is not insuperable.  That is within the competence of the Revenue Commissioners and of those personal representatives who might be in receipt of these repayments and making the necessary distribution in accordance with their duty.  There is no great problem involved and I suggest to the Minister that plain basic justice, in line with the terrible level of inflation, would require as a minimum that he adjust those exemption limits at least in line with inflation for the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand it, the only real <Col N="840" /> argument the Minister has put against it is that it would present some administrative difficulties.  I am putting it to the Minister that those administrative difficulties are not major and are certainly not sufficient to justify omitting to do this, something that presumably he would have done if he had not been introducing the inheritance tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): As regards the adjustment of the abatement which should have been brought in in last year's Finance Bill it was negligent on the part of the Minister that it was not brought <Col N="842" /> in.  Surely the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister were aware the way inflation was going then.  It was a terrible omission.  I am not playing politics but there are families who are badly affected by death duties because the abatements were not adjusted. I do not think the administration with regard to repayments would cause a great problem to the Minister but it would be beneficial to unfortunate widows and children who are trying to find the money to pay death duties on estates of those who died in the last 12 months.  This could cost very little.  The Minister will be helping the weaker sections of the community, those with estates valued at £40,000 to £100,000 which is not excessive by present standards.</P>
      <P>The relatives of those who died only days before the appointed date will be severely hit by the full impact of the old law.  Before Report Stage the Minister should endeavour to provide some relief for those I have mentioned.  There is room for flexibility here and the Minister would be making himself very popular by adopting our suggestion.  A lot of people are not in a position to pay the duty with the value put on the estate in these days of high inflation.  Adjustments were made in 1971, 1972 and 1973 but inflation then was only running at 7 or 8 per cent.  The position today is different.  One would not need to have a very big business for it to be valued at £60,000 or £70,000. A widow with one child would be subject to a considerable amount of death duties at the present rate of abatement and in most cases she cannot find that money.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that small businesses find it practically impossible to make ends meet today.  That is one of the reasons why we have always favoured the abolition of death duties.  Here we find that the Minister is not prepared to make any upward adjustment of abatements.  I would ask the Minister to show some leniency.  It will not cost the Exchequer a great amount of money. It is feasible and can be implemented.</P>

      <P>There is one question I would like to ask the Minister. <Col N="843" /> It is clear from the discussion that so far as any estate resulting from a death before 1st April, 1975, is concerned, death duties have not been abolished.  They are there for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I want to pursue one further point with the Minister in regard to the abolition of death duties, by whatever name.  Take the case of a childless widow inheriting £300,000 on a death happening after 1st April, 1975.  In addition to being sole successor she is also the sole legatee under the testator's will.  In other words, she is in sole entitlement.  In that case an Inland Revenue affidavit will be issued in due course.  Will grant of probate issue and the administration be complete before the estate is vested in her?  The grant of probate has to be issued before the estate is vested in her but will any tax be payable before the grant of probate in her case?</P>

      <P>It is as to whether death duties are being abolished or not.  On the Minister's own argument it is very relevant to the Bill.  At the present moment the Inland Revenue affidavit and the provisional grant assessment with the necessary receipt endorsed on the appropriate document are primary documents which are requisite before the grant can be issued.  If the Minister, as I think is fair, may construe his new provisions as meaning that there is no assessment, therefore, no duty payable <Col N="845" /> before the gift or the legacy or the inheritance is vested in possession in the person beneficially entitled, that, of course, obviously postpones the Revenue Commissioners' right to collect and the Revenue Commissioners will be, so to speak, out of their money for that time.

      <P>There is another matter that I want to raise on this section. The Minister will recall that I put down a question to him in this House on 30th January last in regard to a newspaper article which had appeared concerning the principal value of property passing on death and I asked him to make a statement.  Basically, this problem was concerned with the fact that when certain deaths took place stocks and shares were highly valued and the estate was valued as at the date of death but when it came to payment of duty in some cases the stocks and shares were worth half or less than their valuation as at the date of death so that the amount of money available to the whole estate was half or in some cases less, out of which duty assessed on the much larger value at the date of death was to be paid. Considerable hardship did ensue from this in some cases.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his reply used the following sentence:</P>
      <P>I am, however, having all aspects of the matter examined as sympathetically as possible to see how cases of undoubted hardship can best be dealt with.</P>
      <P>There were supplementary questions and answers but that was the kernel of what was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 13th February, I put a question to the Minister asking him if in view of the urgent necessity for immediate action in the cases of undoubted hardship <Col N="846" /> referred to by him in the reply of 30th January he would state the action he proposed to take in the matter.  His Parliamentary Secretary replying on behalf of the Minister indicated that it was proposed in such cases where duty had not yet been paid and where the Revenue Commissioners thought it desirable, that they would permit payment of duty to be postponed until there was a recovery of stock market prices to a level where there would be alleviation of the hardship.</P>
    <P>On 9th April I put a further question to the Minister asking him ... the steps he proposed to take to alleviate the hardship arising in the cases referred to by him in a reply of 30th January, 1975 in which death duties had actually been paid.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    <P>Neither the Revenue Commissioners nor the Minister for Finance have any authority to repay death duties which have been properly paid in accordance with the relevant Acts of the Oireachtas...</P>
    <P>In effect, what the Minister was saying was that there were cases of undoubted hardship.  Where duty had not been paid he was going to take steps to postpone payment of duty until the value of the stocks recovered.  Where duty had been paid, neither he nor the Revenue Commissioners had any authority to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I put down an amendment to this section to deal with this situation and it was ruled out of order, correctly, because it could involve a charge on the Exchequer.  While it may be technically out of order on those grounds, I would suggest that the point at issue is quite relevant to the situation.  It would be open to the Minister, if he wished, to amend this section in order to obtain the statutory authority to deal with this problem in cases where duty had been paid.  I have indicated broadly in the amendment I put down how it might be approached.  The Minister will be aware that this problem has been adverted to and dealt with in legislation in Britain where the same problem arose and where a specific statutory provision was made. I want to ask the Minister now if he <Col N="847" /> is prepared to make statutory provision for such cases and, if not, why not?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot presume to be able to correct in a short time all the deficiencies of the past.  There is another side to the argument advanced by Deputy Colley.  Many people were fortunate enough in that the person from whom they received an estate died at a time when the stock market was valuing stocks at a very low figure.  As a consequence the estate duty was correspondingly less than it would have been had the stock market not been in such a poor state.  If concession is to be introduced for people who lost because the stock market fell after the date of death, then it could be argued that to balance the position provision should be made to collect a higher tax from people who were fortunate enough in that the value of their assets increased after the date of death.  I think the Deputy will see that the pendulum can swing either way.  I think reasonable people would not accept that the only loser in any swing should be the Revenue.  The Revenue Commissioners have exercised the power they possess to allow postponement of estate duty in cases where people ask to have payment deferred so as to allow the possibility of an improvement in the value of assets.  Any people who exercised that a few months ago are in the happy position of being able to sell their stocks today at a price greatly enhanced over what it was at the beginning of the year. The law does not permit a refund to be made where people do not avail of the right to obtain postponement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For several months past we have heard loud complaints about the complexity of all the changes in the law the Government are enacting.  But if all the anomalies and difficulties of antique legislation were to be rectified by appropriate measures, then the Finance Bill and all the other Bills would be of immeasurably greater length.  Therefore, once again, we have to count the minuses and pluses in relation to any proposals.  I am afraid that the reality is that the pluses indicate that the proper thing <Col N="848" /> to do is to abolish death duties altogether, with all their inevitable anomalies, and proceed to a system of capital taxation suited to the needs of the modern day and age.</P>
    <P>Let me say also that, perhaps, some of the annoyance felt and difficulties experienced by people in regard to death duties today might not be so great had not Deputy Colley increased the rates of estate duty as recently as 1971 when the upper rates were increased.  At that time the upper rates operated from £55,000 upwards. For instance, an estate which previously was taxed to duty at 30 per cent was increased to 33 per cent, 40 per cent was increased to 45 per cent.  At the lower range of £100,000 and, at £250,000 the rate was increased from 40 per cent to 55 per cent.  That was four years ago only.  In that light some of the cases being pressed on me here to rectify all the failures of the past are somewhat unreasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat difficult to restrain oneself when listening to the Minister for Finance who a short time ago was appealing to us to deal precisely with the section, to co-operate and get on with this Bill and then listen to the nonsense to which we have just listened&mdash;red herrings about all the anomalies in the death duties system, the increases which were made in liabilities in 1971 and other such nonsense.  The fact of the matter is that this matter has become a problem in the last 18 months or two years only at the outside while the present Minister for Finance held that office.  That is the first point.  The second point is that I quoted the Minister himself as saying that there are cases of undoubted hardship.  Therefore, that is not in dispute.  The third point is that the Minister, on being pressed by me, in parliamentary questions, did take some steps to alleviate the position of people who have not paid duty.  The point I am putting to the Minister is that, in the case of people who had paid the duty, there is in many cases at least as much hardship as in the cases where it has not been paid and where he has taken some remedial action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> I do not see why we have to go round in circles on this matter and why the Minister cannot deal precisely with the point at issue, which is: is he prepared to give relief and, if not, why not?  One of the reasons he said he was not prepared to do so was that he could not remedy all the defects in the death duties system.  Nobody is asking him to do that.  He said that the abolition of death duties&mdash;I am quoting him now&mdash;from 1st April was really the only way to approach this.  The Minister knows very well that is totally irrelevant in the cases involved here. One can abolish death duties by repealing the statutes and so on, as we have told the Minister he should be doing if he wants to abolish death duties, and still not make the slightest difference to the cases about which I am speaking. I rather think the Minister knows that.  If he does not, it is somewhat disappointing to be trying to argue with him and, if he does, he should not be wasting our time while he is urging us to get on with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister say clearly and unequivocally if he is not prepared to do it, that he is not and why he is not for reasons relevant to the issue.  Would the Minister indicate why it is he finds it possible in a great deal of the legislation he has brought before this House to imitate, almost comma for comma, legislation in Britain but he is not prepared to imitate the legislation in Britain on this issue where, apparently, his opposite number was able to resist the temptation of saying: &ldquo;Well, if there is to be any benefit to the taxpayer, where there is a case of undoubted hardship, there will have to be a corresponding chance of benefit to the Exchequer.&rdquo;  His opposite number was able to resist that.  I would suggest that the Minister resist it and look at the facts of the situation where, as he said himself, there are cases of undoubted hardship.  Would he please exercise the authority he has to apply some remedy in respect of these cases of undoubted hardship?  He can do it, we cannot.  I tried to do it in this amendment but it was ruled out of order for the reasons I mentioned.  Let us not go round in circles on a lot of other irrelevant <Col N="850" /> issues.  Is the Minister prepared to try to remedy these cases of undoubted hardship?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Government to tell the truth to the people.  Since they came into office they have concealed the truth about unemployment.  The people should be told the facts so that they can appreciate the extent of the problem.  It is only when we know the extent of the problem that we can tackle it in a comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>On 6th November, 1974, in reply to a motion on employment policy put down in my name, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" /> ... I was disappointed with Deputy Dowling's speech.  I can understand, especially at by-election time, with all the ammunition that the economic situation gives him, Deputy Dowling's desire to pump the Government. However, I think it is dangerous at a time like this when that desire to throw political stones passes over into irresponsibility....</P>
    <P>What I said on that occasion was that the numbers on the live register would reach 100,000 early in 1975.  That is what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said was irresponsible. These were the facts as seen by us at the time.  As I stated yesterday, there are approximately 103,000 people unemployed.  I have substantiated the figures I gave.</P>
    <P>I ask the trade union movement why they have been so silent in the last two years.  I call on the unions to throw off their shackles, to let the buttonhole trade unionists in the Government know their feelings in relation to the unemployment situation and the distress caused to family life. The real situation has been concealed by Ministers who claim it is irresponsible to forecast with the best available information.  We have heard many statements from them; we heard about the 14-point plan and the variety of plans.  We heard the Minister for Finance tell the House that they had no policy or plans.  At column 16 of the Official Report dated 26th November, 1974, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I indicated in my budget statement of 3rd April last that the Government had decided that it would not be possible to publish a meaningful development programme for the years ahead in the light of the unsettled word situation.</P>
    <P>The unemployed have nothing to look forward to because the Government have no policy or plans.  When the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was asked where labels for his Department had been printed we were told they were printed in England.  This is happening while Irishmen are tramping the streets looking for work.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="852" /> for Social Welfare told us 25,000 are living below the poverty line but yet the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs gets labels printed in England. Some time ago he got the approval of the House to increase the vote for his Department to £175 million.  He is the largest employer in the country and a considerable amount of money has been made available to him but nevertheless there has been a substantial cut-back in the number employed in his Department.  Overtime has been reduced notwithstanding the fact that there is an enormous demand for telephones and other services.  Why are the Labour Party so silent?  Is this what Deputy Desmond and his colleagues mean by &ldquo;Socialism in the Seventies&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We are entitled to know the true facts about unemployment so that realistic steps may be taken.  No doubt the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce will criticise this motion.  The only unfortunate thing about it is that it may be too late to do anything.  Deputy Desmond's colleagues indicated to the workers before the election that they were the same as the workers.  Where are they now?  The wives of the workers are forced to go from shop to shop in an effort to get the best value from the last penny because they are down to their last penny. Last night the Minister for Finance was down to his last penny on the slot machines.  In my constituency many factories are closing and this applies to the Minister for Finance and to Deputy Desmond&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The kind of rhetoric we have heard is not likely to provide one more job, nor will it solve the serious unemployment situation. I wish to make three comments. First, I shall deal with the trends of employment and unemployment because unless both sides of the House understand what is happening in relation to employment in particular industries we will not produce any constructive solutions.  Secondly, I propose to comment on aspects of the live register and the various statistics that are trotted out in relation to the figure of 102,000 people.  It is important that we do not talk ourselves into a crisis or into the kind of situation that existed in 1957 when I could not get a job, and talk ourselves into a situation in which we could lose national confidence.  There is no need for the kind of rhetoric we have heard in this debate.  I exempt Deputy Fitzgerald from that stricture.  He endeavoured to be as constructive as possible, bearing in mind that he is in Opposition.</P>
      <P>I propose to comment on what the Government are doing and intend to do in relation to this matter.  As one who has taken a deep personal interest in employment, unemployment and industrial development, I believe that we are now at a plateau and are beginning to come off it.  I would think that by the end of 1975, by the third quarter, we will see it well and truly levelled out.  I would not be that optimistic about substantial reductions in unemployment in 1975 but by the first quarter of 1976 I believe we will see a substantial downturn in the unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures are illuminating.  Employment in the transportable goods industries, and these are a barometer in many ways, rose by 1 per cent on average in 1974.  The rate of increase decelerated progressively over the year and by December last the number at work in those industries was over 1½ per cent lower than in mid-December, 1973.  In other words, the crisis point and the really critical <Col N="854" /> quarter was the last quarter of 1974. There was an increase in employment in the first quarter of 1974 as compared with 1973.  It went up by 7,300.  In the second quarter it went up by 4,100.  In the third quarter it went up by nearly 2,000 but in the fourth quarter of 1974 there was a drop of 3,700.  Therefore, the average increase over the year was only 2,100 or 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Employment in the private sector of the building industry rose by a ½ per cent in 1974.  Total employment at the end of 1974 may have been up to 10,000 lower in the transportable goods industries than at the beginning of the year.  To make a division of the 10,000, we would estimate roughly 5,000 on the industrial side and 5,000 on the agricultural side.  It is important to bear that analysis of the live register in mind.  While all sectors have suffered from rising unemployment in 1974 transportable goods industries suffered by far the largest increase in unemployment.  However, we must look at a few sectors.</P>
    <P>The industries I would be particularly worried about are the skins and leather industries where unemployment in the 1974 period was up by 1,300, textiles where it was up by 3,500 roughly, metal manufacturing and engineering where it was up by 3,900, bricks and artificial building materials up by 480, clothing up by 2,700, vehicles up by 1,500, paper-making up by 600.  If we in Government can mount successful rescue operations and maintain employment in the industries I have mentioned we will get to grips with the problem in no uncertain terms.</P>
    <P>There has also been a disturbing trend in unemployment in the services sector, particularly in the distributive trades.  This gives grounds for worry. There are 2,200 fewer people in the distributive trade and I would suggest that it is not so much unemployment arising from the economic situation but a whole transformation which is occurring in the distributive sector with the growth of supermarkets and the decline in casual employment.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of hooha by some spokesmen on the live <Col N="855" /> register.  They just baldly take the the figure of 103,000, 104,000 or 102,000 and say: &ldquo;That is unemployment.&rdquo; It is a bit more complicated than that.  I have always regarded the live register as a reasonably reliable guide to trends in unemployment but even in Opposition I have had reservations about it.  Its value as an indicator of the absolute level of unemployment is very much open to question.  I would urge the Opposition to have a look at the live register and to carefully consider it.  The live register covers certain categories of workers who cannot be regarded as unemployed in the generally accepted sense of that word, namely, persons who are available to work on a full-time unrestricted basis.  On the live register there are people aged 65 and over. Sixty-five is generally regarded as being retiring age.  There are at present 2,600 such people on the register.  They can hardly be regarded as unemployed.  There are 12,200 farmers and farmers' relatives assisting on the live register.  It is doubtful if the majority of those people would be available for full-time work.  That is a total of something like 14,500 people.</P>
    <P>Short-time workers are included. In all the European countries short-time workers are segregated from those who are considered to be unemployed. At present there are 7,500 persons on the register who are on short-time work.  They are people on a four-day or a three-day week plus unemployment benefit, usually pay-related benefit.  Their earnings, by and large, are maintained.  Those workers are not unemployed.  They are employed by an employer on three days a week but they are on the live register. The Fianna Fáil Party have trotted out the figure of 102,000 persons and they have baldly stated that they are unemployed.  If we deduct the categories I have mentioned the more correct figure for the absolute level of unemployment is in the region of 8,000.  I have taken out those aged 65 and over and the farmers and farmers' relatives assisting. Deputy Fitzgerald cannot seriously suggest that a small farmer who is <Col N="856" /> collecting dole is an unemployed person.</P>

      <P>Included in the 80,000 are a substantial number&mdash;I would suggest 10 per cent&mdash;who, by virtue of physical infirmity or by virtue of being classified generally as being unemployable are not at work. It is accepted in the western European sense of the examination of any unemployment statistics that one takes about 10 per cent of the live register figure as being in the latter categories. I agree with Deputy Dowling that school leavers are not included. They should be included.  Perhaps there are 2,000 or 3,000 school leavers who are unemployed but this figure will be much higher in about September next, because more of these people will have become available for full-time employment.  It is dangerous to trot out a figure of 100,000 as being unemployed.  This results in investors, employers and industrial workers being scared.  To talk in these terms is to talk one's self into a crisis situation.</P>

      <P>There are a number of factors which must be taken into account.  There is no doubt that from 1st April the stimulatory effects of the budget increases in social welfare were reflected in the economy.  The escalator clause in the national pay agreement will benefit the economy by the second or third quarter of this year.  Also, the revival of world trading conditions, and the decisions taken by America will result in a levelling off of our unemployment situation by the third quarter <Col N="858" /> of 1975.  I am confident also that the stimulated world demand now becoming evident, as was reflected in the shares index on the London Stock Exchange in the past couple of weeks, will assist considerably the improvement of the employment situation by the third quarter of 1975 and that by the first quarter of 1976 there will be a halt in unemployment.  We must take into account the lags involved between the changes in demand and the effect of these changes on unemployment. The Fianna Fáil denunciations will get us nowhere.  What we must do is consider what constructive action we can take in industry.</P>

      <P>In that context I might draw attention to the public capital programme of the Government which, also, has been a major stimulatory factor in ensuring that unemployment does not rise beyond its present level.  We have provided £42,500,000 for the IDA and they intend approving for grant assistance this year projects with an employment potential of no fewer than 22,000 jobs at full production.  I accept the word of that very fine public servant, Mr. Michael Killeen, in this regard.  I do not think anybody would accuse the IDA of speaking in a political or partisan fashion in their projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the western region, an area where employment must be maintained effectively, we are providing an additional £2.138 million to finance the industrial development activities of SFADCo.  We are providing £3 million for Córas Tráchtála to finance their activities in the promotion of Irish exports and in the development of new overseas markets for Irish goods.  In addition, we are providing £3 million extra for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. All of these moneys will help to stimulate and to ensure that the expertise and skills of the country will be put to the best possible use.  There are 40,000 workers, trade union members, in Irish industries that are exporting <Col N="859" /> to Britain, to the Continent, to America and to many other parts of the world.  These workers are producing Irish goods and are doing a very good job.</P>

      <P>In addition to the agencies I have mentioned, we also have an exceptionally competent public agency created by the Fianna Fáil Party and congratulations to them.  It is now carrying out essential work for this Administration.  I refer to Fóir Teoranta.  This company is financed entirely by the Exchequer.  In the current year it has approved loans totalling £3.7 million involving the employment of no fewer than 5,800 workers. That kind of stimulus has been of major benefit to the economy in ensuring the stabilisation of Government expenditure to ensure that national investment policies are effectively maintained during the current crisis.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the Minister for Finance wishes to speak after the next Fianna Fáil speaker. Both sides of the House should not panic each other into an economic crisis situation.  We have now reached the plateau.  By the third quarter of 1975 we will begin to slip back and <Col N="861" /> the expansion will come in the first quarter of 1976.  Despite some advice we got from the Central Bank, we have maintained a reasonably inflationary and expansionary budgetary strategy.  Foreign borrowings are not the most desirable types of development.</P>
      <P>We have borrowed something in the region of 50 per cent of the 1975 public capital programme.  We have borrowed the best part of £225 million, and that is some borrowing to keep ourselves going.  We are surviving. We will not fall into the trap of just sitting back and waiting for events to overwhelm us.  We have taken action.  The Minister for Finance has acted in a courageous manner.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the first thing I should do is sympathise with Deputy Desmond on the role he had to play in defending the unemployment situation.  I realise this was a difficult task for him.  He did his best <Col N="862" /> to try to put a good face on the unemployment situation.  No matter how he tries to dress down this figure of 102,000 unemployed, the fact remains that there is a crisis.  Deputy Desmond said he hoped he would have a realistic debate.  I was hoping that we would hear something realistic from the Government side of the House and that some hope would be held out for the 102,444 people who are on the dole.  No matter how Deputy Desmond or anybody else tries to minimise this problem, or tries to take away certain categories of people from the unemployment figure, the fact remains that the live register shows a figure of over 102,000.  Deputy Desmond mentioned the small farmers and said that they could not be described as unemployed persons.  The same qualifications for receipt of unemployment assistance apply in the case of a small farmer as in the case of any other worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true.  In order to qualify for unemployment assistance the small farmer has to be capable of and available for employment at any time.  Those are the two conditions.  The same conditions apply to every other worker.  If those two conditions are not fulfilled the small farmer does not get unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of school leavers are not included in that figure on the live register, or professional people who are unable to find employment, or part-time workers.  This could add possibly 30,000 more to the figure I have quoted.  Therefore, we see there is a real crisis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know, too, that unemployment has been a remarkable feature of Coalition Governments here.  When the last Coalition left office we had something in the region of 100,000 <Col N="863" /> unemployed.  At that time there was another outlet, emigration.  A large number of young Irish boys and girls were seeking employment in foreign countries.  Happily today the emigration figure has subsided and our young people no longer have to emigrate to Great Britain or the United States which they had to do during the last period of Coalition Government. When the Coalition ran away from their responsibilities this was the legacy they left behind them.  Fianna Fáil had to come back and start to build up the economy.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the same thing may happen on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Labour said that the Government's response to the present position was positive, concrete and realistic but there was nothing positive, concrete or realistic in what he said.  I hope that the other Ministers who will speak in this debate this evening will have something more positive to offer to the people who are seeking employment.  We had hoped that we would hear some plans from the Minister for Labour since he is the Minister primarily responsible for the labour situation, but unfortunately we did not.</P>
    <P>The present level of unemployment of more than 102,000 represents an appalling indictment of the Government, an indictment which is made all the more serious by the fact that there is no prospect of an early improvement. From what we have heard from the Minister for Labour, there is no evidence that the Government will take any action to remedy this situation.</P>
    <P>Minister have been telling us that increased unemployment can be attributed to the international setback resulting from the oil crisis, but this is not altogether true.  Even the Central Bank in its recent report demonstrates that this is not true.  Inflation and price increases have been the main contributing factors to this unemployment problem.  In Ireland, unhappily, the disease of inflation is progressing. The average annual rate of price increase has moved up from 3 per cent in the 1960s to 8 per cent in <Col N="864" /> 1970, 11 per cent in 1973, 17 per cent for 1974 with the frightening prospect of it being in the neighbourhood of 25 per cent in 1975.  If corrective action is not taken immediately Irish producers will become uncompetitive in the home and foreign markets, thereby creating further unemployment and industrial unrest.</P>
    <P>We cannot hope to attract foreign industrialists to set up in this country if this is the prospect that awaits them. During the Fianna Fáil term in office every effort was made by the Government and various agencies such as the IDA to attract investment to the country.  We see many of those industries today happily giving good employment and proving beyond any shadow of doubt that it was worth the effort put in by the Government to attract them here.  One of those industries is Digital, which set up in the industrial estate in Galway and is today giving good employment to over 600 people with prospects for further expansion in the near future.  We realise there have been failures, but by and large the number is very small. Since this recession began the level of industrial inquiries has been reduced mainly because of the uncertain economic situation in the country.</P>
    <P>The Government have a duty to help in the establishment of new industries by providing the infrastructure or providing the money to local authorities for this purpose.  We realise how difficult it can be for local authorities to acquire industrial sites and the long delays involved in their acquisition.  Local communities should be encouraged to keep their towns tidy and incentives should be provided by the Department of Local Government for this particular purpose. Tidy towns are most important in any effort to attract foreign industry. A good telephone service and a good water supply are also most essential.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what has happened to the plan introduced by Fianna Fáil some years ago to provide advanced factories in rural areas. How many of those factories have been erected since the present Government took office or are any new <Col N="865" /> factories planned?  This was a very laudable development by Fianna Fáil and it gave a ray of hope to many small towns, particularly in the West of Ireland.  In Ballygar and Mountbellew in my constituency two of those advance factories have been established.  This has been a great boost to the people in those areas. It has given valuable employment and is something which can be extended. I hope the Government have not forgotten about this particular scheme. I hope they will develop it and ensure that other small towns, which have the labour force and the industrial sites available and are anxious to provide the right infrastructure for industry, will not be let down and told there is no money available for this type of project.</P>
    <P>In many constituency approximately 70 per cent of the work force in Galway city have to commute there daily.  Some of them have to travel distances of 40 and 50 miles.  This is a great hardship on them.  We have only to consider the cost of having to travel that distance to work daily, consider what it costs to run a car for a week, a month or a year and what it costs to buy petrol for that car at the present terrible prices.  Those workers are getting no help from the Government or anybody else.  They have to pay income tax and get no concessions for the long hours they are travelling.  The Government, to make things more difficult for them, put 15p per gallon on the price of petrol.</P>
    <P>A better effort could be made by CIE to provide a service to take those workers to work.  I have heard complaints from many areas in my constituency, where workers have to travel long distances by car, that CIE have not put on the necessary service. It should be possible for them to run a bus in the morning to ensure that workers get to work on time. The unemployment situation in my constituency is very bad.  In the three labour exchanges we find a sizeable number are unemployed.  In Ballinasloe labour exchange area, there are 661 people unemployed, in Loughrea we have 258 and in Tuam we have 1,268.  Those are the latest figures <Col N="866" /> available on the 18th April.  This strengthens the case I have already made for advanced factories in those areas.  We have the labour force available but we have no industry.  The Government should make every effort in those areas, where there is such high unemployment, to absorb that labour force into some type of industry.</P>
    <P>The two industries I have mentioned in Ballygar and Mountbellew are a case in point.  There has been a lot of controversy about the Regional Fund and how it will be used.  The people in the west had hoped to benefit from this fund, but we now find that the money being given by the EEC is to be taken by the Government and put into the Exchequer to help get the Government out of their terrible plight.  It should be remembered that during the EEC Referendum campaign my party, who were then in Government, and the Fine Gael Party committed themselves to devoting the money from this fund to the development of the west.  If that money was devoted to the west it would help to provide the infrastructure to attract industries, help to improve the telephone service, provide the necessary water and sewerage facilities and the acquisition of sites for houses and industries.</P>
    <P>Even though the amount of money we will receive from the Regional Fund&mdash;I believe it will be £4 million &mdash;is small, if it was used properly it could boost industrial development in western counties.  It would prove a valuable supplementary grant to the £10 million already given to the IDA to modernise existing industries, thereby ensuring competitiveness and consequent expansion.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what has happened to the Social Fund which was set up in a period of economic expansion to cope with regional and sectional problems.  We are faced with economic recession and widespread unemployment, and to meet this drastic change we must adopt drastic measures.  The Social Fund should be more flexible in its application and, where necessary, extended to cover the areas worst hit in <Col N="867" /> the present unemployment crisis.  Have private firms been helped by this fund or are all the applications for assistance from State agencies?  The private sector should be encouraged to avail of this fund which should be used for training and retraining in a period when few industries are expanding and few new jobs are being created.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is the second largest industry here.  Its gross output is £450 million which is 14.5 per cent of our GNP.  There are 82,000 people directly employed in the industry while another 25,000 people are employed in other sectors associated with the construction industry.  If the industry is in trouble the entire economy is affected.  The industry is in trouble in spite of what the Minister for Local Government has stated.  I should like to pinpoint the decline in cement sales during 1974 and this will indicate that there was serious unemployment in the industry during that year.  In the first quarter of 1973 the sales increased by 65.8 thousand tons, 23.3 per cent; in the second quarter the increase was 75.7 thousand tons, 20 per cent; in the third quarter the increase was 30.8 thousand tons, 8.1 per cent and in the last quarter of that year there was an increase of 70 thousand tons, 1.9 per cent.  In the first quarter of 1974 we had an increase of 5.1 thousand tons, 1.5 per cent while in the second quarter there was a decrease of 1.0 thousand tons, 0.2 per cent.  The decrease in the third quarter was 23.4 thousand tons, 5.7 per cent while in the last quarter the decrease was 18.9 thousand tons, 4.9 per cent. In spite of what the Government tell the people about the construction industry doing well there has been a serious decline in cement sales.  When cement sales decline workers have to be laid off because they cannot work without cement.</P>
    <P>I should now like to give figures of the numbers unemployed in the private sector of the building industry in the years 1973 and 1974.  In January 1973 59,831 were unemployed while in January 1974 60,907 were unemployed, an increase of 1,076.  The figure for <Col N="868" /> February 1973 compared with February 1974 showed an increase of 1,615. March, 1974 showed an increase of 741 on 1973 while the April figure was up by 1,010.  The figure for May, 1974 was up by 1,408, June by 1,145, July by 135.  The figure for August, 1974 showed a decrease of 68; September a decrease of 606; October a decrease of 1,145; November a decrease of 808, and December a decrease of 1,211.  In March of this year, the month for which the latest figures are available, 3,903 people were unemployed in the private sector of the building industry.</P>
    <P>These figures were released by the Central Statistics Office and Members will see from them that there is a serious problem in the building industry. There are 3,903 persons unemployed in the private sector at present, when the industry should be picking up and when normally the industry is improving and workers are finding their way back into employment.</P>
    <P>Building material manufacturers and merchants are working on short time.  Why is this so if the industry is booming, as the Government would have us believe?  We see that a number of houses are left unsold.  Is it because there is no money available?  People on dole queues cannot buy new houses.  This is a bad situation.</P>
    <P>There will be new EEC road transport legislation in 1976 which means that the maximum daily driving time will be reduced to eight hours.  This will add to the operational costs of many industries and will create further problems for them.  Are the Government prepared to do anything about those problems?  Are they prepared to help those industries that will be affected by this legislation in 1976?</P>
    <P>A very large number of young persons will be leaving school next autumn and coming on the labour market.  What efforts are being made to accomodate them?  Have the Government any plans to create employment or to ensure that they will be given employment within the shortest possible time?</P>
    <P>The population is increasing and even when this recession is over many new jobs will be required.  Our accession <Col N="869" /> to the EEC has given us excellent opportunities of which we should make full use.  Full advantage should be taken of the schemes in operation in the EEC so as to ensure that the country gets maximum benefit from them.</P>
    <P>A long dole queue is no answer to our problems, neither is social insurance benefit, nor the redundancy fund which was introduced by Fianna Fáil. They alleviate hardship in the short term.  A man who cannot find work is entitled to some kind of benefit.  Workers have their pride.  No worker wants to remain on the dole forever.  The dole is a temporary measure.  It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that the dole queue is reduced and that drastic measures are taken to ensure that those on the dole at present will find suitable employment before long.</P>

      <P>The world is suffering today a greater depression and recession than anything previously experienced by mankind.  The depression of the last 18 months is much greater in every country other than the OPEC countries than was experienced in the catastrophic days of 1929 to 1933.</P>

      <P>Ninety-four per cent of Ireland's gross national product is involved in exports and imports.  The world has become much more interdependent now than it was in the early thirties because free trade is more universal and Ireland in particular has become much more vulnerable to the swings of fortune and misfortune since we properly decided that our future lay in expanded trade rather than in a reliance upon the Fianna Fáil &ldquo;live within yourself and sink the ships&rdquo; philosophy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which would have created much more misery for our people than any difficulties which are being currently experienced.</P>
      <P>The trouble is that this motion is late.  It is late because already the upswing is occurring.  That is not to say that we have overcome all our difficulties; nor is it to say that the Exchequer has untouched resources other than taxation or foreign borrowing, both of which the Opposition deplore; but it is to say that the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Economic and Social Research Institute in their latest reports say that there is growing confidence in industry, that more firms are now reporting higher actual production and higher expectations of increased production in the months ahead, that these firms are also estimating better employment prospects in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>As regards agriculture, cattle prices have recovered from the low points prevailing last year and are now at record levels.  Milk prices have improved.  Milk production is increasing. These developments alone will ensure enhanced incomes for farmers. This year farmers' incomes will rise by between 35 and 40 per cent, surely a factor which will inspire confidence not only in the farming community but across our whole economy because of the benefits which will flow from increased incomes in the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition are wrong, as <Col N="871" /> usual, in alleging that living standards of workers have fallen in Ireland in the last two years.  The average earnings of workers engaged in manufacturing industry rose by over 40 per cent in the two years 1973 and 1974 and this was 8 per cent greater than the rise in consumer prices.  Thus, in spite of the extraordinary increases in the prices of energy, the real purchasing power of workers has increased substantially since we assumed office and is guaranteed to be maintained at least at that level in the year of the greatest economic difficulty ever experienced in the world.</P>
    <P>Our performance, by reason of our interdependence on the rest of the world, reflects what is happening elsewhere. But what is particularly significant and a cause of encouragement to us is that, although we are more exposed than are other countries, our performance has been much better.</P>
    <P>On the unemployment front, countries with no balance of payments difficulties, countries which are in surplus, which have massive wealth available to them, without difficulty, have experienced a greater rise in unemployment over the last year than have we.  Belgium has had a 50 per cent increase; Denmark has had a 350 per cent increase and is now running an unemployment rate of 14 per cent; France has had a 65 per cent increase; Germany 94 per cent; The Netherlands 37 per cent and Ireland's increase, which is certainly a cause of very serious concern to us, is 47 per cent.</P>
    <P>Those are indications of the malaise affecting the world as a whole, a malaise which has caused the world economy to sink into a recession without precedent.  The world economy is something like one of those giant tankers the engines of which must be put into reverse many hours before the vessel comes to a halt.  Throughout 1974 and early 1975 Minister of this Government have been saying to their friends in the international community that the recession was more serious than many other countries were prepared to acknowledge. It gives us little satisfaction today to <Col N="872" /> be told we were right and to have other countries, who were in a position to do so more than a year ago, taking action now to reflate their economies because they went into a deeper recession than they were prepared to admit a year ago.</P>
    <P>Today's motion expresses the concern of Dáil Éireann at the rise in unemployment.  Certainly, we can endorse that concern because nobody is more concerned about it than are we in government who work from one end of the week or month to the other endeavouring to find solutions.  Nobody but a fool would dream that the solutions to our difficulties are to be found by government expenditure alone.  Indeed, increased government expenditure in some areas can tend only to exacerbate our difficulties.  Government expenditure can be increased only if the revenue available to government is increased and that can be increased only by further taxation. Any taxation which would stimulate the inflationary spiral would be contrary to the best economic interests of the country.  Similarly, any unnecessary increase in borrowing, either domestically or on the foreign market, would tend also to exacerbate the inflationary difficulty.  Inflation has become our greatest enemy because it is not only undesirable in itself but it is also a cause of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as I said on Saturday last, it behoves us all, in our several walks of life, in whatever are our areas of responsibility, to moderate our demands and expectations if additional resources have to be made available to stimulate our economy to ensure that those resources are spent in new investment, in the creation of new employment opportunities rather than being expended on current consumption.  But most of the suggestions made by the Fianna Fáil Party, indeed, I could almost say all of the suggestions made by the Fianna Fáil Party in recent months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Government have increased in less than 2½ years by no less than 125 per cent State expenditure on the construction industry.  Taking last year with this year, we have increased by 50 per cent the amount expended by the IDA on new industrial facilities. We have increased by 42½ per cent the amount being expended this year on the improvement and modernisation of existing industry to maintain employment.  The resources of Fóir Teoranta are being almost trebled this year to meet the temporary difficulties of industry because of the international situation which is necessarily reflected here.</P>
      <P>We cannot run away from those realities.  I do not blame the Opposition for endeavouring to make mischief while the sun of difficulties is shining on all Oppositions.  All Governments and all European Democracies face the same problems as do we today.  But we can say, with some degree of modesty and with the facts to justify our claim, that we have succeeded.  Although we are more vulnerable than others, although our resources are less than others, we have succeeded better than other people in a much stronger position to face the greatest difficulties that have ever faced the world.  We believe that our confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am indebted to Deputy G. Fitzgerald for having given me a few moments of his time to comment on this motion.  I was fortunate in being here to listen to the Minister for Finance, with his typical arrogance and bluff, debate the well-being of farmers saying the farmers were never better off, that cattle prices had increased considerably in recent times.  I would suggest to the Minister for Finance that he go down to Youghal in County Cork where he could buy calves very cheaply.  Two hundred calves were dumped into a quarry near Youghal last week.  As we all realise, prices being paid for calves at present is at rock bottom. Farmers cannot give them away so they must dump them.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance would have us believe that the well-being of the farming community is at top level.</P>
      <P>I have but a few moments to comment. Therefore, I will retreat to the few points I had in mind.  I had a question on today's Order Paper regarding the position in Mallow town where at present we have an unprecedented 350 people on the labour exchange. Mallow is a good example of an industrial town where conditions are typical of those obtaining throughout the country at present.  Not since the dying days of the Coalition in 1951, and again in 1957, have we had conditions such as we are experiencing today.  The Minister for Finance was able to say we are caught up in a world inflationary position and condition, that all our problems and troubles are attributable to outside influences.  He must not have studied the Central Bank report in which it was indicated clearly that 50 per cent of our problems only could be attributed to outside influences and that the remainder was due on the whole to bad housekeeping and administration. We have all the signs of 1957 with us again and there may be some justification in the belief that we are not far from a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> One of the points I wanted to make is that the present unemployment position is unprecedented.  Unemployment in itself is bad.  Worse again is the demoralising effect unemployment and long labour exchange queues have on the working community. People feel and justifiably so that those people registered on the unemployment exchange are better off doing nothing than are these people who work.  Secondly, they feel that the long string of unemployment queues necessarily means the collection of more taxes from those people in employment.  The position of the working man, the man who is at his job from 8 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock or 6 o'clock, as the case may be, has been too often overlooked.  Taxation has increased and he has had to bear the brunt of the unemployment queues.  We accept that when Fianna Fáil were in office there were industrial recessions.  In north-east Cork we had problems with industry from time to time but the Government invariably got firms back into business.</P>
    <P>We must accept that we have a problem with regard to unemployment. Rather than pushing large sums into social welfare, consideration should be given to diverting social welfare funds into the Office of Public Works.  We know there are many schemes in need of money.  Roadways need improvement in my area and I am sure the same applies throughout the country.  It should be possible to divert into public works the vast sums that are keeping long queues at the labour exchanges and, in this way, essential work could be proceeded with.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour should consider subsidising local authorities who are prepared to employ more men.  It is far better to have people employed than in queues at the labour exchanges.  If county councils, corporations and other bodies were helped they could employ more men for essential works.  In addition, the unemployed would not suffer the demoralising effect of the labour exchange queues.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="876" /> Confidence in the economy is at rock bottom.  I have been told that never before have there been so few inquiries to the IDA.  The community have lost confidence in the Government, as have potential outside investors. The latter have no interest in establishing industries here.  We are set fair for a general election on the basis of big promises given on the potential, or alleged potential, of our offshore resources.  We are getting ready for promise No. 15.  The Taoiseach and his Cabinet have reached the bottom of the barrel and there is no more money available for social welfare, education or for local authorities.  We are on the way out although the Government try to make it seem that there are bright things on the horizon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I have not more time because I should dearly love to take apart the inept speech of the Minister for Labour. As was stated by the newspapers today, it was empty and without purpose. I should also like to answer the points that were made so weakly, so apologetically and so obviously without feeling by Deputy Desmond.  I shall not even refer to the Minister for Finance.  His arrogance was disgraceful and was typical of what we have come to expect from a man whose credibility is at zero.  The Central Bank have told him who is responsible for so much of the inflation from which we are suffering but yet he had the neck to tell us all about inflation.  He contradicted what Deputy Desmond said&mdash;they were on different wavelengths&mdash;and obviously he did not give any thought to what was said earlier in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Labour told us the Minister for Finance and Industry and Commerce would speak but we have not heard from the latter Minister.  On a motion such as this we were entitled to expect him to tell us what he intended doing for the working people.  When will he tell us what steps he intends taking to protect the textile and clothing industries? We understand that he is preparing plans in his Department&mdash;it is <Col N="877" /> quite a long time since the task force from Europe told him he should put his own house in order&mdash;but we want to know if he is only preparing licences that will monitor the situation.</P>
    <P>We want the Minister for Industry and Commerce to impose effective restrictions on these imports in an endeavour, even at this late stage, to protect the livelihoods of the workers. The indications are that in two years' time there will be no employment in those industries.  In December, 1974, 64 per cent of the home market in footwear was gone.  What steps is the Minister taking to help ailing industries? Today another shoe company in Limerick city closed their doors, leaving 80 people unemployed.  In County Offaly, a receiver has been appointed to another firm and 200 male employees are under protective notice.  I say to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on one of his few visits to us, to convey to his colleagues in Government that their policies have wrecked the economy in a way that was done by their predecessors in the Coalition Governments.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage, I would ask the Government to analyse the industrial situation and to strive to restore confidence.  Allegations are made against people on this side of the House but we are responsible people. It is our prime concern to see this country prosper, to have more opportunities for our young people.  Deputy Desmond spent 20 minutes playing with figures, defending a hopeless situation.  Last night I asked the Minister for Labour to be positive in his approach, to spell out what the Government intended doing with the social fund in the provision of extra jobs.</P>
    <P>Can the Government say their response has been of any joy to the car workers in Dublin and Cork, to the textile and clothing workers, to the shoe and leather workers and to the many others who are unemployed or who are in grave danger of being made redundant?  We have been told about the money being spent on capital expenditure this year but we have not heard about the cut-back in the <Col N="878" /> capital expenditure by the ESB which is resulting in considerable unemployment. We have not been told about the cut-back in Road Fund grants to the local authorities so that the authorities will not be able to keep their work force to the end of this year&mdash;a situation that has not arisen since 1957.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Labour last night was tired and empty and the speeches tonight were no better.  This Government are grinding to a halt, just as the wheels of industry are grinding to a halt because of lack of confidence in the future.  The Government will be remembered as the men who did nothing positive for the country.  We need energy, guts, determination and enterprise.  The workers are probably the best working people one could come across.</P>
    <P>I forgot to mention a midland area where Bord na Móna for a long time gave considerable employment.  Now they are affected by the economic situation also.  Industries in Dublin and in rural areas are suffering, due to the growing lack of confidence on the factory floor, particularly in small businesses.  Unless this is tackled now this pie in the sky that speakers are telling us about&mdash;what we will achieve around the next corner&mdash;is no good for the working people.  They want opportunities.  Our school leavers want opportunities.  Please do something for the young people of the country who will have no opportunities in the coming summer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained the difficulties.  It has been suggested that all beneficiaries lose under the arrangement described by Deputy Colley but that is not so.  The only person who would lose under such an arrangement would be the universal or residual legatee.  I know that in many cases that could be the sole beneficiary but the reasons for variation in the market price between the date of sale and the date of death can vary.  Sometimes executors can, at the request of the beneficiary, sometimes it is one and the same person, postpone sales in expectation of achieving a benefit for themselves.  It does not always materialise.  In many cases no loss is incurred even if the market is not behaving in a bull fashion for the reason that the duty may be paid by way of Government securities which can be surrendered at par and in such a situation if the market is low the beneficiary can get quite a significant gain.</P>
      <P>In a number of cases the executors themselves can be responsible for a great part of the loss.  If difficulties have arisen as they may have&mdash;I am not saying they have not&mdash;sometimes they have been attributable to the fact that banks have pressed executors&mdash;it has not been the State that has been pressing them for the recovery of their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> There are several cases that have been brought to my notice by people who have claimed serious loss who sold stock where there were other liquid assets available, where there was money available in the bank that could have been used.  Quite clearly there is a multiplicity of different situations.  It would be very difficult indeed to legislate for situations of that kind.</P>
    <P>Again a further complex problem would be the difference between stocks and shares in public and private companies.  The sale and transfer of shares in private companies is, of course, normally restricted by the articles of association and the question of the appropriate valuations on different dates would be a very complex matter to adjudicate upon.  I do not think I could assist consideration of the problem at this stage if I were to go into all the various details.  The Deputy may be assured that we have given earnest consideration to it.  I will take another look at it but I cannot see that the problem is one which is capable of simple remedy.  It is not.  It is a complex problem and one cannot look at the minuses without also looking at the pluses that can occur in this situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that in cases where there is no loss as for instance, the case he mentioned where people surrender Government stock at par, no question of giving relief would apply if there has been no loss, that it is only in a case where there has been a loss that this would arise?  Would he also accept that while clearly there are complications involved they have apparently been overcome in Britain? It would, therefore, seem to be possible for the Minister to overcome them if he wished to do so.</P>

      <P>The 36.75 per cent rate operates on a two-tier basis, something that is often overlooked.  It is 36.75 per cent at the manufacturing or import level and 6.75 per cent at wholesale or retail level.  Of the 36.75 per cent rate applicable at the earlier level, 30 per cent is not subject to the normal VAT recoupment arrangements, but is trapped in the price passed on to the next stage of distribution.  When, therefore, the manufacturer's price is fixed at an artificially low level the loss of tax is appreciable, even if, at the retail stage, the price is fixed at the normal market level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners that the practice is developing of manufacturers selling at such artificially low prices to their own subsidiary wholesaling companies as to avoid much of the tax.  It is important, from the point of view of fair competition in trade as well as from the point of view of the <Col N="883" /> Exchequer that the practice should end as soon as possible.  It is estimated that if the practice were to continue at its present level, there would be a loss of about £200,000 per annum and if the practice were to spread the loss would be correspondingly greater.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 11 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, by substituting a new subsection for subsection (2) and a new subsection for subsection (4).  The amendments came into effect as and from January 16th this year under Resoluton No. 9 passed by the Dáil on the previous day.  Both of the amendments are designed to clarify certain doubts regarding the construction of the existing law and which have created the possibility of substantial tax avoidance.</P>
      <P>The first doubt relates to whether, on the cessation of manufacturing or assembly operations of Fourth Schedule goods, stocks of finished goods, can be subjected to the higher, that is, the 36.75 per cent, applicable only to sale at the manufacturing level.</P>
      <P>The second doubt relates to the provisions concerning the supply of materials.  The existing section 11, subsection (4), was intended to ensure, in a case where materials are supplied for the manufacture of goods where the tax rate for the finished goods exceeds the rate chargeable for the materials, that the Exchequer will receive in total the amount appropriate to the finished goods.  The doubt referred to is whether the provision can be applied in cases where the materials were acquired in circumstances not giving rise to tax.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 13 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, by inserting a new subsection, (2A).  The effect of the new subsection is to suspend in respect of live cattle, the tax recoupment of 1 per cent which registered purchasers, for example, meat factories, butchers and exporters, may claim from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of purchases from unregistered farmers.  The purpose of the suspension, as I explained in the budget statement, is to provide a sum of £2.2 million required by the Exchequer to finance additional cattle feed vouchers.</P>
      <P>The suspension will have effect retrospectively as from 1st March, 1975, which is the date of the commencement of a taxable period, and will cease on 30th June, 1976, at the latest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so in practice but I wonder if it is so in theory.  Is it not the position that the farmer is entitled, having agreed a price, to be paid an additional 1 per cent?  Is it intended to recompense him for the VAT he has suffered in respect of certain farm inputs?  If VAT is being taken away is he not losing the benefits of the 1 per cent addition to his price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of cattle there is no specific addition to the price paid.  The farmer does not get £x plus 1 per cent.  He gets whatever is the going price of the day but the meat factories, exporters and the like, have been entitled to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a recoupment of the notional 1 per cent.  As a result of this they will not be entitled to it.  It is presumed that the 1 per cent which they received in the past was passed on to the farmer.  The reality is more important than the theory.  In effect, there has been no material reduction in price.  Incidentally I think it is also fair to say that fortunately, thanks to the good Lord, the fears which existed at the time of the budget regarding the cattle fodder situation have not materialised.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In Part V, to insert the following section before section 52:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Paragraph (i) of the Fourth Schedule to the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, is hereby amended by the deletion of `motor cycles, motor scooters, mopeds and auto cycles'.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to have motor cycles, motor scooters, mopeds and auto cycles removed from the higher rate of VAT.  At the moment the rate is 30.26 per cent. We are all aware of the effect the use of petrol has had on the economy over the years.  We know only too well <Col N="888" /> what happened last year when petrol supplies were cut drastically and, when we succeeded in getting petrol, it was at a greatly increased price.  The Minister for Transport and Power is reminding us constantly to use energy carefully and that we cannot afford waste.  We have all seen the television advertisements where the £ note is burned and people are advised how they should save energy.</P>
    <P>The use of light vehicles such as auto cycles, motor cycles and mopeds would provide a great saving for workers going to work.  In many cases, they have to take two buses and sometimes three buses.  I know many workers from the Killester area, which Deputy Colley is very conversant with, who have to work in Finglas.  They have to get a bus into town and a bus out of town.  Even if they only go in the morning and come home in the evening, at a conservative estimate it costs them about £2.50 a week.  If they could go directly from Killester or Raheny to Coolock they could do that for about 50p a week.  As well as that, in many cases they could go home for lunch which they cannot do now.  This would present a great saving to the ordinary workers.  I urge the Minister to think carefully about this because it seems rather ludicrous that there is VAT at the rate of 30.26 per cent on these small vehicles and the rate on fur coats is only 5.26 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand why Deputy Belton moves this amendment and I am not unsympathetic to the argument which he advances in favour of people using motor cycles rather than motor cars. Nor am I unappreciative of the low cost of operating motor cycles having enjoyed operating a moped for many years myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of difficulties in relation to acceptance of the amendment.  There are also a number of misunderstandings in relation to the operation of the existing system compared with what is suggested, which I should like to explain.  Earlier I drew attention to the fact that the VAT rate of 36.75 per cent contains two separate elements.  One is a rate of <Col N="889" /> 30 per cent which operates at the assembly or import level and from the point of view of price that is much lower than the retail level.  There is also a rate of 6.75 per cent which operates at the retail level.</P>
    <P>To reduce the rate from 36.75 per cent to 19.5 per cent at retail level would not give any significant reduction in the price to the purchaser and accordingly would be unlikely to confer any significant benefit on the motor cycle industry.  The 19.5 per cent rate would be charged on the retail price which would include the distributor's margin, whereas the other rate of 30 per cent operates only at the assembly or import level and contains only 6.75 per cent of the retail profit margin.  The actual added value in the motor cycle assembly business is very small compared with the import value of the components.  I am sure the House will appreciate that the employment content is correspondingly quite small.  Apart altogether from the tax element, there has been a fairly steady decline in the demand for new motor cycles reflecting, no doubt, the anxiety possibly which some people have in respect of motor cycling and also reflecting an increased preference for motor cars.</P>
    <P>In 1971, the number of new motor cycle registrations was 9,264; in 1972 the figure was 7,685 and, in 1973, which was substantially unaffected by the oil crisis, the figure was 6,607. The number of new motor cycles has been decreasing for reasons which are not, I think, connected with taxation. There are, of course, other taxes on motor cycles besides value-added tax. There are customs duties.  These are protective duties designed to protect employment in the motor cycle assembly industry.  These will be phased out in the case of imports from EEC countries and they will have to be aligned with the full non-external tariff in the case of imports from outside the EEC.  Apart from these tax items there is undoubtedly still a very significant benefit for any person who decides to travel by motor cycle.  If he does his sums he will see that a light motor cycle gives him a substantial <Col N="890" /> cash advantage at the end of every week compared with either a motor car or public transport.  While on paper an argument can be made in favour of this amendment&mdash;an argument can be made very effectively really by a competent Deputy like Deputy Luke Belton&mdash;it will, I think, be seen from the explanations I have given that the situation is not quite as serious as it may appear to be and the decline which has occurred appears to be attributable to causes other than value-added tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave the figures for the decline in the number of motor cycles from 1971 to 1973 and he said that this decline was probably due to the fact that more people were using motor cars.  Would he not agree there has been a decline in the sale of motor cars due to the increased cost of petrol and would he not also agree that this should in turn lead to an increase in motor cycles, mopeds and autocycles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly.  I have not seen the figures for 1975.  There was not as big a drop between 1973-1974 as occurred in the previous three years.  Perhaps this was a reflection of people's concern with the price of petrol.  I think the probable reason for the reduction in the demand for motor cars&mdash;this has occurred in other countries as well as here&mdash;is attributable not so much to the cost of petrol as to the widespread recession which has reduced incomes because of unemployment, lack of overtime, short time, a general anxiety and also, of course, the increase in the cost of motor cars themselves, an increase which has been quite substantial apart from the cost of the energy consuming content.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:</P>
      <P>In Part V to insert the following section before section 52:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;52.&mdash;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, value-added tax shall not be payable in respect of the supply of electricity or gas consumed on or after the <Col N="891" /> 16th January, 1975 to individuals aged 70 years or upwards living alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The amendment is self-explanatory really.  The date, 16th January, is, of course, the day following the introduction of the budget.  That is why it was picked.  I have tabled this amendment in an effort to give some relief to the people mentioned.  It would not be a major relief in terms of cost but it would be a major relief to the people concerned.  Listening to people, particularly Ministers, I have a feeling that very few people realise what an enormous problem has been created for old people, particularly those living alone on very small incomes, who were subject to the effects of the increases in the price of electricity and gas over the past two years.  The increase has been enormous and quite out of proportion to the increase in the cost of living.  These people have to pay value-added tax which is going up all the time as the price increases.  This is adding a burden on them which may prove for some the last straw.</P>
    <P>The Minister will tell me there would be considerable administrative difficulties in implementing this amendment. The difficulties are by no means insuperable in my opinion.  I do not claim that the wording of the amendment is precisely what it should be to achieve exactly what we want and to ensure we do not open loopholes, but would the Minister accept the principle of it?  The problem is there and it is a major one for old people living alone. It could mean the difference between life and death for them and I urge the Minister to accept at least the principle involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exemption suggested by Deputy Colley would not be of significant benefit to those concerned having regard to the free electricity allowance to which they are already entitled.  Old age pensioners and social welfare recipients aged 67 years or over &mdash;the Deputy suggests 70 years in his amendment&mdash;living alone or with dependants receive free of charge up to 300 units per two month period.  They do not pay any meter rent.  The cost is borne entirely by the State, as the <Col N="892" /> Deputy is aware.  The State also covers value-added tax and the fuel variation charge appropriate to the allowances. The value of the allowance for a two-month period is estimated at between £4.50 and £5, or something in the region of £30 a year.  We are informed by the ESB that there are very few, if any, pensioners who exceed the free allowance.  The benefit suggested by the Deputy is, therefore, not required since it is already in existence.  The only case where it could be of benefit would be in respect of consumers of gas but, because of the free electricity, a number of pensioners have switched from gas to electricity.  The effect of granting the aid, even to those using it, is estimated to be something less than 1 per cent.  The statistic I have been given is that it is of the order of .07 per cent. Now, having regard to the fact that there are various gas companies and that they are not as well geared in handling accounts as is the Electricity Supply Board, there would be some very real problems for them in the administration of an allowance such as this if it were to be granted.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will accept that the lion's share of expenditure by such people is already covered by the State scheme and that, accordingly, his amendment, while, no doubt, well-intentioned, would not confer any significant benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I am rather astonished to hear the Minister saying that few, if any, pensioners exceed the free allowance.  The reason this surprises me is that, first of all, I have personal knowledge from my constituency of pensioners who certainly exceed the allowance.  Secondly, when I was Minister for Finance I was responsible for, as far as I can recollect, doubling the existing allowance of units and even then was aware of the fact that this did not go nearly far enough, particularly in the winter in providing any real relief in regard to heating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall I had consultations in this regard, particularly with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who gave me some very clear examples of cases of considerable hardship which were arising. I have a distinct recollection at <Col N="893" /> that time of being quite dissatisfied with what I was able to do, although I was doubling the existing allowance, because I was aware there were quite a number of pensioners who would still have difficulties.  That was at a time before the enormous increases in both gas and electricity, arising directly or indirectly out of the oil crisis, were imposed.  The position now, in respect of anything they have to pay over and above the free allowance, must be much more difficult than it was then.</P>
    <P>I realise there are some administrative difficulties but I do not think they are by any means insuperable. I appreciate the fact that there are a number of gas companies around the country but I believe, provided the people concerned are identified&mdash; they would have to be by applying&mdash; the matter could be relatively easily dealt with by allowing the gas company concerned to claim in respect of its own liability for VAT what was foregone in respect of each of the identified people.  I do not think the Minister was saying that the administrative difficulties were such that it would not be possible to do this. The substance of what he was saying was that it would benefit few if any pensioners.  If that is true, of course, it is a very valid argument for the Minister to make but I repeat I am astonished if that is the position because it was not the position a few years ago and the allowance of electricity units has not been increased since then.</P>

      <P>The weather has been mild for the last two winters and this may have something to do with it.  I am also informed that when excesses occur they are quite marginal. They are in the region of 25p or thereabouts so that the amount of VAT involved in the excess is insignificant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be harrowing about this.  Does the Minister not recall, within the last 18 months, an old man was burned alive in a corporation chalet and there was good reason to believe that his death was brought about because he was <Col N="894" /> unable to pay his ESB bill, although he was in receipt of free electricity?  I do not know if the Minister recalls the case but I do and it is by no means an isolated one.  I strongly urge the Minister to look again at the information he has been given to see if it is not something that maybe has been averaged out.  I am sure he is familiar with the old story of the man who wandered across the river and asked how deep it was.  He was told it was an average of 3 feet deep and he was 5 feet tall but he got drowned because at one point it was 6 feet.  I suspect something like this may be happening in the information given to the Minister about the usefulness of the free electricity allowance.  I believe, from what he said, that if he were satisfied there were cases where this could be of some assistance he would be disposed to try to do something about it.  I accept that is so and, therefore, I ask him to recheck the information he has been given to see if there are not cases where it could be of some value in very difficult circumstances.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy will accept, to use his analogy of the river, his amendment would only just vary the average depth of the river by an inch or so but it would not overcome the problem of the greater depth which might exist in part of the stretch.  One would want to look at the situation to see if the amount of units should be increased in certain circumstances where particular difficulties arise such as, for instance, in one of the prefabs where possibly the insulation is not as good as it is elewhere. I will certainly be well-disposed to consider the matter and I will examine it further.</P>

      <P>This deals with the capital services redemption account.  A system operated through the capital services redemption account is designed to amortise the expenditure on voted capital services, which is charged to the capital budget, by means of annuities <Col N="895" /> charged on the Central Fund and against the current budget over a 30 year period.  Each year a new 30-year annuity is set up, based on estimated expenditure on voted capital expenditure in that year.  In the following year, when actual expenditure is known, the annuity is adjusted for the remaining 29 years.  Portion of each annuity is earmarked as the interest element and a sum not exceeding the total of these interest elements may be paid from the account towards meeting interest on Exchequer borrowings. The balance of the annuities is used towards helping to finance the capital budget.</P>

      <P>Section 22 in this Bill is the section which gives effect to the Schedule.  Subsection (1) of that section states that Part I of the Second Schedule shall have effect for the purpose of supplementing sections 19 to 21 and this section.  It is the provisions of sections 19 to 21 which we have to add to Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Part III, paragraph III of the proviso to section 81 (3) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is to ensure that a premium chargeable under <Col N="898" /> section 83 will be charged for one year only.  The paragraph as it stands refers to premiums in respect of which the recipient has opted to be charged on instalments thereof as they arise.  As the option to be charged on instalments is being withdrawn, by the effective repeal of section 83 (6) by section 20 (a) of this Bill, the words in quotes in the first subparagraph of column 3 of Part III of the Second Schedule are no longer relevant and are now being repealed.  For the same reason the second and third subparagraphs of column 3 of Part III of the Schedule repeal references to section 83 (6), sections 91 (1) (b) and 92 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that the House dealt with this matter, particularly with relation to sections 19 to 22 on the basis of the kind of case he outlined which all sides agreed should be dealt with but if other kinds of cases not envisaged in those sections are affected by this, would the Minister agree that there should not incidentally be an interference with the rights of those persons? Would the Minister agree and place on the record of the House, that in such cases the Revenue Commissioners will allow the right of election even if there was not a question of suffering undue hardship if it were denied?

      <P>We are now proceeding on the basis of substituting this omnibus clause.  The trade carried on by the transferee company referred to in paragraph 3 (1) (b) is not a trade as defined in section 31 (1). Therefore, it is necessary to substitute another word for &ldquo;trade&rdquo; in paragraph 3 (1) (b) and the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is being inserted.</P>
      <P>Representations have been received to the effect that the condition that the business of a transferee company must consist wholly of the sale of goods manufactured by the transferor company is too restrictive.  Accordingly, to provide for the case where the selling company's trade is not confined to selling goods produced by an associated manufacturing company the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; are being inserted in paragraph 3 (1) (b) in lieu of the word &ldquo;wholly&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The representations to which the Minister refers were also referred to me.  I think they are reasonable and I think the Minister's amendment meets the case made in regard to those specific points.

      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 40:</P>
      <P>In page 34, paragraph 3, to delete subparagraph (5) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  The provisions of this paragraph shall apply only where one of the two companies referred to in subparagraph (1) (a) holds throughout the relevant accounting period or reference period either in its own name or in that of a nominee all of the ordinary shares in the other company referred to in the said subparagraph or where some other company holds throughout the relevant accounting period or reference period either in its <Col N="902" /> own name or in that of a nominee all of the ordinary shares in each of the two companies referred to in the said subparagraph.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The primary purpose of this amendment is to relax the conditions under which a selling company associated with a manufacturing company may qualify for a measure of relief on a group basis where it would not otherwise qualify in its own right.  Under paragraph 3 (5) of the Third Schedule it is a condition precedent to the granting of relief that the manufacturing company should hold either in its own name or in that of a nominee all of the ordinary shares in the selling company.  The amendment has the effect of widening the scope of paragraph 3 (5) to include the converse case where the selling company holds all of the ordinary shares in the manufacturing company and the case where all of the ordinary shares in both the manufacturing and the selling companies are held by a third company. The amendment also secures that relationship between the parent company and subsidiary company or the relationship between the common parent and its subsidiaries, as the case may require, must subsist throughout the relevant accounting period or reference period.  Again, the amendment is made in response to representations from apparently the same source as Deputy Colley and I received them.</P>

    <P>As I have already indicated when I was talking on section 31, a transferee company cannot be carrying on a trade as defined if it is to qualify for relief pursuant to paragraph 3 of the Third Schedule.  It is, however, necessary, for technical reasons to secure that for the purposes of computing the deductions to which the transferee company is entitled under section 31 by virtue of paragraph 3 it will be regarded as carrying on the trade as defined.  It is with this end in view that the proposed new subparagraph (6) is being added to paragraph 3 by means of this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to some representations he received.  I think he will find that one of the points put to him in those representations was a suggested interpretation of paragraph 3 (1) (a) and that interpretation was that the paragraph as drafted makes it a condition for the relief that all goods manufactured by the manufacturing company should be sold to the selling company.  I think that is based on the use of the words &ldquo;those&rdquo; at the end of paragraph (a) &ldquo;acquires those goods as trading stock&rdquo;.  Does the Minister agree with that interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We received representations on the lines of what the Deputy has just argued but I am advised that the paragraph, as drafted, does not and could not bear the construction which has just been suggested.

      <P>Since the Minister does not interpret that as meaning &ldquo;acquires all those goods&rdquo;, he must interpret it as meaning part.  What part, the main part of it, any part of it?  The Minister will appreciate that if the interpretation which is suggested could be placed on this is correct, then certain other consequences follow, whereas if the interpretation which he says has been advised should be placed on it is correct, then those consequences do not follow. It is of some importance to understand what is precisely the kind of advice proffered to the Minister on this point.</P>

      <P>If it were to mean only &ldquo;all the goods&rdquo;, then it would seem to me there would be a necessity to determine what would be the period during which one would measure the goods which had actually been manufactured in that period and acquired by the other body during that period.  Of course, we know that goods are manufactured in an on-going process.  Again, acquisition by another <Col N="905" /> company is an on-going process.  But one cannot say at any particular moment that the purchaser has acquired all the goods manufactured by a particular entity.  One could not say that unless the purchaser was to be at the end of the assembly line, at the end of the manufacturing process and receiving them as they were manufactured. There will always be a residue of goods in a manufactured unit which has not been transferred elsewhere.  I should not say always but that is the normal practice.  To try to interpret this section in such a way as to suggest that all the goods must be taken at any given time is to stretch this in a way which is contrary to ordinary business practice.</P>

      <P>It is suggested that conditions operating in groups&mdash;and this is what we are dealing with here, groups of companies&mdash;which use selling companies vary considerably from group to group.  The extent of stockholding by group selling companies varies considerably; so does the mark-up allowed to such companies. The people who made these representations claim that they are aware of cases where the stocks held in the selling company are low relative to its profits, whereas the converse is the case in the associated manufacturing company.  Therefore, in some cases, the method of apportionment prescribed in this Schedule would not give the same measure of stock relief as if the manufacturing group did not use a selling company.</P>
      <P>Consequently, it is suggested that paragraph 3 (2) be amended to enable the manufacturing and selling companies to make a joint election to apportion the relief by reference to trading profits rather than their stockholding.</P>

    <P>This amendment is on the lines of one I put down in 1973 and again last year. It was dealt with in 1973.  It was never reached last year at the time when the Finance Bill was guillotined through. The amendment is put down in the light of the exemption of stamp duty on a fine up to £1,000.  I found it very difficult to see what is the justification for charging stamp duty on small amounts of rent, whether they are in a long lease or in a tenancy agreement. When I moved a similar amendment in 1973, the Minister did not disagree with the principle I put forward but told me he could not do everything in one year and it was hoped this would be done in the succeeding year.  It was not done last year and, so far, it has not been done this year.</P>
    <P>There is the incongruous situation that on the part of the consideration that represents the fine there is no <Col N="908" /> stamp duty up to £1,000 but even a tiny rent, whether by ground rent or in a tenancy agreement, is subject to duty.  Of course, the duty is not very high at the lower figures.  Where the term does not exceed 35 years or is indefinite, the duty on a rent of £100 per year is £1 so there would be no question of a substantial loss to the revenue.  In fact, there would be very little loss but it would make the matter more sensible in the light of the abolition in the last two years of duty on small capital considerations.</P>
    <P>In 1973 the Minister accepted the principle of what I am saying and this is the first opportunity we have had to bring it back again.  If it was valid then it is even more valid now with inflation running at a rate of 20 per cent per annum since then.  If the Minister is consistent with what was done in relation to capital payments or fines, I hope he will accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows I am not unsympathetic to the proposal he has made.  There has not been an adequate system of collecting information about rented property. It is possible the much-discussed new capital taxes may provide a better system of recording information about property.  A great deal of property is now held by people who convert single dwellings into multiple dwellings and collect rents from them.  I would anticipate in the not-too-distant future that some amendment would be made of the kind suggested by Deputy O'Malley but I think we have achieved quite an amount in this year's Finance Bill without adding to the number of new problems to be dealt with.  Even an easement can create problems somewhere along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another element which is not unimportant.  Deputy O'Malley might make little of it but, on reflection, perhaps he would not.  Many letting agreements are prepared in a situation that gives the tenant very little protection because often he is the weaker party.  The very obligation to stamp a letting agreement in its <Col N="909" /> own way has provided some protection for the tenant and not infrequently a landlord has found himself in a position of embarrassment where he failed to stamp an agreement.  Frequently because of failure to have a letting agreement stamped when it was entered into, the landlord has not dared to produce the agreement later on and this has operated to the advantage of the tenant.  It has been a protection for him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting the system is perfect but if there was not the surveillance that arises where letting agreements are entered into and stamped, it is probable that the operations in the rental market might lean somewhat against the tenant. There are enough disadvantages already operating against tenants without putting in an easement that would jeopardise their interests.</P>
      <P>The amount of the stamp duty is very small and the revenue will be quite small.  Certainly it is not an imposition on the parties to a letting agreement to have it stamped.  It is only a tiny fraction of the total outgoings involved in the preparation and execution of a lease and of the payments and benefits that arise afterwards. It cannot be said it is an imposition on the parties.  At most it is an inconvenience but until we have more knowledge about the operation of the whole system of landlord and tenant operations with regard to flat dwellings I consider it desirable to retain this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have heard from the Minister has been most interesting.  It was worth putting down the amendment just to hear some of the admissions we got from the Minister but there has not been a reply to the argument I put forward now, any more than there was in 1973. However, we now know the Revenue Commissioners are making a surreptitious copy of tenancy agreements sent to them for stamping and that they are using this for income tax purposes.  We have the word of the Minister for Finance in the Dáil to <Col N="910" /> that effect.  The only argument the Minister made against my proposal was not an argument of principle but simply that it suited the Revenue Commissioners to keep in touch with the letting of land and property, particularly in relation to people who are turning houses into multiple dwellings.</P>
      <P>The Particulars Delivered Stamp under the 1909-10 Finance Act does not apply to tenancy agreements and, in the normal way, the Revenue would not get a copy or an abstract of a deed or a lease.  It is interesting to know the Revenue Commissioners are using this very small stamp duty as a way of checking up on people as to whether they have let property and, if so, at what rate.  The fact that the small amount of duty may be lost would not matter but the substantial amount they might get in income tax from the parties to the letting would matter.  I do not think the surreptitious activities of the Revenue Commissioners in making use of the information they get as a result of the stamping of documents should be an excuse to retain a duty that is otherwise not acceptable in principle when sales for £1,000 or less are free of duty.</P>
      <P>The remark of the Minister that this was a protection for the tenant by forcing the landlord to stamp the agreement is of doubtful validity because the tenant is liable for stamp duty under any normal agreement. Prior to 1967 he was liable for the costs also.  If for some reason the agreement is not signed at the time it is executed, there is nothing to stop the landlord stamping it five or ten years later under a penalty.  I understand the interest does not exceed the amount of the original duty. Therefore, a duty of £2 will only cost £4 even if several years have elapsed.  There is no embarrassment caused to landlords although it may well be caused to tenants because they may not feel like paying the duty but they are liable for it, not the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little disturbed to hear from the Minister that those agreements are used for the purpose for which he mentioned.  One would have hoped <Col N="911" /> that the Revenue Commissioners would not be bothered checking up on people to the extent that they read agreements for small lettings and presumably take copies of them.  That appears to be the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's third reason for not accepting the amendment was that there were enough good things in the Finance Bill for this year and that he did not want to create another problem.  That is almost exactly what he said two years ago, that this amendment would be a grand thing but that they would do it some other year.  In other words, there is no reason why it should not be done except for the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are using this as a means of getting information they would not otherwise get and the few shillings or pounds do not matter.</P>
    <P>That is the wrong approach on the part of the Minister.  If the Revenue Commissioners want information about lettings let him put a section in the Finance Bill.  Let him do it openly and say that whether it is liable for stamp duty or not a copy of every letting agreement shall be sent to the Revenue Commissioners.  That is the honest way to do it.  I do not like this method.  Because they have the excuse of collecting the few shillings on the tenancy agreement they retain it even though it is anachronistic and does not fit in with the abolition of duty on capital fines of £1,000 or less.  They still retain duties as small as 5p under this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The three reasons given by the Minister do not invalidate what I have put forward.  He should accept the amendment and, if he wants to, let him put a section into this Bill on Report Stage but take away this silly, troublesome little obligation to stamp agreements which are frequently so small that it must cost the Revenue Commissioners more to collect this duty than they get out of it.  Some of the duties payable are as low as 5p and the time alone of the official in calculating the duty and in impressing the stamp must come to 50p even if he only takes a short time to do it.  It has to be posted to the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="912" /> and posted back.  The stamp to send it back must cost more than the amount of duty in some cases. Those foolish little duties should be forgotten about.  I thought most of them were abolished some years ago. There were duties on receipts, cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes which were so small that they were done away with.  At least when one was stamping cheques one could stamp thousands of them together but with this each one must be done individually. Each one has to be examined and a duty calculated.  It is just not worthwhile.  If it is of use to the Revenue Commissioners for other purposes they should put in a section asking for copies of agreements and not do it in this back-door way.</P>

      <P>I wondered why the Deputy was talking about it for so long.  I hope he knows by now it is only names and addresses that are required.  Any person who has an income from lettings should disclose the information to the Revenue Commissioners for income tax purposes. Unfortunately they do not.  The law does not require the lessee to pay the stamp duty.  In practice a landlord may require, as a condition of the tenancy, that the lessee pays but that is a matter for negotiation in each case.  There is no obligation under the law imposed upon the lessee to pay the stamp duty.  Anyway it is only buttons compared with the fee that would be payable to the professional advisers in the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1973 the reason why the Minister, quite rightly in my opinion, abolished duty on a capital fine up to £1,000 payable in a transaction was that the amount involved was so small that it was not worth the trouble of collecting it.  At that time the duty on £1,000, as far as I can remember, was £5 or a little less.  That was regarded as so small that it was not worth collecting.  I would like to read out the list of duties that are payable under this.  The sum of £5 was too small in 1973 to be collected but now the Minister says that the economy will break down if he does not get 5p, 10p, 15p, 20p, 25p, 50p, and 75p.  Then you come to the big time&mdash;£1.  We suggest it is not worth the time of the Revenue Commissioners to collect those sums.  I can say without fear of contradiction that they cost more to collect than they provide.  This is a joke.</P>
      <P>At least the second time the Minister spoke only about the duty to tell the Revenue Commissioners about one's income from lettings.  He did not try the one about there being too many &ldquo;goodies&rdquo; in the package.  It has now been narrowed down to the fact that it is not to collect those amounts, it is to get information surreptitiously that the Revenue Commissioners want those things retained. How could the Minister say in 1973 that it was not worth collecting £5 and in 1975, the Coalition's inflation having ravaged the country in the meantime, that it is worth collecting 5p?  Can the Minister answer that?</P>

      <P>In the case of an outside transfer of property particulars <Col N="914" /> have to be delivered to the Revenue Commissioners so that there is information about the sale and the purchase.  Furthermore, the deal would have to be transferred or registered either in the Registry of Deeds or in the Land Registry.  Therefore, information becomes available even if a stamp is not imposed on the deed. However, in regard to a letting, there will be no record of a transaction by way of PD from or by registration.  I have told the Deputy I anticipate that in the foreseeable future there may be some movement in this field.  For the reasons he advanced and for other reasons, that date will be sooner rather than later.</P>

If the arguments are valid now&mdash;and the Minister has accepted them as such&mdash;would it not be logical and responsible to sweep away all this nonsense?  If he wishes to bring in another system he should do so openly.  So far as we are concerned he is free to table an amendment for Report Stage when we could recommit this part of the Bill, if necessary. I am not saying that we would accept any such amendment but we would be free either to accept it or vote against it.  Then, the country will know where it stands.  It is ridiculous that the Revenue Commissioners, for this surreptitious purpose, are expected to spend £1, £2 or £3 in order to collect 5p, 10p or 15p.</P>
      <P>Unless the Minister can answer my question as to why, since it was considered uneconomic to collect £5 in 1973, it is to be economic to collect 5p in 1975, he should accept the amendment and stop this waffling.  If he is to bring in some new investigatory procedures that is fair enough but we would like to know what they are so that we might decide whether to accept them.  What we have heard from the Minister will only raise suspicions in the minds of any normal persons.  I wonder what horrors are in store for us all under the Minister's further proposals, those about which we do not know yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Schedule, the reason that it is set out here is because in the budget the Minister increased stamp duty on transactions between £20,000 and £50,000 from 3 per cent to 4 per cent and he increased the duty on transactions in excess of £50,000 from 5 per cent to 6 per cent.  At the time these provisions got little or no publicity because many people do not know what stamp duty is and are not concerned with it unless they have to pay it. These increases have a definite bearing on the cost in respect of a number of people whose importance in our economic life is considerable.  For example, a builder buying land for building houses would rarely be able to buy any worthwhile quantity for <Col N="917" /> less than £20,000 and the extra £10 on £1,000 or £100 on £10,000 in addition to the duty for which he would be liable already, would make some contribution to increasing the cost of houses.  Inflation, generally, is putting up house prices anyway so that increasing numbers of properties are coming within the £20,000 and upwards category.  Presumably the Minister tries to justify this increase on the ground that only people with large amounts of money can pay £20,000 for any kind of property.  I would point out to the Minister that, over the past two years, scarcely any farm would fetch less than £20,000. Quite a modest farm in many parts of the country will make £20,000.  Quite a moderately sized farm in most parts of the country will cost more than £50,000.  Not everybody realises that, if they buy a medium sized farm for slightly over £50,000, they are paying 6 per cent duty on that since 1st March.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fourth Schedule implements the budget resolutions, or decisions, or whatever they are.  I am talking about them.  In spite of the Minister's wish that I should not talk about them I will continue to talk about them with your indulgence, Sir.  As a result of this budget decision or resolution which this schedule now seeks to put into permanent effect, anyone buying a moderately sized farm, by no means a big farm, will pay 6 per cent duty to the State.  On a little over £50,000 that is duty of a little over £3,000. Many people do not realise that they are liable for tax until they have to fork it out all of a sudden.  In addition they have to pay land registry fees and solicitors' fees.  These expenses can often be considerable.  Younger people wishing to start off in life by buying a farm will find themselves hit with all kinds of unexpected expenses.</P>
      <P>It is wrong that there should be a considerable increase in duty at this time, and not at a very high end of the scale for luxury properties, but for properties purchased for £20,000 and upwards.  A small business could make that now.  A fairly big house could make that now.  Any sort of a farm will make that now.  Any sort of building land if it is more than a few acres will make that now.  The consequential difficulties which are created are not insignificant.  At this time when so much advice is given about trying to keep down costs it seems extraordinary that the Government should deliberately put up the cost of housing and the cost of farming and various associated matters.  If this increase were in respect of property worth over £100,000 it might be understandable but at a time of rampant inflation, to increase the duties on properties worth £20,000 and over seems to me to be foolish and unjustified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemption was brought in in 1973 for sales up to £1,000.  Since then the value of money has gone down by about 40 per cent.  It is not <Col N="919" /> unreasonable to ask that that exemption limit of £1,000 should be increased by at least 40 per cent.  Because of inflation I do not think it is justified to put up stamp duty at all, because the take of the State increases in exactly the same proportion as the increase in inflation.</P>

We are all talking about the difficulties of housing and the effects of inflation on people who are transferring under this schedule.  The stamp duty on £7,000 would be £110.  As I read this schedule it would be more than one-seventh. That should be sufficient comment from the city point of view to reinforce what Deputy O'Malley has said from the general point of view and the agricultural point of view.</P>

      <P>It is so long since we were talking about this Bill that the continuity I had envisaged when I reported progress is hardly applicable tonight.  I want to make two points in general before I go on to an analysis of the Bill.  I have pointed out already on the other Bill, and by way of introduction I want to point out again, that the Minister and the Government have embarked upon a massive programme of taxation, capital and current, in the present year.  This programme is designed to meet the demands of the State machine.  Most of it will be applied to State housekeeping rather than capital purposes.  This massive programme of taxation, of which this Bill is a part, is unsupported by either a programme or a project for the economic revival and development we, on this side of the House, believe is necessary for its support. Herein lies the fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition in the approach to this Bill just as there was the same fundamental difference in our approach to the other items in the general chain of legislation comprising this massive programme of taxation.</P>
      <P>It is relevant to point out here as a basis for this Bill, and as part of this taxation programme, that in the past social development and revenue buoyancy and the social value of taxation programmes depended on the level of productive economic activity. The essential difference now is that whereas, in the past, there were social provisions like the Social Welfare Act we discussed some time ago and provisions for getting more revenue for useful purposes through taxation, all that was supported by programmes of development, particularly in the 1960s when we had specific programmes for economic expansion which were the fundamental basis and <i>sine aua non</i> for supporting all the rest.  This Government have no such programme, but they are still taking the money, and what we fear on this side is that the camel, so to speak, has embarked on a programme of living on its own hump.  That is something that cannot go on indefinitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> That is the first general point I want to make.  It underlines the essential difference between the two sides of the House.  If that is clearly understood, then our differences and our agreement on particular measures and particular sections of these measures can be put into perspective. It goes without saying that there is much in what the Minister is doing that would be both desirable and beneficial if properly supported by the economic activity to which I have referred and by programmes similar to the former programmes for economic expansion to which I have also referred.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the situation is even a little worse than that.  In the absence of such economic development and support, I fear that the impact of inflation will be such as to aggravate the problems of State housekeeping, to depress the living standards of citizens, to make the burden of taxation more onerous than it would otherwise be on the taxpayer and contribute to creating difficulties, of which local inflation and unemployment are symptoms, and to aggravate the deeper causes which are reflected in these symptoms.  These are the fears that have to be expressed at the outset. Be that as it may, I do not see a great deal of point in labouring the matter further at this particular moment but I make the point to underline the essential difference between the two sides here and as something that must be kept in mind in fixing the perspective of our agruments on particular provisions.</P>
    <P>As part of this massive taxation programme the Minister is putting through this year, we have proposals for capital taxation.  Proposals for capital taxation in the modern context, properly geared to the realities of the economic situation, may well be justifiable and desirable but again the question must be asked whether the programme the Minister has undertaken is either justifiable or desirable and whether it will, in effect, bring the returns the Minister hopes to get from the more narrow fiscal point of view or whether, as some of us who are, perhaps, more <Col N="922" /> pessimistic fear, it will only aggravate the problems of supporting the revenue the State needs&mdash;whether, instead of increasing revenue, the contribution made to inflation and to depressing buoyancy and collectibility of revenue may be such as to nullify the benefits the Minister hopes to get from this taxation.</P>
    <P>Again, I must make a point&mdash;it is a point we had to make this morning &mdash;that the Minister has chosen to bring in this code piecemeal.  He has brought in three separate Bills&mdash;the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Wealth Tax Bill and this Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and it is not possible to put them in separate compartments any more than it was possible this morning to discuss section 45 of the Finance Bill without referring to this Bill.  I want to keep within the rules of order and I do not think I will be trespassing on them if I describe the scheme of capital taxation as follows: we had heretofore the system of death duties for the taxation of capital. There were other provisions like stamp duty and so on but these were ancillary.  The Minister now claims to have abolished death duties.  We had that argument only today and, again, I repeat that he did no such thing.  If he will have his point, if he did abolish them, which he did not, with what has he replaced them?  He has replaced them with a capital acquisitions tax, a tax on all appreciation of property, a tax which will cash in on, so to speak, and get a rake-off from inflation.  There is a wealth tax, which is a capital tax pure and simple on the value of the property involved, and there is now this Bill which specifically not only deals with the area formerly covered by death duties but also deals with gifts <i>inter vivos.</i> If you take those three provisions and even this provision by itself I believe the statement I made this morning when I said the Minister has widened the net and narrowed the mesh is justified.  Very good for generalities, now to specifics on this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill does two things.  It puts a tax, effectively for the first time, without going into small detail, on <Col N="923" /> gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, that is gifts without consideration, transfers of property of any sort, real or chattel <i>inter vivos.</i> That is widening the net.  It then puts on a tax which can very appropriately be described as a death duty, because that is what it is, on property which devolves on death.  It makes changes in the procedures, if I understood the Minister's argument this morning, but leaves them essentially the same.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be characterised as the Bill which put back on 1st April death duties which were removed by the Finance Bill on the same date.  I said this morning there was not even one hour's hiatus.  I say now there is continuity.  First of all, this Bill has a very long interpretation section.  Lest there be any doubt about its taxation relating to death it has a full section, section 3, defining the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;on a death&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first section is the short title and the next two sections are simply definition sections.  That comprises Part I of the Bill.  Part II deals with the gift tax.  In plain language a tax that somebody is to pay is a tax, whatever you call it.  Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>A capital acquisitions tax, to be called gift tax and to be computed as hereinafter provided, shall, subject to this Act and the regulations thereunder, be charged, levied and paid upon the taxable value of every taxable gift taken by a donee, where the date of the gift is on or after the 28th day of February, 1974.</P>
    <P>As far as gifts are concerned we go back to the 28th February, 1974 and every transaction <i>inter vivos</i> that is within the meaning of sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Act become liable to tax.</P>
    <P>There are, understandably, sections to deal with joint ownership and so on.  A detailed discussion on those would be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  I am concerned that it will be realised that this is a new scheme of taxation that is being imposed. I am not disputing that there may be a case for this approach but let us be honest about it and say what <Col N="924" /> we are doing.  Let me again voice the essential difference between the two sides of the House.  We feel those provisions need the support, primarily, of a proper economic development programme whereas the Government do not seem to see the need for this.</P>
    <P>We now come to what must be, in effect, a continuation of the argument this morning.  The Minister was very vehement that he had abolished death duties.  I refer to the record of what transpired in the House this morning as to whether under the Finance Bill he did or did not.  Perhaps I may be allowed to recall that I was able to point out&mdash;Deputy Colley and other Deputies also pointed it out&mdash;that substantively, procedurally, in contemplation of the law that was not the case.  Even if it were the case, even if he abolished death duties on this, the last day of April, 1975, we are now on the same day discussing a Bill which brings back death duties under another guise, continuous with the ones we discussed this morning, without any hiatus.</P>
    <P>Let me take Part III of the Capital Acquisition Tax Bill.  Section 10 states:</P>
    <P>A capital acquisitions tax, to be called inheritance tax and to be computed as hereinafter provided, shall, subject to this Act and the regulations thereunder, be charged, levied and paid upon the taxable value of every taxable inheritance taken by a successor, where the date of the inheritance is on or after the 1st day of April, 1975.</P>
    <P>Then it goes on to say in the following section:</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this Act, where, under or in consequence of any disposition, a person becomes beneficially entitled in possession on a death to any benefit (whether or not the person becoming so entitled already has any interest in the property in which he takes such benefit), otherwise than for full consideration in money or money's worth paid by him, he shall be deemed to take an inheritance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> Then you have the definition of taxable inheritance in the following section, which boils down to the fact that any property that devolves on the occasion of a death into the hands of another is a taxable inheritance. This raises two rather interesting points.  What is the nature of the inheritance tax?  Heretofore we had estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  There were legal distinctions in the various sort of duties. This inheritance tax partakes of the nature of all of them.  It is of the nature of estate duty in that it attaches, in the last analysis, to the property although the successor, the person receiving it by definition in this Act, is primarily the person to whom the Revenue Commissioners will look for payment.</P>
    <P>It clearly is of the nature of legacy duty and the remainder of the provisions of the Act that they would provide that there is no escaping residue just as the succession duty or any residuary duties provided.  I submit I am in order in stating that in Part III of this Bill death duties are being put back into operation.  When I asked some questions in relation to this matter this morning the Minister was quick to point out that it was on this Bill that the matter arises.  For this reason I am glad to be able to avail of the opportunity to put those questions.  In order to understand the procedure of the Act we have to see what the procedure is at present.  On a death where property of the deceased is left&mdash;and this is of the essence in this Bill and in the old law if the Minister's contention is right that he has abolished it&mdash;someone is entitled to it and that person has to move to secure the title.  What usually happens with property of any reasonable size is that the personal representative or some interested party moves and an inland revenue affidavit is furnished in pursuance of which, if I understand the situation correctly, the Revenue Commissioners issue a provisional grant assessment.  On that with the appropriate receipt which constitutes the primary documents an application can be made to the probate office of the court and a grant of <Col N="926" /> probate issues if there is a will and letters of administration if it is an intestacy.  On the provisional assessment duty is payable and paid.</P>
    <P>Not only is duty payable but I believe the receipt is regarded as a primary document before the grant will issue.  There is then the final cleaning up of the estate, the furnishing of a corrective affidavit, if necessary, and the provisional assessment is superseded by the final assessment. The balance of estate duty is paid, legacy duty is paid where appropriate, subject to provisions relating to near relations or to charities.  Succession duty comes after specific requests. When the matters are cleared up the Revenue Commissioners will issue a certificate of discharge.  When I raised this matter this morning the Minister said that under this Bill the Revenue Commissioners would not collect until a later stage than at present. On that occasion I submitted, and it was not contradicted, that it would appear that the rest of the procedure would be exactly as it is at present.  In the interests of clarity I should like to analyse this situation in the light of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The first thing to notice is that although in the first instance this inheritance tax is another name for death duties it is attached to the actual legacy.  It is still a charge on the property so that to make a distinction between legacy duty and estate duty on that ground would be a distinction without a difference; the two are rolled up together.  Having regard to that we have substantively the same situation as we had yesterday afternoon.  With regard to procedure, section 35 defines accountable persons and it distinguishes between the donee or successor&mdash;we are talking about inheritance.  It defines primarily accountable persons as the accountable persons which includes every trustee, guardian, committee, personal representative, agent or other person in whose care any property comprised in the gift or the income therefrom is placed at the date of the gift or at any time thereafter and every person in whom the property is vested after that date, <Col N="927" /> other than a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser, or mortgagee for consideration in money or money's worth.</P>
    <P>In the same section, subsection (6) states that the tax shall be recoverable from any one or more of the accountable persons and the personal representatives of any accountable persons who are dead.  Accountable persons in subsection (6) obviously refer to accountable persons as defined in subsection (1) and subsection (2).  Substantatively death duties remain and by virtue of section 35 the liabilities of agents and personal representatives essentially remain.  Then we come to the procedure for recovery of tax.</P>
    <P>I now come to section 38.  In section 38 provision is made for retaining the Inland Revenue affadavit, which is referred to in inverted commas.  Subsection (2) goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Inland Revenue Affadavit required for an application for probate or letters of administration shall extend to the verification of a statement of the following particulars...</P>
    <P>and a number of things are set out there.  It seems to me, that being so, whatever rules of court or other legislation is there unrepealed which provides for the primary documents being necessary to ground the application and granting of a grant, whether probate or letters of administration, that that procedure substantially remains and there is nothing in this Bill or in anything we did this morning that changes that.  That is reinforced. I want to pursue what I was pursuing with the Minister this morning but, in order to fill in the picture I want to say that on this point it is to be noted that the same section 38 provides for a correcting affadavit.  The Bill provides for receipts and certificates of relief and discharge.  That is in section 48.  Unless I am greatly mistaken, not only does this Bill continue death duties in an attempted disguised form but it also continues the procedures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> It is here that there may be a point of difference and this is what I want the Minister to elucidate: this morning the Minister informed me that not alone would there be a provisional grant assessment and a payment on foot thereof and as far as I could ascertain&mdash;I have not as yet had an opportunity of reading the record&mdash; if I understood the Minister aright, no duty would be payable or required by the Revenue Commissioners until the perfection of the transaction by the fact that the gift has vested in possession in the successor. If I have misinterpreted the Minister in that I would like to be corrected but if that is the Minister's intention I would like to question whether that is going to be the effect of the Bill because there are two provisions in this Bill that we must have regard to in that connection&mdash;sections 41 and 21.</P>
    <P>Let me make my point clear.  I am asking the question: at what point is the tax payable?  That is a very relevant question from two points of view because, first of all, the point at which it is payable is of much interest to the Revenue Commissioners who are very concerned about delay in tax collection and we have heard a great deal about it.  If there were to be a change from the present system to delay any collection to the end of the perfection of the transaction I can see quite a period elapsing in which the Revenue Commissioners are out of their money.  That is the Revenue Commissioners' side but in fact that could happen.</P>
    <P>We must be on the alert as to what is happening because the Minister provides a very stiff interest provision and interest will be payable from a date very close to the date at which the tax is payable.  Let us pursue this a little more deeply.  Section 41 says that the tax shall be due and payable on the valuation date.  Subsection (2) of the section says:</P>
    <P>Simple interest at the rate of one and one-half per cent, per month or part of a month, without deduction of income tax, shall be payable upon the tax from the valuation date to the date of payment of the <Col N="929" /> tax and shall be chargeable and recoverable in the same manner as if it were part of the tax.</P>
    <P>So, it is very relevant indeed to inquire when was the valuation date. We must therefore refer to section 21, which says:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of subsection (7), the valuation date of a taxable gift shall be the date of the gift.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) says:</P>
    <P>The valuation date of a taxable inheritance, other than a taxable inheritance referred to in subsection (2) or (3), shall be the earliest date of the following&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  The earliest date on which a personal representative or trustee or the successor or any other person is entitled to retain the subject matter of the inheritance for the benefit of the successor or of any person in right of the successor or on his behalf;</P>
    <P>(b)  the date on which the subject matter of the inheritance is so retained; or</P>
    <P>(c)  the date of delivery, payment or other satisfaction or discharge of the subject matter of the inheritance to the successor or for his benefit or to or for the benefit of any person in right of the successor or on his behalf. </P>
    <P>Take (a)&mdash;</P>
    <P>The earliest date on which a personal representative or trustee or successor or any other person is entitled to retain the subject matter of the inheritance.</P>
    <P>It is from that date that the tax is payable and interest thereon when accrued is payable as part of the tax. Therefore, the Minister will appreciate why I am pursuing this matter to find out when this tax is payable.</P>
    <P>Again, what happens in the case of a death?  Somebody is involved, some person, and remember the words used there&mdash;&ldquo;personal representative,&rdquo; or &ldquo;trustee,&rdquo; or &ldquo;successor&rdquo; or any other person.  Therefore, any person <Col N="930" /> who is either entitled to, or in possession of the property concerned, fixes the valuation date by virtue of being in that category.  What happens? When a person dies, somebody, <i>somebody</i> has to move.  Presumably, as soon as that person moves they have an interest of that nature.  It seems to me that an agent, a personal representative, a successor&mdash;that is, a person entitled within the meaning of the Act&mdash;anybody in that category, immediately they become involved in the transaction at all, fixes the valuation date.  Therefore, would I be wrong&mdash;I ask the Minister&mdash;in supposing that the very moment any person moves to furnish an Inland Revenue affidavit, that that is the valuation date under section 21?  If that is the valuation date, then there is no alteration in the procedure at all.  The tax would become payable and it would behove him, in view of the interest provisions, to pay it, and pay it voluntarily.  That is just another aspect of one of the objectionable features of a lot of this legislation, namely, that the Revenue Commissioners will be relieved of all duties of assessment, in the first instance, the onus will be placed on the taxpayer to pay up and let the Revenue Commissioners revise at their leisure.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said, I should like to ask the Minister again whether he is accurate in what he said this morning&mdash;whether, in view of the procedures I have outlined, which appear to be identical in effect, with minor variations, with the current procedures that the tax is not payable before the grant; whether it is not open to the Revenue Commissioners to so construe the provisions; whether, indeed&mdash;in view of the very limited terms of section 45 which we passed this morning&mdash;any change whatsoever has been made in court procedures; whether the probate registrar, or whoever is responsible, will accept the primary documents without the receipt for something. Therefore, the provisional assessment remains, although a significant change may be made that that provisional assessment is, so to <Col N="931" /> speak, made by the taxpayer himself rather than by the Revenue Commissioners. That is a point that needs clarification.  I freely admit I may be completely in error.  But I was precluded from following it up this morning by the Minister's objection and I should like to have it clarified.</P>
    <P>Certainly, having regard to the impact of sections such as section 47 and others, the definitive section 10; having regard also to section 35, defining accountable persons and their liability; to section 41, which defines when the tax is due and payable and provides for interest; finally, having regard to section 21, which provides a definition of the valuation date of a taxable inheritance, I wonder if the Minister's contention this morning is an accurate interpretation of the Bill before us.  I wonder is it an interpretation that will satisfy the Revenue Commissioners.  With those preliminaries I should like to see the remainder of the matter worked out as we go through Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the Minister can have claimed to have abolished death duties unless one tries to escape the technicality that death duties mean only, in a narrow sense, estate legacy and succession duties, as defined by previous statutes.  I am not aware that &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; is a statutorily defined term. I think it was a useful term when referring in general to the specifics I have mentioned.  Unless one tries to interpret the words &ldquo;death duties&rdquo; in that narrow sense I do not see how on earth the Minister can pretend he has abolished them.  Death duties remain. As we said this morning, even the old law remains.  Although the old duties will not be leviable, the law remains and the duties subsist in contemplation of law and in actual practical application to every death before the 1st April, 1975.  Those death duties, with modifications and adjustments, both in substance and procedure, continue under this Bill. But they are essentially death duties and the procedures essentially the same.  That is the point I want to <Col N="932" /> hammer home.  I think it will clear the air for a constructive discussion of what the Minister is doing in this Bill.  The more detailed arguments can be followed up on Committee Stage.  There is, for example, section 36 relating to the delivery of returns. There are distinctions there between the primary accountable people and otherwise.  In any event, agents and everybody else&mdash;personal representatives and so on&mdash;are captured within the terms of these sections and the matter will entail a certain amount of detailed analysis.</P>
    <P>What I cannot say at the moment &mdash;it would take an expert in tax law to say&mdash;is whether the changes, such as they are, are in any way in aid of the taxpayer, or whether they are simply further provisions in aid of the Administration and of the Revenue Commissioners in the collection of these taxes.  Again, it is unnecessary to refer to the overburden that is upon them; they have indeed been overburdened.  I, for one, would not like to stand in the way of any <i>bona fide</i> assistance we can give them in performing their duty under this Act.  I am concerned that we are overloading them with duties.</P>
    <P>There are parts of the Bill that are commendable.  I do not want to deny the Minister credit for his approach and for the reliefs he has given but, in order to put the whole matter in perspective, I must advert to the point made by Deputy O'Malley on the Finance Bill.  It is perfectly correct to provide the exemptions that are set out in the Second Schedule having regard to the current rate of inflation, but Deputy O'Malley pointed out certain consequences that may not have been in the Minister's mind.  Even though his argument may not be a popular one, it is worth the attention of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about the abolition of death duties but there is one aspect that has been completely forgotten.  One of the arguments for removing death duties was that if these duties were minimised it would be possible to attract capital.  This was a major argument but it has been completely submerged <Col N="933" /> in the argument of personal hardship which the Minister, to his credit, has met.  In fact, there is no abolition of death duties and the whole capital taxation scheme works in the opposite direction.  The net has been widened and the mesh narrowed.  However, that is a consideration I am not going to press on the Minister and I mention it merely to stress that death duties have not been abolished.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has done is to revise the provision for death duties as part of a wider capital taxation scheme.  He is imposing new taxation, in the course of which he is giving some exemptions.  I do not want to take from the value of these exemptions to a wide range of people.  I have been critical of the Minister in some instances but I should like to express appreciation where it is due.</P>
    <P>The remainder of this Bill is largely a matter for Committee Stage.  However, perhaps the Minister could clarify the following points. Section 53 (1) states:</P>
    <P>The first £250 of the total taxable value of all taxable gifts taken by a donee from any one disponer in any relevant period shall be exempt from tax and shall not be taken into account in computing tax.</P>
    <P>I thought that at the moment the sum allowed was £500.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>This Bill, like the other Bills, is difficult to deal with because they are all part of one transaction.  I fear the net result of the Minister's actions will be more inflation.  It will be self-defeating.  I regret this because there is much in the legislation that deals with urgent problems.  However, the way the Minister has chosen to deal with these matters is an inefficient one, one that deprives this House of the opportunity to discuss the matter and, although it is designed to help the administration, it will clog and paralyse it.  We must keep these points in mind on the other Stages.</P>

      <P>In the short time at my disposal this evening I can hardly even begin to deal with the complex provisions of this Bill.  It is no harm to remind Members that two new and separate taxes are contained in this Bill, the gift tax and the inheritance tax.  They form only two of the four new capital taxes being introduced by the Minister, allegedly in lieu of death duties.  The other two are the wealth tax and capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>The real problem we must assess is whether the old system, with whatever modifications might be thought desirable, is preferable from the point of view of individuals and the economy generally.  We must assess if it is preferable to the very complicated system of four new taxes.  It is my belief that the damage which has clearly been done to the economy since the publication of the proposal of the Government in relation to capital taxation generally on 28th February, 1974, has been great, even though the Bills have not yet been passed and put into effect.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  At column 537, volume 280 of the Official Report replied:</P>
      <P>In their January, 1975, report, the National Prices Commission recommended to me that the practice of advertising each month the list of authorised price increases in the national newspapers should be discontinued.  The reasons for this recommendation are set out in detail in the report.  Copies of the report are available in the Oireachtas Library and have been circulated to each Deputy.  The main reasons for the recommendation are as follows:</P>
      <P>I will take each reason seriatim and show what we regard as the spuriousness of each one.  The first reason was:</P>
      <P> (i)  Since price increases by firms which have been wholly or partially exempted from price control are not included in the list of authorised price increases, the list is no longer comprehensive.</P>
      <P>The reality is that the comprehensiveness of the advertisement would no longer be applicable.  The Minister could quite clearly indicate the limitations on the advertisement.  He could state that the advertisement was not comprehensive and relate his remarks to the particular price increases which were intended to be conveyed.</P>
      <P>The second reason was:</P>
      <P>(ii)  Almost all increases approved will have already been implemented before the date on which the relevant monthly report appears.  Thus the list of authorised price increases that appeared in the press advertisement was more likely to confuse than inform the consumers.  The commission's recommendation was accepted. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of confusion, surely the Minister could make quite clear <Col N="936" /> the date when the price increases would become operative.  There should be no difficulty in that respect. This particular paragraph of the reply shows a total lack of understanding of the housewife who, in our respectful submission, cannot be confused by clearly worded advertisements stating where prices have been increased and where it is intended to increase prices.  That part of the Minister's reply is an insult to the intelligence of the housewife.  The housewife has become price-shocked and to suggest that this advertisement would confuse her is putting her intelligence at the minimum.  We reject the fallacy and the superficial thinking of the Minister as displayed in that part of his reply.</P>
    <P>The reply continued:</P>
    <P>The commission have stressed that price increases will continue to be made widely known.  All price increases sanctioned by them will appear in their monthly reports, which are usually well covered by the national press.</P>
    <P>The national press is basically geared to what is newsworthy.  The National Prices Commission report cannot be published in its totality, having regard to the newsworthiness aspect, which means there will be selectivity so it is unfair to suggest that the newspapers can undo the harm which the Minister is doing by not publishing the advertisement.  He seems to be putting on the newspapers the obligation to do his job for him.  The Minister has a bounden duty to produce the full range of price increases in the advertisement which has been published almost since the inception of the National Prices Commission in October, 1971.  The newspapers, of course, would also be limited by the problem of space.  It is untrue to suggest that the newspapers will or can carry the full range of price increases which up to now have been in the advertisement.  The advertisement has one great merit.  It has the advantage of accessibility.  We believe the Minister has an obligation to let people know about price increases on foot of the Government's now well worn promise <Col N="937" /> of open Government.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce was sincere about this promise he should surely be open about price increases. He is deliberately setting out here to engage in some form of cover up.  His reasons for not publishing the advertisement given in reply to the questions by Deputy O'Malley and myself are totally out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 152 of the January, 1975 report states that:</P>
    <P>After our November 1973 Report had been published, we wrote to the Consumers' Association of Ireland, the Confederation of Irish Industries, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Housewives' Association, asking for their comments and observations.  All the comments that were submitted were published in full in our March 1974 Report (No. 27).</P>
    <P>The response of the Consumers' Association of Ireland was that they wished the advertisements to continue, that there be a demand for the curbing of rising prices and that they would be opposed to argument against the publication of price increases.</P>
    <P>The CFI recognised the desirability of publishing all authorised price increases and considered that the most appropriate vehicle was the report of the commission.  In their opinion there was duplication in the publication of the prices in the Report and in the advertisements.  Consequently, they recommend that the report would be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The ICTU were opposed to any change in the general policy regarding the publishing of details of price increases. The Irish Housewives' Association were in favour of a continuance of publication of the monthly report of the commission.  Therefore, three of the four organisations concerned stated clearly that they supported the continued publication of prices in the advertisement.  Despite the views expressed by those organisations the Minister has decided not to publish the prices in the monthly advertisement.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 157 of the Report states and I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> Having considered these submissions, we concluded in our March 1974 Report (No. 27) that details of recommended price increases should continue to be published in full in the appendices to our monthly reports.  We recommended, however, that the practice of publishing each month the list of authorised price increases as an advertisement in the national newspaper should be discontinued.  These advertisements contained no information that was not already available in the appendices to each monthly report and the press release issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the date of its publication.  This recommendation was not accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In their report of March, 1974, the commission recommended that the advertisement be discontinued but the Minister, and rightly in our view, rejected the recommendation.  However, he accepts the same recommendation when it is put forward in the January, 1975 report.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, rather unfairly, has been sent here by the Minister to try to explain the Minister's decision.  We have the greatest sympathy for the Parliamentary Secretary who is placed in this difficult situation but he has an obligation to reply to us as to why the Minister changed his mind between March, 1974 and January, 1975 on this issue.</P>
    <P>The newspaper advertisement has the advantage of immediate accessibility. It is an easy reference.  When, with Deputy O'Malley, I raised this matter by way of question on Thursday last, we stated that the report of the NPC, of which 2,000 are published, is all very well but that the NPC tried on another occasion to justify their non-publication of price increases by using the term &ldquo;the psychology of inflation&rdquo;.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary explain that term in the context of the psychology of the non-publication of the advertisement?  Are both examples of psychology concomitant? Can he state why the Minister refuses to publish the advertisement?  This was of tremendous assistance to housewives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> Personally, I found publication of prices on a monthly basis to be very helpful in every respect, and it is only proper that on this side of the House we would pay tribute to the hard work done in this regard by the people concerned on the commission, but that is not the point.  The commission made recommendations but in the final analysis it is the Minister who must accept responsibility for the sanctioning of price rises.  Anything the Parliamentary Secretary may say in an effort to exonerate either the Minister or the Government will not work.  It is not good enough for the Minister to come here and tell us that the advertisements will not be published in the future. This attitude is a distinct change of mind on his part in a period of 12 months.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the whole area of price increases.  There seems to be the impression abroad that the Government can, on an almost daily basis, sanction price increases but that people do not seem to mind any more. Of course people are concerned with this issue but they have been so shocked by these almost daily price increases that they have gone beyond the stage of expressing their concern. Of course, too, they are concerned with the devaluation of the £ and the consequent inability of the £ on a weekly basis to buy the same amount of food as it bought the week before.  It is the duty of this House to articulate the people's concern and that is why we have raised this matter on the adjournment. I do not wish to indulge in political clichés but I must say that the Minister is engaging in a cover up because of the embarrassment caused him by the non-delivery of the promise to control inflation and price increases at an acceptable level.  We all accept that prices must be increased and that the rate of inflation must increase but the increases should be at an acceptable level.  However, the Government seem to be suffering from frozen feet in these matters.  I trust that, in reply, the Parliamentary Secretary will refrain from saying that in some way outside influences caused this inflation and these price increases.  That assertion <Col N="940" /> does not bear any examination, as is evident not only from the recent report of the Central Bank but from a recent statement by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the area of political clichés and to use expressions like &ldquo;not discharging their responsibilities&rdquo; or &ldquo;not performing their proper functions&rdquo;.  The non-publication of these advertisements is a deliberate cover-up by the Government in an attempt to prevent the housewife from getting the information to which she is entitled on price increases.  People are not getting access to that information.  There is no doubt that 2,000 booklets printed on a monthly basis is not sufficient. The Parliamentary Secretary will probably say they will publish as many booklets as are sought but that is not the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My submission in this discussion will be that very full information is already available and will continue to be available to the public on price increases.  The retention of the advertisements which Deputy Andrews is concerned about does not, on balance, serve a useful purpose.  These advertisements duplicate channels of information already available.  They are costly and incomplete and they contribute to what the National Prices Commission and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have described as the phenomenon of the psychology of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their March, 1974, report the National Prices Commission recommended that the practice of publishing each month a list of authorised price increases as an advertisement in the national newspapers should be discontinued.  The Minister did not accept the recommendation on that occasion.  Evidently the National Prices Commission were very strongly convinced of the rightness of their case in asking that these advertisements should be discontinued, because they returned again to this subject in their January report of 1975. <Col N="941" /> I would remind the Deputy and the House that the National Prices Commission would not have made this submission on two occasions if they were not convinced of its correctness. Among the members of the National Prices Commission are representatives of the Irish Housewives' Association and of the trade union interests who are deeply concerned with the phenomenon of inflation.</P>
    <P>On the second occasion in January, 1975, the National Prices Commission brought to light additional factors in relation to this matter.  They felt that this question should be reconsidered in the light of changes which had taken place during the past year.  When this issue was first examined by the commission in 1973, fewer firms were exempted from price control, with the result that the list of price increases in the monthly advertisements was more comprehensive and informative. Since the autumn of 1973, more firms and industries have been exempted from detailed price control, for example, laundries, dry cleaning establishments, hotels, restaurants, cinemas, dance halls, the animal feedstuffs and fertiliser industries, and all firms producing transportable goods and employing not more than 20 people, or with a turnover not exceeding £150,000 per annum.  In view of the fact that price increases by firms who have been wholly or partially exempted from price control are not included in the list of authorised price increases, the list is no longer comprehensive and, therefore, to that extent less useful in informing buyers of all the price increases which have been authorised or applied.</P>
    <P>I should also make the point that the advertisements refer only to home produced articles and, as the Deputy is aware, many of the goods being bought by the consumer are not home produced.  These advertisements were inserted in the newspapers long after the increases had taken place, in some cases up to two months afterwards. These advertisements followed the publication of the National Prices Commission report in which the particular price increase was dealt with. Of course, the price increase would <Col N="942" /> have taken place at the time when the NPC gave their decision, which they recommended to the Minister, and the Minister took a decision to grant the price increase.  This could have been up to two months before the advertisement was inserted.</P>
    <P>In any of those advertisements which were published approximately 90 percent of the increases so advertised would have already taken place.  Therefore, if you like, there was not much point in publishing a large advertisement telling housewives of price increases which had taken place and which were effective in the shops for up to two months perhaps.  I do not think that really served any useful purpose and it could confuse people who might think that the advertisement related to an increase which would take place in the future and it might, indeed, contribute to conditioning people to accept increases which were not authorised.</P>
    <P>For the reasons mentioned above, the National Prices Commission recommended in their January, 1975 report, and the Minister subsequently agreed, that the practice of publishing each month a list of authorised price increases as an advertisement in the national newspapers should be discontinued. The commission stressed that full details of all price increases recommended by them would continue to be published in their monthly reports and, as the Deputy has acknowledged, these are well publicised.  The NPC point out that if their recommendation is not accepted the cost to public funds of advertising price increases in 1975 will exceed £30,000.</P>
    <P>A further important point that might have been made by the commission was that the advertisements were, laterally at any rate, to a large extent not performing their purpose of informing the public of price increases. It is quite usual for manufacturers to produce a large number of products as well as different sizes of the same product but, because of marketing considerations, it would be unusual for a manufacturer to implement the same percentage increase in price on all products or categories of products.</P>
    <P>However, to list all the products involved <Col N="943" /> and to indicate the price increases for each product would entail the use of advertising space by the Department perhaps four or five times the size of that actually used with a cost, perhaps, of well over £100,000 per annum.  Because of this consideration the practice was adopted of giving in the advertisement the average increase in price where the price application related to a number of products or a range of products.  Telling a consumer that a range of products has increased by an average of, say, 15 per cent is, of course, quite useless.  What the consumer is interested in is the increase in price for each product and an average increase of 15 per cent could mean that individual products had increased by anything from ½ per cent to perhaps 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The following figures indicate the extent to which price increases were given as an average in the last four advertisements prior to their discontinuance. In the August-September report, of the 86 applications 44 were given as averages.  In October, of the 60 applications 30 were given as averages.  In November, of the 83 applications 30 were given as averages. In December, of the 71 applications 29 were given as averages.</P>
    <P>I would stress also that advertisements will continue to be inserted in the newspapers in relation to all products covered by maximum prices orders.  These advertisements will be published prior to the maximum prices orders coming into effect.  As the Deputy and the House are no doubt aware, maximum prices orders cover a very wide range of stable foodstuffs and groceries.</P>

This would not in any way serve to diminish the rate of inflation which we are suffering from, unfortunately, at the moment.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is not the holder of a qualification certificate which is an essential requirement for entitlement to unemployment assistance. It was decided by a deciding officer that his means were in excess of the amount which would entitle him to such a certificate.  This decision was upheld by an appeals officer. The person may, however, now be entitled to a certificate, which may <Col N="814" /> entitle him to assistance at a reduced rate, in view of the increased means limits which came into effect on 2nd April, 1975, and I am having this aspect of the matter examined.</P>
