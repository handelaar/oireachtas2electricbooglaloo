      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 1, 10, Votes 16 and 28 to 33, inclusive, No. 11 (resumed).  Votes 28 to 33 will be debated together.  The Dáil will sit next week as follows: Tuesday, 3 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., Wednesday, 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. and Thursday, 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m.</P>

      <P>It was my intention earlier this week to ask the Government to make time available for the usual debate on the adjournment.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach indicated yesterday that it was the intention to adjourn either this day fortnight or tomorrow fortnight. I hoped the Taoiseach would be present so that I could notify him direct.  I would like to hear from the Tánaiste if he can now indicate if time will be given for the usual adjournment debate prior to the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I might be allowed to reply to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. The Government have not yet considered if they will make time available for an adjournment debate.  I am not sure I should acquiesce in Deputy Lynch's description of it as a usual adjournment debate because the Dáil has been getting somewhat out of the habit of having adjournment debates in recent sessions and the need for them is perhaps less marked now that very much more time is made available to the Opposition by way of <Col N="910" /> Private Members' Time.  I will ask the Taoiseach to deal with the question of the Leader of the Opposition and to make an early statement in the House about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £120,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Attorney General, etc., and for the expenses of criminal prosecutions and other law charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Attorney General (Mr. Costello)</NameTxt>
      <P>Subhead B, the first subhead of this <Col N="911" /> Supplementary Estimate is a subhead which provides for the cost of travel, the provision of legal books and publications and other incidental office requirements for the Attorney General, the Chief State Solicitor, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and their staff.  The original Estimate subtantially underestimated the extent of the involvement in foreign travel of the legal officers in the Office of the Attorney General, particularly during the Irish Presidency of the European Communities.  In addition, unexpected travel was required for appearances before the European Commission of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  Of the total sum now in the subhead £16,000 will be required in respect of travel for the ten months to 31st October last.  Other factors resulting in the increase under this subhead include the increased cost of general office supplies since the Estimate was settled.  Furthermore, no provision had been made for the cost of establishing a separate office for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
      <P>Under subhead E expenses provided for include expenses of witnesses for the State in civil actions; payment of costs awarded against the State, except where paid from another Vote; expenses of juries, local state Solicitors' costs for official business; payments for reports of judgment, transcripts of evidence, copies of summonses, and certificates of convictions; fees to State pathologists and conveyance of articles for analysis, and so forth.  Expenditure under this subhead fluctuates considerably and is influenced by a number of factors, including, of course, the number and expensiveness of court cases falling to be dealt with in any particular year. In this connection the costs of one case which is included in this Supplementary Estimate amounted to £26,000 and seven other cases which, in total, cost £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to normal expenditure, in 1975, two headings of expenditure arose: the payment of travelling expenses and subsistence for non-civil servants in connection with Ireland's <Col N="912" /> case before the Commission on Human Rights in Strasbourg, and the appointment of a full-time state pathologist because of the growing requirements in the fields of forensic pathology.  The amount allowed in this subhead in respect of the case to which I have referred is £14,000 and a sum of £10,000 is included in respect of the appointment of the pathologist. The remaining £15,000 arises from increases in litigation generally, particularly is prosecutions, and a general increase in the costs associated with litigation&mdash;witnesses' expenses, juries; and office-type expenses incurred by state solicitors.</P>
    <P>Subhead H is a new subhead.  No financial provision was made in the original estimate for the costs of the Law Reform Commission in 1975. The Law Reform Commission Act, 1975 provides for meeting the expenses of the commission out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. The Law Reform Commission was formally established on the 20th October last.  The grant of £30,000 is made up of two major items (a) remuneration for members of the commission and £25,000 towards the rent and fitting out expenses of office accommodation for the commission. I should take this opportunity to inform the House that the commission's view was that, notwithstanding the fact that it had not yet recruited a research immediately into areas of the law which might require reform. After consultation with the commission, I have requested the commission under the provisions of subsection (2) (c) of section 4 of the Act to undertake the examination of two topics&mdash;the law relating to the domicile of married women and the law relating to the age of majority.  This work can be carried on at the same time as the commission is preparing a comprehensive programme of law reform and will not interfere with the commission's responsibilities under the programme of law reform which will eventually be adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>One very disturbing fact emerges from the Attorney General's speech.  It is that the Book <Col N="913" /> of Estimates for the present year is nothing more than a joke.  It appears that the Attorney General, like his colleagues in Government, has willingly and knowingly cooked the books. We would like the Book of Estimates to be what it always was.  The Attorney General failed to put forward realistic projections of expenditure for the present year.  I am amazed, and I am sure the public at large are amazed, by the Government, coming in here almost daily with colossal Supplementary Estimates.  How is it that the forecasting which was required for the Book of Estimates was so far off the mark?  Why were there so many mistakes and so many projections which were 3, 4 and 5 per cent out?  It is not good enough for the Attorney General or anybody else to come here and read a very short brief, in some cases asking that it be passed without discussion.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>Is the Book of Estimates, which should be published prior to the budget in a couple of weeks' time, to be treated like Aesop's fairy tables?  Is it to be a haphazard effort by the Minister for Finance and the Government to hoodwink the general public with regard to the expenditure which has to be met?  The Government are in a very bad way at present with regard to the finances of the nation.  I know educational matters are coming up next.  It is a sad day when the Minister for Education has to come in here and show cuts in areas where there should be no cuts in expenditure.  I have no doubt we will have ample time to have a discussion on educational matters before the day is out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw that charge and say that the Minister for Education deliberately refused to tell me the truth and misled me and the House.</P>
      <P>If I may get back to the law charges, under the heading Travelling and Incidental Expenses the April/December, 1974 figure was a total of £2,760 and the Estimate for 1975 was in line with this figure; it was £4,500.  We now find an additional sum requested under this heading of £15,000.  The £15,000 is made up of £6,900 in relation to the Attorney General and his staff, £3,200 in relation to the Chief State Solicitor's Office and £4,900 in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions and his staff.  In regard to the latter figure of £4,900 for the Director of Public Prosecutions and his staff, I would like to know more about the incurring of travelling or incidental expenses by the Director and his staff.  I think a more detailed explanation is required before it would be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the additional £2,400 for the Attorney General and his staff, it seems scarcely credible that an under-estimation of this kind could have taken place if any consideration had been given to what the Attorney General and his staff might have to do in the course of the year.  It appears that there was a high degree of carelessness in this <Col N="915" /> regard.  So far as our information goes, neither the Attorney General nor his staff did anything that would incur travelling or incidental expenses to any great extent out of line with the 1974 figure.  Further explanation is required here.  In respect of the Chief State Solicitor's Office the additional sum required for travelling and incidental expenses is £3,200.  If the travelling and incidental expenses of the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's office are inter-connected, then it should be shown why the expenses were not properly anticipated because together they come to an additional figure of £10,000.</P>
    <P>Under the general law expenses the additional sum required is £75,000.  The figure for April/December, 1974 was £26,650 and the Estimate for 1975 was £43,000 which would be more or less in line with the previous figure.  It is difficult to see what could have caused an increase of £75,000.  The ingredients of this heading are expenses for juries, fees to pathologist, payments to witnesses in civil actions and miscellaneous expenses.  We are told by the Attorney General that we have a pathologist appointed at £10,000 a year and one court case, as he said, had costs running to somewhere in the region of £14,000.  In general, in regard to the two items I have mentioned, that have been dealt with, it may be relevant to inquire whether in the setting up of two offices, that is to say, the expansion of the Attorney General's office and the setting up of a new and heavily-staffed office for the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether we are already operating Parkinson's Law to this extraordinary extent and whether the fact that these two offices are now in existence is to some extent due to what has occured in this regard.</P>
    <P>The other additional figure is a sum of £30,000 in relation to the Law Reform Commission.  It is understandable that the commission should have been set up and that the remuneration to date of members <Col N="916" /> might be covered by the figure of £5,000 or remuneration for the remainder of the financial year might be covered by that figure but the other expenses of £25,000 should, I believe, be explained in great detail. There is a sum of £25,000 provided towards the rent and setting up expenses of office accommodation for the commission.  It is quite an expensive office for a small number of people.  If expenses of this kind have been incurred at this juncture, it would appear that the office is already in operation.  Are they ready to go into operation?  It is a great expense to the taxpayers of this country.</P>
    <P>If this is a reasonable deduction from the seeking of a sum of money of this magnitude in relation to the Law Reform Commission, it is relevant to ask what tasks have been undertaken up to the present.  How many meetings have they had?  What topics have they placed on the priority list for law reform consideration?  When may we know what their priorities are?  When may we expect their first reports?  Will their first reports relate to reforms which are vitally necessary on the civil side or to reforms which are equally vitally necessary on the criminal side in relation to the very real, day-to-day problems affecting the business of the courts?</P>
    <P>Much more information should be given.  The Attorney General and everybody involved in the preparation of the Book of Estimates&mdash;and it is the job of the Government, lorded over by the Minister for Finance&mdash; must be charged with gross neglect in the way they come here almost daily, sometimes hourly, queueing up with Supplementary Estimates for colossal sums of money.  Inflation is one thing and the Government should know as much as, if not more than, anybody else about inflation because of their responsibility for it and encouragement of it in many instances.  The figures we are asked to accept now go beyond any figure that should be allowed for inflation.  The Government must be taken to task for this.  For that reason, I am not accepting the Supplementary Estimate of the Attorney General and I am asking that the matter be voted on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that these Estimates are coming so quickly that the printers cannot keep up and I want to lodge a protest against discourtesy from the Government benches in not providing Members with copies of the brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>No discourtesy was intended.  As I understand it, the practice of the House is that when a Minister or somebody in my position is introducing an estimate of this sort and if he has a written speech he gives it to the spokesman on that matter.  I can assure the Deputy that no discourtesy was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins criticised the fact that the Government were requiring a Supplementary Estimate and he criticised the estimating ability of the Government in this connection.  I did explain that in estimating costs which have to be met out of the Exchequer in the coming year a number of matters must of necessity be conjectural.  I should point out that the difficulties in this connection should be well-known. <Col N="918" /> The present Opposition when in Government in the 1971-72 financial year had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate amounting to £79,000, the original estimate being £362,000.  In 1972-73 they had to bring in a Supplementary Estimate of £50,000.  There was also a Supplementary Estimate in 1973-74. The point I wish to make is that it has proved over the years difficult to estimate what expenses would have to be met out of this Vote because of the very nature of these expenses.  One of them, as I pointed out, was in fact costs in relation to an action which had been heard some time previously and the amount of which had not been known.</P>
    <P>On the matters of detail being raised by Deputy Collins, I should explain that under subhead B, a number of matters which I outlined fall to be considered and that the travelling expenses in relation to this subhead now are mainly in relation to travelling expenses involved in offices in the office of the Attorney General and not in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The matters that come for consideration in relation to his office are matters relating to the expense of establishing it, not travel expenses.</P>
    <P>I did explain that what occurred this year is that there were very abnormal and unexpected travel commitments of the officers of the Office of the Attorney General.  These arose partly because of the Presidency and also because of commitments the officers of my Department had in relation to the Strasbourg case and also in relation to cases before the European Court of Justice. and it was not possible to anticipate the extent of the payments that would be made under these headings.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead E I have already explained to the House that this does include these matters which are very difficult to anticipate, particularly in relation to the costs that may be involved in respect of which Exchequer grants would be required.  I have also explained that under subhead E there have been, unexpectedly, sums required in relation to costs in connection with the Strasbourg case.  This explains to a considerable extent the reasons for this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="919" /> On subhead H, the position is that the office accommodation is nearly available to the Law Reform Commission and it is hoped that they will be able to take up occupation within the next couple of weeks.  I can assure Deputies that the expenditure involved in establishing an office is not by any means unusual and no great luxurious appointments are involved.  Deputies, I am sure, can take a look at it themselves if they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Law Reform Commission's programme, the position is that the Law Reform Commission have the task of preparing a programme and they are involved in this task at the present time and I know it is hoped that a programme will be prepared very soon.  This programme would indicate the areas of priority in which research would be undertaken and reform introduced.  In the meantime, as I have already indicated to the House, the commission have indicated their willingness to undertake immediately the research into two topics which I have referred to already.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Attorney General say whether the sum of £25,000 for office accommodation for the commission is a once for all job or will it be an annual cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,068,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come <Col N="920" /> in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Education (including Institutions of Science and Art), for certain miscellaneous education and cultural services and for payment of sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I understand that with the agreement of the Opposition, all the Education Votes will be discussed together.</P>
    <P>The total additional amount being provided in the Supplementary Estimates for the five education Votes, 28, 29, 30, 31 and 33 is £26,246,000. This represents a percentage increase of about 13.5 on the original Estimate of £191,233,000 This figure was in turn £41 million greater than that in the Book of Estimates for 1974.</P>
    <P>Included in the total amount of £26,246,000 is a sum of £19.6 million approximately for increased provision for salaries.  It includes the extra cost arising from the implementation of the terms of the 16th round salary agreement and adjustments in certain allowances negotiated through the conciliation and arbitration schemes.</P>
    <P>In the case of Vote 29&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;the additional amount required for subhead C.1 is £8,696,200 and in Vote 30&mdash;subhead B&mdash;an additional amount of £4,928,400 is requested for incremental salaries.  The additional amount in subhead A of Vote 31&mdash;Annual Grants to Vocational Education Committees&mdash;is mainly for salaries and, similarly, subhead I.1 of the same Vote requires additional provision for salaries of teachers in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>The provision of £3,086,800 in subhead A2 of Vote 33&mdash;Higher Education&mdash;for the purpose of additional money to the Higher Education Authority in respect of general, non-capital, grants to universities and colleges and designated institutions of higher education includes in addition to an appropriate sum in respect of the 16th round salary increases, an amount of £1,500,000 to enable the colleges to reduce their financial deficits and be in a better position to meet their commitments in 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> Items for which additional provision is required arising out of claims at the conciliation and arbitration scheme include improvements in principals' and vice-principals' allowances and the payment of maternity leave to teachers.</P>
    <P>Additional provision is being made in the Supplementary Estimates for £1,150,000 for capitation grants to secondary schools and £825,000 in the case of the supplemental grants payable to secondary schools in lieu of tuition fees.  Deputies will recall that on 7th May last I announced that the Government had decided to increase the rates of these grants as follows as from the beginning of the school year 1975-6: Capitation grants: Maximum rates of grant&mdash;junior pupils from £19 to £28; senior pupils from £24 to £36; grant in lieu of tuition fees from £35 to £50.</P>
    <P>The tuition fee had already been increased by £5 to £35 as from the beginning of the school year 1974-5. The increase in that grant in two years has accordingly been £20 or 66? per cent.</P>
    <P>In the course of my statement on 7th May last, I explained the circumstances in which the Government had decided on these increases.  The financial support to voluntary secondary schools from the State comprises:</P>
    <P>(i)  Capitation grants payable to all schools;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Grants in lieu of tuition fees in the case of schools under Catholic management in the free education scheme&mdash;a special variation of the scheme suited to the circumstances applies to the case of schools under Protestant management.</P>
    <P>The rates of capitation grant for secondary schools had not been increased since 1st August, 1969.  It is true, of course, that in the meantime the State has borne the entire cost of the increases in salaries for secondary teachers by way of adjustment of the incremental salary portion of the teachers' salaries.  It is also a fact that the basic salary portion of the teachers' salaries&mdash;the portion of the salary payable by the school authorities&mdash;has remained static at £400 since 1st <Col N="922" /> August, 1969 and that some relationship, whether direct or indirect, must be accepted as existing between the amount of basis salary per teacher, the pupil/teacher ratio and the rate of capitation grant per pupil.  Nevertheless, the Government accepted, on my recommendation, that in consideration of the increase in costs arising under other headings an adjustment in the rate of the capitation grant as from the beginning of the school year 1975-76 was appropriate and necessary.</P>
    <P>As from the commencement of the school year 1969-70 the rate of the grant per pupil in lieu of tuition fees payable to schools in the free education scheme was £25.  An increase of £5 was allowed as from the beginning of the school year 1972-73 and a further £5 as from the beginning of the school year 1973-4.  The further increase of £15 as from the beginning of the school year 1975-6 brings the amount of the grant at present payable to £50 per pupil.</P>
    <P>In connection with the general provision for the financing of secondary schools, I might also recall that during 1975 the terms of the secondary schools building grant scheme were amended to provide a grant of 80 per cent in respect of the total approved cost of the school premises including the cost of furniture, equipment and fees but excluding site cost.  This new arrangement will confer a great advantage on secondary schools.  Previously no loan or grant from the Department was available for furniture for ordinary classrooms and grants in aid of specialist rooms were so inadequate that, in practice, school authorities found that the 70 per cent grant for the school premises did not constitute much more than 50 per cent in many cases of the total cost of the school plus furniture and equipment.  The new arrangement means effectively an increase in the grant from not much more than 50 per cent in many cases to 80 per cent in all cases.  It also means that the money which school authorities had to set aside for furniture and equipment will now be available to meet the balance of the 20 per cent required for the school premises, furniture and equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> The additional provision of £129,000 in subhead C of Vote 30 is required to meet the increased cost of conducting the Department's certificate examinations. Improved rates of remuneration were paid to examiners and improved rates of travelling and subsistence allowances to superintendents at the examination centres.  There were also increases in printing costs of the examination papers and in transport costs.  An increase in provision for similar reasons is required in subhead F, of Vote 31 &mdash; Vocational Education.</P>
    <P>The increase in the provision required in J.1 for secondary comprehensive and community schools is in respect of salaries for the teachers and of general operating costs.  There are at present 14 comprehensive schools and 18 community schools in operation in which 15,600 pupils approximately are enrolled.  The main increase in operating costs arise from increased costs of heat and light, and for maintenance and cleaning contracts, as well as increases in costs of administration in respect of printing, stationery, postage, telephones <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>The scheme of aid towards the cost of school books in second-level schools is operated on a reasonably flexible basis which makes it difficult to make accurate estimates of cost well in advance of the period during which the expenditure is incurred.  The provision in 1975 in subhead K of Vote 30 includes recoupment in respect of some claims for the school-year 1974-5 which were not received in time for payment in 1974.  The greater part of the excess arises, however, from the fact that demands from schools were appreciably higher than originally anticipated.  An increase in the cost of school books was a contributory factor in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Vote for primary education it has been found necessary to open a subhead C. 10 for this year only to meet payments in connection with painting of schools undertaken and completed before 31st December, 1974, and for which the managers <Col N="924" /> concerned had not been recouped before 1st January, 1975.  The new scheme of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools &mdash;subhead C.6 of Vote 29 for 1975&mdash; comprehends these grants as from 1975.</P>
    <P>The original provision of £10,000,000 in subhead E of Vote 29 &mdash;Building Equipment and Furnishing of National Schools&mdash;is being increased in the Supplementary Estimate to £11,000,000.  This amount compares with the actual expenditure of £6,629,283 in the financial year 1973-4, the last previous 12 month financial year period.  The total capital provision for the building of schools and colleges in the year 1975 is now £26,395,000 including £2,784,000 from the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>The relevant subhead provision for free school transport&mdash;D. 3 of Vote 28 &mdash;is being increased by £3,318,700. A large portion of this increase&mdash; £1,043,700 is in respect of operating costs.  Increased provision of £2,275,000 is, however, required for the purpose of making a payment to CIE in respect of the written down value of all school buses as at 31st March, 1974.  It does not represent an additional charge on the Exchequer, since at the same time as the Department of Education pays the appropriate amount to CIE an identical amount will be paid by CIE to the Department of Finance.  The aim of the transactions is to enable a more satisfactory arrangement to be made in relation to the financing of school transport services, including the capital required for the purchase of the school buses.</P>
    <P>The remaining increases arise generally in miscellaneous subheads, such as travelling and incidentals, post office services, international organisations <i>et cetera</i>, where the increases incurred were largely outside the control of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should wish to make a brief reference to developments over the past year in relation to the reorganisation of educational structures and courses at third level.</P>
    <P>Following my announcement of the Government's decisions on 16th December, <Col N="925" /> 1974, I have been engaged at their request in continuing consultation and exchange of views with various interests in higher education with a view to elucidation of the decisions and their implementations.</P>
    <P>The governing bodies of the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick and Dublin, have been established in accordance with the Government's decisions and held their first meeting on 19th June last.  On that occasion I met both governing bodies together and in the course of my address outlined the role, in the Government's view, of the NIHEs in the sphere of higher education.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the governing bodies have been engaged in the work entrusted to them.  They have each nominated ten members to serve on the reconstituted National Council for Educational Awards, and I am now recommending persons for nomination by the Government to complete the membership of the council.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House of progress in the implementation of the Government's decision in relation to the National College of Physical Education, Limerick, and the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects, which is planned for the same campus.  The Government decided that these two colleges should have a joint governing body of 25 members.  I am happy to say that invitations have been issued to serve on this governing body and also that the institution&mdash;which will embrace the National College of Physical Education and the college of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects&mdash;and for which the governing body will have responsibility will be known as The Thomond College of Education.</P>
    <P>The National College of Physical Education has already been successfully established.  When the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects is in operation we will be catering on one campus for our teaching needs in the areas of physical education, woodwork, metalwork, rural and general science and building construction.  In addition to providing initial teacher training in <Col N="926" /> those areas, the Thomond college will be a major centre for in-service training for teachers of general subjects and for teachers in remedial and adult education.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I desire to state that satisfactory arrangements have been completed between the university authorities and the Colleges of Education for Primary Teachers for the award of a university degree on the successful completion of the new three-year course of study in these colleges.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My first reaction to the Minister's speech is one of great disappointment.  It is an arid document with nothing new to it.  One might say that it is even a defeatist document.  Whoever they are in Government they seem to have defeated the Minister for Education. Last night I read his latest Estimate speech and I noticed that it was full of promise, full of planning and full of projection but there is nothing in his speech this morning introducing these Supplementary Estimates.  This was the Minister's first major speech &mdash;if it was major&mdash;for more than two years and I expected to hear from him some proposals for dealing with the serious stagnation in educational matters that has gripped the country over the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to go through the Supplementary Estimates first to seek the meat which has been left out of the document and, relative to the Supplementary Estimates, to make some positive suggestions.  I should like to reiterate what a colleague of mine said this morning, that there seems to be a serious defect in the system of preparing Estimates.  We hear a lot nowadays about programme budgeting but if this is what it means and any householder in following that&mdash;I am not the best at managing my financial affairs myself&mdash;was so far out in his estimate of what he could spend in a year, he would be in serious trouble. It is apparent from what the Minister said that a great deal of this money is for salaries.  Surely, it would not take a financial or economic expert to forecast that there would be, in the context of continuing national wage <Col N="927" /> agreements, demands for increases in salaries.  When the Book of Estimates was being prepared this could have been provided for so that the Book of Estimates would not become a charade, a joke.</P>
    <P>It is not really a Book of Estimates in any accurate sense.  The Supplementary Estimates provide for more than £3 million for the office of the Minister, more than £8 million for primary education, more than £8 million for secondary education, almost £3 million for vocational education and more than £3 million for higher education.  In order that Deputies can make any kind of meaningful comment on an Estimate the Minister, and his Department, should be more realistic.  I find very interesting the reference to the little bit of financial juggling that went on with regard to the school bus service.  Apparently, the Department of Education gives the money to CIE who in turn gives it back to the Department of Finance. From replies to letters asking for an extension of the school bus service one would have thought that the Minister had no money to play around with.  I am not suggesting that this money has gone around its wheel of fortune but it could be applied to liberalising the whole school transport system.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister has to provide extra money for Post Office services and that the Estimate applies to the end of this year.  I hope that when the Estimate is being prepared for 1976 the Department officials will take into consideration the increased postal charges which will operate from 1st January next so that we will not be coming back in December, 1976, with a tale of woe about increased postal charges which will be severe and are due to the individual action of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subhead A.4&mdash; Bord An Choláiste Náisiúnta Ealaíne is Deartha&mdash;an additional £13,000 is required but I should like to know if the £57,000 mentioned in the original Estimate as a capital service was spent. Is this £13,000 for current expenditure or is it also a capital cost?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> Under subhead A.5&mdash;Expenses of National Council for Educational Awards&mdash;I should like to state that the council are in some kind of limbo at the moment.  They were set up as an <i>ad hoc</i> body but this &ldquo;ad hockery&rdquo; has gone on for a long time.  They were abolished on 16th December last and resuscitated and two groups of ten have been nominated by the institutes for membership.  However, we are awaiting the Minister's ten and in the meantime there is no chairman &mdash;there is an acting chairman&mdash;and the council are working away and have been called on by the Minister to give the educational accolade to the graduates of the National Council of Physical Education.  I said at Question Time recently that the council are being used in an unworthy manner by being left in never-never land. The council are giving very good service to the Department and the State and at least the Minister should take account of the feelings of people who give that kind of service.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> element seems to me to be the insulting part of it&mdash;that after three or four years of hard work there has been no finality.  There has been a certain crossing of personnel. There are people in the two groups of ten who have been on outgoing groups and I expect the same will happen in respect of the ten the Minister will be choosing.  I will come back to this later.  I think the National Council for Educational Awards deserves better from the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>In regard to scientific research grants to students, there has been an increase of £6,500.  I seem to recall that there was some trouble about the allocation of these grants.  If my memory serves me right, there was a question of only first class honours graduates being awarded grants.  I should like to know if this allocation of £6,500 is connected with that.</P>
    <P>I see in subhead G.2 that the Royal Irish Academy are to get an additional sum of £10.  There is something very difficult to understand about this. Further down, the grant-in-aid of the general expenses and so forth is £23,000, less savings on the printing <Col N="929" /> of the Dictionary of Old Irish, £20,000 and in the national biological programme, £2,990, a total of £22,990, which leaves £10 out of the total sum of £23,000.  I understand the Dictionary of Old Irish has been finished and I hope the Minister will see to it that the £20,000 will be extracted from the Minister for Finance and allocated to the academy in due form.  I realise there might be difficulty when the Secretary of the Department will face the formidable Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts if the money is not spent on what it has been assigned to, but it would be a great pity if through some kind of accountancy jiggery-pokery the academy would lose the money.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that they will not.</P>
    <P>The projected publication of a national atlas was mentioned as was the setting up of field study centres. I believe there is an overdraft of nearly £100,000 in the academy at the moment.  Everybody realises the work the academy do is of great importance in the cultural life of the country and there is always a danger that that type of institution will lose out.  I do not want to go on about it in case it might seem unbalanced but I was thinking on something on the lines of Parkinson's Law: the more cultural the content the easier and sharper the axe seems to be wielded, when axes are being wielded.  That is what we have to look out for when considering Estimates.</P>
    <P>One thing I should like to find out is what these savings on other subheads, amounting to £389,210 are about.  I should like from the Minister a breakdown of those savings.  It would be very revealing and I should be obliged if the Minister were able to show me how, with all the clamour there is for money for education, that £390,000 specifically comes to be saved.</P>
    <P>On the question of university grants, I had a letter from the Minister on the matter of higher education grants stating he would communicate with me further.  I do not see any provision for increased grants in this Supplementary Estimate.  Perhaps the Minister has the information which he promised in a <Col N="930" /> letter to me as to what his intention is in this matter.</P>
    <P>Subhead G.1&mdash;Publications in Irish &mdash;was the subject of an Adjournment debate and the Minister made statements with regard to certain publications in Irish.  I would hope he would be able to transmute sympathy into money.</P>
    <P>I do not see in the Estimate&mdash;and I am dealing with Vote 28, Office of the Minister for Education&mdash;any provision for increased payments covering 1975 up to 31st December for audio-visual aids for schools.  Again, at Question Time, we were told that, with the sanction of the Department, many schools purchased audio-visual aid equipment but that the money allocated had been exhausted.  I think&mdash;and I hope that the word is not too severe&mdash; that this is dishonest budgeting, to allocate at D.4 £120,000 to sanction purchases for schools and then to leave the schools are an dtrá folamh.  The Minister had an opportunity with this Supplementary Estimate to add to the £120,000 an amount of money which would cover sanctioned expenditure and, when I say &ldquo;sanctioned&rdquo;, I mean sanctioned in general by the Department. I criticise the Minister for not having done that.</P>
    <P>The annual general meeting of the National Library Society of Ireland took place during the week.  There was a kind of academic resolution congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his efforts to provide adequate accommodation in paragraph (1) but paragraph (2) was substantially an appeal to the Minister and to the Parliamentary Secretary to make sure that the perennial problem of accommodation for the National Library be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate for Vote 29 this lack of realism with regard to the national wage agreement and the increase in salaries is evident.  I understand that, under a previous Administration some leeway was left in the Estimates because, realistically, people knew these demands were forthcoming. I know there is a bargaining problem in this but people should not be thrown to the extent that they were by this Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> In the primary section I see that for nine months of 1974 £77,000 was allocated for special courses.  For the whole 12 months of this year the Minister could only see his way to providing £12,500.  There is no relief here either in the Supplementary Estimate on that score.  This is a very serious problem.  Both in this House and in the Seanad people have called the Minister's attention to the importance of these special courses&mdash;and I understand some of this money was for courses for remedial teachers&mdash; whether for remedial, subject courses or what have you.  Teachers cannot be expected to live on their capital.  Again the Minister missed a golden opportunity to increase those amounts.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  On Vote 29, Primary Education, I see there is also a saving.  This is technically an interesting point.  The item does not appear on the Supplementary Estimate <Col N="934" /> paper but it refers to something that is in the main Estimate.  There is savings under subhead A1.  I presume I am entitled to ask the Minister for a breakdown of that savings of £1,550,000.  How were those savings affected?  I have a barrel of suggestions on which these savings could be spent without burying them back into the restricted number of subheads that are dealt with in the Supplementary Estimate.  How did the Minister make savings under A1 in the original Estimate?  I have to double check everything lest I offend the Chair.</P>

The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is not one of those who would be more subject to this than another.  I do not even know what that nonsense means but I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle might know what I am driving at.  I find him a very humane chairman but I do not like that particular aspect of this. It is an indication that the full Estimate should be debated in due form in this House and that we should not be relying in the first week of December on the Supplementary Estimate in which we are confined for discussion.</P>

    <P>I see under subhead F of Vote 30, Courses for Secondary Teachers, that an additional sum of £10,000 is required bringing the revised Estimate up to £20,000.  On the analogy of the reference back in Vote 29 I want to point out that the £10,000 dropped from £90,000 for nine months the year before and that this only adds £10,000 to the original Estimate.  The Minister lost an opportunity here.  The sum of money is very very big so he had the opportunity of at least <Col N="935" /> bringing it back to what it was for the nine months of 1974.</P>
    <P>Under subhead J.1, the Comprehensive and Community Schools Running Costs, the complaint must again be made that there was a total lack of realism in assessing the costing.  I cannot understand how the costing could be so far out.  Even if new schools came into the scheme, intelligent anticipation should have made allowance for this amount.  I intended to say something about education on television but subhead H is not included in the Supplementary Estimate so I cannot refer to that.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead K, I want to compliment the Minister for providing an additional sum towards the cost of school books.  This is a very necessary scheme.  I have not sufficient knowledge of how comprehensive it is. My policy is that where the need is great the books should be provided and where it is not we should encourage people to purchase books.  From my own experience of teaching I find that very often the people who can best afford to buy books are the people who show the greatest reluctance when encouraged by teachers to do so.  Very often the person of moderate means is prepared to make a greater sacrifice than the person who is in reasonably affluent circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a saving on other subheads of £25,900.  On what was this saving made?  There is also reference to savings on secondary schools building grants of £718,000.  I would like some further information on that.</P>
    <P>Under Vote 31, Vocational Education, the greatest disappointment to me in the original Estimate and this Supplementary Estimate is that there is no effective action, financially, on the Murphy Report.  Under subhead B, the Minister referred to the Thomond College of Education in Limerick.  I see there is an additional sum required under this subhead of £44,000. Will this refer to the training of teachers in the Thomond college exclusively? They are being trained elsewhere at the moment.  I would like to know a little more about the actual <Col N="936" /> college and at what stage of planning or execution this is.  A sum of £144,000 seems very small in this regard.  It will take a good deal of money to cope with this.</P>
    <P>We need more of what are now being called specialised teachers.  In many parts of the country there is a crying need particularly for metal work teachers and electronics teachers. I wish the Minister well in his efforts to train as many as possible. On subhead I (3)&mdash;Regional and other Technical Colleges and Specialist Teacher Training Colleges: Capital Costs&mdash;there is a saving, according to the Supplementary Estimate, of £774,700.  This is a substantial percentage of the Estimate of £2,434,000. I would like to know exactly what that refers to.  Is there some allocation in the original for the Thomond college in that?</P>
    <P>We come now to Higher Education. Under A (2)&mdash;an tÚdarás um Árd Oideachas&mdash;Grants to Universities and Colleges and Designated Institutions of Higher Education&mdash;during 1975 we were continually told by the university colleges that their current accounts were in a parlous position. I would like the Minister to tell me whether they have cleared them. There is a reference in his speech to this and it seems to me that there is an implication that they are still carrying some dogs' legs of old debts. This is not a healthy situation for the university colleges to be in.</P>
    <P>Without being at liberty to debate the whole Estimate, I do not think I could sort out a certain amount of to-ing and fro-ing of finance in respect of the National Institute of Higher Education.  I understand that from the original Estimate £50,000 was taken to finance the NIHE in Dublin.  I have a note here that from B (1), which is not in the Supplementary Estimate, £250,000.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  It says here there is a saving under subhead B (1) of £200,000 and this, together with the £50,000 that was taken already, seems to me to have deprived Limerick of £250,000.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint linn cheann féin ar an Meastachán dúirt <Col N="937" /> sé go raibh suim fé leith aige i bpáistí atá ciothramach agus éislinneach.  Níl aon tagairt sa bhFó-Mheastachán do scrúdú agus do theistiméireacht speisialta do na páistí sin.  Iarradh ar an Aire scrúdú speisialta agus teistiméireacht speisialta a chur ar fáil dóibh ach níl aon trácht sa bhFó-Mheastachán seo air sin.  Dúirt sé linn go raibh suim fé leith aige fosta sa phaíste díphribhléideach.  Níl sé ag tabhairt níos mó airgid dúinn chun an chabhair sin a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé cheana féin go ndeanfainn athagairt do chúrsaí oideachais le haghaidh an duine fásta.  Dúirt an tAire linn go mbeadh scéim aige, ag dul le tuarascáil Murphy, i dtaobh oideachas don duine fásta.  Fágadh ar lár an méid sin fosta as an bhFó-Mheastachán seo.</P>
    <P>In éineacht leis sin dúirt sé go nglacadh sé fíor&mdash;chomhairle leis na dreamanna go léir atá páirteach san oideachas.  Ní dóigh liom gur sheas sé lena fhocal sa méid sin ach an oiread.  Dúirt sé mar phrionsabal ginearálta go raibh sé de dhualgas orainn sa tír seo níos mó dár gcuid rachmais a chaitheamh ar oideachas mar go bhfuil ár maoin shaolta níos teirce ná mar atá sé ag tíortha na hEurópa. Sin rud nár dhein sé go fóill, ar aon chaoi, agus is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ró-lag sa Rialtas chun é sin a dhéanamh. Ba chóir dó an fód a sheasamh i gcoinne na ndaoine atá chomh sprúnlaithe sin nach bhfuil siad ag tabhairt an airgid dó.</P>
    <P>I said I would come back to the National Council for Educational Awards.  I would like the Minister to finalise this particular problem.  He should set up a National Council for Educational Awards statutorily and appoint his own ten in addition to the 20 that already have been selected and are ready to take over.</P>
    <P>Rud a chuireann íonadh ormsa ná gur theip ar an Aire, mar adúirt sé i dTrá na gCeist le déanaí, cúigear agus fiche a thoghadh don Ghúm.  Níl ach cúigear tofa aige cheana féin.  Dúirt sé liom go raibh postanna fógraithe aige le déanaí.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ábalta an 25 úd d'fháil.  Mar chruthaige mé fein tá easpa téacs leabhar Ghaeilge ag brú ar mhic-léinn <Col N="938" /> agus ar mhúinteoirí le fada.  Bhí focla dócais ag an Aire dúinn nuair a thosnaigh sé aréir ach ní mór an dul ar aghaidh atá déanta againn go fóill sa mhéid sin.</P>
    <P>There is an element in the Supplementary Estimate covering primary school management and there are a few questions that I should like the Minister to answer.  Is it a fact that the Minister and his Department are refusing teachers the right to sit on the board of management with a vote? I understand that a certain agreement was reached between the outgoing individual managers and the INTO on this matter.  Has the Minister any objection to the terms of this agreement being adhered to?  Does he object to teachers sitting on the board of management with a vote?  I have a question down to the Minister which may not have reached him yet about certain classes of schools.  Is it true that there are some schools which will not, even if they have a board of management, command the £6 grant from the Minister?  I did not think there was any such category but I have had some correspondence from people who think that even if there is a board of management a certain type of school will not get the £6 per pupil.  If this is not so, I should like the Minister to put peoples' minds at rest on the matter.</P>
    <P>Judging by the money being provided in the primary Supplementary Estimate I cannot see any possibility of improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio, a cause to which the Minister dedicated himself when he became Minister.  There was an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and, with all modesty, I think the former Minister, Deputy Faulkner, can claim credit for it, having provided an increased number of places in the training colleges. The Minister will have to attack this problem from both the teacher training and the building angles.  He will have the support of this side of the House if he tackles it vigorously as I think he is in duty bound to do.</P>
    <P>I do not see much hope for increased research which is very necessary at all levels in education.  In particular, the Minister said that he <Col N="939" /> would pay great heed to the results of the Van Leer study on children from disadvantaged areas.  I understand that there is a certain disappointment with the results immediately after the primary period, that research elsewhere, and in Britain particularly, has shown that the special treatment does not survive; in other words, the superiority shown by those in the group under experiment as compared with the controlled group does not stand the shock of removal further up the educational ladder.  The Minister would be well advised to provide funds for experimentation in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards additional money for the training of teachers, I hope that the Minister is taking account of his blank year.  I have already appealed to him to make a statement now on this matter.  Will he be taking in, or has he taken in many more graduates to fill the blank year?  Will he allow fit primary teachers over 65 years of age to teach?  Those he barred this year, will he allow them back?  Also, what is the position of teachers who were trained in Britain and were granted recognition here provided they passed certain tests?  Will he allow these back into the service to try to cope with the blank year and also to try to improve the teacherpupil ratio?  Now is the time to make these announcements because human beings must look ahead and various people must make decisions.  The Minister would be clearing the air for all concerned and particularly the three categories I mentioned if he made an announcement now.</P>
    <P>I thought there might be something in this Supplementary Estimate about An Foras Oiliúna.  That seems to be in some kind of limbo where a good many educational initiatives seem to end up.  In the case of students who are going in increasing numbers to regional technical colleges for whom provision is made by way of scholarship, I suggest that the Minister might&mdash;I would leave it to him and his Department to decide the standard&mdash;extend the grant system to them, not necessarily the same grant system as for university students.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> The Government to which the Minister belongs, and particularly the few vocal Ministers who came in to support the proposals of 16th December last in regard to third level education, claimed that it was very important that the technical and technological section of our educational system should be up-graded.  That in itself is a sort of implication that it is now on a lower grade than other levels.  I do not agree with that; I have my own view on it.  If the Minister extended the grant system to the regional technical colleges, he would be helping in a field which is very important as the Minister himself admitted in his last major speech on education.</P>
    <P>The community schools and comprehensive schools have attracted some extra money in the Supplementary Estimate.  When taking his last Estimate over two years ago the Minister said he was very concerned that the community in the environment of the community school should be involved not merely in the management of the school but in the utilisation of its facilities.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister has fallen down on his objective in this regard. There has been serious criticism from the principals and vice-principals of community and comprehensive schools quite recently and I myself am not satisfied that the involvement of the community in the use of the facilities of the school is what it should be.</P>
    <P>The provision for year-long courses for guidance teachers has been suspended. The Minister, who is now, I am sure, trying to make an impression for the Estimates for 1976, should not in any way yield on this matter of guidance teachers and remedial teachers because according to his stated philosophy he himself attaches great importance to them.  The outside quota facilities, I gather, are no longer available for guidance teachers.  The year-long in-service training courses have also been cancelled.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also on record as being concerned about adult education. He is not moved in this matter at all.  There are a few pilot schemes <Col N="941" /> but the great bulk of decisions with regard to the implementation of the Murphy Report still remains untouched.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the National College of Physical Education which obviously will be brought into the new complex in Limerick.  The position in which the college found itself with regard to the conferring of the degrees this year should be a warning to the Minister that he should move and move quickly with regard to the National Council for Educational Awards.  The proposals which became decisions somehow&mdash;the metamorphosis took place between December and March&mdash;are in my opinion wrongheaded and incapable to a certain extent of being implemented.  I do not know whether it is true that the Minister or the College of Physical Education itself tried to get one of the university colleges to confer the degree which was conferred by the NCEA this summer.  It is thought generally that a try was made and that it was a failure.  We have the serious situation coming up in the summer of 1976 that the exact same position will apply, if the Minister does not move in the meantime, to the graduates of the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I understand that the graduates of the National College of Physical Education have pursued a course in Irish studies.  The Minister earlier mentioned that a course in Irish studies would be operative before long.  I should like to hear the Minister's comments on that.</P>
    <P>At column 406 of the Official Report for 23rd October, 1973 the Minister promised a White Paper.  At present he does not approve of the use of the term &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;.  I want to read this for the Minister because he is at the moment, apparently, pushing a study.  He refused to tell me in the House under what heads the study was being made.  In his speech on the higher education problem the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Special machinery was then set up in my Department to process all the submissions received in the context of the HEA reports and <Col N="942" /> to consider all the recommendations and views in depth for the purpose of enabling me to formulate proposals covering the whole field of higher education for approval by the Government. These procedures are being accelerated at my instance, and I am now in a position to inform the House of my personal intentions for the months ahead.  When the Departmental examination to which I have referred has been completed and the specific proposals which I will make have been considered by and approved by the Government, I hope to see the proposals published in a White Paper....</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>A pre-legislative document is what he referred to the week before last.  However, it is the substance rather than the form that I am interesed in.  I continue the quotation of what the Minister said on 23rd October, 1973:</P>
      <P>I hope to see the proposals published in a White Paper which will be the prelude to the introduction of the necessary legislation to give effect to the proposals.</P>
      <P>In other words, the White Paper is a pre-legislative document.  The Minister said on that occasion at column 406:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="943" /> It is, of course, difficult to set a time-table for these developments. I would like, therefore, to assure all those who are awaiting a decision that the publication of my proposals will not be delayed longer than is necessary to enable full consideration to be given to all aspects of what is a very complex question.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the same column, said:</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it is my fervent hope that when next I have an opportunity of reporting to the House on the Votes with which my Department are concerned, I will be in a position to record substantial progress and developments in relation to higher education along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <P>The 16th December last did not represent progress.  The Minister made no report today.  He simply reported that he was providing sums of money to keep the current accounts of the universities and university colleges out of the red or to expel the little letters &ldquo;o&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo;.  I find it very hard to understand why the Minister did not take this opportunity of reporting his present position with regard to the university question.  He did promise but he did not deliver on his promise and that is why I started off by saying the Minister's speech was an arid document, a dispirited document, a defeatist document.  Indeed, the whole business gets curiouser and curiouser.  The proposals on 16th December sprung like Athena from the head of Zeus but, unlike Athena, the Minister did not stimulate any intellectual or administrative activity since.  All we have is this fanciful talk.  What about regionalism? There was no mention of that, no mention of regionalisation plans which the Minister outlined some time ago.  He talked about how good it would be to have a local administration set up which would have the feel of the community.  I approve, but there has been no progress.  All is barren.  At column 407 of the same speech, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have already emphasised on <Col N="944" /> different occasions that it is the fundamental policy of the present Government, and my own also, that educational development should proceed on the basis of full discussion of all important issues and with the full co-operation and general agreement of the parties involved.</P>
    <P>We have had no report of discussions on regionalisation and no report on development in the field of higher education.  The people in Dalkey want a certain type of school.  Has the Minister had meaningful discussions with them?  Can he not see they have certain rights?  He should be talking to them and trying to come to an agreement with them in the same way as any group of Christian parents are entitled to the Minister's attention and to his action in regard to the schooling of their children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of a change of responsibility and control from one group to another.  That is the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that the Minister said he and his Department would consult with the people who have primary rights.  If a group of parents in Dalkey want a multidenominational school and are in complete accord on the matter, then the Minister should facilitate them to the fullest extent of his powers.  If a group who want a Catholic school come to the Minister with a proposition, he should equally facilitate them to the fullest extent of his powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were as simple as that the solution would be easy, but I have to put it in another context.  It is a question of one of these groups seeking a change in the control of the school from one group to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows the human intellect is specially designed to deal with difficulties.  They are, in fact, the only things worth using the mind on.  The whole educational process would become stultified if there were no problems.  It is problems that inspire people and bring the best out of people.  The Minister must not approach things with a closed <Col N="945" /> mind.  Neither must he arrogate to himself an exclusive concern, which is something he tends to do, for the health of Christianity.  We are all entitled to defend our beliefs and stand up for them and we should all do so but to arrogate to oneself the primary right of being the defender of any specific faith is not an exercise in which a politician should indulge.  It is neither desirable nor fruitful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;has a monopoly of concern for a particular Christian people.  I just want to put that on the record.  I shall make some positive proposals now.  It is disappointing to find no facing up to the necessity for development in pre-school education. The percentage of pupils in school before the statutory age is very high. There is no compulsion on them at that age.  The Labour Party document waffled somewhat about lowering the age.  Most pupils are in school before they are statutorily compelled to go <Col N="946" /> to school.  We are now members of the EEC.  We should take a look at what is happening on the Continent, not necessarily to follow exactly what is being done there but to find out what is being done and then pick our own way.  The Department should encourage voluntary organisations involved in pre-school work and the State should assume some obligation for these schools where that is necessary. In Belgium and particularly in France the courses are somewhat over-structured.  This I would reject.  I would reject any kind of pressure through over-structuring.  I would reject too much of an academic content too early.  We should not, at the same time, dignify with the name of school some place in which there is no fixed educational objective.  The Fianna Fáil committee on education has already published a document on pre-school education and in that document there is expert advice from one of the leading experts in this field.</P>
      <P>The foremost objective in the primary school field should be the pupil-teacher ratio.  The tendency, particularly in an underprivileged area, of having a large class is deadly, it is deleterious to the pupil throughout his life.  The figures given show an improvement since the sixties but in my view it is a No. 1 serious problem which would entitle the Minister to go to the Cabinet in search of finance to overcome it.  The problem can be met in two ways, by providing the teachers and by providing extra classroom space on an emergency basis. I am aware that teachers' organisations have a great reluctance to allow their members to teach in prefabricated classrooms.  They are correct in this because what is said to be temporary will become permanent.  To break this problem I believe the teachers should give in on that.  We should have a qualified teacher and a classroom to help to break down the large classes.  Where pupils want as much individual attention as possible this should be a priority.  A false picture is given on occasions by averages but averages are no a great help in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schools with the large classes <Col N="947" /> must be pinpointed and the problems in them tackled.  There will be a difficulty at times in providing space for the classrooms and this is hard to overcome.  Perhaps we could do what the New Yorkers did, build upwards, but we do not want to do too much of that either.  The period of transfer between primary and secondary schools should be the subject of research. On the last occasion when I was talking in public to my party about education I emphasised that. I also referred to a contribution made at an INTO conference by a delegate from Kilkenny who pointed out that the new curriculum takes a child to a certain point and then he is thrown into a different environment, a differently structured system.  There is a danger of misunderstanding between the practitioners on both sides; one firing volleys off at the other for lack of the basic three Rs and for lack of understanding the philosophy behind the new curriculum.</P>
    <P>Remedial teaching is very important at all levels but at primary level in disadvantaged areas it is essential. We know that the results of the research in Rutland Street showed that it is advantageous&mdash;it is expensive and I am not saying that we can generalise from that&mdash;and that it is important to treat people remedially. It is important that we get into the homes and do it also; we should bring the parents in on this.  It is sad to think that the general conclusion is that this advantage does not carry on further than the actual experimental period.</P>
    <P>I am sorry about the débâcle on audio-visual aids in the primary schools and I am sorry that the Minister did not take the opportunity of remedying the deficiency there. There are unfortunate people with the technology on their tables but without money to pay for it.  There is an element of retrospection in one of the matters referred to by the Minister and he should see that his 1976 gaberlunzie carries money to cover those expenses.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the fact that we have not even started in the <Col N="948" /> field of examination science, in the field of assessment.  In the secondary system a team of inspectors were always up to their chins in all kinds of administrative work, visiting schools and moving around the country and they were also expected to deal with the setting of examination papers and the marking of them.  The system is a primitive one and I regret that the Minister did not mention the examinations' board that was envisaged.  In my view there should be a full time examination section with teacher representation to study this business of examinations and assessment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not forget his dedication to the provision of guidance and remedial teachers.  He should remember that no matter what kind of pressure is brought to bear on him from the Department of Finance.  In this morning's newspapers the injustice of the pay-related benefit clawback from the awards to the secondary schools was dealt with.  If, on a technicality, the employer, the school concerned, must be charged the pay-related benefit, then the amount of the pay-related benefit should be added in the first place to the grants provided by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be unmindful of community participation in the facilities of community schools, nor merely in the facilities but in the development of adult and community education.  Such a school will also be used, inadvertently even, as an instrument of development of community consciousness.  With regard to the regional technical colleges and the national institutes for higher education, there is only one way the Minister can effectively deal with them and that is to jettison part of his proposals of 16th December, to put the NCA in charge of assessment and awarding of degrees, as well as diplomas and certificates.  I am not asking for a dichotomy between the third level non-university and the university.  In a paper in the autumn <i>Studies</i>, Dr. Hession made some good points but if they were carried to their logical conclusion they would mean the elimination of the technological sector leaving the university to deal <Col N="949" /> with the whole situation.  An important field for study and research is the relationship between the technological colleges and the universities in the third level.  The kind of crude shorthand solution attempted by the proposals on 16th December, in my opinion, is totally wrong.  He points out that in Germany the conceptual part of technological training was omitted originally and purely technological training was given, but when retraining was given the people without this conceptual background found it difficult to acquire new skills.</P>
    <P>That is what I would expect to happen.  It is not necessary that only the universities can concentrate on this idea of the conceptual: it can be given in the technological colleges as well.  I am asking the Minister to allow the technological colleges to do their own thing.  If he provides the money to pay the staff for it at the university level and also the accommodation and the equipment the university people have, the staffs of the technological college will not be the poor relations in the third level field.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to allow UCC and UCG to become independent universities in their own right. I am asking him to increase grants for students in accordance with the percentage increase of inflation that has taken place.  I am asking him to present a stronger presence in the Government.  At the moment he is adopting the attitude of &ldquo;Hit me now with the child of economic recession in my arms.&rdquo;  He should beard the Minister for Finance for his own particular domain.  He should come out with some meaningful programme in accordance with the Murphy Report.  He should not allow the Irish Academy to sink beyond trace in a large overdraft.</P>
    <P>I commend AnCO for their new apprenticeship course and for making allowances for apprentices who have already got the leaving certificate. That has been my philosophy all the time.  On the European front, I should like the Minister to push for some kind of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have shared an interest in that for a long time back. It is more than disappointing from the educational point of view the impact Europe has had here.  I am disappointed with the Estimates. They should have filled up the gaps that have been pointed out in this House in the last 12 months.  They have done no such thing.  The biggest tragedy of all would be if they gave an indication to the public that some of the ills had been remedied when they have been left untouched by this Supplementary Estimate.  All we have got is a patching up of a very poor Estimate in the original Book of Estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Minister on this Supplementary Estimate and to compliment him and the Department and the people who provide education throughout the Republic.  When we think of education we automatically think of the teachers in the various grades.  In rural Ireland especially they are the most highly respected profession.  In recognition of the fact that they do tremendous voluntary work on behalf of the communities in which they live as well as the great work they do in the schools. Their leadership has always been looked to.</P>
      <P>It is a tribute to the Minister, who comes from this profession, that such considerable progress has been made by the Department since he assumed office.  He has given to the Department the leadership they require in this difficult period to develop education significantly on all fronts.  This has called for considerable extra expenditure. When we hear Opposition spokesmen on this Estimate, are we to take it they are against paying increased salaries to the various grades of teachers in the present financial year?  They cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has committed himself to providing a university degree for national teachers.  Attempts have been made to credit this achievement <Col N="951" /> to all and sundry, but those who follow closely educational debates and various conferences will willingly apportion the credit where it rightly belongs.  The INTO for more than a century have been looking for this kind of qualification and I am glad they are getting it.  It is a credit to the Minister that for the first time since national schools were established more than 150 years ago he has introduced these boards of management which give parents a say in school management. This furthers the concept of parent intervention in education.  In doing this I feel sure the Minister was not in any way casting a reflection on the management system we had known heretofore.  Rather has he given to the parents a new involvement and this is welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay a word of tribute to the school managers of both Catholic and Church of Ireland schools for the tremendous amount of unpaid, unselfish work they have contributed to the education of successive generations of people.  Especially in recent years there has been a tremendous amount of adverse criticism of school managers, I suppose because of the difficulties they had to face in financing school extensions. They have done a magnificent job and I wish to place on record the community's great indebtedness to them. I hope that the creation of the new boards will ease the burden on both clerical and lay managers and, at the same time, give parents a greater say and interest in the education of their children.</P>
    <P>As we are now in the last quarter of the 20th century there is no other facet more important than education. I am happy in the knowledge that my colleague, the Minister, has a great and deep appreciation of the magnitude of the task with which he has been entrusted on behalf of the Government. I was happy to note also that last year the Minister advocated the same type of management boards or committees in respect of vocational schools.  After some initial hesitation on the part of many of the committees, <Col N="952" /> I was glad to note recently that the chairman of the IVEA, a constituent of mine, Mr. Jack McCann, said that the boards of management in vocational schools would be in operation in the very near future. Reading the Minister's speech at the ASTI conference in Galway I noted that much the same kind of structures had been proposed in secondary schools.  This should be of tremendous benefit to education generally.  Certainly it will spread the load and ought to increase the interest of more and more people in education.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to an aspect of educational affairs which, in my opinion, does not receive sufficient attention.  I would call on the Minister to resist the pressures to change for the sake of change, to continue to conserve our heritage and ensure that all our educational structures are moulded within the Christian principles. In saying that, of course, I also expect the Minister and his Department to provide for the nonChristians, such as the Jewish community schools, as successive Ministers have done, guaranteeing equality and justice to all.  Christian ethics I think, are being ignored in many cases.  Many of the old traditions are being attacked or bent on all sides.  Actually, it has become quite fashionable to be seen as a liberal.</P>
    <P>I spent one-and-a-half years as Vice-President of the European Commission for Cultural Affairs and Youth when I had an opportunity of seeing different systems in operation not only in EEC countries but in many of the African states as well and of assessing the value of our system.  The one thing we can say about the Minister for Education is that we know exactly where we stand with him, despite the fact that he is very often under attack for his principles and the serious way in which he tackles his task.  His philosophy is consonant with his ability as Minister in charge of the operations of the Department of Education.  That can hardly be said for Fianna Fáil when the increased capital grants for secondary schools were being discussed in this House on 16th April last.  The Minister placed <Col N="953" /> on record the statement of Deputy Jack Lynch in which he spoke about restoring the responsibilities for control of secondary schools to the pluralist community.  With the permission of the Chair I should like to quote from column 1842 of the Official Report of 16th April last.</P>

      <P>In this House on 16th April last the Minister for Education quoted from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11th April last, in which Deputy Jack Lynch, the Leader of the Opposition was quoted as saying:</P>
      <P>We are now witnessing the restoration of the responsibility for education and its control to the pluralist community.  The people and their representatives are being asked to take direct responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> Further on the same quotation read:</P>
    <P>In the development of a new partnership in education between the Churches and the State, we must preserve the best traditions of the existing system while we promote the new and more exciting systems of inter-denominational education, ...</P>
    <P>If I were to quote the Minister at column 1843 of the Official Report of the same debate he asked:</P>
    <P>Could I, perhaps, get some enlightenment from Deputy Faulkner, who spoke in such glowing terms of the Christain Brothers' school in Dundalk, terms in which I wholeheartedly concur, as to whether he can identify the &ldquo;pluralist community&rdquo; to which the Brothers are to &ldquo;restore&rdquo;,&mdash;&ldquo;restore&rdquo; mark you&mdash; the responsibility and control of that school?</P>
    <P>I quoted that because I do not recall ever seeing any answer to that query by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is now going too closely into general policy.  It was raised earlier by Deputy Wilson in his speech but the Chair did not allow it.  The present occupant of the Chair pulled up Deputy Wilson and so is obliged to pull up Deputy McDonald in the same way for following this line.  The debate cannot get onto that line of policy.

      <P>I bow to your ruling but the motives of those who propound those theories are important. Multi-denominationalism is, to my mind, a cloak for secularism.  A Deputy can only assess progress in education by looking at the progress made in his own constituency.  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly we have had the benefit of some of the World Bank money the Minister secured in the second loan negotiated over two <Col N="955" /> years ago.  I should like to compliment the Minister and his Department and to thank him for the improvement of so many educational centres in my constituency.  I understand that a new vocational school at Tullamore to accommodate 600 pupils has recently been completed.  Planning for a new community school to accommodate 900 pupils at Birr has already commenced.  I understand the architects have prepared the plan and it is hoped to commence work on this new building in the autumn of next year. World Bank finance is available for those two projects.  The new community school at Birr is estimated to cost in excess of £700,000.</P>

      <P>I am quite content to take a fleeting glance at the expenditure the Minister proposes to invest in my constituency.  I should like to compliment the Minister on providing the finance and having the plans prepared for the extension to the Convent of Mercy secondary school in Tullamore which was erected this year.  A further extension is planned to provide overall accommodation for 600 pupils.  An important improvement scheme was recently carried out to the Portlaoise Presentation Convent secondary school.  Planning has been initiated for the provision of new accommodation at Edenderry to provide 500 secondary school places and 400 vocational school places.  This will be a major scheme.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed to extend the Rathdowney vocational school and the Brigidine Convent in Mountrath. Planning for these works has already commenced.  Surely this indicates great progress.  Great credit is due to the Minister to the Department, to the Office of Public Works, to the community, to the two vocational education committees, to the managers and the clergy and religious orders involved, and all who played an important part in ensuring that progress in the provision of educational facilities continues in the constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are very much a part of the European scene, now that our leaders are highly respected partners in the European Community, we should endeavour to become more outward-looking.  We should try to direct the eyes of our young people eastwards towards the mainland of Europe a little more.  This is very important having regard to the fact that this week a decision to hold direct elections to the European Parliament has been more or less confirmed for May, 1978.  During the period I had the honour of being Vice-President of the Cultural Affairs Commission, we visited very many art galleries and libraries and saw the services <Col N="957" /> provided by our community partners.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Minister to encourage county libraries to provide for their school services a selection of slides of well-known works of art which could be sent around to the various schools and thus introduce our students to the great works of art of the pre-Renaissance and the Renaissance period, and modern art.  This should be extended to discs with a selection of music both classical and modern.  If countries like Denmark and Holland, who are comparable in land mass with us, if nothing else, can provide these services for their children, we should seriously contemplate extending our services to embrace those types of services.  County councils should be encouraged to provide accommodation which would enable the National Gallery to lend pictures to them.</P>
    <P>A greater effort should be made to encourage the study of languages in our schools.  Financial support for school groups who go to Europe on educational trips should be increased to encourage a greater number of our young people to go to mainland Europe.  The European Parliament extend grant aid to groups who visit the Parliament during plenary sessions. In relation to this I should like to refer to an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of last Saturday written by Bruce Arnold, one of our leading columnists.  He was discussing the health question and stated:</P>
    <P>Let us ask: Could it be the politics of the thing?  Could it be that the Minister for Health, acting on behalf of the Coalition, as a whole since he has no Labour Deputies in that particular area, is giving a &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; general hospital to Portlaoise in order to help the local Fine Gael Deputy, Charles McDonald, who lives in Portlaoise and relies on that town for a major part of his support, and is often absent at the European Parliament?</P>
    <P>This man is suggesting that when one attends the European Parliament one is absent, and, therefore, not as active on behalf of constituents, <Col N="958" /> and there is a need to give one a lift.  If we are to remain a part of Europe, we should devise our educational facilities in such a way as to give the people an appreciation of the new environment in which we live as a community and also prepare our children for competition in the greater Europe in the last quarter of this century.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament extend grant aid to groups and also to journalists.  I hope this will be taken up by my friend, Mr. Arnold, so that he can come and get a greater appreciation of what the thing is about and will not find himself talking about Deputies when they represent their constituents, whether it is in the national Parliament or the international forum that he would describe them as being absent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair finds the Deputy is going outside the scope of the Estimate but the Chair would say to Deputy McDonald that if he could relate it to subhead B.1, international organisations, he then might find himself completely within the ambit of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just coming to that.  I should like very much to avail of the opportunity of complimenting not only the Minister but also the Assistant Secretary of the Department who has represented our country in a very exemplary fashion, particularly in the provision of the European university in Florence.  The Minister's representative there has won not only for himself but for the country great credit for the great work he has put into the educational establishment in Florence.  Already some Irish personnel have taken up duty there in preparation for the opening of this university next October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see the allocation for that heading increased because it is only when we have our people abroad playing an enlightened role in the international scene that we can derive full benefit from our participation in the European Community. The social and economic thought of the Fine Gael Party has been moulded <Col N="959" /> by the social doctrine contained in the Papal encyclicals.  Most people in public life will state their acceptance of the teaching contained in those encyclicals but two dangers exist.  Firstly, such acceptance amounts to lip service and, secondly, these principles may be used as an excuse for inaction. I am confident that the present Minister will keep foremost in his mind that aspect of Fine Gael policy which we find enunciated back in 1965.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity of making some brief comments on this Supplementary Estimate on education.  The Minister mentioned the increase in capitation grants and the grants in lieu of tuition fees which he made last May.  Before that there were many meetings of parents, teachers and public representatives who were very concerned about the situation. One teacher summarised it very well when he said that it would take a mighty cry from the people to get the Minister to act.  Thanks be to God he acted although I would call it more a reaction, that in so far as we have a policy I am afraid it is a policy of reaction to events.  We waited a long time for this action but we are glad it came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with the subhead concerning school transport.  Over £1 million has been allocated for operational costs under this scheme.  I, like many other Deputies, have heard many complaints about the school transport system.  I feel that all the new buses we had are getting rather old and we will have to look seriously at this matter.  In rural areas I do not believe there is much point in having large buses on many of the narrow roads that serve our schools.  Many <Col N="960" /> of those large buses are literally taking corners on Hail Marys.  I would prefer a system where we had smaller buses to serve these schools.</P>
    <P>I notice there is an increase provided for school books.  We should be very concerned about this area because we seem to have a system where the school books change every year.  Perhaps a system of the schools renting the books to the pupils would help in this regard. A library service is needed here.  We were very disappointed in County Galway that the grant for primary school libraries was discontinued last year. We hope we will be able to obtain a grant again next year.  We welcome the new colourful books that have been brought out for children in all schools.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDonald referred to the boards of management which have met informally.  Would the Minister give an option to the smaller rural schools, those which have smaller numbers than their counterparts in the city, of continuing with the old system where they got grants on the area of the room? They will not benefit under the £6 grant from the Department when the local contribution of £150 is put up. The mentally handicapped schools will be particularly affected because they have a small pupil-teacher ratio.  School transport is very desirable for mentally and physically handicapped children. Such children should be given priority.</P>
    <P>Cuts have been made in education. Last year the grants for summer courses were cut and also the grants for audio-visual aids.  Many teachers were refused those grants because, they were told, funds were exhausted.  Above all, we need more money for building. Last July I tabled a question as to the number of pre-fabricated buildings used as classrooms in County Galway in the 1973-74 year and the number in the 1974-75 year.  The figure for 1973-74 was 183 which increased to 201 for 1974-75.  At the same time, the Minister pointed out that it was the policy of the Department to phase out prefabs and to replace them with permanent structures.  It is very hypocritical to talk about education being child-centred in primary schools if we are not providing classrooms and if <Col N="961" /> we are not consistent in our policy of phasing out prefabricated buildings.</P>
    <P>Of course, education means more than just providing money.  I believe teachers should be encouraged to teach dancing, music and so on. Surely Telefís Scoile could play a bigger role in providing suitable programmes. I believe the allocation to Telefís Scoile has been greatly reduced. &ldquo;Sesame Street&rdquo; which is produced by an American corporation, is a programme that has captured the imagination of young children.  It caters very well for young children.  RTE have not produced any programme like this.  I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.  On Saturday mornings particularly RTE should be showing programmes suitable for children.</P>
    <P>The pupil/teacher ratio still seems to be a big problem in primary schools.  There is also the fact that teachers who had reached retirement age were compulsorily retired and of the 238 untrained teachers only those over 30 and under 55 with the necessary experience were selected for the course.  That has ensured that the pupil/teacher ratio will not be greatly reduced.  I cannot understand why teachers under 30 have been discriminated against.  Surely a teacher of 27 or 28 is as good as a teacher of over 30 provided he or she has the teaching experience.  There is also a lack of remedial teachers to deal with problem children in all schools. I hope more attention will be given to the pre-school development because I believe it is very important and nowadays we have the facilities and the media to promote this development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of my first reactions to this Supplementary Estimate was: &ldquo;Where will the Minister get the money&rdquo;?  It is not our function here to worry unduly about this but I understand that moneys are rather scarce at present.  The facility with which money can apparently be discovered often surprises me.  If the promises made by the Government generally when taking office had been respected, especially in the matter of keeping down prices, there would not <Col N="962" /> have been any need for the moneys being sought here because they arise <i>in toto</i> from the fact that prices have not been kept down.</P>
      <P>I shall now endeavour to speak on the subheads and also, with your permission, make general reference to this thing called education.  I think the time has come when we must ask: &ldquo;What of education and why?&rdquo; What do we need the money for and why?  Have we not enough education in the country at present?  This is something to which we should be applying ourselves.  As I see it, in certain areas at least the country is overflowing with education.  We have thousands of leaving certificate holders, hundreds of university graduates, all wondering, as I am now, about this thing which we call education. They are saying to themselves: &ldquo;I was told what it was.  I went and sought it.  I found it.  Now I have it but what does one do with it?&rdquo; That is a fair comment on the position at present and it must be especially relevant to the fact that the people have already spent or committed themselves to an expenditure of £200 million and we are now looking for an additional £26 million.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not wish to interrupt but I am sure the Deputy is aware that on Supplementary Estimates we are confined to the subheads.  The general question of education may be discussed on a token estimate which the Chair understands, the Minister has said he has no objection to introducing. Therefore, education as a whole may be discussed later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not propose to develop that but I think it should be accepted as being very pertinent to the subheads and all we have before us that we should stop and ask what is it required for?  Is this the avenue through which we get money to subsidise the teaching profession, money for all the purposes indicated here? Even though the discussion on the philosophy of the matter must await another day I think it is at least to some extent relevant to what we are discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="963" /> I propose to move on to primary education and the moneys sought here in respect of it.  My first comment relates to subhead C.10, grants towards cost of painting of schools.  There was no provision in the original Estimate and I should like to know why.  Is it the policy that we do not make any annual provision for the painting of schools?  I should imagine that there would be such an annual provision. The Department have within their ranks many educated people and one would have assumed that having regard to their resources it would have been possible to predict more accurately the amount of money required for their various operations.  I relate that specific question to this subhead.</P>
    <P>We talk of moneys in respect of salaries, buildings and painting, but surely it is possible to have a word regarding the children attending primary schools.  There has been talk of a student/teacher ratio of 1:40 and 1:35.  Certain averages have been given.  In the schools in my constituency the ratio is much higher.  I think the tragedy of education is that the unfortunate children, of whom 250,000 do not go beyond primary education, are not getting a fair deal from the total of £220 million being spent on education.  A standard primary curriculum is being applied overall and no regard is had to the special position of certain areas or to the fact that, say, in the Tolka Valley area a new population is moving in with children coming from other schools, with disruption of domestic and family life.  The Minister promised me that adequate facilities in the way of buildings would be available for them but we have a situation where already the school that allegedly would provide those facilities is filled and the Department are transporting children from that area to other areas around the perimeter of a city.</P>
    <P>I link this comment with a reference to school transport.  I had occasion some months ago to report to the Department that in respect of the children to whom I have referred I had seen a total of 187 primary school children being transported in one <Col N="964" /> double-decker bus, the overflow from that new school.  Having brought the position to the notice of the Department and of CIE the position was corrected but it had obtained for at least a week.  How long more would it have obtained if it had not been brought to notice?  Who is worrying, or is anybody worrying about these children, many of whom are still being transported out of that area?</P>
    <P>We talk here about equal rights and facilities being available all round.  I do not know if in the Minister's constituency the position is such that children attending primary schools have not what is regarded as the normal standard.  I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>Reference is made here to moneys required for second and third level education.  The first obligation on this House is to ensure that ample provision is made in respect of the branch of education that all our children must avail of and most of whom must depend on, primary education.  There is much talk about boards of management and those with children attending primary schools know of the requirement from now on of the payment of a fee in respect of primary education, something unknown in this country and something contrary to the Constitution.  Every week there is a collection in one form or another to defray the running expenses of the school.  We might do well to dwell on the fact that there is no such requirement in the case of university students who do not have to make any special contribution.  Their parents do not have to get together to organise the collection of money in respect of the management of the university.  It might be said that these students are paying fees but their fees do not in any way pay for the service they are getting.  At present there is a <i>per capita</i> subsidy of about £1,000 in respect of every university student.  Why do we expect so much from taxation for that level of education&mdash;which I know is very necessary but which concerns what I would regard possibly as the educational elité?  Why are we so generous with money at that level and at the same <Col N="965" /> time so niggardly with money at the level of education affecting all our students?</P>
    <P>Imagine a situation in a school in Finglas with children coming from homes where the educational start they have got leaves something to be desired, and 45 of those children being pushed into a room with a teacher.  That is the position that obtains with those children until they reach the age of 14 or 15 when they are released with the hope that they will do the best thing they can for themselves.</P>
    <P>We must from now on pay much more attention to the fact that more children than ever are dependent upon that first step and that it is that first step which conditions every other step along the road.  I want to see a reversal of the generosity in the matter of moneys until such time as we are satisfied that the very best has been done for primary school students.  That is not the position at the moment.  I have referred on another occasion to many shortcomings in respect of the curriculum, many shortcomings in respect of other aspects.  Repetition of my arguments in those respects will be postponed for another occasion.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Parliamentary Secretary is here.  I do not want him to assume that that is the prelude to any form of attack.  In the matter of school transport, I cannot understand why it is not possible to increase the subsidy to CIE in respect of students living in Dublin city and on the perimeter of the city who must travel elsewhere for education.  Take the case of students who lived in Pimlico and who because of inadequate housing in the area have been transferred to Finglas, Ballyfermot or Tallaght.  I speak with direct reference to school transport and education, forgetting for the moment the social aspects which affect children just as they do adults.  It will be accepted that educationally it is desirable that such students should continue their education in the area in which they had been living.  The student who is transferred to an outlying area finds that there is no school accommodation for him there and the authorities will transport him to a school in the vicinity <Col N="966" /> where there are vacancies.  That is the only consideration.  It is a question, to put it bluntly, of where can you shove him in.  That is not the correct attitude.  The moneys given should be devoted to assisting that child to travel back to the centre where he had been attending school.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that he will get that form of assistance.  It may be suggested that it would be difficult to administer such a system.  I do not think it would be.  I do not think it is a matter beyond the competence of the Minister's advisers.  Having regard to the amount of money being spent on school transport, a very good case can be made for assisting the type of student to whom I refer.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of school buses to which Deputy Kitt has referred, Deputies must have noticed on every road, at practically every hour of the day, school buses lying idle. Having regard to the capital investment in those buses, we should have inquired further and without much difficulty we would have discovered areas where those buses could be put to greater use.  For instance, they could be used to transport children to centres of historical interest and, especially in the case of second level students, to industrial centres.  They could be used for what might be described as geography classes and nature study.</P>
    <P>It would be an interesting exercise to plot the number of hours during which school buses are used as against the number of hours during which they are idle.  School buses involve large capital outlay.  The full utilisation of the bus is the best return on that investment.  In the case of an aeroplane the least return on the capital outlay is during the time when the plane is left idle.  The same applies to a bus. With the provision of additional moneys there could be full utilisation of school buses.</P>
    <P>There is an examination fee for second level examinations.  Unfortunately, we will be living with examinations as they are for a long time.  It will be always necessary to have a system with which to measure the achievements of one student as against another.  It could be done in <Col N="967" /> a more sympathetic fashion but this is not the opportunity to discuss alternative systems.  An opportunity is provided on this occasion to refer to, say, the fees in respect of the group certificate, the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  It may be suggested that the fee is not high, that it does not place an undue burden on parents.  Again, I am searching for the attitude towards examinations and examination fees at that level as against the higher level.  How does the examination fee at second level compare with the fees payable at third level?  There is a fee of £2.50 for a boy or girl sitting for the leaving certificate examination. It is worthy of note that, having passed the examination with four or five honour grades, there is no guarantee in the matter of earning one's livelihood of sure employment. Compare that with the situation in the universities or in the other third level colleges.  What fee is charged? Is any fee charged at all?</P>
    <P>There is reference here to university scholarships.  What I am about to say now will not be popular but I do not believe saying what is popular is part and parcel of education. I am not happy about the situation of children in our primary schools whose parents contribute to central taxation out of which money is paid to subsidise students in university.  I see neither equity nor justice in that especially when I know that the student who emerges from university with a profession&mdash;let it be that of doctor, lawyer, dentist or what-have-you, I might make special reference here to the legal profession but I do not think it would be right to isolate one from the others&mdash;earned through his own industry admittedly but contributed to materially in large measure by the parents of what I describe as neglected children because I think it is true that the university graduate is subsidised to the tune of about £1,000.  I know fees are paid but I know the fees are not sufficient to meet the cost of university education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="968" /> I do not think it fair that the parents of primary school children should be asked to continue subsidising university students when we do not get any admission from those who benefit from third level education that they owe anything to the rest of the community. There is an acceptance in the matter of service that they owe something and will give it but I do not think there is any acceptance or even any understanding of the price at which this education should be made available.  I know a child of poor parents may attain to university but the percentage is very, very small.  I believe that the system is such that such children merely fill a gap that cannot be filled by other sections.  I am not saying the Minister holds identical views with me but I have sufficient faith in his judgment to assume he accepts there is, perhaps, something in what I say.</P>
    <P>Have we reached the stage now at which we should be evolving a new scheme particularly in respect of those who are my first concern, the weaker section in our community, the intelligent, industrious boy or girl coming from a home where money is not available in any great measure whose higher education cannot be financed by parents?  Could we not have a scheme under which a loan would be available to this type of student?  We should not concentrate too much on whether he got seven or eight grades A, B, or C in his leaving certificate because it does not follow that that type of student is the best suited for university education.  Let us see now if we cannot redress the balance and correct the undoubted injustice which exists at the moment, not by taking more money from those who already have to pay but rather by making money available to them.  The successful graduate should be under obligation to return the compliment and pay back the money loaned.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the universities, I have found myself in association with these people especially in the last few months.  I do not want to give the impression now that I am in any way critical of these people.  I am not.  I take people as I find them.  If they <Col N="969" /> impress with their sincerity, their regard for their fellow citizens, their intelligence, logic and common sense, then I am quite ready to be impressed. That is the yardstick which I apply.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that someone who has a chain of degrees is automatically superior to other friends I have in other areas.  In the main I find these people sound products and good advertisements of what might be called third level education.  In respect of others I am at a loss to see where the much paraded benefit of third level education is to be seen.  I am sure that if invited to co-operate and examine the situation&mdash;it would appear that for far too long third level education has been cornered, and monopolised&mdash;we could anticipate the assistance and the co-operation of the universities.</P>
    <P>It is indefensible for the Minister to underestimate to the extent of £1 million for comprehensive and community schools.  The original Estimate was for £3 million and the additional sum now required is £1 million.  I thought the additional sum was in connection with matters which were more or less identical with third level colleges and for that reason I wondered why the error of underestimation is not the same.  It is more than extraordinary to be out £1 million on an original Estimate.  In thinking of the 13.5 per cent failure by the officers of the Department to anticipate expenditure I recall that some years ago when I was an important&mdash;in my own estimation&mdash;clerical officer in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries if I was responsible for the preparation of the Estimate which referred to the section in which I worked and was out to that extent my EO and my HEO would have been asking questions.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to increases in salaries which represent the biggest factor in the overall shortfall but surely the Department realised that negotiations were taking place and in some cases had been finalised and that inevitably that meant a fairly substantial increase.  The Minister should indicate the provision made in that regard in the original Estimate.</P>

      <P>What subhead is the Deputy referring to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the 13 per cent shortfall in the Estimate and the reference to salaries.  I am being critical of the extent to which the Estimate failed to indicate the true financial position in respect of this year.  Originally, the Minister looked for £198 million and now he is seeking an additional £26 million, a substantial increase.  I am critical of the Minister's officials who did not realise, in respect of primary and secondary school education, they were dealing with, or had dealt with, applications in respect of salary increases which would have to be met and would require the moneys now sought.  They should have been obvious last year.  This is not an omission which is peculiar to the Department of Education; we have had it in respect of other Departments.</P>
      <P>One wonders whether it was part of general policy that estimates at the beginning of the year, or last year's budget, did not necessarily have to paint a true picture.  Occasionally, my wife complains if I do not compliment her on her cooking.  I tell her that any time I do not like it I will tell her but my wife says that is not enough.  That thought strikes me in respect of these estimates.  I hope the Minister is not expecting that contributions from these benches will in any way be different from the traditional contributions.  In Opposition one indicates shortcomings and acts as an opposer rather than a complimenter. Ideally, it would be better if we complimented the Minister rather than opposed or criticised him but I am following the traditional function of this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To depart from that, I compliment the Minister on what he has done in the matter of capitation grants.  It might have been better had it been done earlier.  The Minister can say it might have been done when Fianna Fáil were in Government.  I say yes. So long as we accept the situation in which there are capitation grants we must also accept that there will be variations, that if the capitation grant is £15 one year and if, as has been <Col N="971" /> indicated by the Minister, there is to be a 13 per cent increase in the matter of the moneys he wants, the same thing can be said for increasing these grants by the same percentage, or at least there should be a mechanism through which the capitation grant would be increased in accordance with ever-increasing costs.</P>
    <P>Goldsmith wrote about the hare whom horse and hound pursue, panting to the place from whence at first he flew.  I flew from the national schools and I return to them now before concluding, to the national schools in the areas around Dublin which are being newly developed. Earlier I resisted the temptation to ask for details about the second school which should have been built or is to be built to accommodate students in Finglas South.  I avoided referring to the position of the secondary school of St. Michael knowing that the Minister has given an assurance that the extension of that school is being expedited.</P>
    <P>In respect of the primary schools, I ask the Minister for heaven's sake to set up some special unit which will examine the position in Dublin.  I make no apology about concentrating on Dublin because here we have the biggest number of primary school students and these students are not getting value for money.  We are exposing them to the new curriculum and the manner in which we are treating them under the guise of education is not bringing from the students and will not bring from them when they are adults the recognition which should be.  We are not entitled to any public recognition from those students or their parents.  We are assuming that that which is appropriate to what might be regarded&mdash;one must be very cautious about terms&mdash;as suitable for shall we say sophisticated &ldquo;betterclass, more educated areas&rdquo; is automatically suited to that particular area.  It is not.</P>
    <P>In the matter of good citizenship, of respectability, of industry, of decency, the parents to whom I refer compare with the best, but, unfortunately, some of them, in the matter <Col N="972" /> of what they can do for their children within the educational framework, are not competent and, therefore, there is an obligation on us, which the rest of the community will accept, to endeavour to fill the gap, to make up for this deficiency.  That has not been done.</P>
    <P>In those areas we have bigger classes.  The school to which I refer originally had 17 classrooms, 16 plus a communal room.  The communal room went in the first year of the life of the new school because the manager had to put a class into it. That should not have happened.  I am being asked to agree to the voting of money and conscientiously I cannot let the opportunity pass without referring to this.  Every school in the country has a communal room or a library.  Those children have not got it.  In their first year that free room has gone because the manager had to use it to put in more children, and other children who were going to the school had to be transported to other areas, children who already had been mobile in the matter of housing. Surely these children deserve not just the same but more attention than the non-mobile students in more secure areas?</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for the tolerance shown to me in referring to matters which, though very directly concerned with the Estimate before us, might be difficult to identify with any special subhead.</P>

      <P>The information and data recently submitted by the local committee is being examined in my Department in conjunction with other available data to see if it will be possible to sustain a case for submission to the EEC Commission to have the area in question, or certain parts thereof, designated as disadvantaged within the terms of the directive.  I should add that the only areas designated as disadvantaged, apart from certain mountainous areas devoted largely to sheep production, are the western counties, where special aids to agricultural development have traditionally applied.  It is doubtful if the EEC Commission would agree to any significant extensions <Col N="974" /> outside the western counties. Moreover, the available data indicates that farm income levels generally in this area of Tipperary and Limerick are not significantly below the national average, and it may not be possible, therefore, for the area to meet the multiple criteria prescribed in the directive.</P>

They were told by the Land Commission&mdash; this is not really my responsibility at that stage&mdash;that if they had this sort of problem, to go and speak to the Department of Social Welfare.  They did and they knew their situation before they finalised the deal.  It is not fair to say that they did not know in advance where they stood.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
      <P>The domestic meat trade and the export meat trade operate under different systems of veterinary inspection arising from the requirements of different codes of legislation.  I am aware of the shortcomings in the supervision of the supply of meat for the home market but these shortcomings have existed for many years past.  Various recommendations on this matter have recently been the subject of a special study by my Department preparatory to taking part in a review of the whole problem in collaboration with the other Departments and interests concerned.  Because of the complexity of the legislation, much of which dates back to the last century, it could be some time before the problem can be effectively resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I say yes and no in answer to that because exporting is a specialised job.  The trouble is if you facilitate export from local authority slaughterhouses you will have small people nipping in and out of the business and getting operatives for two or three months who will not know their job.

Of course, many growers obtain their seed requirements from their own crops or from neighbouring growers.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Doonbeg fishermen have taken the initiative in regard to making provision for safe landing there, that the Land Commission have made land available to provide the facilities there and that the Clare county development team regard this as a very high priority? In fact, I think it is their No. 1 priority.  This is probably one of the safest harbours in west Clare.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that it is time his Department came in and did something?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Several representations have been received relative to improvements at Doonbeg and it has got special attention from me as a result of those representations. However, the position is that the value of fish landings, mainly lobsters, in the last five years was limited.  In 1970 it was £5,000 odd.  In 1971 it was £1,500 and in 1972, £2,113.  In 1973 it was £5,679 and in 1974, £6,534.  The cost of the works involved would be high in proportion to the value of the landings.  Again we took into account that at Seafield, which is nine miles away, a harbour improvement scheme was carried out recently costing £71,000.  The Minister has said that Doonbeg would be examined as sympathetically as possible. I can repeat that but Deputy Daly will appreciate that the fishing potential there is not too high at present.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that one of the major reasons why fish landings there are limited is because there are no proper facilities for landing? If the Parliamentary Secretary would provide some money, even a very small amount, it would help the local people who are going to provide facilities there anyway.</P>

I am sure the Deputies are aware of the nature of the regulations.  In Kerry nine qualified. In Cork the number was 134.  Of course, in other fishing districts the number is much higher.  The Waterford board may issue up to 281 licences and the Letterkenny board up to 212.  All the licences are issued strictly in accordance with the regulations laid down.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if it is still proposed that the new regulations governing the use of tachograph control of driving hours, and so on, will become operative on 1st January, 1976 as announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Accession Treaty the EEC regulations governing the use of tachographs, maximum daily driving hours, and so on, are applicable to Irish domestic transport as from 1st January, 1976.</P>
      <P>However, as announced on 3rd October, 1975 the Government are seeking a deferment of the application of these regulations, following consultations with trade unions and employers, in so far as they affect Irish domestic transport, for a period of two years.  The request for deferment is being pursued with the EEC authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that an announcement was made on the 1.30 News today concerning a further meeting in connection with this problem.  Would the Minister not accept the urgency of this matter and that there is grave concern here among trade union members and employers generally who want to know where they will stand on 1st January which is now very near?  Obviously, we have no opportunity of being in the position to implement this proposal on 1st January.  Could we have <Col N="994" /> any sort of assurance or at least a ray of hope that a postponement here is expected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Much will depend on what actually takes place at the discussions now going on in Brussels.  I do not think there is any great fear on the part of either employers or trade unionists because they are well aware of the situation and when we entered the EEC we agreed to accept the terms and conditions laid down. We feel that we would require further time and having consulted both trade unions and employers the matter is at present being discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are seeking a two-year postponement.  Why did we not go about it at an earlier stage? Why did we not have the meetings that are being held this week and next week held long ago in order to have the situation clarified well in advance of 1st January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions have been taking place over quite a lengthy period.  It was easy to accept what the EEC wanted us to do at any time if we said that we would operate from 1st January but we refused to accept and so far we have not made progress with the EEC on the matter.  That is why the further discussion is taking place.  It is easy to close the book on any of these things and say that we will agree with them.  We do not agree with them and that is the reason for the further discussions. The matter has been discussed over a very long period.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the measures that are being taken to publicise the fact that grants are being made available from the European Social Fund to private firms towards training costs; the number of firms that has availed themselves of these grants to date; and the total amount involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The availability of assistance from the European Social Fund for training programmes carried out by private firms has been publicised in a variety of ways.  There has been Press publicity by my Department, by the Industrial Development Authority and by AnCO.  The matter has also been publicised in various publications which are distributed widely to industry for example, the AnCO News and the IDA News and the IDA annual report.  The employers' organisations too have given widespread publicity in their journals and otherwise to their members.  A most effective method for making the availability of social fund assistance known to private firms is through AnCO training advisory service.  The AnCO training advisers in the course of their regular visits to private firms throughout the country for discussions about training matters advise firms of the possibilities of social fund assistance.</P>
      <P>To date, social fund grants have been approved for training programmes of 42 private firms involving a total amount of fund assistance of almost £1.1 million.  Applications for a further 20 private firms for an amount of over £400,000 are under consideration by the European Commission. These figures relate only to social fund assistance for existing firms carrying out training in conjunction with re-equipment programmes.  Applications for fund assistance for training programmes of new firms are submitted by the Industrial Development Authority, Gaeltarra Éireann and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been refusals.  Would the Minister not deem it advisable now to advise the Minister for Labour to approach the Department of Industry and Commerce with a view to changing the restrictive regulations in our own country restricting some of our private firms from availing of grants from EEC where there are moneys available to them but which moneys are not being made available because of the existence of these conditions of our own Department of Industry and Commerce?  Would he not now seek a change in those regulations to enable more training money to be obtained by private firms here? There have been refusals on those grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put the Deputy's views to the Minister.  I think he will admit that a very sizeable sum of £1.1 million has been approved.  I do not know how many have been refused but there are pretty strict regulations under which applicants must qualify before they get grants.  I will, as the Deputy suggested, ask the Minister to have a look.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that.  Deputy Fitzgerald is not correct when he says they are internal regulations.  There are three factors which limit the extent of training courses for private firms which qualify for social fund grants.  It is the requirement of the social fund regulations that these conditions are carried out.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the total amount of moneys provided from the European Social Fund for retraining purposes; the number of workers who were taken on for retraining since the inception of the scheme; and where the retraining was undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that social fund assistance of about £14¾ million has been approved to date for programmes of full-time training of workers, which would include training for new jobs of unemployed persons both with and without previous employment experience as well as retraining for higher skills of persons already in employment.  The total number of persons benefiting from those programmes is estimated at 46,000.  These estimates do not include amounts of social fund assistance approved for, or numbers of trainees concerned in, (i) short training courses, (ii) apprentice-type training courses or (iii) programmes of vocational rehabilitation of handicapped persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The training programmes concerned have been undertaken in various locations, including AnCO training centres, other specialist training centres <Col N="1004" /> in Ireland and overseas, within individual Irish firms, with firms abroad, regional technical colleges, hotel training schools and vocational schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the extent to which he intends to use the European Social Fund in order to help young people, particularly school-leavers, to find jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Assistance from the European Social Fund is already being obtained to the maximum extent possible for schemes which are eligible under the fund regulations.  A very substantial part of that assistance relates to programmes which benefit young persons, including school leavers.</P>
      <P>The Council decision of 17th June, 1975, taken under my chairmanship and embodied in the decision of 22nd July, 1975, provided for special social fund intervention for operations to facilitate the employment and the geographical and professional mobility of young people under 25 years of age.  Arising from that decision the possibilities of promotion of additional schemes which will attract fund assistance have been under active consideration by various official agencies.</P>
      <P>At present three Irish applications in respect of schemes of this nature are under consideration by the European Commission.  The first, submitted by the Industrial Development Authority, concerns a new scheme of training by employers with suitable facilities of apprentices surplus to their own requirements.</P>
      <P>The second application, submitted by AnCO with the co-operation of the Department of Education, is concerned with the provision of one year off-the-job training in AnCO training centres or in special centres within the vocational education system and in the public or private sectors for (a) young persons who, although suitable for apprenticeship cannot find employment, and (b) young persons who cannot be given suitable training in their employer's establishments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third application, promoted by <Col N="1005" /> the Department of Education is concerned with the training of young persons (a) in pre-employment or preparation for work courses; (b) in secretarial courses; (c) for technician level skills; and (d) in one-year foundation courses for young persons wishing to pursue careers as accountants, administrators, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is expected that further applications for social fund assistance relating to programmes in respect of young persons will be submitted to the European Commission over the next few months.  One such application which will be submitted very shortly will relate to a programme promoted by AnCO, called the Community Youth Training Programme in consultation with a number of local authorities, concerned with the training of unemployed school leavers and young persons for work on community projects. Some applications or parts of applications already lodged with the Commission involving the training of young persons will be dealt with under the Council decision of 22nd July.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if his Department have given consideration to the NESC Report on Manpower in Ireland especially in regard to the role of his Department in the formulation of employment policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments of the NESC on the OECD Report on Manpower Policy in Ireland have been examined in my Department.  There are three propositions which are put forward in the OECD Report and endorsed by the NESC.  These are, that manpower policy has an important and key place in the general context of economic and social planning; that the Department of Labour should be involved <Col N="1006" /> in all aspects of policy making which impinge on employment; and that the Department should have adequate resources in the way of specialised staff to provide information about the labour market and be in a position to forecast employment trends, and particularly imbalances in supply and demand.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, I agree with these views and recommendations.  I am making arrangements to appoint a number of specialised staff to a planning unit which will be responsible, <i>inter alia,</i> for the co-ordination and analysis of manpower information.  The institution of the premium employment scheme already gives the Department a direct if limited, role in employment creation.</P>
      <P>I regard the development of the role of the Department of Labour in the formulation of employment policy as a matter to be pursued in consultation with the other Ministers and Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>Two advisory committees now operate under my Department.  The first is the Inter-Departmental Committee on Manpower Policy, representative of AnCO, IDA and other Government Departments.  The second is the Committee on Manpower and Training Implications of Potential off-shore Oil and Gas finds.  Representation on this committee includes the Departments of Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power, Education, AnCO, Gaeltarra Éireann, the ESB, the regional technical colleges, the Higher Education Authority and the universities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>While there are no formal arrangements for independent periodic assessments of the training carried out by AnCO, such assessments have recently been made by the OECD and by a group of experts appointed by the EEC.  Pending completion of a cost/benefit study of its adult training programme being conducted by AnCO under the supervision of a steering committee on which the Department of Finance and my Department are represented, I have no plans for a further independent assessment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Again may I ask the Minister for Labour through the Minister for Local Government, is he aware that the AnCO training programme provides only ten-week courses?  Where people for one reason or another have had their apprenticeship courses terminated all AnCO can offer is a ten-week training programme. All I am asking is, does the Minister think that is sufficient? People who considered that they were not properly trained have asked for further courses and AnCO say that there is only a ten-week training course, which they can repeat.  This is far from adequate for people who have had their training course terminated.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The action taken in this matter followed normal procedure for dealing with applications for work permits.</P>
      <P>The hospital applied for a permit three weeks after the doctor had been appointed.  Following consultation with the Department of Health and appropriate professional bodies about availability of Irish doctors my Department informed the hospital of the procedures which would have to be complied with to establish nonavailability of a suitable Irish doctor for the post and a temporary permit for six weeks was issued.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I will take Questions Nos. 25, 26 and 58 together.</P>
      <P>On the 16th October, 1975, I announced a number of measures designed to help deal with youth employment and training.</P>
      <P>Among the measures are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  I have accepted the proposals made by AnCO for a new apprenticeship system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> 2.  I have also arranged for AnCO to increase greatly the number of training places for apprentices and trainees in its training centres.  The number of training places for apprentices and technicians in the regional technical colleges has also been expanded and spare training capacity in firms is being taken up by AnCO to train more young people.</P>
    <P>3.  A pilot scheme entitled The Community Youth Training Programme has also been announced. Briefly, the scheme involves a short period of AnCO training followed by involvement in suitable community projects such as the renovation of old peoples' homes and so on.  The first projects are expected to involve the training of 100 young persons in the eastern region before Christmas.</P>
    <P>If the scheme proves successful it will be extended to other areas where suitable projects have been identified.</P>
    <P>4.  The special industrial training programme utilising the extra £1 million, made available in the January budget supplemented by ESF assistance, will have catered for 2,000 additional persons by the end of the year bringing the total trained in 1975 to over 7,000.</P>
    <P>Further steps to help mitigate the problem are being taken with the help of the European Social Fund and I will be outlining these steps in my reply to another question by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <P>The committee has three subcommittees; one dealing with the area of employment, training, welfare and pensions; a second subcommittee is examining the important area of women and the law; and the third subcommittee is looking into the area of the treatment of women by the media.</P>
      <P>The committee attaches particular importance to the question of improving industrial training for women and the need for the opening up of apprenticeships in traditionally male trades.  It has drawn up recommendations for the training of girl apprentices, the expansion of training facilities for women who wish to reenter the workforce and for the provision of pilot schemes to train women in disadvantaged areas.</P>

The indications are that there will be no opportunities for the 1976 apprentices and in view of that does the Minister not regard this as one of the most serious problems facing us?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I should like to make a statement to the House about the European Council of Heads of Government, accompanied by their Foreign Ministers, which met in Rome on 1st and 2nd December, 1975.</P>
      <P>As Deputies know, it was decided in Paris last December that there would be three meetings each year of heads of government of the countries of the European Community, accompanied by their Foreign Ministers.  The purpose of these meetings is to enable Governments to co-ordinate, at the highest level, their attitudes and policies on variou matters affecting the Community. It is basic to the purpose of these meetings that they should be conducted with a minimum of ceremony and a maximum of purpose. Generally speaking, they give orientations to the Community, which are implemented in accordance with normal Community practice.  Under these arrangements, there is no formal conmunique, as such.  However, it is also customary that there should be a short statement or statements of the conclusions. I shall arrange to have the statements issued on this occasion laid before the House shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the background against which the meeting was held.  The suggested agenda covered an extremely wide and complex range of subjects, including a review of the economic and social situation, present arrangements for financing the Community and its Budget, direct elections to the European Parliament, the report being prepared by the Belgian Prime Minister, Mr. Tindemans, the question of a single passport, separate British representation at the forthcoming Conference on International Economic Co-operation, and the Common Agricultural Policy.  On a number of these items, there are proposals by the German, British and Irish Governments, <Col N="1018" /> which were circulated before the meeting to the heads of government of the Community.</P>
    <P>On many of these issues, our position in the Community could have been seriously affected if the wrong decisions or orientations were taken. For this reason, we considered it important to submit for consideration by the meeting a formal memorandum of our views.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with the items discussed at the meeting I should like to say a few words on the general principle affecting our attitude.  We believe that the Community is now at a critical stage in its development.  Progress is being slowed by the tendency of member States to by-pass its procedures and institutions.  Faced with the present world crisis, the countries of the Community have been visibly moving apart. There are many examples of this&mdash;the manner in which the recent Rambouillet meeting was arranged is one of them and the fact that the solidarity of the Community on the vitally important Conference on International Economic Co-operation was, before the meeting, in doubt, is another.</P>
    <P>I spoke at the opening of the meeting on these issues and urged strongly on the other heads of government the necessity for a thorough appraisal of the measures needed to achieve the development of the Community in the way envisaged by the Treaties.  We must, before we look at the individual items, such as those making up the suggested agenda for the Rome meeting, make up our minds as to whether we are serious about the concept of European union, and, if we are, on the ways in which it is to be achieved. I was pleased that, in fact, the meeting concerned itself during the two days largely with this type of fundamental question and in its results demonstrated the strength of support of the heads of government represented there for the concept of European integration for the concept of European integration, as it is developing.</P>
    <P>This concern was demonstrated beyond all possibility of doubt by the amount of time and the vigour which went into the discussion of the British <Col N="1019" /> proposal for a separate seat at the forthcoming Conference on International Economic Co-operation.  The discussion on this subject was robust &mdash;taking up most of the second day of the meeting.  It showed beyond all possibility of doubt the strength of feeling of the member Governments on the subject.</P>
    <P>The way in which the problem was resolved was an indication of the spirit of the Community.  There is provision that during the Ministerial Conference, the President of the Community delegation may ask two additional Community members to present statements in the light of their experience provided that the statements are in conformity with the mandate approved by the Community. The understanding is that, in fact, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg will be invited to speak in this way. The achievement of this understanding that the Community will speak with one voice at the Conference is a great step forward in the development of the Community, as such.  It is not so long since we would have considered it utopian to believe that the countries of Europe would, at a vital international conference of this sort, speak with one voice.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of separate action by countries of the Community on issues which affect us all, there is the second major difficulty which faced us in Rome, in relation to the development of the Community, in the attitude which appears to have been developing of questioning the growth of the Community budget as a whole.  It is well that we should get this into perspective.  The budget of the Communities for 1975 is of the order of 1 per cent of the combined public expenditure of the member States of the Communities.  I know that on other definitions, this percentage is higher but the difference is not material to my point.  The proportion of the public expenditure of the countries of the Community represented by the budget is minute. The budget could be doubled or trebled and it would still represent only a small percentage of what the <Col N="1020" /> Governments and public authorities of the member States of the Community spend in or through their own budgets.</P>
    <P>With a budget equivalent to so small a share of the public expenditure of the member countries, we cannot expect to fulfil our hopes for economic and monetary integration&mdash; to get adequate regional and social policies going&mdash;through the institutions of the Community.  We cannot achieve our professed aims if we are not prepared to provide the means. We cannot advance integration if each Government chooses or is left to cope as best it can with its own problems, within its own territories, with little or no reference to the aims and procedures of the Community.</P>
    <P>The criticism voiced of the increases in the preliminary draft budget for 1976 are, perhaps, symptomatic of this approach.  I would be more receptive of these criticisms if it were demonstrated that the previous level of Community expenditure was sufficient to achieve the aims we have set out.  I doubt if this has been done.  The conclusions in Rome did not, in fact, damage, as we had feared, the prospects of the further growth of national resources to be committed to the Community.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of Community expenditure so as to ensure that it is properly spent and that value is obtained for money is a related aspect of this same problem.  The proposals made by the United Kingdom, German and Irish Governments&mdash; and by the Commission&mdash;to secure more effective financial control over Community expenditure were accepted by the Council, with an indication that they should be examined expeditiously.  This means that the European Parliament will be asked to examine, with the Council of Ministers and the Commission, the role which Parliament might play in controlling public expenditure by means of a committee or subcommittee&mdash;perhaps similar, in many ways, to the Public Accounts Committee. We also hope that the European Court of Auditors will be able to commence activities during 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> The Council also noted with satisfaction the strengthening which had taken place in the powers of the member of the Commission responsible for finance and the budget&mdash; without prejudice to the principle of the collective responsibility of the Commission, as laid down in the treaties.</P>
    <P>Criticism of the budget often centres on the amount spent by the Community under the common agricultural policy.  Agriculture absorbs more than 70 per cent of the total Community budget.  On this subject, there is a great danger that a double standard will be applied.  The Community have, for practical purposes, achieved a common market in industrial goods.  This is of immense benefit to the countries with a large industrial base.</P>
    <P>When we look to agriculture the picture is completely different.  There exist in the Community controls which are contrary to the concept of free trade.  The unity of the market which has been achieved or is in course of achievement for industry, is nowhere near being achieved in agriculture. The disruptive and protective effects of the monetary compensation amounts system are only too apparent to us all.</P>
    <P>The slow rate of progress in developing other common policies is, in part, responsible for the high proportion of the Community budget devoted to agriculture.  It is inevitable that expenditure on the most developed of Community policies should represent a significant proportion of total Community expenditure.  Nevertheless, the amount we, as a Community, spend on agriculture, is equivalent only to about 0.4 per cent of the total gross national product of the countries of the Community.  Further, this expenditure largely replaces national expenditure on agriculture.  I made these points briefly at the meeting. The current position is that the report of the Council of Agriculture Ministers will be the basis for the examination of the admitted defects in the operation of the CAP&mdash;but without, in any way, affecting the <Col N="1022" /> principle of that policy.  I regard this outcome as satisfactory to us.</P>
    <P>An obvious way to strengthen the institutions of the Community is through the direct involvement of the peoples of Europe in the selection of members of the European Parliament and the enlargement of the Parliament's powers.  Proposals on this were discussed in Rome at some length on both the first and second days of the meeting.  The conclusion is that elections to the European Parliament will be held on the same day in May or June in 1978&mdash;as I proposed originally at the Paris Summit last year.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, the present position is that we are represented in the European Parliament by ten members or just over 5 per cent of the total. Under proposals at present being considered we would be given 3.6 per cent of the membership of Parliament.  We would not regard this reduction in our proportionate representation as acceptable. There was considerable debate on this subject at the Rome meeting, with great stress being placed by some members on the need to observe strict proportionality as between membership and population.  This question is referred back for further consideration to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Other questions affecting the future and institutions of the Community were deferred until a later date.  The report to be presented by Mr. Tindemans, taken together with the proposals by the German and Irish Governments and the Commission, will provide considerable material for debate and discussion in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    <P>The meeting heard a report from those who attended the Rambouillet conference on the economic and social situation.  The need was stressed for close co-ordination between the economic policies of the member States in order to consolidate the recovery which seems to have begun and to improve the present level of employment. My impression was that for most of the countries represented at the meeting the lowest point in the present depression had been reached, if not passed.  This could have particular significance for us&mdash;with our high dependence on exports, but its effect will <Col N="1023" /> not be felt in a significant way before the end of 1976.</P>
    <P>It is particularly noteworthy that the rate of inflation in Germany in the year to November, 1975 was of the order of 5 or 6 per cent.  Our figure is more than three times that level.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough the conclusions, reinforced by the discussions in Rome, that we will have no prospect of being able to benefit by the upturn in world trade if we cannot sell what we produce; and this we will most certainly be unable to do unless we can make our prices competitive. Growth, employment and the prosperity of our country depend on this.</P>
    <P>When I came back from Brussels last July I was impressed by the strength of pessimism among the heads of government of some of the most powerful countries in the world as to economic prospects then existing.  This time the meeting was more optimistic but, for us, this optimism must be tempered by the knowledge that there is a great deal to be done before we can provide a firm basis for a recovery in employment and economic growth. The community here must make a contribution in the short term to safeguard our future.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would regard the meeting in Rome as having been a success in that some dangers which had been threatening us were staved off and advances were made in the further strengthening of the concept of a single Community: but I think that this success is still limited by the longer term dangers, some of which I have suggested in these comments.  A Community which does not progress must go backwards.  There can be no such thing as a standstill in the development of Europe.  There is still a long way to go before we establish economic and monetary union envisaged in the Treaty of Rome and elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express the Opposition's appreciation to the Taoiseach for reading this statement on the outcome of the Rome Summit held earlier this week.  However, before proceeding I must comment on the timing of the statement <Col N="1024" /> in the sense that we received no notice of it until a short time ago.  Yesterday it was intimated that the Taoiseach might make a statement at 7.00 p.m. yesterday.  Then we were told it would not be made, without further comment. This morning we were given no intimation on the Order of Business that the statement would be made this afternoon and I absented myself for an official luncheon engagement.  Shortly after 3 p.m. I was told for the first time that this statement would be made and I was presented with a copy of it.  It should be possible to arrange Government business in a more ordered manner and give the Opposition a more reasonable opportunity to present views on an important matter of this nature.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the statement itself. I feel the Taoiseach must have had his tongue in his cheek when he started the last paragraph of the statement by saying:</P>
      <P>In conclusion I would regard the meeting in Rome as having been a success in that some dangers which had been threatening us were staved off and advances were made in the further strengthening of the concept of a single Community...</P>
      <P>I may agree with him that some dangers that were threatening may have been staved off but, apart from the staving off of some of the dangers, I should like to know in what respect there were advances made apart from the decision to hold elections for membership of the European Parliament in 1980.  By and large, it will have to be admitted that all commentators regarded the Rome Summit as anything but a success.  I do not think any objective commentator would disagree with me when I say that 1975 will hardly rank as a year of great accomplishment and achievement within the European Community.  It was a year of depression, of economic insecurity.  Admitted though it must be that serious economic problems beset the member countries, there was little progress made in any direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I may come first to some of the dangers that the Taoiseach suggested were staved off.  Certainly, it <Col N="1025" /> was only right that to some extent British wings were trimmed in respect of the desire to be represented at the Conference on International Co-operation to be held in Paris later this month.  They based that desire on the fact that they were&mdash;as Mr. Wilson is reported to have said in Rome&mdash; about to join the first division in the league of oil producing/exporting countries.  I do not know how solid that claim will be.  It is only right to point out&mdash;and I am sure the Taoiseach must have pointed out, if not in public at least in private&mdash;that countries like Britain who, having voted for membership and having, not only by implication but by obvious design agreed to the terms of membership cannot renege on membership where it suits them.  If they feel now they are going to become economically independent as far as oil is concerned it ought to be pointed out to them that they cannot run under the European Economic Community umbrella for other purposes, in other areas, in which they feel they are weak.</P>
    <P>Similarly, at the Rambouillet Conference four of the more powerful members of the Community decided to ignore the other, smaller, members of the Community and were represented individually at that Rambouillet Conference without leave or licence, as far as I understand.  There is nothing in the Taoiseach's statement today to indicate that the disapproval of the smaller members of the Community was indicated very clearly and trenchantly to those four members for doing just that&mdash;for ignoring the interests, as they appear to have been ignored, of the other members of the Community by being accepted representatives at a Conference of this nature.  If representation was necessary on behalf of one or more members of the European Economic Community, then the full spirit of membership of that Community as a whole should have been represented and there should have been one voice at that conference speaking on behalf of the Community.</P>
    <P>At the first of these Summit Conferences I attended on behalf of the Government in October, 1972, in Paris the goal of economic and monetary <Col N="1026" /> union was postulated, and postulated to the point of having it effective by 1980.  One of the instruments, amongst others, to be used in attaining the goal of economic and monetary union was the Community regional policy.  Events since have shown that, to say the least of it, there has been an absence of enthusiasm among certain members of the Community for the implementation of a regional policy.  I am not going to absolve our Government for not being more aggressive in ensuring reasonable and effective regional policy emerging at this stage.  I have accused the Government before of not being vigorous enough, not using sufficient muscle, in their various appearances, through members of the Government, at Brussels and Luxembourg on this particular issue.  Unless we have an effective policy that can equate living standards and incomes throughout the Community, then there is no point whatever in talking about economic and monetary union.  Therefore, I would ask the Government to ensure that our efforts in the future be redoubled and that real muscle be put into our discussions with regard to the implementation of a regional policy.</P>
    <P>As it happens, the debacle of the EEC Regional Policy demonstrates very clearly the lack of progress within the Community over the last year. Recently the EEC Commission has been advised by the Committee, under the chairmanship of M. Robert Marjolin, the former Vice-President of the Commission, that the aim of economic and monetary union by 1980 is now unrealistic.  But that is as far as we go.  We do not know when the aim will be realistic, at what date.  I suggest that the time has now come when serious attention should be given to this very desirable goal because it is part and parcel of the basic ideal of European union.  At least, in this respect the one decision that was made in Rome&mdash;that is, to hold direct elections in 1980&mdash;will achieve some progress in the goal towards European union.  Unfortunately, there has been little debate in this country on this particular subject.  The time has come when we must direct our attention to a full debate on where Ireland will go within Europe and where Europe is <Col N="1027" /> going on the road to European union. We must be sure that we know exactly what are our goals, where our interests lie.  We must ensure, in whatever strategy we evolve, that our interests and national identity be properly protected along the road towards the European unity goal.</P>
    <P>Direct elections will be perhaps one of the most immediate matters to which attention will have to be given by this House.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee have been giving some attention to it and indeed, I think, have reported on this subject.  I understand that each member country will be initially entitled to apply whatever method of election it decides in the first instance.  Thereafter, whether it be a four-or fiveyear period following the first election in 1980, there will have to be a uniform system of election.</P>
    <P>I understand that our Joint Committee have come up with the suggestion that, since the list system, the list or proportional representation system, is the one most likely to be adopted in Europe, perhaps we might adopt that system for our first European Parliament elections.  We shall have to decide this.  We shall have to make sure that whatever system we employ will result in a reasonably fair representation of Irish parliamentarians in Europe.  When I use the term &ldquo;Irish parliamentarians&rdquo; the question arises whether it will be possible for people who are not Members of the Oireachtas to go forward.  I shall deal with that very briefly. We should endeavour to maintain our present proportionate representation at least.  The Taoiseach mentioned that our present membership &mdash;ten out of 185, I think he said&mdash; represented 5 per cent.  If the proposal now made, as we understand it, is that we have 13 out of something like 355, that will reduce us to about 3.6 per cent.  We should maintain our present percentage proportion of membership, not simply as a matter of right but as something we think desirable, in that the smaller members ought to be given weighted representation <Col N="1028" /> in their favour.  It is a reasonable concept in parliamentary democracy that areas of scattered or limited population should have that little extra weight in ultimate representation. No matter what the arguments are, we should stand out for our full membership, at least membership based on present percentage proportions.</P>
    <P>When it comes to the form of election or the type of people who can put themselves forward for election, that is another issue.  Whether it would be confined to people who are supported by groups or Members of the Oireachtas, it would seem to be a denial of democracy if we left it open to anybody and everybody.  I am putting this forward as a proposition. If people who have no attachment to a political party, who are bound by no discipline, as we understand it in a political party, they could represent, with confidence, our interests in the European Parliament.  This question will have to be given some consideration.</P>
    <P>The next question which arises is, if we have any system whether it should apply to the country at large or if we should have it on a regional basis.  I have no hard and fast views about this, but it would seem that a reasonable basis for representation here would have a lot of merit, because we know there are disparities even within our own country of social and economic well-being.  For example, if there was even within our own system, a weighted means of representation of western areas, that would be a desirable course to adopt.</P>
    <P>I am speaking off the cuff because I have not had sufficient opportunity to read and absorb the Taoiseach's statement in detail.  But above all, as a parliament and particularly as an Opposition, we must complain about the lack of progress that has been made within the EEC.  We must complain at the obvious flexing of economic muscle by the more powerful members and we should not hesitate to use our equal rights as a member State within the Council of Ministers to ensure that whatever developments take place economically or politically in Europe <Col N="1029" /> that we will make our voices effective as we have the right and the means to do in any further economic or political evolution in Europe in the years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In conclusion, I would like to ask why is this money being sought this year and not last year or early in the New Year?  I would be interested in ascertaining where this money will come from.  The time has come when we should be looking at this thing called education, analysing it and discovering whether we are interested in the materialistic side of it, if there is an idealistic concept about which we are concerned.  Are we happy about a situation which seems to help, intellectually and educationally, the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer?  When we are spending £250 million we have an obligation to reassess the position and, to use the terminology of the people in my constituency, ask what is it in aid of.  Does education today do no more than replace what was referred to as the old capitalistic system?  The better educated one is, the greater his power and the higher the standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does our educational system recognise the importance of such a characteristic in our young people and adults as honesty because there seems to be <Col N="1030" /> no provision for this in our examinations? Are we concerned about the children who are amenable to discipline, who are prepared to do their very best but who under this system see very little reward for their efforts? Are we happy about the movement from primary to secondary schools? There are some schools where a child cannot get a place unless he satisfies certain educational requirements.  He is asked if he is good at Maths, or English or Irish.  Irrespective of his code of behaviour or respectability, if he does not get a high mark in the entrance exam, he will not get a place in that school.  The child who is so rejected cannot be blamed if he feels that in today's world, and under this system of education that if he does not have a high IQ and does not pass set examinations which often require no more than a good memory, a certain mental ability and a tutoring in the questions likely to be asked, there is no place for him.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier about the educational system which applies a general standard and assumes that it will suit everybody.  I spoke of the primary schools in my constituency.  Like many other speakers, I find it very difficult to keep within the confines of the Estimate and I thank the Chair for bearing with me.  When considering this system of education, perhaps the Minister would bear in mind the schools I mentioned, especially the &ldquo;Little Willie&rdquo; School in Baldoyle&mdash; I am happy to see some of them are with us today.  Is the present standard of education at primary, secondary and third levels appropriate to our visitors?  May I, through the Chair, ask our visitors to let us have their views later?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on this Supplementary Estimate before us and I shall try to be as relevant as possible.  I am astonished at the size of the Supplementary Estimates coming before us.  Sums in relation to the original Estimates must not have been done correctly.  It is certainly not lack of intelligence on the part of the Minister but there should have been more accuracy with the original Estimate.  We all know it <Col N="1031" /> is impossible to be completely accurate but there is a great lack of accuracy in relation to the Estimates presented to us.  When such large Supplementary Estimates have to be introduced I feel there is an attempt being made to deceive the House.</P>
      <P>I do not want it to be taken that when people on this side of the House stand up and make statements saying we disagree about the size of Supplementary Estimates that we disagree with money being spent on education. Education is very important for the country and the money spent on it is absolutely essential but requests for those increases, which are sought now, should be available earlier in the year. Most of them should be on the original Estimates.</P>
      <P>There are a few comments I should like to make as far as rural Ireland is concerned in relation to the particular schemes under the Department of Education.  We were told earlier how the free travel affects Dublin pupils.  I now want to talk about how it affects pupils in rural Ireland going to either primary or secondary schools.  There should be flexibility about the rules in relation to catchment areas.  Deputies from all sides of the House have to make representations in relation to children who are being brought to school.  We have to ask to have distances taken off for some pupils or to have distances added in the case of other pupils.  The Minister should not be tied with too much red tape regarding the free bus service to primary and secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards secondary education, Deputies in my area have a particular problem where we have one vocational school at which the leaving certificate is not done.  The Department of Education say there are not enough pupils. The reason for this is that when parents are sending their children to secondary schools they do not want to send them to schools where they cannot finish their secondary education.  If pupils in my area go to this excellent vocational school they have to leave it after doing the intermediate certificate and go to another school to do the leaving certificate.  The result of all <Col N="1032" /> this is that we are writing to the Minister's Parliamentary Secretary for transport for pupils from this school to other schools in the same catchment area where they can do their leaving certificate.  I am sure the Minister knows this vocational school well because it is the only one in my area.  If we could get the full secondary course in that school we would not be annoying the Department of Education for the pupils.</P>
    <P>Another thing which affects rural Ireland is the recently appointed school committee boards and the grants allocated. I listened to the Dublin people saying that the schools are overcrowded. We have the reverse position in the rural schools.  The schools are too big in many areas for the number of pupils attending them.  There is one three-teacher school which is now demoted to a two-teacher school.  The building is the same size but the number of pupils has gone down.  The grant is the same size.  The grant for the upkeep is per pupil.  It is a fairly large building.  There were enough pupils for three teachers but there are now only sufficient for two.  However the full building must be maintained.  The present grant system per pupil is detrimental to rural Ireland.  This is also very hard on the Protestant community. I know of several of them who only have a few pupils going to a national school.  They only get the grant per pupil.  I ask the Minister to consider this very carefully and see if any adjustment can be made.  It is now the parent committees who have to collect the local contribution.  Is there not a contribution to be made per child?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get those issues clarified, particularly the grant per pupil.  A number of teachers have come to me about this.  I want to pay tribute to the teachers in all three grades&mdash;first, second and third levels &mdash;for their great service to the country in the past.  It is important to stress the part they played when we speak on the Education Estimate.</P>
      <P>At the moment a lot of people are unemployed.  Some of them are unmarried and are quite young.  Many of them have approached me to see if they could get a place in some vocational school to improve their education.  If they go to AnCO they must have either the group certificate or the leaving certificate before they can do any course.  I know of a young unmarried man of 27 years of age.  He felt on principle that he should not accept unemployment assistance.  He was anxious to come to Dublin to see if there was any possibility of finding a school where he could improve himself. He tried the country and as far as I know there was only a woodwork class.  He cannot do any of the courses in AnCO unless he has a group certificate. He has a good primary school education and he cannot improve himself anyway unless he can get into some vocational school.  He would like to improve himself during his period of unemployment.  When I was young and we left the national schools we could go to technical schools and do various courses, such as woodwork and engineering, to improve ourselves. Apparently now there are no classes of this kind.  This should be seriously considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney mentioned the whole question of what we are educating people to.  Is it to an examination?  It is not for me, who only got a national school education to comment too much <Col N="1034" /> on this but I have met people who have leaving certificates and whose standard of general education is not very high.  They have been educated to an examination.  I do not know how this can be changed.  I think they should be assessed on their standard over a number of years within the school.  I know that &ldquo;pull&rdquo; could come into this but under the present system certain pupils know the type of questions that will be asked at examinations and they educate themselves to the examination papers.  Their general education is not of a high standard.  There are many people who are well educated but at a written or oral examination they do not do well.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I will not be here when the Minister is replying because I am very anxious to hear his reply.  I am interested in the question of the grant and how the local contribution is being collected.  In the past, it was collected at the church door.  The grant is not satisfactory where the school is big and the number of pupils small.  The Protestant community in particular have only small numbers of pupils and as the grant is paid per pupil it is not very satisfactory for them.  I would like the Minister to clarify this situation.</P>

      <P>On a point of procedure, I would like to get this Estimate this evening but I have no wish to suggest that the debate be curtailed. I have already suggested to the Opposition spokesman that a token estimate of £10 would give Deputies an opportunity, at a later stage, of continuing the debate and I would hope that the Whip opposite will be able to accept that arrangement.  I would not ask if it were not of absolute necessity that we should get it this evening.</P>

      <P>Our spokesman is not here at the moment and I would not like to give a decision on his behalf but he will be here later.  There are some other Deputies who wish to contribute to this debate.  The difficulty is that we have been getting a spate of Supplementary Estimates.  I do not for a moment question that the Minister is genuine in his offer to bring in a <Col N="1035" /> token Estimate but when would we discuss it?  There are only two more weeks left and then the whole thing goes by the board.  After Christmas we are in to a new financial year.  As Opposition Whip, I am daily being faced with a semi <i>fait accompli.</i> I found myself in a desperately awkward situation last week.  The Minister for Transport and Power in respect of a Bill told me that any time before the end of the session would do and two days later in the Seanad he said it was a must.  I find it very difficult to know exactly what to believe at present.  If the Minister for Education needed this money tonight, yesterday was a little too late to circulate the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister whether he has yet come to any decision in relation to a problem we have had in Laois for over 12 months.  The Minister told me in this House on 11th February last that he was awaiting legal advice.  He said:</P>
      <P>When this information is conveyed to me I will then be in a position to make a determination in the matter.</P>
      <P>This relates to the appointment of a headmaster at Portlaoise Vocational School.  I raised the matter in the Dáil on 20th May.  At that stage the Minister informed me that he was considering the views of the vocational education committee.  He said:</P>
      <P>I have seen the legal advice in question.  It was discussed at the meeting of the County Laois Vocational Education Committee on 14th April, 1975, and their views thereon were conveyed to me in the minutes of that meeting.  I am now considering the views of the committee and will be in touch with them in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I found it necessary to write to the Minister in July because I could not put down another question within a six-month period.  I had a reply from the Minister which conveyed, peculiarly, that the matter had moved into a <i>sub judice</i> situation.  We now find that the vocational education committee were playing ducks and <Col N="1036" /> drakes with the Minister.  Apparently the Minister is quite willing to allow this to happen and is not exerting his authority in this regard.  He said he shared my view that I did not want to see a committee dissolved and so on but I wonder how much longer will the Minister continue to allow the vocational education committee to flout his authority.  I would be glad if the Minister would deal with this in his reply because the people on the Laois side of my constitutency and the parents of pupils in Portlaoise are very annoyed about the situation.  The Minister must appreciate that it is not good for education to have this type of power struggle going on. There are a few hundred children in this school who must be influenced in the long term.  The wranglings of politicians in this regard must be getting a bad name for politicians.  I would ask the Minister to try to get this matter resolved.</P>
    <P>I had a complaint made to me by a contractor who called to see me on Monday last in connection with the allocation of contracts for electrical work in regional college extensions in Galway, Waterford, Dundalk and Sligo advertised some time ago.  The complainant who came to me was a businessman in my constituency.  He had tendered for the electrical works in these colleges.  He had been called for interview, as he put it, to the Department about four or five weeks ago and he was shown a list of the tenders that had been submitted.  It would appear that there were 12 tenders in all, that there were tenders from 12 different contractors.  All of them did not cover the four regional colleges but there were 12 tenders covering the whole sheet.  The contractor concerned showed me the list. The sums of money tendered were shown, not the names of contractors. That is understandable.  I was rather amazed to find that any officials of a Department would hand such a list to a contractor.  I thought it was a new development.  I am not basically criticising it.  The impression I got was that this contractor was being asked could he possibly tender at the prices stated.  He had tendered for the electrical <Col N="1037" /> work in those four schools and I think he was brought there to be quizzed as to whether he could possibly do the work at the prices in his tenders.  It is no harm to put it on record here that while he was not the lowest tenderer for Galway he was lowest for works in Waterford, Dundalk and Sligo.</P>
    <P>He told me that he rang the Department on Friday, 21st November, and while he was not told that the contracts had been drawn up he was given to understand that his tenders would not be successful.  His price for Waterford was £58,647 whereas the next lowest tender on this list presented to him in the Department was £73,000 odd.  He was roughly £15,000 under the next lowest tender.  Yet he was given to understand he would not get that contract.  His price for Dundalk was £70,000 odd and the next lowest tender was £77,000 odd.  He was roughly £7,000 lower.  His tender for Sligo was £54,000 odd and the next lowest £59,000 leaving him £4,500 or £5,000 lower.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department will be open to criticism if he does not get those three contracts.  He came to me because he has 54 employees and if he were ruled out of contracts for the Department of Education he would find it necessary to make 30 of these workers redundant.  I fully appreciate that if he gets the jobs somebody else will not get them.  I checked with the Department of Education.  I was anxious to get on to the building section which deals specifically with this matter.  I rang on Monday last and checked with the Minister's office to know if it was permissible to ring the section directly.  I was given to understand, as I already knew, that the Minister does not approve of this; he much prefers one to go through his office.  I did not want to try ringing directly the principal officer concerned with whom I have never been in contact because I felt I would be putting him at a disadvantage in asking him for information and he would probably have to tell me that he would prefer me to go through the Minister's office because I have had this experience before.  It is very difficult to deal <Col N="1038" /> with a problem like this in a threecornered way.  I was told that it was not the Department themselves but some consultants engaged by the Department who may have been in contact with my contractor.  I was told that despite the claim made by him that he had made a telephone call to the Department on 21st November and was told that he would not be successful or had not been successful, there was nobody in the Department who could have told him that and that it must have been the consultants.  I am not challenging anybody in that regard but I was going on the statement made by the contractor to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are other Deputies and I certainly am not making a decision like this at the last minute. If part of the reply is that the consultants or anybody are worried about my contractor I want them to understand that this man has already done electrical work for the Department on schools in Falcarragh, Carndonagh, Ardee, Athlone, Tullamore and Millstreet within the last couple of years. I questioned him as to whether his work was inferior or did not measure up to the standard required and he says he did not get any complaint of that nature.  If that is so I will not accept that this man can be refused those three contracts.</P>
      <P>This is what worries me.  When this man came to me he told me he had already been to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government making his complaint personally and asking him if he could try to resolve the matter for him.  He had a reply in writing from the Parliamentary Secretary on the following day to say that he would whisper in the ear of the Minister.  This is what worries me in relation to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate prior to Question Time I found some very interesting points made by the previous speaker, Deputy Tunney.  I will be brief in the limited contribution that can be made under the subheadings of this estimate.  This Estimate for £26 million represents an increase of 13.5 per cent as distinct from a Supplementary Estimate last year which represents an increase of approximately 26 per cent, indicating the increased budgeting of the Department of Education in this current year.  I also note the sum of £19.6 million for increased provision for salaries.  In regard to that I should like to comment that not only must officials be paid their just increases awarded over the year but I think the accommodation which the Department have is possibly outdated at this stage and does not lend itself to the optimum efficiency one would hope to obtain from this Department. I should like to see improved office accommodation for the staff of the Department of Education so that their efficiency could be increased and the administration of the educational system improved accordingly.</P>
      <P>In relation to vocational education committees, I should like to say that I find their criticism at times of the Department of Education and the Minister at the head of the Department of Education to be totally unjustified; that certain members of the Dublin Vocational Education Committee, public representatives, are not acting in a responsible manner or in accordance with the mandate given to them by the electorate.  It is a pity that the Minister does not have more authority over the VEC.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just referring to the way in which the increase in the amount of moneys for salaries of officers of the Department of Education can be nullified and efficiency can be diluted by irresponsible representatives on a vocational education committee. The time of committees and departments can be spent discussing such things as the availability of free contraceptives in Bolton Street Technical School by people who have a very strange vested interest in the educational facilities in that vocational school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to Vote 29&mdash; Primary Education&mdash;and the additional amount required under subhead C.1.  It has come to my notice and I am certain the Minister is concerned very deeply that there is a problem regarding the ability of the less well-off section of the community to provide school books for their children attending primary school.  I notice in the details given by the Minister in regard to the Votes that a large amount of money is being spent on the decoration of primary schools. Schools must be decorated from time to time.  Unfortunately, a myth exists in regard to the availability of free school books.  There is a gap between what parents think is available and what is actually available.  In this connection it would be no harm if the Minister were to delegate authority to some of his officers at the beginning of the school year in September or during the summer holidays to embark upon a publicity campaign that would make it known that all school books are not free for all students attending primary school as that is the situation existing at the present time.  Unfortunately, a myth has developed over the past number of years that a medical card holder is entitled to free school books.  Because of this medical card holders do not allow for the fact that they will have to pay for school books and do not realise that the allocation of free school books rests primarily with the school manager.  It would be a great help if there was a standardisation of eligibility for free school books.  This <Col N="1041" /> year undue hardship was experienced in some schools because of lack of information on the part of parents.  It rested largely with teachers and public representatives to explain the position. I should like to see the Minister setting up a system in relation to national school books whereby his Department would have control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude by paying a tribute to those engaged in education, <Col N="1042" /> those in receipt of these salaries by saying how grateful we are for their dedication, to the religious orders and particularly to the remedial teachers, and to say to the Minister how disappointed I am that there is not a special section in this Estimate for dealing with further grants for slightly handicapped people.  I should like to see them included fully in the national school system instead of in special schools to which a certain amount of stigma attaches, and to say how appreciative we are that the grant has been increased from £25 to £50 in lieu of tuition fees, for senior pupils from £24 to £36, and for junior pupils from £19 to £28.</P>
      <P>I shall not delay the House much longer, but it is important that we voice our opinion regarding the quality of national schools being built at present and to ask the Minister whether he considers the 18 community schools to which he has referred to be satisfactory and an improvement, because there is some grave doubt as to whether they are or not.  The comprehensive schools are certainly doing quite well. One would like to see greater planning where new housing estates are going up in the suburbs, particularly the south Finglas area where the Minister announced that he will be going ahead with a 16-room new national school. I should like the Minister to give consideration to the new national school at the cattle market site when that site comes for development for local authority housing.</P>
      <P>The free school transport is to be commended and it has been expanding. It is necessary, but whether the closing of the smaller schools was a good idea or not is another thing.  The Minister is also to be commended on setting up the governing bodies for the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to thank the House for the positive manner in which the Deputies on both sides approached this Supplementary Estimate.  Unfortunately, in the few minutes left I shall not be able to answer the points made by the various Deputies, but I shall try to communicate my answers to them informally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> I must, however, in the brief time allotted to me take up the question raised by Deputy Lalor about a subcontractor in his constituency. Tenders of subcontractors must, in accordance with normal practice and procedure, be opened publicly.  This was done for electrical subcontractors on 9th October last.  The next step is for the architect to check out the lowest tender, and if he is satisfied as to his prices, reliability and so on, to recommend acceptance of the lowest tender.  Should the architect not be satisfied for one good reason or another&mdash;the inability to fulfill the contract satisfactorily, unreliability based on previous experience, failure to meet deadlines&mdash;then the architect will recommend that the lowest tender be not accepted and will proceed to examine the second lowest tender. This is the normal tendering procedure and is in process of being carried out at present.  No definite recommendation about the acceptance of the lowest or of any tender has yet been received from the architect.  The matter is, therefore, <i>sub judice</i>, at the moment.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the following. In any case where the lowest tender is not being accepted, the Department must submit the case to the Government Contracts Committee for formal approval.  That is a safeguard with which I am in full accord.</P>
    <P>If I might briefly refer to the point raised by Deputy Callanan before I go on to any other matters, I indicated to the Deputy that I wished to have the opportunity of stressing that the introduction of the new scheme of capitation grants for primary schools would not affect the fundamental position whereby the local parish community had a basic responsibility for the cost of maintenance and upkeep of national schools.  The change which has been brought about by the introduction of the capitation grant system is that the new method of financing, as well as being much more flexible, makes a substantially greater subvention from the State for the upkeep of the schools.  Previously, the grants from the State comprised heating <Col N="1044" /> and cleaning grants, equipment grants, as well as painting grants.  The local community had the responsibility to provide the balance of the cost for the running of the school. That responsibility of the local community has not changed A guarantee is given, however, that where the community contributes the equivalent of at least £1.50 per pupil, the Department will contribute the equivalent of £6 per pupil.</P>
    <P>So as to avoid any further misunderstanding, may I again repeat that the system of local responsibility for the upkeep of national schools has not been changed by the introduction of the new scheme, that the local parish community has not been relieved of their responsibility in that regard, that any attempt to place responsibility for the local contribution for maintenance on the boards of management specifically is not in accord with proper procedures.  I reiterate that the authorities who were heretofore responsible for the local contribution are still responsible.  I would ask anybody who knows of any departure from previous practice in this regard to let my Department know immediately.  Of course, it would be entirely reprehensible if anybody would attempt to levy £1.50 per pupil on the parents of children attending school, and again I say it would be unconstitutional if this were attempted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made reference to the item &ldquo;Savings on other subheads&rdquo; appearing on the different Votes.  It would not be feasible for me to go into details, but I may say that, in general, it is a technical device to enable adjustments&mdash;particularly in relation to the capital provision&mdash;to be made as between the different Votes to match actual expenditure with the original Estimates.  The Deputy will appreciate that in relation to a school building programme there may be appreciable variations in the rate of progress as between different projects in hand at the same time, particularly so in this year when the summer weather was such that a lot of work which normally would have taken longer, in fact, was completed very quickly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> I noted the observations of Deputy Wilson concerning the provision in D.4, Audio-Visual Teaching Aids.  A marginal excess may, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, be accepted on an open subhead where a grant-in-aid is not involved, subject to the amount being met from savings on other subheads of the Vote. The question of appropriate action in relation to particular items of expenditure under subhead D.4 in 1975 will be further considered in accordance with this general arrangement when the Vote has been augmented by the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made reference to the NCEA.  On 19th February, 1972, the Government authorised the Minister for Education to arrange for the setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i> NCEA to operate for a period of three years or until such earlier date as the council could be statutorily established.  It was inappropriate to establish the council on a statutory basis while decisions on the reorganisation of higher education were pending.  On 14th February, 1975, the Government extended the period of operation of the <i>ad hoc</i> council with its then chairman and members, pending reconstitution.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> council is, therefore, operating pending its reconstitution with ten from NIHE, Limerick, ten from NIHE, Dublin, and ten to be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister for Education plus a chairman to be nominated by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The <i>ad hoc</i> council had been carrying on its work and has been holding conferrings in various institutions throughout the country, for example, in what was formerly known as the NCPE, Limerick, now known as Thomond, in the RTC, Sligo and so on.</P>
    <P>I should have liked to reply to the other points made by the Deputies. I thank them for their approach to this Estimate.  I am glad they see my point that I want to get it this evening, and I offer them the possibility of a £10 token Estimate debate if it can be arranged between the Whips at a later point.</P>

I intended to do this because of the deficiencies that I pointed out and that were not covered in the Supplementary Estimate, and because of the savage mistake in the accounting for the Estimates.

She made an application for a deserted wife's allowance on 6th October, 1975, and her case is at present being investigated.  Every effort is being made to finalise the inquiries which are necessary to determine her eligibility for the allowance and it is hoped that a decision in the matter can be reached at an early date.</P>

The council also have proposals for widening of the adjoining public road which would seem to involve the demolition of the wall in question.  A compulsory purchase order relevant to the road widening has been submitted to me for confirmation and I expect to give a decision shortly.</P>
