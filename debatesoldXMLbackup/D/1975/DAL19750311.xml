      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the measures he proposes to take regarding the future of brain-damaged children resulting from triple-antigen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any evidence to show that there are children in this country who have been brain damaged as a result of immunisation with triple antigen.</P>
      <P>I have seen the report referred to by Deputy Enright.  I am aware that there have been suggestions that adverse reactions to vaccinations against pertussis may arise.  The medical officers of my Department have discussed the matter on different occasions during the past 12 months with chief medical officers who are responsible for vaccination in their own areas.  No serious adverse effects have been reported.  I am also advised that the National Drugs Advisory Board which is responsible for receiving reports of adverse reactions to drugs have also had no such reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I pointed out in reply to a parliamentary question on this matter on 14th May, 1974, pertussis can be a serious and sometimes fatal disease. Vaccination against it was recommended by my Department in 1955. <Col N="128" /> In the six years preceding that&mdash;that is, from 1950 to 1955&mdash;the average number of deaths from pertussis was 64 per year.  After the introduction of vaccination there was a marked decrease and during the last decade&mdash; from 1964 to 1974&mdash;the average number of deaths had fallen to 2.8 per year.</P>
    <P>Following adverse publicity since last year concerning adverse reactions to pertussis vaccination there is reason to believe that a drop in vaccination levels may have occurred.  Concurrently with this there has been an increase in the number of cases of whooping cough notified and two deaths from the disease were recorded in the first three quarters of 1974.</P>
    <P>All vaccines can cause reactions and there is some evidence to suggest that in rare cases these reactions may be serious.  It is very difficult however to discern between chance-associated reactions and vaccine-attributable reactions in infants.  In all the circumstances I am advised that vaccination against pertussis is still a procedure which should continue to be recommended, subject of course to the exercise in individual cases of his own clinical judgment by the immunising medical officer.  The combination of vaccines to be used in individual cases is also a matter for the immunising doctor.  Vaccinations are, of course, not compulsory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to ask his Department to undertake a survey into the incidence of brain damage resulting from this triple antigen?  Would he also take into account the information available from Britain in regard to this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>All the information in my Department is to the effect that such vaccination has not been responsible for brain damage.  I am also informed that, as a result of a special committee which met in Britain, the conclusion arrived at was that this triple vaccination should still continue. There are reports also in the other European countries&mdash;in fact throughout the developed world&mdash;that this vaccination has not been proved to have effect on the brain.  I should <Col N="129" /> tell the Deputy that consultations between my Department and the county MOH's have been going on during last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of health board doctors have advised against such injections? They have recommended that two of the injections be given and that the one for whooping cough be given on a separate date.  If there is any possibility of a weakness in the child, such as a cold, and he has the three injections together, is it true that this aggravates the matter and could lead to such damage as appeared in this article?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that some medical officers or GPs have recommended that the vaccination for whooping cough be not included.  I presume these doctors have taken into account possible ailments in the child or a possible adverse medical history in respect of the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister received any complaints on this matter from the public or from people who claim their children have been damaged?  Would he ask his Department to conduct an investigation into the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one particular case&mdash;I do not want to mention names &mdash;at present in a hospital in Dublin for examination and assessment.  I think I should await a report on the matter before commenting further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware if there are further cases throughout the country?  Would his Department communicate with the health boards and ask them to have investigations carried out with regard to mental retardation in some children who have received the three injections?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained already, the Department have been constantly in touch with county medical officers and with general practitioners. No report of brain damage has been received in my Department, neither has such a report been received from the National Drugs Advisory Board.  There has been no <Col N="130" /> report to the effect that after immunisation there has been brain damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in at least some of the public health clinics parents are being advised of the risk of brain damage if this vaccination is given?  This is happening in the case of infants with no background of risk of the kind the Minister envisaged and, as a consequence, most parents who receive this advice refuse to have the injection administered to their children.  This probably accounts for the drop in the number of injections referred to by the Minister.  This being so, will the Minister accept that there appears to be a conflict between the advice given to parents in the clinics and what he is now saying as a result of the advice available to him?  It is desirable that this matter be clarified as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it should be clarified as soon as possible but I do not know what &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; means in this case.  Investigations have been carried out not only in this country but in Britain also and by the World Health Organisation and it still has to be proved there is an association between this vaccination and brain damage.  As I said in my reply, the incidence of death from whooping cough has gone down dramatically and it is believed in medical circles it is due to this vaccination.  It would be a pity if there were such a scare that those who need the vaccination would not avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will understand that when parents are warned by properly qualified people in the clinics that there is a risk of brain damage to their children they will not take that risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and I presume the medical profession would act like that.  The children are usually introduced by the public health nurse and, in view of the scare in recent times, I presume there would be a detailed examination of the history of the child and the family.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Welfare officers have been appointed in some Government Departments and are available to help staff with personal problems such as alcoholism.  In the private sector, the Irish National Council on Alcoholism are actively engaged in encouraging firms to adopt formal policies regarding alcoholism among employees and to date they have had some limited success.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Employer/ Labour Conference have set up a working party to examine the whole problem of alcoholism as it relates to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that there still appears to be an old-fashioned idea in relation to the problem of alcohol, that it is not recognised as a disease?  As a result of this many people find themselves out of employment because they do not get help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to make a generalisation but my idea is that the alcoholic would be helped in every way so that he might be rehabilitated, not only in society but in his job also.</P>

      <P>The Minister has stated that welfare officers have been appointed to Government Departments. Do such officers operate outside the confines of Dublin city? Will the Minister not agree that the approach in some Departments to this problem is most inhuman and archaic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only speak for my own Department.  That has not <Col N="132" /> been my experience there.  The welfare officers to whom I referred in my reply are confined to particular Departments, and perhaps one is associated with two Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>The Social Welfare Bill, 1975, which is now before Dáil Éireann includes a provision under which an urban local authority may extend the school meals scheme to any national school situated outside their functional area where not less than half of the children attending such school reside either in the authority's functional area or outside that area but in dwellings owned or provided by such authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the Oireachtas caters for the situation mentioned by the Deputy.  For instance, in Ballymun quite a number of people occupy dwellings provided by the city council but the school which the children attend is physically located outside the functional area of that council.  There is provision in the Bill to make allowance for that and <Col N="134" /> allow the corporation to extend these provisions to that type of situation.</P>

      <P>My information is that these reports were exaggerated. Defence Forces go out in aid of the civil power when asked for by the gardaí, usually by the chief superintendent in the area.  We have provided more than 6,000 military parties in the year ended 30th September last and we set up 16,000 joint Garda/Army checkpoints.  We sent out more than 3,000 patrols in the same year on the road network along the Border.  That was all in aid of the civil power.  When they ask for help we give it to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in the light <Col N="135" /> of his reply to questions of 7th February, 1974, he considers that persons who purchased their houses under the pre-1973 scheme or post-1973 scheme are entitled to dispose of them in the same way as any house owner or whether, in view of the fact that some people have sold these houses at a profit, particularly under the 1973 scheme, they should forfeit part of that profit to the local authority or the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation tenants who purchased their houses under pre-1973 schemes and paid the current market value of their dwellings are subject only to the conditions set out in their lease and are, therefore in the same position as any person who owns a leasehold interest in property.</P>
      <P>In the case of tenants who are purchasing their dwellings over a period of years, a condition in the lease requires the consent of the housing authority to be obtained to the resale of the house.  This condition applies to both the pre-1973 and post-1973 sales schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the sales scheme which I introduced in July, 1973, which gave tenants of local authority houses an opportunity to purchase their dwellings on terms based on the actual all-in-cost of the house converted to current monetary values, I decided, having consulted with interested parties, including the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, that as the houses were being offered to the tenants at prices well below the current market value, speculative selling and buying of the houses should be discouraged.  To this end, the Housing Authorities (Borrowing and Management) Regulations, 1974, stipulate that as a condition of the granting of consent to the resale of houses purchased by tenants, whether outright or over a period of years, under the 1973 scheme, a local authority should require payment to them of one-third of any profit made on the resale if <Col N="136" /> such resale takes place within five years from the date of purchase.  The regulations became law on 18th September, 1974.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of these people who sell their houses at a profit do so in order to purchase small dwelling type houses and that the houses so vacated are probably easing the demand for houses on the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  I am aware that in some isolated incidents people who sell their houses in those circumstances do repurchase houses.  The number of people who are involved in this is so small that they do not represent a very big problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister obviously has statistical information which I do not possess.  The people who come to me and are anxious to purchase their houses would not purchase them unless they had a snob idea that to move out of a local authority housing area would be advantageous to themselves, their children and their employment opportunities.  They purchase those houses at a price with a view to moving to a new locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned a &ldquo;snob idea&rdquo; but I am not interested in helping people who want, for snob reasons, to move out of want is regarded as a working-class area.  I am interested in making it possible for the tenants of those houses to purchase them at a reasonable cost and, having done that, I agree with the suggestion made by organisations, including the tenants organisation, that it would be unreasonable to allow them within a period of five years to make a big profit.  I agree it would be unreasonable to allow them to buy and sell and get out to what they would consider to be a better class area or to leave the area altogether. In my view the idea was a good one; it was not originally mine but I thought it was a good idea particularly when it was put to me by NATO and by the former Dublin Commissioners.</P>

      <P>(1) Yes, but the matter is kept under review; (2) No; (3) This information is not available in the form requested by the Deputy.  The present rate of failure at all tests is 51 per cent, and it is estimated on the basis of past experience that the failure rate is similar, both for persons undergoing their first test, and for all others, that is, those undergoing a second or later test; (4) The latest general directive on standards was issued in August, 1973.</P>

      <P>The Minister replied &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question whether he considered the standards were being too rigidly adhered to.  Was this not allegedly one of the reasons why a tester was let off in November last? Was it not because of a too rigid application of the testing rules, because, as he put it, he was not willing to conform to a departmental directive to the effect that less than 50 per cent should be failed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, at some future time.  It was done some time ago and one could spend a lot of time bringing out statistics which would not prove very much.  Separate records are not kept for first and subsequent tests but a spot check covering a random selection of cases was made in April, 1973.  The check revealed that the pass rate for a first attempt was 50 per cent and that overall for persons doing the second or third or subsequent tests it was slightly over 50 per cent.  There is no statistical reason why that should be so but that appears to have been the evidence.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 13th February, consideration is being given to the measures that may be necessary to give effect to the EEC directive on waste oil disposal.  It would not be appropriate for me to advertise publicly the names of companies prepared to collect waste oil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this on previous occasions and inquiries I have made since indicate to me that there are such companies but that people who have waste oil to dispose of here in Dublin, and who dispose of it in some of the tributaries of the Liffey, do not know where to get in touch with the disposal companies.</P>

      <P>The public Press is always glad to get advertisements. Deputy Lemass asked questions on 28th June, 1973, 9th July, 1973 and 14th May, 1974.  The position is that so far as I am aware there are two companies in Dublin and one of them has written to us asking us to notify local authorities that they collect waste oil.  They could easily notify the local authorities themselves.  I do not think it should be the job of the Department to tell any local authority that a certain company will do a job for them.  That is a matter for the people concerned.</P>

      <P>Fish prices are not guaranteed by the EEC.  Withdrawal prices are fixed each year for a number of varieties of white fish, namely, cod, haddock, plaice, saithe and whiting, normally landed by Irish fishermen.  When prices fall to the withdrawal level fish may be taken off the market and compensation obtained from the EEC.  The withdrawal of fish from market must be undertaken, however, by a Producers' Organisation set up in accordance with EEC regulations.  Such an Organisation has not yet been established here but I understand that arrangements for the formation of one on a national basis are now at an advanced stage.</P>

    <P>I have been given responsibility for co-ordinating Government action on the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  This report made recommendations on the steps necessary to ensure the participation of women on equal terms with men in the political, social, cultural and economic life of the country.  Primary responsibility for processing these recommendations rests with different Ministers according to the subject matter of the particular recommendation. I hope to expedite overall action <Col N="152" /> by co-ordinating the work of all Departments in this area.</P>
    <P>In December, 1974, I established the Women's Representative Committee under the chairmanship of Eileen Desmond, TD.  One of the tasks of this committee is to report to me on the progress towards the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Commission on the Status of Women and make submissions on the legislative and administrative reforms necessary to ensure that women participate in all spheres of life on equal terms with men.</P>
    <P>I intend in my co-ordinating role to ensure that appropriate recommendations from this committee are implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The penalties provided for defaulting employers under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, are as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  Where an employer fails to implement a determination of the Labour Court relating to an equal pay dispute, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £10 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>

    <P>(b)  Where an employer dismisses a woman from her employment solely or mainly because she made a claim for equal pay, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 or on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding £1,000. In cases of dismissal a woman has the <Col N="153" /> option of going to the Labour Court. Where an employer fails to carry out a direction of the Labour Court to pay compensation to the woman who has been dismissed he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding £10 for every day during which the offence is continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is concerned with the extensions and improvements of the social insurance and social assistance schemes which were provided for in the budget.  The Bill also provides for increases, consequential on the budget increases, in occupational injuries benefits and improvements of the scheme of voluntary insurance and the school meals scheme operated by urban local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will understand, Bills such as this contain a number of provisions which are amendments to existing legislation and are necessarily technical.  The explanatory memorandum which has been circulated with the Bill is aimed at clarifying <Col N="162" /> these provisions and I hope that Deputies will have been helped by it in their examination of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The provisions contained in this Bill represent a further advance in the Government's social programme. They fulfil the undertakings given to the people in the White Paper <i>A National Partnership</i> which stated that &ldquo;the Government believe that those who are dependent on social welfare payments should be cushioned against price rises and should also be assured of at least an adequate maintenance of their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other sections of the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The increases announced in the budget and provided for in this Bill do not just keep pace with inflation. They represent a real increase and they are in line with the Government's policy of improving the position of all social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>With the implementation in April of the various improvements covered by the Bill, the rates of social welfare payments will have been raised by this Government since 1973 by figures which range from 66 per cent in the case of some personal rates of benefit, to 80-90 per cent for single-parent families and to 96-140 per cent for child dependent allowances.  Children's allowances&mdash;which it is proposed to raise again for the third successive year&mdash;will have gone up since 1973 by 360 per cent for the first child, by 140 per cent for the second child and by 93 per cent for the third and subsequent children.  In the same period, the cost of living has risen by between 35 and 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Total Exchequer expenditure on Social Welfare, that is on the services administered by the Department of Social Welfare, in 1975 is now estimated at approximately £210 million, compared with £92 million in 1972-73.  This increase of over 125 per cent, which far outstrips inflation, is an accurate reflection of the expansion and improvement of our Social Welfare services which are regarded as central to the social reform programme of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The budget proposals for social welfare involved a substantial increase in the rates of non-contributory old age and blind pensions, a further easing of the means test and a further reduction in the qualifying age for pension from 68 to 67 years.  The maximum weekly personal rate of non-contributory pension is being raised from £7.30 to £8.85 for persons under 80 years of age and from £7.85 to £9.55 for persons aged 80 and over. The maximum weekly payment for dependent spouses who are not themselves entitled to pension is being raised from £3.65 to £4.40 so that the overall weekly payment for a non-contributory pensioner with a dependent spouse will, at maximum rates, be increased from £10.95 to £13.25 or, if the pensioner is aged 80 or over, from £11.50 to £13.95.  In addition, increases of pension for qualified children of pensioners are being raised by 40p a week to £2.35 for each of the first two children and by 30p a week to £1.80 for each further child while the payment for a prescribed relative looking after an incapacitated pensioner is being increased from £4.15 to £4.95.</P>
    <P>The further easing of the means test, by disregarding the first £6 of assessed weekly means instead of the first £5 as at present, will again improve the position of existing pensioners who have less than the maximum pension.  The increase in the amount of means which can be disregarded for pension purposes will apply only in the case of means in the form of current income.  Generally, it will not apply where the means take the form of ownership of capital as the existing provisions in regard to the assessment of such means are sufficiently liberal.</P>
    <P>In addition, the reduction in the qualifying age from 68 to 67 will bring some 10,500 new pensioners into the scheme.  The total number of pensions affected by the improvements in the non-contributory old age and blind pensions schemes will be 156,000 made up of 124,000 existing pensioners, 11,500 new pensioners, 15,500 adult dependants and 5,000 children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="164" /> Non-contributory widows' and orphans' pensions are being similarly improved.  The maximum weekly personal rate of pension will be increased by £1.55 to £8.85 and the first £6 of weekly means will likewise be ignored. The weekly amounts payable in respect of qualified children are being increased by 55p to £2.95.  Together with the existing amounts of a widow's earnings which may be disregarded in assessing her means, the ignoring of the first £6 of weekly income will allow a widow greater scope for supplementing her income by earnings. Thus a widow with no other means who has two children could earn up to £9 a week and still draw the new maximum pension of £14.75 for herself and her two children. The increased weekly rates and the easing of the means test will apply also to the allowances for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>An estimated 12,500 widows will benefit from the improvements in the scheme, of whom about 200 will be new pensioners.  Additionally, some 2,600 deserted wives with 3,100 children, 2,200 unmarried mothers with 2,300 children and 100 prisoners' wives with 300 children will also benefit from the improvements.  The weekly rates of non-contributory orphan's pension are being increased by £1 bringing the maximum rate to £5.75.</P>
    <P>I turn now to unemployment assistance. The maximum weekly rates of payment are being increased by £1.35 to £7.70 for persons in urban areas and by £1.30 to £7.35 for persons resident elsewhere.  The rate for an adult dependant is being increased by 95p bringing the maximum rate for a married couple to £13.25 in an urban area and to £12.80 elsewhere.  The rates for children will go up to £2.35 for each of the first two and to £1.80 for the third and each subsequent child.  It is estimated that the average number of persons who will benefit from these increases will be 62,000 including about 24,000 smallholders together with some 37,000 adult dependants and 102,000 dependent children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> There are increases also in the general children's allowances scheme. The monthly rates of the allowances are being increased by 30p for the second and each subsequent child.  The rate for the first child will remain at £2.30 but the rate for the second child will become £3.60 and will be £4.35 for the third and each further child. The number of families who will benefit from the increase in rates is about 275,000 involving about 720,000 children.</P>
    <P>Last year we introduced a scheme of allowances for single women who had attained the age of 58 years.  The means test applied in this scheme is broadly on the same lines as for unemployment assistance and the maximum rate of allowance is the same as the urban rate of that assistance.  The weekly rates are being increased by £1.35 to a maximum £7.70 and will, accordingly, remain in line with unemployment assistance for persons in urban areas.</P>
    <P>The reduction in pensionable age affects not only the qualifying age for old age pensions but also the maximum age up to which short-term benefits such as disability and unemployment benefit can be paid.  Liability for the payment of social insurance contributions will, of course, also cease at 67 years instead of 68 as at present. A number of &ldquo;saver&rdquo; clauses have been included in section 10 to protect the position of existing pensioners and persons approaching the age of 68 years.  These saver clauses are similar to those enacted in last year's Social Welfare Act which also reduced pensionable age.  I may mention here that in consequence of the reduction in pension age to 67 all persons of that age, whether pensioners or not, will now become entitled to benefit from the free travel arrangements.  The free electricity and free television licence concessions will also be available to qualified pensioners over 67 years.</P>
    <P>I come now to increases in the rates of pensions and short-term benefits under the social insurance system.  In the case of retirement pension and old age, contributory, pension the personal rates go up by £2 a week to £10.50 where the pensioner is under <Col N="166" /> the age of 80 and to £11.10 where the pensioner is aged 80 or over.  The allowances for adult dependants are being increased by £1.15 for those under 67 years and by £1.40 for those who are 67 years or over.  The payment for a prescribed relative looking after an incapacitated pensioner is being increased from £4.15 to £4.95 as in the case of non-contributory old age pensioners.  The personal rates of widow's, contributory, pension and deserted wife's benefit are being increased by £1.70 to £9.50 a week.  In the case of a recipient of widow's, contributory, pension who is aged 80 or over, the increase will be £1.80 a week.  The new weekly rates of flat-rate unemployment and disability benefit will be increased by £1.65 to £9.40 for a single person and the allowance for an adult dependant will be increased by £1.05 to £6.10 a week. Maternity allowance is also being increased by £1.65 to £9.40 a week.</P>
    <P>The allowances paid with pensions and other benefits in respect of qualified children are also being increased. In the case of widow's, contributory, pension and deserted wife's benefit the increase is 60p for each child and in the case of the remaining pensions and benefits the increase is 45p for each of the first two children and 40p for each other child.</P>
    <P>In addition to these flat-rate benefit payments, pay-related benefit is payable also as a supplement to unemployment and disability benefit, maternity allowance, and in certain circumstances, with occupational injury benefit.</P>
    <P>Some examples of the effect of the increases may be of interest to Deputies. In the case of retirement pension and old age, contributory, pension a married pensioner whose spouse is aged 67 or over will, at the maximum rate, receive a weekly pension of £18.40 as against the present £15, or £19 as against £15.60 if the pensioner is aged 80 or over.  A widow with two qualified children will get £15.80 a week compared with £12.90 at present, and one with four qualified children will get £22.10 as against £18.  In the case of unemployment benefit and disability benefit a married man with two <Col N="167" /> qualified children will receive £20.80 a week as compared with £17.20.  A man with four qualified children will receive £25.20 a week as against £20.80 at present.</P>
    <P>In line with the improvements in the general social insurance system, the Bill also provides for increases in the rates of various benefits payable under the occupational injuries scheme.  The increase in weekly rates will be broadly in line with those provided in the general social insurance benefits.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of the increase in the rates of social insurance contributions which cover all benefits of the social insurance system.  This year, the total increase in the contribution will comprise two elements of which the first will be in respect of increases in benefits and pensions and the general improvements to be made in social insurance schemes.  The second element of the increase has its origin in the current unemployment position. Deputies will recall that in the course of his budget statement the Minister for Finance indicated that in view of the likely trends in employment in 1975 the Government had decided that it would be prudent to make available an extra £15 million against additional unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims above the level provided for in the published Estimate for Social Welfare.  The Exchequer, the Minister stated, will provide £7.1 million of this sum and the balance will be raised by way of a special increase in the social insurance contributions. I would like to emphasise that this special increase will be strictly a temporary one to meet the current abnormal unemployment position.</P>
    <P>The increase in contributions which will be necessary in respect of the first element will be 93p to be shared as to 63p by employers and 30p by employees. The amount of the special increase to which I have referred will be 31p, to be shared as to 21p by employers and 10p by employees.  Thus the total increase will be £1.24 of which 84p will be borne by employers and 40p by employees.  Increases of less than £1.24 will be applied to those <Col N="168" /> rates of social insurance contributions which do not cover all the benefits of the system.  A small increase of one penny in the contributions payable to the occupational injuries fund by the employers only will also be necessary towards meeting the cost of the improvements in payments under this scheme.  Accordingly the new rates of contribution in respect of this scheme will be 12p for a male employee and 9p for a female.</P>
    <P>The ordinary rates of contribution covering the social insurance services administered by my Department, including the increase of £1.24 and the new occupational injuries contribution, will thus be increased to £4.23 for men of which the employer will pay £2.59 and the employee £1.64. For women the new ordinary rate will be £4.12 of which the employer will pay £2.54 and the employee £1.58.</P>
    <P>I would like at this point to comment briefly on the question of financing the social welfare and health services, and of the social welfare services in particular.  The gross cost in the present financial year of the social welfare and health services will be in excess of £380 million.  Where public expenditure is at such high levels it is obviously necessary to give careful consideration to all the implications.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we seek to obtain the best return, in terms of genuine social service, for such high and increasing totals of expenditure. We must look initially at the effects of what we are doing in order to ensure that adequate funds are directed to the relief and eradication of particular hard-core problems.  I welcome the recent publication of research findings which focus our attention on this matter and which, I might add, was brought to the notice of the House when I presented the Estimate for my Department last year.</P>
    <P>In this country the major share of the cost of the social welfare and health services is borne by the Exchequer. Such a situation might be thought to imply a major element of vertical redistribution of income. <Col N="169" /> However, it must be borne in mind that a very high proportion of the general taxation raised in this country comes from various forms of indirect taxation.  Indirect taxation&mdash;and flat-rate social security contributions&mdash; tend to be regressive.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Government that the present system of financing these services should be restructured over a period of years to ensure a more equitable approach, to bring our systems more into line with the situation in the European Community and to concentrate Exchequer outlays more directly on areas of real need.  Accordingly, the Minister for Social Welfare has arranged to have this whole area examined with a view to appropriate proposals being formulated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The fact that a Green Paper concerning a national income-related pension scheme and the question of providing social security pension coverage for the self-employed is to be published during the year will of course have a direct bearing on this matter.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in the Bill to rectify a situation which arose following the abolition of the remuneration limit for compulsory insurance of non-manual employees. In this connection I should like to explain that there are two classes of voluntary contributors under the Social Welfare Acts: the first group comprises persons who pay higher rate contributions which provide cover for retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, widow's (contributory) pension, deserted wife's benefit and death grants, and the second group are persons who pay lower rate contributions which provide cover for widow's (contributory) pension and deserted wife's benefit only.</P>
    <P>The first group&mdash;that is, persons paying the higher rate contributions&mdash; are persons who, when they ceased to be compulsorily insurable, were in employment which was insurable for benefits which included retirement and old age (contributory) pension. The second group of persons paying the lower rate contributions are persons <Col N="170" /> who were formerly compulsorily insurable for widow's and orphan's pension, deserted wife's benefit and occupational injuries benefit and for no other benefit or pension under the Acts.  These are persons employed in the public sector and include civil servants, officers of local and public authorities, teachers, army officers and others.</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation a voluntary contributor who becomes an employed contributor ceases to be a voluntary contributor.  When the remuneration limit for compulsory insurability of non-manual workers was abolished with effect from 1st April, 1974, persons in the public sector who had until then been higher rate voluntary contributors again became compulsorily insurable as employed contributors for widow's and orphan's pension, deserted wife's benefit and occupational injuries benefit and for no other benefit or pension under the Acts.  They were accordingly precluded under existing legislation from continuing to pay contributions as voluntary contributors for retirement pension and old age (contributory) pension and death grant. Provision is made in the Bill to enable persons in the category mentioned to continue as voluntary contributors so that they may continue their insurance cover for the benefits referred to.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget statement announced that the weekly rates of the various pension, benefit and assistance payments would be further increased with effect from the beginning of October next following a review in the light of the rise in the cost of living.  As the House may not be in session in the months immediately preceding October next it is proposed to effect this increase by regulations and the Bill accordingly provides that the Minister for Social Welfare, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may, by regulations, increase the weekly rates of benefit and so on.  Provision is included in the relevant section of the Bill to ensure that the regulations will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after they are made and, if a resolution <Col N="171" /> annulling the regulations is passed by either House within the next 21 days on which that House has sat after the regulations have been laid before it, the regulations will be annulled.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Finance said in his budget statement, the October review will be designed to maintain the real value of the level of payments established in April.  The erosion of the purchasing power of welfare payments in a period of rapid inflation is a cause of concern and the Government are determined to protect social welfare recipients against this result of the present economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>This innovation is a fulfilment of the commitment given in the White Paper <i>A National Partnership</i> and it will be implemented under the terms of this Bill by means of a review of and further increase in rates of weekly payments, taking into consideration the movement in the cost of living and other relevant factors. I propose also to make an improvement in the school meals scheme operated by urban local authorities. Under existing legislation such authorities are empowered to provide school meals for children attending national schools in their functional areas.  With the growth of local authority housing on the fringe of their areas large numbers of children who are living in an urban authority's area or in dwellings outside the area which are owned or have been provided by the local authority in question are attending national schools which have been built just outside the functional area of the urban authority.  Consequently these children cannot be provided with school meals as the scheme stands at present.</P>
    <P>To resolve this situation I propose to amend the School Meals Acts for the purpose of providing that, where not less than half of the children attending a national school outside the functional area of an urban local authority reside either in that area or outside that area in dwellings owned or provided by the urban authority, that authority may determine that school meals may be provided in the <Col N="172" /> national school in question.  In this connection the instance that will immediately come to Deputies' minds is the housing area of Ballymun.  In this district the corporation have built over 2,000 houses in the county area and there are some 4,500 children attending national schools which are just outside the city boundary.</P>
    <P>In the past two years the budget improvements in the social welfare scheme were brought into operation from the beginning of July.  Previously increases in the rates of social assistance operated from August and in the rates of social insurance benefits from October.  This year, because of the change in the financial year which now coincides with the calendar year, all the improvements proposed in the Bill will come into effect much earlier, that is, the beginning of April next. Further increases in weekly payments are, as I have mentioned earlier, also to be made from October next.</P>
    <P>Thus, rates will have been increased only nine months after the previous rise and will be further raised after six months.  An example may serve to underline the impact of this change.  In June, 1974, the old age contributory pension for a person aged 69 years was £7.20.  In April, 1975&mdash;just ten months later&mdash;a person at the age of 67 years will receive a pension of £10.50.  That is an increase in pension rate of 46 per cent in ten months, with a two-year reduction in qualifying age.</P>
    <P>These combined increases will add considerably to the overall expenditure of social welfare.  On the social assistance side, including children's allowances, the increase in cost to the Exchequer will be £22.4 million up to the end of December, 1975.  On the social insurance side the gross increase in expenditure from the social insurance fund is estimated at £26.6 million to the end of December, 1975, of which £23.7 million will be met by increased contribution income, leaving £2.9 million to be borne by the Exchequer in that period.  The total cost to the Exchequer for the period April to <Col N="173" /> December, 1975, will therefore be £25.3 million.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already, the Exchequer will, in addition, provide £7.1 million towards the cost of additional unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims.  The special contribution increase of 31p is intended to provide a further £7.9 million towards the cost of these additional unemployment claims.  The Exchequer will also meet the cost, estimated at £430,000, of the extension of the schemes of free travel, electricity and television licences which, from April next, will result from the further reduction in pension age.</P>
    <P>In bringing before the House a measure such as this, I am more than conscious of the complexities of our social welfare legislation at this point in its development.  The Bill's title of itself indicates the range of legislation governing this area&mdash;with reference being made to Acts including the Old Age Pensions Acts and the Education (Provision of Meals) Acts and covering the period from 1908 to 1974.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 60 basic Acts and at least 350 regulations governing the schemes operated by my Department, not to mention innumerable examples of case or precedent law arising from the application of these.</P>
    <P>I have initiated work in my Department on the codification and simplification of the whole field of social welfare legislation.  This will be a long and complex task and one which should ideally lead to the production of a new consolidated Social Welfare Act.  The work on this badly-needed improvement will be proceeded with with all possible speed.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to sponsor the improvements covered by the Bill, which I recommend to Dáil Éireann for speedy and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that there are approximately 60 basic Acts and at least 350 regulations governing schemes operated by his Department as well as <Col N="174" /> innumerable examples of case or precedent law arising from the application of these Acts and regulations.  I have the greatest sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary in that respect, and it is heartening to hear that he intends conducting a campaign of modification and simplification of the whole field of social security legislation.  Since being given the brief for this party of &ldquo;shadowing&rdquo; the Parliamentary Secretary, this situation has been of great concern to me.  I have tried to ascertain the number of Acts, but I have succeeded in discovering only about 39. This indicates clearly that my research must continue.  It is a revelation to find that there are 60 basic Acts.  Therefore I expect that if I spend another week on this type of research I will discover those I have missed.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he intends adding to the number of regulations and that this will enable him to bring increases in payments to the notice of the House by way of regulation.  This will add to the burden and the complexity of the whole area of social welfare.  The proposed Bill is highly complex.  It is directed at benefiting financially the less well-off sections of the community and on behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the increases in social welfare payments.  Any Government that have come before the House down through the years with social welfare Bills have invariably announced increases in social welfare entitlements.  It is interesting to note that since the latest increases were announced, that was on January 15th with the increases to come into effect at the beginning of April, the cost of living, which is increasing at about 20 per cent per annum, will have eroded them by at least 5 per cent.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary intends dealing with that problem by enshrining in the legislation a section which I would describe as an inflationary compensatory clause.  When the situation is reviewed in October I trust that this clause will be used to compensate for inflationary increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years the various increases in social welfare benefits have been related generally to the cost of <Col N="175" /> living.  The Minister for Finance, no doubt having been urged by the Parliamentary Secretary, has been reasonably generous in relation to social welfare increases.  Unfortunately, what he gives with one hand he takes back with the other.  I will distinguish this Bill as the March budget.  In addition to the Social Welfare benefits it contains an element of income taxation.  I will describe the budget we had earlier this year as the January budget.  Of course, we also had the petrol budget before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in the January budget raised income tax allowances to take account of increases in the cost of living.  Now the Government have shifted the method of payment from income tax to social insurance contributions.  Any possible benefit the employee received in the January budget has now been clawed back in a rather crude fashion by the March budget.  In addition to our own point of view on that particular problem, no less a group than the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union have said that the social welfare taxation enshrined in this Bill almost completely wipes out the relief given in the recent budget, that is the January budget.</P>
    <P>We are concerned with the general economic strategy of the Government. This concern is highlighted by the approach outlined in this Bill.  Their approach to the economy at present is one of continual taxation.  In four months, from before Christmas to this month, approximately £50 million was raised in taxation by increased petrol charges, postal charges and health contributions. We had the budget of 15th January introduced by the Minister for Finance, which raised approximately £48 million.  Now in the Social Welfare Bill before us, or the March budget, the Government propose to raise approximately £40 million between the employer and the employee through increased social welfare contributions. They will receive £27½ million approximately from the employer and £13 million from the employee, that is 84p paid by the employer and 40p paid by the employee on the social insurance <Col N="176" /> stamp.  That typifies the approach of the Government.</P>
    <P>That is the philosophy behind the increase in the social insurance contributions. We would have thought the central Exchequer in a socialist <i>milieu</i> would have been concerned with the payment out of social welfare entitlements and the payment out of social insurance obligations.  However, in the circumstances it is difficult to understand why the burden is being shifted from the central Exchequer to the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>In relation to the employer and employee, the manager and worker and industry generally, our spokesman on finance, Deputy Colley, in the debate on the January budget stated that industry required an injection of some £25 million.  All it received then was £13 million.  Now industry is being requested to pay £27 million, its portion of the social insurance stamp, that is employer <i>vis-á-vis</i> employee. This taxation acts as a disincentive and may result in smaller firms going out of business.</P>
    <P>In respect of the pay-related benefit scheme, which was operative for the nine months up to 31st December, 1974, it is generally agreed that income over that period was in excess of £8 million and the outgoings on that figure were less than £3 million.  This leaves a balance of approximately £5 million. If that £5 million is available, why was it not given towards the alleviation of the social insurance contribution?  If this £5 million is in existence, what is happening to it?  The Parliamentary Secretary might deal with those matters.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the reason for the special increased element is that it has to take account of the special circumstances of current unemployment. The employer is being asked to pay approximately 64p for improvements and 20p for special increases.  We presume the special increases are towards the payment of benefits under the employment benefit scheme. Of the 40p the employee is being asked to pay, there is a breakdown there of 30p for improvements and 10p for special increases.  This will <Col N="177" /> give a total increase of £1.24.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary prepared to give an undertaking to the House&mdash; I know they are difficult to get from any Government&mdash;to honour the promise that when we reach 4th April, 1976, these special increases will be abandoned, or does he intend doing away with the special increases? We all look forward to the day when the unemployment figure is considerably reduced.  If that day is not reached is it the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to increase the special increases, as outlined in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I touched on the question of the equity of shifting taxation to the employer and employee in this fashion. There is apparently no specific reason given for the shifting of this considerable burden of an increase of 84p to the employer and 40p to the employee.  There is mention of what is happening in the EEC countries. I do not think that is a sufficient reason to put forward what we consider is penal taxation.  This is unwarranted taxation, particularly in the current economic climate.  Instead of this we should encourage small, medium and large business firms to induct as many people as possible and not penalise them with the payment of this form of taxation.  Will it be the practice of the Government to shift the burden of the social insurance contribution from the Exchequer to the employer and the employee? We wish to have this matter clarified.</P>
    <P>We wish every success to those negotiating the national wage agreement; anything said in this House that might damage the prospects of concluding that agreement would be anti-national and unpatriotic.  There has been mention of a figure of an 18 per cent increase being asked from the employers and when we consider the other increases that have taken place recently, for instance, the petrol budget in December, the January budget and now the increases recently imposed, we can understand how industry is creaking so much. The Parliamentary Secretary has made a commitment to the House that he will pursue the consolidation of the social welfare legislation and <Col N="178" /> regulations.  This is an important commitment and we hope that by its introduction some sanity will be brought into the complex area of social welfare legislation.</P>
    <P>As a Parliament we must ask ourselves whether it is sufficient to decide every year that we will give a certain amount to social welfare recipients and then to conclude that we have done our duty.  That is not satisfactory and I am sure the House will agree that we will have to look deeper into the problem.  If we give a person a 5p, 10p or 50p increase in social welfare payments we will have to consider how that will affect him, and how it will improve the quality of life for him.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has set up an advisory committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty and he has placed before the EEC a number of exercises, including a welfare rights project, a home assistance project, a community research project and a social service council project.  These works are to be welcomed and perhaps in his reply the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us when they will be put into practice.  In addition to increasing the weekly entitlements of social welfare recipients, we will have to consider what we can do to uplift them in the cultural, environmental, medical and community sense.  To date the Dáil has not considered fully the proposition that there is more to social welfare than cash payments on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to pilot schemes to combat poverty, one of the most important aspects is a re-examination of the whole area of the home assistance scheme.  This is well known to Deputies and to public representatives as the lowest level of social assistance &mdash;by that I mean as the bottom level of social assistance.  Home assistance as we understand it today derives from the Poor Law and it goes back to 1833.  It developed into the outdoor relief scheme and, in 1922 when the State was founded, it became the home assistance scheme and thus it has remained.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging to note that the Parliamentary Secretary has set in train an examination of the possibility <Col N="179" /> of abandoning the home assistance scheme.  I hope we get into the position of direct intervention in relation to people who are currently in receipt of home assistance.  The officers concerned are doing a difficult job well but it is not reasonable to expect them to be thoroughly trained in the whole area of social welfare and social services.  We would have to integrate the community in the direct intervention programme which I have in mind.  It would be direct intervention by the community, by the medical care people and by qualified social workers.  In other words, it would be an effort to lift the people out of a feeling of beggary, to give them hope and to lift them out of themselves.  If we cannot do that, if the only thing we do is to call home assistance by another name, it will be useless.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the home assistance scheme was discussed at some length in a social studies booklet, the <i>Irish Journal of Sociology.</i> On page 447 of the document it sets out clearly the type of thinking that should be involved in the area of social work and home assistance generally.</P>
    <P>It states:</P>
    <P>The nature of social work is neither easy to define nor to describe but Peter Leonard's definition would be acceptable to most practitioners:</P>
    <P>We may use the term social work to denote the processes used by welfare agencies to help individuals, groups or communities to cope more effectively with their problems of social functioning. Thus, social work consists of social casework (with individuals), social group work (with groups) and community organisations of community development (with communities)... Social work is a professional discipline which has its own body of knowledge based upon practice but scientifically largely unvalidated.  It makes use of the results of academic work, such as sociology and psychology, and consequently owes allegiance <Col N="180" /> to certain scientific assumptions. Yet because social work is a means of implementing society's decisions on the handling of certain forms of behaviour, it is concerned deeply with values and with the use that can be made of knowledge for social action.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is the crunch line. rather than knowledge for its own sake.</P>
    <P>Leonard quite explicitly considers social work as a profession.  He refers to it as a &ldquo;process used by welfare agencies&rdquo; and as &ldquo;a professional discipline&rdquo;.  It may, however, be argued that the essential characteristic of social work&mdash;&ldquo;to help individuals, groups or communities to cope more effectively with their social functioning...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I understand it a home assistance scheme does not take cognisance of all that is required in dealing with the human being in his or her social functioning.  The social assistance officer who is doing his job within the existing fabric given to him basically by this House, where the blame lies in the first instance, has to do his duty as he sees it.  He has to examine each case for financial assistance on its merits.  A person may be in need of a pair of shoes, of &ldquo;Communion money&rdquo; or clothes for a child or children.</P>
    <P>Whereas that is important in itself, I do not think it is unreasonable to look behind the reasons why money must be expended in that fashion and why these people have to approach the home assistance officer and ask for money.  A lady who approached me recently told me she found this humiliating.  I can well understand that.  I did not want to embarrass her by asking why she had to place herself in that humiliating situation.  She did not want to go to the home assistance officer but she had to do so due to various reasons.  I do not want to go too much into that case because the individual could be easily identified but I am aware of the reason why that person had to go to the home assistance officer.  Her husband was not in the least concerned about his obligations to his wife and children.  We can <Col N="181" /> dismiss that husband and say that if that is the way things are we will have to look after his wife and children but we should try to find out why the husband found himself in the position that he did not wish to look after his wife and children.  There was a reason for that also and we cannot dismiss the husband blandly and say he was a social dropout.</P>
    <P>We should look behind the social assistance scheme and see how we can help the husband and try to stop that type of problem arising.  I accept the local voluntary organisations have been doing their bit for that family but that family does not necessarily want cash to continue to have the necessities of life, to exist on a day to day basis, on a grass-hopping basis with no hope for the future.  What that family wants is the father and home assistance is not providing that family with a father.  For this reason the Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated on the fact that his advisory group on poverty recommended to the EEC a pilot scheme to look into the whole home assistance scheme.</P>
    <P>In my view it will be a worthwhile examination and I hope it will bear fruit.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary is dedicated to his job, is concerned and I believe he will urge the EEC to make their finding known as a matter of urgency.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us when this pilot scheme will be brought into operation and where it will operate?  I understand that one scheme will operate in rural Ireland and another in urban areas.  If that is not the position, it should be.</P>
    <P>Urban Deputies know poverty from an urban experience but that does not absolve us from recognising that there are areas outside the borders of the urban constituencies we represent in rural Ireland.  These schemes should operate in those areas at the same time and as a matter of urgency.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary say when the home assistance scheme will be abandoned and replaced by a sane and uplifting one?  What is required is that we return to the individual the dignity that will permit him or her recognise themselves as members of society.  One <Col N="182" /> wonders whether it is too much to return to those individuals their dignity.</P>
    <P>In addition to the various home assistance schemes many voluntary organisations operate in this area and they deserve the praise of the Members of this House.  If these voluntary organisations were not in existence I could see a breakdown of the whole fabric of the health and social welfare services.  What has the State done to help individuals assisted by the Simon Community, the Samaritans, Alcoholics Anonymous?  Alcoholism is a form of poverty.  The individual is deprived of his dignity in the first instance and his intellect becomes poor, it lessens in its degree of perception but the extension of alcoholism is that it deprives others. If the alcoholic is married and has a family or if he is looking after his aged father or mother they are hurt in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those of us who know of the work of the Simon Community, dedicated young men and women who take their nights and early mornings off to look after dropouts, are aware of their devotion to this type of work.  I have never gone on a visit with members of this Community; I have never gone on an &ldquo;evening jaunt&rdquo; with them to discover where individuals are sleeping, but I know that they take such people from under car wrecks and return them to the Community houses in the city. The Association of Widows in Ireland is another noteworthy organisation and the work done by members of this association cannot be over-stressed. They are doing a wonderful job and as one who is fairly closely associated with them I know the kind of work they are doing.  They are helping those widows who cannot face up to the challenge of life on their own.  There are some widows in that organisation who are well able to face up to the challenge of life and they are doing a wonderful job on behalf of the widows who are not.</P>
    <P>In respect of organisations like the Simon Community the Parliamentary Secretary might consider a schools programme.  We have heard suggestions that people between the ages of 18 and 19 might be conscripted into <Col N="183" /> the Army.  I do not accept that at all. I believe such young people should seriously consider involving themselves in organisations such as the Simon Community.  The Parliamentary Secretary could set up some form of schools programme urging young people before they take up employment or becoming university students to give at least six months, nine months or a year to working in the interests of the community.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is a person who is open to reasonable suggestions. I believe my suggestion is reasonable.  Many programmes have been put before school leavers which do not seem to get off the ground.  I do not subscribe to the idea that because a person is young he is bad. Quite the contrary.  Young people have distinguished themselves in this country by their dedication.  It would not be unreasonable to bring to their notice at school level the organisations in which they could participate and the service they could give their country not necessarily by way of military service.  Certainly if school leavers go into the Army, the Army is all the better for it, but if they want to do something for nothing, if they want to give something to their fellow countrymen and women for nothing, they can become involved in those organisations.  I am suggesting this programme be initiated as a matter of urgency.  It could be conducted by sociologists, doctors and so on with a hard core task force from the office of the Minister for Health and the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  There is absolutely no reason why this should not be done and should not be successful.  Thank God there are plenty of organisations which would willingly take on young people for six months to a year.  The young people could finance the year themselves or alternatively the voluntary organisations which finance their own services could help them.  Young people generally do not want much money if they are the type of people who are prepared to give this sort of service.  This would be a worthwhile programme.</P>
    <P>The Dáil and the Government <Col N="184" /> should initiate a programme which will quite clearly identify poverty and deal with poverty at its source.  This is an absolute priority.  The Parliamentary Secretary might prevail on the Government to devote time, even a day, to discussing the whole area of poverty in the community and to seeing what we have done, are doing and will do with a poverty programme. The Government have an obligation to initiate such a programme but it is only fair to say that the Opposition have their ideas, too, and the Government would not go unsupported in relation to any programme they produced. In the meantime, Fianna Fáil will not be found wanting in ideas in this respect.  We are in the course of preparing a comprehensive policy document on the whole area of social welfare and a comprehensive section of that document will be devoted to a war on poverty and what we will do when we return to office.  However, it is not an area for politics.  It is an area which cuts across party boundaries and is one on which the Dáil might reflect for a short day in its life.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said he intends to introduce a national scheme of income-related pensions in a Green Paper.  I hope this will come before the House as soon as possible and bring some sanity into the whole area of pensions.  To return briefly to social work being done by social science graduates, their placement and so on, one might define social work.  Social work as I understand it covers quite a number of areas&mdash;children, old people, physically disabled people, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people and, of course, deviants.</P>
    <P>We have to go behind the actual payments themselves.  They are given by way of entitlement and not by way of charity.  That is another message we should try to get across to our people. These entitlements are theirs as of right, without any qualification.  Having given the individual the money per week, do we leave it at that?  I do not think we do.  I do not think we can.  I do not think we should.  We must consider loneliness and neglect.  In our society there are people who are abandoned.  I say that deliberately. <Col N="185" /> Parents are in homes where they should not be, or one parent is abandoned and left alone.  People in our society are guilty of that social crime. People are living in loneliness and neglect.  We sometimes try to explain that by saying: &ldquo;That mother or that father may not have been particularly pleasant to his or her offspring some 40 years ago and that is the reason for the neglect 40 years later.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is not a good enough explanation. A child who was neglected or dealt with severely by his or her parents 40 years ago, should not visit that neglect on the parents 40 years later.  One can understand the reaction of a child to a beating in particular, a savage reaction to a beating given without explanation.  This comes into the whole area of community care and the direct intervention and the direct participation I have been speaking about.  It is an area which requires the clearest definition.  It must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>To come back to the Parliamentary Secretary's task force, we have a number of ideas which may assist him in the immediate alleviation of the type of poverty we all want to see done away with.  Would he consider the possibility of setting up a housekeepers' association, or the encouragement of some organisations willing to take on that task?  Would he consider the possibility of setting up a home maintenance association and giving that task to some voluntary organisation?  Would he consider a shopping programme? These are three items we believe could assist immediately in making things easier for the more senior of our citizens and for the more physically disabled citizens who have to live on their own, or who have to live with one another because of the circumstances of their case.</P>
    <P>A housekeepers' association would consist of women who are healthy and concerned for others who are less physically capable.  They would do general housekeeping chores.  This is recommended.  This association, which would be based in the community, would provide a corps of women who would volunteer a couple of hours per day to do light housekeeping chores for senior citizens.  This association <Col N="186" /> would also eliminate the social syndrome of ageing, loneliness and isolation by providing contact with people in the community.</P>
    <P>I know that in my own constituency and in other constituencies people are providing that type of service.  Old people are giving their contemporaries the type of service I have been speaking about.  No disrespect to them&mdash; they are doing a great job&mdash;but there is a lack of national co-ordination. They are doing it in an unheralded fashion.  Is there any reason why we should not have a national housekeepers' association?  No reason at all. We should give these people the assistance and encouragement they deserve.</P>
    <P>The same can be said about a home maintenance association.  This is self-explanatory. It would include a group of elderly handy men who are in good health and who desire to help the senior citizens who cannot afford to have simple maintenance jobs done on their own domiciles.  Very often those who want to carry out small maintenance projects on their living quarters find that advancing age and physical disability prevent them from doing those jobs.  This home maintenance association would be community based and community supported.</P>
    <P>The third suggestion is a shopping programme.  We all know individuals who because of their infirmities cannot leave their domiciles to do their shopping. When old people can do a day's shopping they are kept in touch with other people.  In some instances, to my certain knowledge, the fact that they can talk to the shopkeeper or the shop assistant gives them some form of uplift.  A shopping programme, community based, and staffed with volunteers would provide a valuable and needed service for the eradication of a serious and widespread physical sickness among the aged, namely, malnutrition. Inclement weather, physical infirmity and inaccessibility to shops present a monumental obstacle to the senior citizen who has to get food.</P>
    <P>It is further advocated that a national council of the ageing be established to provide research and programme development and evaluation through the exchange of information <Col N="187" /> pertaining to the lifestyle of the aged. There must be ample representation of senior citizens.  This brings another matter to mind as a follow up to the three positive suggestions and positive plans which are being put forward for the benefit of the House and for the use of those who would consider availing of those suggestions.  The last suggestion, namely, the suggestion of a national council of the ageing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Chair does not like to interrupt, but I am sure the Deputy appreciates that this matter is more appropriate to the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point there and I accept it.  On the matter of the various councils and associations I mentioned, I appreciate it is more the concern of the Department of Health but there is a thin dividing line between it and social welfare. However, I appreciate the Chair's point.  If we are setting up councils for the aged, is there any reason why these people should not be represented on them?  Having brought a person back to some sort of minimal physical stability, why should that person not have a place on a board to discuss his or her contemporaries?  We would urge that the aged should not be excluded from boards of this nature. They can speak from their own experience and from their knowledge of their neighbours.  Their contemporaries are better known to them than to a 30 year old who might well be a member of such a board.  These are reasonable suggestions in the context of the whole area of poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return specifically to the Bill, as I pointed out earlier, one knows of families who do not take advantage of their entitlements under the code. One, there is the stigma attaching to applying for and receiving these benefits and this is anathema to them; two, there is lack of information; and three, there are difficulties in using the services.  This raises the question of the complexity of the services.  The Parliamentary Secretary dealt very honestly with that point and we would hope that on the basis of his face-to-face <Col N="188" /> approach to the problem he will in the next number of years&mdash;I do not want to put a time-limit on the consolidation of 640 statutes and 360 regulations; it is a horrifying thought and I wish the group who are conducting this programme quick success&mdash; will succeed.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Kenny, in the case of Ryan versus the Attorney General, reported at 1965 <i>Irish Report</i>, page 294, developed the concept of bodily integrity and matters which conferred rights beyond those of non-mutilation of the body or the imposing of any process which might be harmful to life or to the health of citizens.  He supported his judgement with a quotation from Pope John's Encyclical, <i>Pacem in Terra:</i></P>
    <P>Beginning our discussion on the rights of man, we see that every man has the right to life, to bodily integrity and to the means which are necessary and suitable for the proper development of life.  These are primarily food, clothing, shelter, rest, medical care and finally the necessary social services.</P>
    <P>My view is that we have the necessary framework in the social services, that we have not got a bad system all in all and that those who would compare social welfare entitlements here with those of other nations might remember we are dealing with a population of between 3 million and 3½ million and that we are not dependent on any outside agencies for the production of the income and the translation of that income into social welfare benefits: we do it on our own account only.  I should like to quote the Leader of the Opposition who spoke here on 6th March last:</P>
    <P>With over 100,000 unemployed is it right that these people, namely the unemployed, are expected to survive on unemployment payments against what can be construed as a vain effort to lower demands?  Is it morally right that what started out as social welfare contributions in effect amount to the imposition of employment tax?  This can only act as a disincentive to the creation of future employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="189" /> I have already dealt with that in considerable detail but we must hark back to the social philosophy which asks that the social insurance contributions be heaped on to the employee-employer section and ask whether the idea that these moneys should not come from central finance rather than direct finance is a good one.  We must consider the very penal increases in this form of taxation.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, there were tax reductions given in the January budget but now in the March budget people are being asked to give back what they got.  One wonders at the equity of this.  We can only question the whole taxation policy of the Government.  They taxed the nation in December through petrol, postage, and television.  They taxed the nation on 15th January and now they are taxing the nation from the first day on which the Social Welfare Bill, 1975, becomes law.  Are we to assume there will be no more taxation before the end of May?  We suspect there will be.  The Government's record in the context of income taxation, a sleight of hand form of income taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing my best.  There is one other matter to which I would like to refer before I conclude my short contribution.  It is the discrepancy that exists between the qualifying age for old age pensioners, 67 years, and the national average age for retirement, 65.  We would support the Parliamentary Secretary in doing away with that discrepancy&mdash;the two-year gap between the age of retirement and the age of eligibility for the old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of questions I should like to pose to the Parliamentary Secretary and with which he might deal in his reply.  If he has not got the figures readily available to him, perhaps he would let me know and I shall bring the matters to his attention by way of parliamentary question. Firstly, would he enumerate the <Col N="190" /> recipients of contributory and non-contributory old age pensions, giving dates along with such enumeration? Secondly, would he give the number of recipients of widows' pensions? Thirdly, would he give the number of recipients of disability benefits, indicating the classification of each disability? Fourthly, would he tell us the number of recipients of unemployment benefit and assistance?  Fifthly, would he enumerate the recipients of the deserted wife's allowance.  He has given us a figure in the context of his brief but I do not think it is a comprehensive one.  Sixthly, would he enumerate the recipients of home assistance benefits?  By way of enlightenment, would the Parliamentary Secretary state what are the basic criteria for the giving of home assistance benefits? To add further to the Parliamentary Secretary's tale of woe, would he be good enough to give us a regional breakdown of those figures?</P>
    <P>The Government Information Services have a wonderful capacity for producing facts and figures and for saying that the social welfare benefits are being increased.  They are being increased on a daily basis almost, if one is to believe what the Government Information Services are saying.  But let it be said that Fianna Fáil, when in office, introduced the bulk of these schemes now before the House.  Were Fianna Fáil in office today there is absolutely no doubt but that they would do as much as, if not more than, the Coalition.  Any Government that comes along, having created 50 per cent of inflation themselves, and gives these increases cannot really believe they are entitled to a pat on the back.  They cannot really believe that what they are doing should be greeted with a fanfare of trumpets.  If they examine the social welfare increases in depth they will realise that October next is a long time to have to await such benefits.  Money was set aside on 15th January in respect of such budgetary increases, to become effective on 1st, 2nd, 3rd of April and so on.  But in the meantime, with the cost of living increasing by 20 per cent per annum, the 5 per cent granted to date has already eroded those improvements. <Col N="191" /> That is the reality of the position.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Chair for his patience in allowing me cross the thin line between the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.  I am sure you will agree with me, Sir, that if one were to take each section of this Social Welfare Bill, parse and analyse it, one would be here until morning.  I think the Bill should be greeted with a certain amount of gratitude for its brevity.  As Social Welfare Bills go, it is a reasonably short one.</P>
    <P>Certainly we welcome the extension of the school meals scheme to those children attending schools outside their local authority area.  I am quite satisfied that the parents of such children will welcome the provision also.</P>
    <P>On the question of children's allowances, I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary should engage in too much self-backpatting; they are not that generous.  I would remind the House that the allowances are given on a monthly rather than on a weekly basis. The matter of children's allowances generally will have to be considered, if not on this occasion, certainly on another.  There will have to be interposed into that discussion the matter of whether or not we should have selective children's allowances or whether they should be applied universally.  I think most Members of the House would agree that because of the universality of application of children's allowances, they are spread rather thinly.  While I would not say there are that many people well off at present, certainly there are people in our society who could do without children's allowances.  Even if such people constitute 10 per cent of our society, there is absolutely no reason why those people should receive children's allowances.  In that sense, I would support the principle of selectivity rather than universality.  It is a matter one would need to discuss, having a knowledge in depth of the background of those people in receipt of children's allowances.  One would need to know the number of persons in receipt of them and know the type of people, were one to introduce the <Col N="192" /> element of selectivity, who would be deprived of children's allowances in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is, probably, an extremely controversial subject for discussion. But, because it may be controversial, we should not avoid it.  That does not absolve us from discussing it and from coming down on one side or the other. One cannot have the principles of selectivity and universality obtaining simultaneously.  Of course, when we speak of selectivity, we are speaking about a means test.  That is the reality of the position.  I wonder if those people in our society who can well afford to do without children's allowances are entitled to them?  I do not think they are.  If they are entitled to them, as they are at present, then what is really happening is that the people who could well do with the money at present being paid to that 10 per cent, or whatever may be the figure involved, are being deprived of it.  There exists a considerable disparity between those people in need of children's allowances, in terms of income, and those who do not.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary for his views on the principles of selectivity and universality in the application of children's allowances and to indicate whether or not he agrees in general with my proposition. I contend that, under the principle of universality, children's allowances are spread too thinly among the various sections of the community, that there are those who are receiving children's allowances who could well do without them in favour of those who really need them.</P>

      <P>Like the last speaker, I would like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill. I agree with a certain amount of what Deputy Andrews has said and with most of what is in the Bill.  I do not intend to criticise but perhaps be a little idealistic in my views.  A great deal of new thinking must go into social welfare as the years go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Deputy Andrews brought up the usual red herring that comes from the Opposition on these matters, that the increases we have given in social welfare have only kept pace with inflation. If you take last year's inflation at 20 per cent and that of the year before at 12½ per cent, that gives an inflation rate of 32½ per cent, but the Government have increased social services by practically 100 per cent from 1973 to 1975.  In 1973 we were spending £92 million on social services, and in 1975 it is proposed to spend £210 million.</P>
    <P>During the last couple of weeks of the by-election campaign in the west we heard it said that the National Coalition had not fulfilled the promises in their 14-point plan.  One of those promises was to increase expenditure on social welfare services. Another promise was to look after the old, the sick and the disabled. Let me remind the Opposition that in all the years they were in Government they left the old age pension at 70 years.  In the three years in which we have introduced budgets the age has been reduced systematically so that from April this year the old age pension will be payable at 67 years.  I could not believe my ears when I heard the Fianna Fáil spokesman say he hoped the age would be brought down to 65.  Surely a few years in Opposition has taught them something.</P>
    <P>It is also well worth remembering that when we came into office the old age pension was £5.15 per week. Again from April of this year we intend to increase the old age pension to £8.85.  Three years ago a non-contributory old age pensioner and his wife were expected to live on £5.15, and we are proud of the fact that two married people, one of them an old age pensioner, will now get £13.95 to live on.  That is a big improvement.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to make a political speech, nor shall I, but I squirmed in my seat when I heard some of the accusations made here by the Opposition spokesman for Social Welfare. I have the greatest respect for him and I know he is a very sincere man, <Col N="195" /> but he should not try to fool the people&mdash;he certainly did not fool them in Galway and he did not fool them here&mdash;into thinking we have not increased social welfare benefits substantially.  As regards the means test, three short years ago if an old age pensioner had any means whatever his pension was cut.  Today an old age pensioner can have £6 per week and still be entitled to the old age pension.  Surely anyone who has worked 50 years for the State deserves the maximum the State can afford to pay.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to make is one on which I have a lot of reservations, that is, increasing unemployment assistance particularly to the farming community and expecting the farming community to do nothing productive for that money.  At present there are about 24,000 small farmers in the west getting the dole.  I see them coming into the town once a week to sign on.  I want to make it quite clear that they are quite entitled to get money from the State.  However, they waste a good deal of time coming to town to sign and collect their money.  The suggestion I would make to the Parliamentary Secretary is that, instead of these people coming into town to sign on, they should be doing something productive. At the moment a married man gets £12.80 unemployment.  In return for that he should be required to do some productive work on his farm. The whole thing could be tied in with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and plans drawn up for periods of six months, 12 months of five years.  This married man would get £12.80 per week, which he is getting at the moment, and if he reached a certain target over a three-month period he would get a bonus, with another bonus at the end of six months or 12 months and a final bonus when the plans had been completed.  Even if the man did not benefit his posterity would certainly benefit.  I am constantly saddened at the sight of so much land going to waste.  All land should be worked.  It is too precious a commodity to be ignored.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> When the investigating officer calls on an unemployed man he usually asks if the land is producing anything.  I do not think this is the right approach.  I believe the amount should be based on the valuation.  Take the case of a married man with a valuation of £12 who is working his farm and may have 20 cattle on that farm; his neighbour with the same valuation may have only six head of cattle.  The man who works his land should not be discouraged from improving his holding by seeing his neighbour, who does not work his holding properly, getting more by way of allowance that he does.  The philosophy and the thinking are wrong. Surely our aim should be to encourage people to work harder.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have a great many people returning from Scotland and Britain because of the unemployment situation.  Sometimes they have to wait 12 to 16 weeks before they get their money.  Some of the red tape should be cut so that these people come into benefit as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allowance for single women looking after elderly parents. Unfortunately, if these women are under 58 they are not entitled to anything except home assistance and home assistance is something they do not want.  I agree with Deputy Andrews on that.  The age should be reduced to 50 or 48.  Again, if there is a third person living in the house no allowance will be paid to these women.  Very often in the country one finds an unmarried brother living at home.  In that case no allowance is paid.  Some of these women have given up good jobs to look after elderly parents.  The same difficulty arises in regard to free electricity.  If there is a third person resident in the house there is no free electricity.</P>
    <P>With regard to old people's homes, some years ago I saw an excellent home for old people in Vienna.  Each individual had a flat with cooking facilities.  There was a communal diningroom and communal television. Each inmate had complete privacy and this is something people value. Perhaps something on the same lines could be done here.  I know the <Col N="197" /> Parliamentary Secretary has many bright ideas and no doubt in time, as the economic situation improves, these will be implemented.</P>
    <P>I have a high regard for Deputy Andrews and I trust that those speakers on the Opposition benches who follow him will deal with this matter in the way he dealt with it and refrain from all the parrot talk about the oil crisis, the January budget, the alleged March budget and so on. The majority of people can read and they are quite competent to make up their own minds.  What we want from the Opposition are constructive ideas. There is the same attitude when increases in the contributions are mentioned. The Opposition seem to be under the impression that manna is continuing to fall from heaven.  If social welfare benefits are increased it is logical to expect that the contributions will be increased also.</P>
    <P>An interesting question is whether we are gradually taking social welfare contributions from the Central Exchequer and making them payments for the workers.  I would be in total agreement with any such policy.  It is a form of insurance scheme for an employee to know that because of paying his contribution he will not suffer any drop in his standard of living if he becomes unemployed or sick or in old age.</P>
    <P>Regarding the increased contributions, I know that the employer's increase is to be 84p while, in the case of the employee it is only 40p.  These increases will hit hard the small businesses.  But, if we consider the payments to be a form of insurance policy, the workers should pay the major part of the insurance.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from a Border area I would draw attention to the situation in the North whereby the self-employed, whether they be farmers, business people or any others, have a self-employed stamp. If these people come to live here they expect to find the same situation in this regard, but that is not so.  I know that those who wish to insure themselves are entitled to do so, but some self-employed people might not be in a position to do that. <Col N="198" /> This is a matter to which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give his attention, having regard to the EEC proposals.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that in future social welfare benefits are to be related to the cost of living.  Perhaps we shall not again experience inflation at a rate as bad as last year's and that, to rephrase the Chinese proverb, 1974 was the year of the tiger while 1975 will be the year of the rabbit.  Nobody can underestimate the economic problems we are experiencing and the consequent unemployment situation.  In each social welfare office there is an unemployment assistance register.  In a register of, say, 200 people, how many would be employable if employment in the area were to become available?  The figures should be broken down so as to give us an accurate picture of the situation, because there are many people on unemployment assistance who should be receiving instead some form of health benefit.  That is why I say only those who are employable should be included in the figures on the assistance register.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the war on poverty.  Poverty is a matter that concerns each of us.  I have witnessed real poverty on only one or two occasions during my lifetime and that was in London.  It is an old saying that the bigger the city the greater the poverty.  During the few years I spent in London I saw old people late at night eating from garbage bins. I have never seen poverty in this country to equal that.  We have no real poverty and with a Parliamentary Secretary like Deputy Cluskey we can be assured that every effort will be made to ensure that there will be no poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The last speaker said that his speech would not be political. So far as I am concerned I assure him that we on this side will bring to the notice of the Government any areas in the field of social welfare in which there are anomalies or in which improvements can be made. That is one of the functions of an Opposition.  When we talk of social welfare today as compared with the <Col N="199" /> situation three years ago we are talking of very different times.  Obviously, we have a certain amount of criticism in respect of the present social welfare structure.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary for having, as he told us, initiated work in his Department in respect of the simplification and codification of the whole field of social welfare.  However, in reviewing the whole structure of social welfare, one must also consider certain aspects of the Department of Health.  Deputy Andrews emphasised the importance of community care and community involvement.  With this in mind any review of social welfare must be carried out in conjunction with the Department of Health so as to ascertain whether the latter can be relieved of certain aspects of their work. Such a review is long overdue.  Perhaps the question is one of improving the system rather than overhauling it completely.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have the co-operation of this party in any effort aimed at improving the social welfare structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the increases in social welfare benefits.  However, these increases do not compensate for the huge increases in the cost of living. That may be easy for me to say from this side of the House.  When we talk of social welfare we are speaking of the less fortunate in our community; and these people, as well as those with substantial incomes, must bear the brunt of any increase in the cost of living.  I have witnessed poverty during the past 12 months and, therefore, I was amazed to hear Deputy White say that he only saw poverty once. Any Deputy who attends to his constituents can see real poverty.  I recall the time of the Government's first budget when there was something in the region of £30 million available to the Exchequer that was never there before.  If I was sitting on the benches where the Parliamentary Secretary now sits I would have demanded that that money be spent solely on social welfare benefits.  The inter-party Government lost a golden opportunity at that time of ensuring that the least <Col N="200" /> fortunate of our community benefited from that money available to the Government.  The last speaker criticised the Fianna Fáil Government but I am afraid that he must not have briefed himself very fully on the cost of living and the social welfare benefits at that time and now.  The Fianna Fáil Government were never satisfied with the amount of the social welfare benefits.  It is the end of social welfare benefits when you have a Government who take credit for what they are doing.  We must all the time try to improve the standard of living of those people.  I deal with people such as old age pensioners, widows and orphans. I know the Parliamentary Secretary and his dedication to his work.  I want to talk about some anomalies and some misinterpretations by officials of the Department in relation to certain aspects of social welfare.  I want to try to remove some anomalies and at the same time ensure the removal of hardships on people in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>I agree there should be no such thing as home assistance.  I am glad the two previous speakers mentioned this.  Home assistance should come directly under the Department of Social Welfare rather than the Department of Health because it is only used in emergencies.  Many of the people who apply for home assistance have contributed practically all their lives to social welfare.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is fully aware of a case I want to mention. People claim unemployment benefit and then there is a dispute in relation to their eligibility for it.  This is sent to the Department and while the officials sit down and discuss whether or not this man is entitled to unemployment benefit a hardship is inflicted on a working man and his family.  Recently in Cork there was a strike in a textile factory and 40 men had to be laid off work.  When the men reported to the local labour exchange they were informed they were not entitled to unemployment benefit. Those men received notices from their employer that employment was not available at present but it did not state on them that this was owing to a strike.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="201" /> Those men were prepared to continue working but they received notices that there was not sufficient work available so they were put on an unemployment basis.  I know the hardship which those 40 men and their families had to endure.  I make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate this case.  As I interpret the Act those people were legally entitled to receive unemployment benefit because their employer did not dismiss them but informed them that sufficient work was not available and their services were not needed for a period.</P>
    <P>I am trying to highlight some anomalies and if they are removed they will alleviate some hardship.  I am a member of an old age pensions committee and I state, without fear of contradiction, that I am totally against such committees.  They cause delay in the payment of old age pensions. I stated on the last occasion we discussed social welfare that when I made representations to the Department of Social Welfare about the delay in paying an old age pension I was informed that the committee had not sat for three months.  An unfortunate man was left waiting for three months for payment of his pension because that committee failed to live up to their responsibilities.  I understand payment had to be made even though no meeting of that committee was held.</P>
    <P>Why should there be such committees? If the committee sits tonight and an unfortunate man reaches 67 years of age tomorrow he must wait at least one month before his case can be reviewed by the pensions committee. The only function of such committees should be to listen to appeals.  If an old pensioner feels an injustice has been done such a matter could come before the old age pensions committee.  I make a special appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to look at this part of the structure of social welfare because it causes undue hardship to old people, especially those claiming non-contributory old age pensions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position when an old age pensioner applies for a contributory pension?  He makes an application direct to the Department. Why can the non-contributory old age pensioner not do this also?  Why should he have to wait for a month? I have already mentioned a case where the person had to wait for three I have already mentioned a case where the person had to wait for three months before the committee met. Perhaps other public representatives will not agree with me, but I think we are inflicting a hardship on those unfortunate people who apply for a non-contributory old age pension.  It is my opinion that the pension committees should hear appeals only.</P>
      <P>With regard to unemployment benefit, there have been cases of hardship where there was a misunderstanding between officials of the Department and an employer regarding the dismissal of a worker.  In such a case the worker concerned and his family must wait until the officials have examined his case.  I know of an instance where an employer went out of his way to dismiss a worker and afterwards he made a statement at the local labour exchange that the man left of his own accord.  The case had to be investigated but this took two months and, in the meantime, the man and his family practically starved.</P>
      <P>Where a dispute arises in such a case the worker should be paid until such time as the Department's referee has made a decision.  We know that six weeks' or two months' back money is usually awarded to the worker but in many cases the help comes too late.  The Department will not suffer a loss because if the man is found to be in error he need not be paid for another six weeks but certainly until the time of investigation he should be paid.  We should recognise that hardship is inflicted not only on the man but on his wife and young family.  An anomaly exists here and the Department should rectify the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The attitude is that it is the claimant who is guilty.  He must wait until an official, an employer or a doctor makes <Col N="203" /> a decision.  If a man is out of work through illness and makes a claim for disability benefit he may receive it for perhaps one month.  After that time he must report to the Department's medical referee and he may be told to return to work.  He is entitled to see his own doctor if he wishes and he may be informed by him that he is not fit to return to work, irrespective of what the Department's medical referee has said.  A dispute may arise between the officials of the Department, the Department's medical referee and the worker's private doctor and, as a result, the man is deprived of disability benefit. Usually in such a case the worker gets the benefit of the doubt and is paid back money for six weeks or two months but what good is that to a man who has to exist in the meantime?  We can visualise the hardship and the strain imposed on him and on his family.  This is an injustice and any Government who allow such a thing to happen are saying the unfortunate worker is guilty before he has had a chance of substantiating his claim for disability benefit.  All of us agree that a hardship exists for such workers.  In God's name, why does somebody not decide there is need for a change in the Act? I realise that Ministers are bound by legislation but an Act should never inflict hardship on a man and his family.</P>
    <P>I do not want the Parliamentary Secretary to think I am playing politics here because I am not.  I am stating the facts and I know of the hardships that have been inflicted.  Many workers who have found themselves in this position have been forced to beg for home assistance so that their families might live.  Frequently they have contributed their social welfare contributions for 20, 30 or 40 years but they are reduced to begging for home assistance. I am appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to bring this to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare so that this anomaly in the social welfare structure may be removed.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also mentioned school meals.  I agree that <Col N="204" /> if there is a need it is the responsibility of the Government to cater for that need, but when we talk about catering for a large number of school children we should look at the facilities that exist in the schools.  I know that all schools are not in a position to provide school meals and I believe that until such time as schools are geared with proper kitchens and other facilities such a scheme would be a waste of time.  I do not want to be misinterpreted in this regard.  School meals are essential, especially for children who have to travel a long distance and for those whose parents are not in a position to give them a proper meal when they are leaving for school.</P>
    <P>In this regard there should be co-ordination of responsibility between the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Education.  If the Ministers are of the opinion that it will not be possible to carry out such a scheme they should get together to ensure that the facilities are provided. I am aware that schools are anxious to give such meals but they cannot take on a large number of children and because of this many children will be deprived of these meals.</P>
    <P>On the question of retirement pensions, I feel the Parliamentary Secretary should have another look at this entire area.  A short time ago a Deputy boasted that the qualifying age for entitlement to an old age pension had been reduced, but in this regard we seem to forget that we are talking about human beings, that we are asking a person to fold up before his time.  If a man is asked to retire it does not take him long to convince himself that he is near the end of his day.  Surely a person aged 65 cannot be considered to be advanced in years.  In my view it is appalling that a man or woman who worked all their lives should be asked at the age of 65 to retire.  If they have to retire it is good that the limit is 65, but not otherwise.  It should be possible for such people to take up part-time employment and at the same time collect their retirement pension.  That would be an occupational exercise.  Such a person could keep active rather than sitting down and wasting away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="205" /> I have asked on a number of occasions that such people be permitted to take up part-time employment and about two years ago the Minister for Social Welfare informed me that he was looking into this matter.  I agree that such matters as occupational injury arise, but I see no reason why a man when he retires cannot take up a job as a petrol pump attendant in order to keep himself active while at the same time collecting his retirement pension.  An income from a part-time job would supplement the old age pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister for Social Welfare, should give this matter serious consideration.  Otherwise, many of our geriatric hospitals will be overcrowded.</P>
    <P>There is a great hardship in regard to single women.  Such women may have never made social welfare contributions and, consequently, are considered uninsured persons.  However, she would be liable for rates and ground rent if she owns her own home and she would also have to cope with the problem of loneliness.  Those problems, coupled with the fact that she would have to exist on a very small income, would make her plight very difficult.  In my view we should devote more of our attention to the hardships that exist in this category.  I should like to mention also the widow with a young family, particularly the widow who has school-going children.  Such a person should be entitled to the fringe benefits afforded to the old age pensioner. For instance, such a widow who has to meet staggering ESB bills should be entitled to free electricity. The introduction of such a scheme would not impose any great hardship on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It is not beyond the capacity of the Parliamentary Secretary, or the Government, to introduce such a scheme. We are talking about alleviating hardships&mdash;that is what social welfare is all about&mdash;but such a scheme has never been introduced even though it would prove an enormous help to widows with young families.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of social welfare that should be looked at is that there is very little help available to a person <Col N="206" /> making a claim.  There are many different sections of various Social Welfare Acts involved and there is complete confusion about disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit. I have seen cases of a person making a claim for disability benefit and being informed after about a month that he should have been claiming occupational injuries benefit. Surely there should be some assistance available to a person making a claim perhaps for the first time.  There should be somebody in the local labour exchange to help a person instead of just handling out a form and telling him to fill it in and send it on. The person waits for three weeks or a month and is then told he should have been claiming for something else.  This causes hardship.  These are small things but they mean a lot to an unfortunate person who is ill or unemployed and in need of financial assistance.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there is to be an increase in the social welfare contribution and that the employer is to carry the biggest part of it.  We all know this will mean a further increase in the cost of living.  The worker will get nothing out of this because we know the employer cannot take the money out of his own pocket and, therefore, it will be added to the price of something for which the worker will have to pay.  The increased benefit will be of little or no use to the working man or his family in the years ahead.  It will bring further hardship in the form of another increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>I have tried to mention in as short a time as possible some of the anomalies that exist.  I do not think it would be difficult for the Parliamentary Secretary to have them rectified.  It would ease the hardship on people. I am making a very special plea, which I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, who is present, to convey to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, to make the changes here and there that will mean an easing of hardship on many people who are mainly dependent on social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government have done more in the two short years since they assumed office than Fianna Fáil did in the 16 preceding years, especially in the field of social welfare. Since the Government took office social welfare payments have been raised by rates which range from 66 per cent in the case of some personal rates of benefits to 90 per cent for single parent families and to between 96 per cent and 140 per cent for child dependent allowances.  Children's allowances which have been raised in this budget for the third successive year have gone up since 1973 by 360 per cent for the first child, by 140 per cent for the second child and by 93 per cent for the third and subsequent children.  In the same period the cost of living has risen by between 35 and 40 per cent.  Government spending on social welfare has been increased by £46 million in full year terms.  This means that since the Government came into power the proportion of GNP devoted to social welfare has risen from 4.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent.  It means that the Exchequer cost for social welfare has been increased in two years by 140 per cent because not alone have rates been raised but the scope of coverage and protection has been greatly extended by the introduction of new schemes, by the reduction of the pension age this year to 67 years and by the easing of the means test.  The social welfare provisions in this year's budget will involve a gross cost of £49.4 million with the Exchequer providing £25.68 million.  The full year cost of these improvements will be almost £78 million with a cost to the Exchequer of £46 million.  Thus in full year terms the cost to the Exchequer of social welfare has risen to £223 million, an increase of £130 million or 142 per cent on the cost of the 1972-73 budget, the last year before this Government took office.  The budget provides for very substantial increases in all weekly rates of social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we took office an old age pensioner had to be 70 years of age with an adult dependant to get the paltry sum of £10.10.  An old age contributory pensioner of 67 years of age <Col N="208" /> with an adult dependant will get £18.40 from 1st April next, an increase of £8.30.  Under the present Government the parents of physically and mentally handicapped children are now getting £25 per month and under the Fianna Fáil Government they got nothing.  As and from 1st April next the deserted wife will get £8.85 plus £2.95 per child and under the Fianna Fáil Government that person got nothing.  An unmarried mother is now getting £11.80 for herself and her child and under the Fianna Fáil Government she got nothing.</P>
    <P>Rates of weekly payments will be reviewed in the light of developments in the cost of living in the period ahead.  They will be increased again in October next.  This review is in line with the commitment contained in the Government's White Paper on the economic situation and is designed to protect the standard of living of all those dependent on social welfare and related payments in a period of continuing inflation.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's Department are busy with the preparation of a Green Paper on an income-related pension scheme which will also deal with certain aspects of social insurance for the self-employed sectors of the work force.  Since this Government took office there has been a very great expansion of the social welfare services including such developments as the removal of the income limit for social insurance, pay-related benefits, allowances for unmarried mothers, allowances for single women to which I have already referred, allowances for prisoners' wives, the easing of the means test, the reduction of the pension age, and special provision for child dependants. These are some of the things this Government have introduced since we came into office.</P>
    <P>The Government are fighting against poverty.  This is a great challenge. There is real encouragement in the progress made to date by the advisory committee on pilot schemes to combat poverty.  We have had the announcement of the first four projects which have been brought to the <Col N="209" /> planning stage.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on producing this Bill.  I assure him that he will be in office for many a long day.  Having spent the past two weeks in the west, I am glad to say that the west is awakening.</P>

      <P>It is O.K. for Government speakers to talk about percentages in terms of increases granted in social welfare benefits in the recent budget and as proposed in this Bill, but the real fact of the matter is that there is still extreme poverty in the country.  I was glad to hear the previous speaker say that the Government are fighting against poverty.  I have seen poverty in my own constituency in South Kerry, where I meet people at every level each weekend.</P>
      <P>Due to the ever-increasing cost of living, due to uncontrolled prices of all commodities&mdash;including the necessaries of life&mdash;which are increasing daily, never before did I hear so many people say they are so worried about where they will get the money to buy food for the following week.  The week after Christmas I found it necessary to subscribe to individuals who came into my office in Killarney.  They were unable to keep bread and butter on the table for their families because they were awaiting decisions from the Department of Social Welfare on their applications for social welfare benefits. That is true.</P>
      <P>Each week I refer at least two or three people to the home assistance officers in their respective areas for relief in terms of cash or vouchers. They cannot procure the money to provide the necessaries of life for themselves. This is happening not only in Kerry but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I should like to pay a compliment to a man who has done a great deal to arouse interest and enthusiasm in combating poverty and to arouse community spirit to tackle the problem of poverty.  I refer to the Bishop of Kerry the most Rev. Dr. Casey.  During the past year or so he has held numerous seminars throughout the diocese of Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have come across cases in which recipients of social welfare benefits who <Col N="210" /> could not afford to pay their rates were summonsed and brought before the courts and decrees were got against them.  I will explain the reasons for this later.  We must remember that, were it not for the funds which the Government got from the EEC, we would not have the same level of social welfare benefits as we have today.  I cannot understand why contributory pensioners are being discriminated against in certain respects, particularly in respect of the scheme for the relief of rates and the free fuel scheme.  It is well known that a non-contributory pensioner living with his wife who is also in receipt of a non-contributory pension can get rates relief and qualify for free fuel, but this is not the case in respect of contributory pensioners.</P>

      <P>The rates relief scheme would be a matter for another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pointing out that the social welfare code should be changed immediately in that respect and I should like to see an amendment introduced to the Bill to that effect.  I cannot understand why contributory pensioners are discriminated against in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly worried about long delays on the part of the Department in deciding applications for pensions and other benefits, particularly those for non-contributory old age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment assistance and unemployment benefits.  I have come across cases where persons have waited ten to 12 weeks for decisions from the Department.  The delays in relation to disability payments are not so great but there seems to be a change of attitude on the part of the Department in relation to applications for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  It appears to me that at least 90 per cent of such applications are referred to the local social welfare officers in rural areas and provincial towns.  This means the officials cannot cope with the vast number of applications being referred to them.  Such officers must visit each applicant, query the applicant, his wife and family on their means and household <Col N="211" /> circumstances and must report back through normal channels.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary exactly why this change of mind has come to the Department, why it is necessary, particularly when there are so many people unemployed, to refer such a large proportion of the applications for unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit to local officers. Not alone does it put a terrible burden on those people but the unfortunate applicants are in many cases kept waiting for months.  They do not know whether they should go to the local home assistance officers for assistance or wait for another day or week for a decision from the Department.  I have had occasion to contact the Department on behalf of an average of ten cases per week.</P>
    <P>Personally, I am convinced the Department should be decentralised.  It would be of tremendous benefit to applicants for various services if each county had its own administrative unit.  At the same time, I subscribe to the view that payments should be made through head office in Dublin where overall control must be maintained and the maximum use made of the computer system.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made from time to time to old age pension committees. There is a lot to be said for and against them but I believe that everything depends on the personnel of the committees and the efficiency of their clerks.  There is no doubt that on many occasions local committees have provided the go-between as regards the local social welfare office, the Department and the applicants. Perhaps the only fault that could be found with committees is that some applicants feel members of them may know more about their personal affairs than they should.</P>
    <P>More local offices should be opened in each county to enable persons make application, to get forms and advice regarding the completion of those forms in respect of their applications for the numerous benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.  I have come across a large number of cases of persons <Col N="212" /> entitled to occupational injuries benefit, or redundancy pay, who did not receive such benefit for months after application simply because they had been unable to comprehend the intricacies of completion of the application forms, because they failed to insert their PAYE number or failed to complete the application form in the proper manner.  I believe that the opening of more of such local offices would streamline organisation within the Department of Social Welfare.  There should be an office established and properly staffed in each town with a population of 1,500 or more.</P>
    <P>I am concerned particularly about the substantial increases proposed in the social insurance contributions.  We must remember that such increases will be paid by employees and employers. We must remember also that the vast majority of employees concerned are already paying income tax under the PAYE system.  We must remember also that the vast majority of employers concerned are already paying income tax and, in some cases, corporation profits tax.  Certainly, such proposed increases will constitute a hardship on many small firms and industries and will have the effect of reducing the pay packet of a large number of employees.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about the operation of the occupational injuries scheme.  I cannot understand why there is a graded system of payment in respect of injury.  In my opinion, the position should be hard and fast; either a person is unfit to work or he is capable of working.  I have come across numerous cases of people having been certified by the Department's medical referee as being 20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent incapable of working and of having had their benefit reduced accordingly. I have been convinced for some time that that system should be scrapped and that occupational injuries benefit should be paid to a person for the entire period of his disablement, until such time as a settlement is arrived at or until such time as the person is declared fit for work by the Department's medical referee.  That is a point very worthy of investigation.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, it appears <Col N="213" /> to me that in our endeavour to eliminate the widespread poverty in our country, large numbers of social workers both male and female should be employed by the Department of Social Welfare.  There are many cases of people not knowing how best to use the minimum amount of income to the maximum benefit of a household. This is where trained personnel could render advice and assistance. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate the possibility of providing a number of social workers in each county and, of course, a large number in the thickly populated city areas.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why there is now a very stringent means test attached to application for unemployment benefit particularly in relation to persons who have been in continuous insurable employment for a number of years.  I have met numerous persons whose applications have been held up because they were referred to the social welfare officer.  Once a person has paid his contributions continuously over a number of years, once he has made the requisite number of contributions, provided he can prove he was unemployed and it was clear that he was not working on the quiet or, as we say in some places, doing nixers on the quiet, he should be paid benefit without it being necessary to refer his case to the local social welfare officer.  This is true particularly in relation to provincial towns where everybody knows everybody else's business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but I think he might be confusing benefit with assistance. In the case of benefit and payment, by entitlement of stamps, cases are not referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In my experience, <Col N="214" /> numerous cases have been referred to the local social welfare officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be in respect of assistance but, in respect of benefit, no.  I think the Deputy may be confusing the two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>For benefit too. I shall bring some of those cases to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only think of the case of a person who has left employment without due cause, in which case he would be suspended for six weeks, the case of a person involved in a trade dispute, or a person refusing to take up suitable employment offered, when they could appeal.  But, as the Deputy appears to think, there is no referral of a benefit case, except in the circumstances I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that applications for unemployment benefit have been and are referred daily to local social welfare officers for investigation. I shall bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary over the next few weeks a few cases where this has happened.</P>
      <P>There is another big fault in the social welfare code, and this is where a person believes he is entitled to unemployment benefit, proves unemployment, that he is capable of working and willing to take up work if it is offered to him.  However, when his application is investigated it is discovered that he has not sufficient contributions on his card in respect of the relevant year.  I have come across a number of such cases where applications were held up for a number of weeks.  Their applications were ultimately refused and they were not paid anything whatever by the Department of Social Welfare while their applications were under consideration.  They then applied for unemployment assistance, which was granted.  Unemployment assistance should be automatically granted to the applicant from the date on which he makes the application for unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many local voluntary <Col N="215" /> organisations who have vast experience in looking after people who require financial assistance in order to provide the necessities of life.  As a means of eliminating poverty, the Department of Social Welfare should pay grant to these voluntary organisations. The Department of Social Welfare should also provide a grant towards the cost of the free fuel scheme being operated by local authorities. Many country councils had tremendous difficulties during the past year in operating this scheme.  In the case of Kerry County Council it was found necessary, for financial reasons, to restrict the scheme, and eventually the scheme applied only to persons who were living alone.  People got free fuel vouchers in October, November and December but were disqualified from getting these vouchers during January, February and March.  The Department of Social Welfare should pay at least 50 per cent of the cost of this scheme.</P>
    <P>The school meals scheme should be extended to rural areas.  Children in the majority of towns in rural areas can go home to their meals, but in the remote rural areas, where the school transport services are in operation, many children leave home very early in the morning and often do not return home until very late in the evening.  The school meals scheme should be extended to such rural schools.  There may be administrative difficulties not alone within the Department of Social Welfare but at local level as well, but it is well worth trying.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the increases granted to social welfare recipients in the recent budget and in this Bill are not keeping pace with the ever-increasing cost of living.  Every day there is an increase in the price of one or more commodities.  I am glad to see that the whole position will be reviewed before October.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the social welfare code with which I am particularly concerned is the operation of the prescribed relative's allowance scheme. As a result of numerous advertisements in provincial newspapers in the <Col N="216" /> past couple of years a large number of people who do not come within the ambit of this scheme got the impression that they would qualify under it.  It should be made clear to the public who exactly is entitled to benefit under the scheme.  The officials of the Department of Social Welfare must be smothered with applications from persons who, as the law stands, do not qualify for the scheme.  That scheme could be extended in a particular direction at very little cost and that extension would eliminate a great many unsuccessful applications. I believe that the care allowance should be paid to a married son, a married daughter or a daughter-in-law residing in the home with the incapacitated old age pensioner.  Were it not for the care and attention these old age pensioners receive from married sons or daughters or perhaps daughters-in-law many of them would be under the care of local health boards and that could cost the State a great deal more.  The scheme should be extended to provide for the payment of the prescribed relative's allowance to the particular categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is about time that an improvement was made in the system relating to small farmers under £20 valuations who hand over their farms to sons or daughters.  This scheme should also be extended to include nephews and nieces.  I have known cases in which farmers who handed over their holdings to nephews and nieces were disqualified from receiving old age pensions. Indeed, the scheme could be extended to the person to whom the farmer would normally be expected to will his farm but, as a beginning, it should be extended to cover nieces and nephews; that would meet the majority of cases.</P>
    <P>There seems to be widespread confusion about the free electricity and free television.  An old age pensioner living alone qualifies for free electricity. If an old age pensioner transfers his holding by deed to a son who is getting married, or to some other member of the family, he makes certain provisions for himself and his wife.  I have known cases where meters <Col N="217" /> were installed in the living quarters of the old people.  Other members of the household naturally had access to the house and, because they had, the old couple were refused free electricity and free television.  The regulations should be more broadly interpreted particularly when the old people have their own meter.  Applications for free electricity should be retrospective in effect.  Sometimes applicants have to wait a month or six weeks before their applications are approved and benefit begins from the date on which the applications are approved.  The effect should be retrospective to the date of application.  I think, too, that the time has come when all electricity requirements should be free and not just a limited amount of electricity.  Tax revenue is buoyant and the Exchequer is getting in an increasing volume of money.</P>
    <P>I believe the primary cause for the need to increase social welfare contributions&mdash;it is the primary cause for concern certainly among the public&mdash; is the increasing unemployment.  We will have tremendous social welfare problems in the near future unless the unemployment situation is tackled. The sooner that is done by the Government the better it will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we all have a full appreciation of the Parliamentary Secretary's work in the elimination of poverty.  In this particular area of social welfare there are no fewer than 60 Acts of Parliament under which social welfare is administered and there are 350 regulations under these different Acts.  In the light of that one can appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's enormous task and involvement. We welcome his interest in consolidating social welfare legislation. When the investigation is completed we shall have a simplified social welfare code.  This will not be before its time.  I am certain that in the near future we will have this consolidation measure before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very impressed by the Opposition spokesman on social welfare.  He welcomed this Bill.  His speech was reasoned and well-balanced and if the views he expressed reflect the views <Col N="218" /> of the other members of his party there can be no reason for their voting against this Bill.  It is refreshing to hear that the Bill is welcomed generally by the Opposition.</P>
    <P>There are substantial increases in every sphere of social welfare assistance. These increases will help to offset the increased cost of living.  We have been told that in October next the position will be reviewed so as to take into account inflationary trends in the intervening period.  This is real progress and will ensure that social welfare recipients will not lag behind other sectors in respects of payments. Our social conscience compels us to think first of the less well-off sections of the community and this is what this Government are doing.</P>
    <P>In 1973 social welfare benefits were increased by 66 per cent in the case of personal rates of benefits, by between 80 and 90 per cent in respect of single parent families while the children's allowance in respect of the first child has increased by 360 per cent since 1973.  Social welfare recipients must realise the Government's desire to eliminate poverty.  The Parliamentary Secretary's announcement in this regard received the publicity it deserved. There may be some who are prepared to suggest better ways of doing the job but the Parliamentary Secretary is the man who knows best how the problem can be tackled.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in the social welfare structure in which improvements are desired.  For example, embraced within the social welfare area I would like to see the administration of the home assistance allowances.  I do not think any change in the administration of this area has been effected since 1833.  This is an area which requires some consideration with a view to helping those who, perhaps because of shyness or otherwise, deny themselves even what is necessary to sustain life.  I have in mind the placing of responsibility on social workers appointed by the State to visit people in this category so that they would be helped while there was still time rather than they would get the headlines when it was too late.  These extreme cases do not occur very often but <Col N="219" /> we must ensure that everything possible is done to seek out those people and help them.  I know that public health nurses do a very good job in this area but their task is not easy if they are not accepted and this may happen in the case of old people who live alone.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the pilot areas scheme regarding the elimination of poverty was a worthwhile and muchneeded innovation and I trust that when the data has been collected we can proceed to eliminate poverty totally.  We appreciate the very good work carried out by social and community groups and by individual social workers in every sphere whether they be in the St. Vincent de Paul organisation or in Alcoholics Anonymous or any other group dealing with social problems.</P>
    <P>There are many areas which require attention but which have still been untapped.  However, I am confident that when the Parliamentary Secretary introduces a consolidated social welfare Bill, all those areas will be embraced which up to now have been excluded from the social welfare sphere.</P>
    <P>Some people expressed worry about the increase in the cost of the social insurance stamp which has to be met by the employer and the employee. It is quite clear that this is only a temporary increase and was introduced specifically to meet the abnormal unemployment position.  Who would grudge that necessary contribution by all those who are reasonably well off to help those who are unemployed? People are fortunate to be able to make some contribution towards those less well-off.  We have the assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary and also from the Minister for Finance that this temporary contribution will not continue any longer than necessary.  While there is any recession there must be a real understanding for those less well off.  That is democracy as we know it and that is democracy in practice.</P>
    <P>One could go into all the details of this Social Welfare Bill, but it might <Col N="220" /> be better to leave this over for a later stage.  The benefits which the people will receive on 1st April and also on 1st October are a tangible proof of the Government's interest in people who have not got the same standard of living which others enjoy.  Everything in the Bill, even the increased contribution, is acceptable.  I feel very pleased, as I come from an area where we have many recipients of social welfare benefits, with the increased benefits given this year.  Anybody who lives in a western county can never claim he has too much of the world's goods.  The soil in this area is not very fertile and we have not highly industrialised areas such as we have in other parts of the country.  Many people in the western area need social welfare benefits because industry was not diversified.  The Government have stated that they hope to diversify industry.  Therefore it is good to know that until this takes place the people in this area will obtain help so that they have as good a standard of living as it is possible for the Government to give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary stated that this Bill is concerned with the extension and improvement of the social insurance and social assistance schemes provided for in the budget.  While this side of the House accept that to a large extent this is true, we should also take note of a sentence later on in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief, which states:</P>
      <P>The erosion of the purchasing power of welfare payments in a period of rapid inflation is a cause of concern...</P>
      <P>Even though a great number of increases are given in this Bill they do not relate to the present cost of living. While pensioners and others will benefit, I do not accept that the increases given are adequate.  I would like to have seen a great deal more done for the people in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recently asked a question about many aspects of social welfare, home assistance, disability benefits and other matters connected with health and <Col N="221" /> social welfare.  We have a great deal to do in respect of all these matters. There are many things in this Bill which we can complain about.  While the increases may be very welcome they do not live up to what we expected, especially in view of the fact that the subsidies which were formerly paid to agriculture are now available to the Government to help the poorer sections of the community.  In the western counties county councils have to face huge bills for home assistance. In my county this year we had to make available £147,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Parliamentary Secretary intends to do something about this and for that reason I will refrain from making any further reference to the matter.  Last year I complained about old age pensions, especially in relation to people in receipt of contributory pensions.  During the last few weeks I have had complaints from a number of old age pensioners who are in receipt of British contributory pensions. Their pension books were collected and their pensions reduced because of an increase in the British payments.  At a time when we are in the EEC and when there is greater co-operation with other Governments in regard to social welfare matters, it should not be necessary to impose this hardship on old people.  They have to hand in their pension books several times during the year and then they find their pensions are reduced <Col N="222" /> by £2 or £3 simply because there has been an increase in the British pensions.</P>
      <P>There have been many instances where people have had to wait a considerable time before they received their pensions.  I know of a case where a person applied for a contributory pension more than 12 months ago but because some of the contributions were made in Ireland and some in England the case has been going to and fro between the Department of Social Welfare here and the appropripriate Ministry in Britain.  There is need for considerable streamlining in the Department of Social Welfare. Were it not for the fact that the man concerned in the case.  I have mentioned has some relatives to look after him, he would be in an impossible situation.  I cannot see why there should be this dreadful delay in attending to the needs of people who are only seeking their rights.  I hope this will be the last time I shall have to make such a complaint here.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that little thought has been given in this Bill to the self-employed, although the Parliamentary Secretary made a passing reference to this group of people.  In any small town at the present time business is in a depressed state and shopkeepers are closing their doors practically daily.  These people have no option but to look for home assistance. Immediate action should be taken to protect the self-employed.  Because many of them have valuations of a certain figure they will not qualify for unemployment assistance and they are forced to go to the home assistance officer for help.  I hope that the suggestion of the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the Green Paper will be acted upon as quickly as possible so that some help may be given to the self-employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another category affected are the fishermen.  Although the skipper of a boat gets his share of the catch like the other fishermen he is not allowed to put up stamps for himself.  This regulation is rather harsh, particularly on the west coast where there are periods when the weather is very bad and fishermen are unable to put to sea.  At such times crew members <Col N="223" /> can draw unemployment benefit but the skipper has no income whatever during such periods.</P>
    <P>Part-time fishermen are adversely affected also because they are not allowed to pay contributions as are other workers.  It is strange that these people should be singled out for this treatment and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to try to remedy the anomaly that exists in this area.  Part-time fishermen frequently work during the summer season but when they go to the unemployment exchange later in the year to draw unemployment assistance they are asked for an account of their earnings.  Most fishermen will give this as far as they can, but their word is not accepted by the official who investigates their case. Usually what happens is that after a fishing season the amount of unemployment assistance is reduced considerably.</P>
    <P>Let us compare their position with that of an industrial worker who emigrates.  The latter may work as a subcontractor on building work in England and may earn £100 a week but when he returns to Ireland and goes to the local employment exchange he is asked only for the date of his last employment and the name of the firm. Part-time fishermen are treated very harshly in this matter and this does not encourage people to work.  In fact, it encourages dishonesty because many of the fishermen will continue drawing the dole and also continue fishing in the hope that questions will not be asked later.</P>
    <P>The present Act militates against rural workers in relation to unemployment benefit.  Two sections of this Act have been applied more rigidly recently than in the past.  Small farmers try to obtain employment with county councils or with farmers with large holdings during the summer months for the purpose of gaining a number of stamps but unless such farmers have 78 stamps over a period of three years they do not qualify to draw unemployment assistance.  Previously if they had 26 stamps and put on 13 for the following year they could continue to draw unemployment benefit.  The application of these two sections in such a rigid <Col N="224" /> fashion makes it almost impossible for people living in rural areas to draw unemployment benefit because they find it difficult to get the required number of stamps.</P>
    <P>In connection with school meals I should like to refer to the way the scheme operates in Gaeltacht areas.  I doubt if that which is given to the children could be described as a meal. The scheme has been in existence for a long time but judging by the way it is administered at present it is a waste of public money.  The scheme should be either improved or scrapped.  The usual pattern is that bread is delivered to the schools twice weekly and cocoa or milk is delivered almost daily.  However, there are no facilities in the majority of schools to provide a satisfactory meal.  Many school children leave home at 7 o'clock in the morning, get the school bus to school and do not return home until 5 o'clock that evening. Such children should be given a substantial meal during the day.  It would not cost very much to instal cooking facilities in schools so that the children could be given even a hot drink.  If it is the intention to restructure the social welfare code and services, this area should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The free electricity scheme causes a great many headaches to public representatives who have to explain who is eligible.  Where an old person has a son who is unemployed living with him or her the free electricity scheme should be extended to those people.  If the head of a household is unemployed and there is an old person in residence in that house, the free electricity scheme should also apply.  The same applies to the prescribed relative allowance.  It is very difficult to explain who is eligible for this scheme.  If a prescribed relative is married to a man who is in receipt of unemployment assistance the allowance should be continued.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that we are going far enough to assist those in the social welfare bracket.  Poverty is worse than ever when one considers the cost of food, clothing and fuel.  People living alone are finding it very hard to exist and in my view the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Government, have <Col N="225" /> nothing to shout about in relation to this Bill.  It is all very well to give figures and quote percentages in relation to increases down the years but the best way to equate things is to consider what £5 can buy now.  I am not satisfied that sufficient efforts are being made to eradicate poverty and I believe that many people are worse off now than they were two years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on this Bill.  It is indicative of the courage of the present Government in very difficult times.  The reduction in the qualifying age for the old age pension and the improved situation in relation to the means test have been welcomed.  It is obvious from the figures that the increases given are far in excess of the rate of inflation. Social welfare is necessary in cases of illness, poverty and old age and we must provide such assistance.</P>
      <P>In the case of small farmers or owners of small businesses on the disposal of that farm or business it is accepted that the old person qualifies for the pension.  Where the money is disposed of for the benefit of a son or daughter it very often does not satisfy the pension officer who is investigating the disposal of means.  I would like to see that rectified.  Money should be treated in the same way as land or any other form of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free electricity and free television licence are matters about which I feel strongly.  Old people are very reluctant to approach anybody about this, form-filling is very often not their strong point and so they do without this very desirable little benefit.  I would like to see the free electricity scheme extended to all old people, even if they are living with sons who are employed or in receipt of social welfare benefit.  The administrative costs at the moment must be such that by simplifying the scheme in this way it would probably not cost any more. It must cost a lot of money to do all the probing that is done at present. A person in receipt of old age pension should automatically qualify for free electricity.  This would give the old person a certain standing in his own <Col N="226" /> home.  He would feel he was contributing towards the household.  It is very important that an old person maintain a certain amount of independence and pride.  In this way he would feel he was helping to pay back the son or daughter for looking after him in his old age.  This would probably help towards keeping old people at home.  Only God knows what it costs nowadays to keep old people in hospitals.</P>
    <P>Although it is slightly outside the scope of this debate, I would like to see an improvement in the capitation payments in geriatric hospitals.  This seems to be an area in which we are skimping.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be more appropriate to another Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I should like to make a point in regard to people in the public sector.  A few cases have come to my notice of people employed in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and in other Departments.  They have their own pension scheme but unfortunately there are snags and they are snags I would like to see removed forthwith. If a man applies to, say, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for a post and is fully qualified in every way, because of some inherent health problem he may not be allowed to become a full-time employee and so may not participate in the pension scheme.  I know of an employee who was with a county committee of agriculture for 12 to 14 years.  He received increments over the years in line with the permanent employees. In fact he missed less days at work than most of the permanent employees. He gave good service but he could not come under the pension scheme.  He died and his widow is now left to the mercy of the waves.  I would be quite satisfied with my contribution if this was rectified because I would not like to see it happen again. People with health problems are the people most in need of a pension scheme.  If a man is likely to live to a ripe old age the pension is not nearly as important as it is to a man who might be taken away prematurely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> I was sceptical about the payment of unemployment assistance to the 24,000 smallholders but my short sojourn in the west showed me that this is a very useful and beneficial contribution indeed and I would like to see it tied in with EEC schemes such as the hill and handicapped areas scheme.  All those contributions are being ploughed in to improve holdings.  The people who are receiving those contributions are using them very wisely.  It is a credit to them. The contributions are helping to keep people in the rural areas of the west and this is something that should be expanded and fostered rather than diminished.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the speaker who said that the prescribed relative allowance should be paid to the son, daughter or daughter-in-law, even though that person is being supported by a husband or wife.  It would help to keep old people at home.  One very rarely sees somebody qualifying for this allowance.  There is a lot of paper work done investigating cases.  If a person is genuinely in need of full-time care and attention, if he is very ill or bedridden, and if that care and attention is being given by a daughter or daughter-in-law that small contribution should be made.</P>
    <P>Having said all that, I must say I am proud to be associated with a Government who saw fit to do so much in such a short time in office for the old and the needy.  It is very easy to talk about socialism but this is true socialism&mdash;to look after the needy and care for the less well-off people.  It is a matter of chance and of inheritance that people are wealthy and if people are not very bright or are not physically able to work that is not their fault.  I am very proud that we, in a difficult period, have succeeded in doing so much for them and I am particularly proud that we will not even wait until the Recess to have another look at the situation. I am sure the people who are in full employment at the moment will not begrudge the extra temporary relief they are being asked to give in a very good cause.  The swing back has come with regard to unemployment and the <Col N="228" /> need for this extra payment will not be there in a very short time.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of retirement pensions for people living in the UK and qualifying for some pension here and some pension in the UK.  I find the social welfare people at home and the social welfare people in Newcastle-on-Tyne equally efficient.  I have no difficulties good, bad or indifferent. I have had a good many dealings with them.  I should like to compliment publicly the people in Newcastle-on-Tyne on the promptness of their replies and their efficiency.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary on a good job.  I should also like to compliment him on his general behaviour as a junior Minister.  All his pronouncements have shown that he has a very deep concern for the people under his care.  I am glad to be able to stand up here and compliment a very great man indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>When one takes this Social Welfare Bill in conjunction with the budget, one must say that it is probably the greatest con-man job ever seen in this House.  The increases given, limited as they may be, are welcome, but they are completely inadequate to deal with the ever-increasing spiral in the cost of living.  The increases given do not meet the increased prices which people have had to meet over the past 20 months.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicates the great job he and the Government are doing in making such limited advances in this distressing period.  With the change in attitudes at home and abroad, we must keep abreast with social welfare payments.  New advances must be made and new legislation must be introduced.  The Minister talks about an increase of £2 and compares it with an increase of £1 when £1 was £1.  This is the con-man job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On budget day the Minister and his colleagues were not aware of the vast burden the increase in the social welfare stamp would place upon the backs of the workers.  With open Government and with a Government of collective responsibility, one would think that one would have got honest <Col N="229" /> replies to questions put by Deputies who were entitled to know what the increase would be.  Apparently the Minister for Finance was in the dark on the question of social welfare and he was only aware of the increases he was imposing on the various items in the Financial Resolutions.  I said:</P>
    <P>I wish to put a question in relation to the social welfare increases where the amount for the year will be £51 million, £27 million being made available from the Exchequer. Will the Minister indicate the increase per stamp for social welfare?</P>
    <P>The Minister deliberately misled the House.  He must have been in full possession of the facts but he did not want to disclose them because it would be shown that the other increases would be eroded by the increase in the stamp.</P>
    <P>It is rather pathetic that the Minister should have inadequate information for the House on social welfare. Other Members of the House also pressed the Minister to tell the House what burden was being placed on the backs of the workers so that we could compare it with the so-called concessions. Having misled the House on that occasion, it is now quite clear that the Minister is aware of the increase.  If the Minister for Social Welfare kept the Minister for Finance in the dark, he should now be aware of the increases which the workers and industry will have to carry in the future.</P>
    <P>I have said that the Social Welfare increases are not sufficient to meet the increases in the cost of living, the increases in the almost daily budgets with which we are all familiar.  We hear that there will be an October review.  How many times will the nation's finances be reviewed before October?  How many more budgets will we have?  How many increases will we have?  Prices are increasing daily.  Increased prices are sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce almost daily.  The review will not take place until next October.  That is not good enough in the circumstances.  If the Government were earnest and <Col N="230" /> honest and were performing their task in accordance with the promises made to the public prior to the general election, an October review might be adequate, but an October review is not adequate because of the broken promises which have placed a vast number of people below the poverty line.</P>
    <P>Before we had 100,000 people unemployed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare indicated that 25,000 people were living below the poverty line.  How many people are living below it now, taking into consideration the vicious increases in the prices of the necessaries of life over the past 12 to 18 months?  One would need a daily review, or a weekly review, or a monthly review, to keep abreast of the upward spiral of prices.  There is no doubt that the widow, the orphan and the unemployed will suffer before the October review.  Even if we have an October review, remedial action will not be taken until the budget in January when the Minister will come into the House and measure the backs of the workers and the industrialists for a further burden.</P>
    <P>Can they bear it?  I say they cannot. The less well off sections of the community will carry the can between now and next October.  During the coming months, the aged, the widow, the orphan and the other distressed sections of the community will suffer a lowering in their standard of living. Reviews of this nature are not good enough when we consider the daily, weekly or monthly budgets presented to the House in one form or another.</P>
    <P>The little that has been given to the most deserving cases has been due to the foresight of Fianna Fáil.  I will give a little credit to Fine Gael for their attitude to entry into the EEC but their colleagues in Labour vehemently opposed entry.  Our EEC membership has meant that moneys were made available to increase social welfare benefits.  Our membership has yielded £60 million in the two years up to April next.  We can add to that the £50 million the Government obtained from increased petrol taxation, health charges and so on and the £48 million <Col N="231" /> extra they got in the budget in January and the £50 million being imposed by this Bill.  Then we will see that the social welfare classes have got very little.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the conmanship of the Government in regard to the social welfare classes.  During the budget debate we heard about the Government's efforts to ensure that the weaker sections would get sufficient to compensate them for the increase in the cost of living.  Let us take a man with £600 a year.  He was given a tax saving of £19.50.</P>

      <P>I am merely making a statement that the increases given are not great enough to meet the cost-of-living increase.  I have dealt with tea and butter.  The two pound loaf of bread was priced at 13½p 23 months ago.  Now it is 21p for a smaller loaf.  If one takes the increases in benefits and in prices on a percentage scale one would see that the weaker sections of the community have lost out.  If one considers the massive 60 per cent increase during the last 23 months, takes a look across the board and considers the increases people have had to pay, not on commodities alone but on other items, <Col N="233" /> such as fuel and so on, one will realise that such people have been given a mere pittance and it does not reflect any credit on the Government.</P>
      <P>This is at a time when there are large amounts of money available.  I indicated their sources&mdash;the agricultural subsidy, the amounts obtained by one means or another through previous budgets on petrol, health charges, postal charges, the January budget and so on.</P>

      <P>In regard to the general situation, we observe that the phrase &ldquo;poverty line&rdquo; spoken about so often in the past has been dropped by members of the Government and indeed by members of the party supporting the Government because they know all too well that the poverty line is extending, as are the dole queues daily in each county.</P>

There is an ever-increasing number and they are to be found also in the dole queues and everywhere else as a consequence of Government incompetence, notwithstanding the fact that they put their hands into the pockets of workers time and time again in the last three or four months.  I know this may be unpalatable to the Labour Deputy from Waterford.  I know I may be hurting his feelings.  Nevertheless, facts speak for themselves.  Some of the increases available at present are available through a scheme, through the EEC, which the Labour Party opposed.  If the Labour Deputy, together with other Members of this House, had his way people would be unable to obtain the minimum amount of benefit being given at present.</P>

Surely no Deputy will infer that any worker could afford to pay much more in addition?  I hope the day will arrive when we will grant much more to the weaker sections of the community. With all the money that has been grabbed from people, the Government should be well able to double the amount of benefits to deserving cases.  Mind you, there are people receiving social welfare benefits who probably should not be obtaining them.  It is the job of the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that the deserving cases get the substantial increases to which they are entitled.</P>
      <P>If this review which is to take place is anything like others before it, if it is anything like the 14-point plan and the other promises that have been made, then we will see a vastly different situation.

That is a matter about which the House must be concerned. If the Government Information Services continue to produce documents, getting Deputies to post them with the Oireachtas mail&mdash;in fact some went out with by-election addresses&mdash;we will have a wild situation in the future.  There is the question of free postage, not to display a social welfare document issued by the Government but to produce party propaganda. This is a serious matter which has been raised before and will be again.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere I hope he will have this matter investigated and report back to the House.  If he does not do so, then he is as big a fake as the rest of them.</P>
      <P>The weaker sections of the community, workers and so on, are asked to pay more increases.  If such people apply for a medical card, the fact that they may pay a greater social welfare contribution is not taken into consideration, nor is the fact that their conditions are worsening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that if the Department, the Minister for Social Welfare, or his Parliamentary Secretary increase the stamp to, say, £4, an applicant's gross income is taken into consideration at that stage. This increase has many disadvantages which must be offset at some stage. This is an increase across-the-board without taking into consideration other aspects such as the worker being injured in the course of his employment. Again if a person applies for a loan or a supplementary grant to purchase a house his total income is taken into account; the social welfare contribution is not.  This is a worsening of conditions for people who wish to purchase their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government think this is good enough for the workers and they are determined to get this money whether <Col N="237" /> people suffer or not, whether people get a home, a medical card or anything else.  Many of these people are working in small industries which will go to the wall because of their inability to pay some of this extra £27 million the Minister is seeking.  The workers will then be on the dole and will probably then get their medical cards.  That will be the sum total of benefits they will receive as a result of these vicious increases imposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>This substantial increase in the stamp was not known two months ago.  I would have thought that, having regard to the open government we are supposed to have, one would have seen the whole picture, but both the Minister for Social Welfare and his Parliamentary Secretary kept the Minister for Finance in the dark.  It was black-guardly that they did not tell him what the increase was going to be.  I would have thought that the Minister, in making an important announcement in this House, would be in full possession of the facts.</P>

      <P>If I may not say it now I shall say it tomorrow or on some other occasion.  I have just said it is despicable that one Minister would keep information from another Minister. If we had this information on 15th January, on the day that I asked, we could have viewed this in a different light.  The fact that this vital information was kept from the people for two months does not reflect any credit on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Social Welfare.  My sympathy goes out to the Minister for Finance who was sent in here without the full facts of the situation.  Or was it that they were telling the truth, that it took the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, with all the machinery behind them, all this time to make up the total cost of the stamp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The question of the substantial amount of the stamp increase has been dealt with by Deputy Andrews and other Deputies, and the injustice of the Government seeking this large amount of money at a time when they should have adequate funds available.  Some of the benefits are being financed by the increase in the stamp, some are being financed by other means.  This stamp increase is a gimmick.  It is additional taxation being imposed on the workers.  The workers are being conned by the device I mentioned earlier, the so-called reliefs that have been given, while they have to pay this extra money back to the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to the review in October, can the Parliamentary Secretary give an assurance that there will be no increases in foodstuffs or in the cost of living, that there will be no increase in transport costs, in fuel costs and all the other costs that erode whatever little the workers have?  If he speaks to the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan or the distressed, they will give the Minister his answer.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary have tried to give the impression that as a result of the substantial increases they have given, pensioners are all millionaires now, that they can live in the lap of luxury. That is far from the reality of the situation.  If there is a deterioration in the cost-of-living situation between now and October, the conditions of these people will be worsened.  Can we have an assurance that their situation will not be worsened?  Unfortunately no such assurance will be given.  I can give an assurance that there will be very little of their pensions left by next October.  One notices the daily spiral in one commodity after another. We are now promised increases in bread and butter prices.  The people who will suffer are those who were made well off after the 15th January. Now they find the whole structure has <Col N="239" /> weakened and since 15th January to date their situation has worsened. This pattern will continue and not until next October will the Government review the situation.  In order to qualify for the kind of increase mentioned by the Taoiseach in today's newspapers a person would want to survive for 20 years.  These people are getting a mere pittance by way of increase at a time when some are near starvation.  That was the phrase used by members of the Government&mdash; people living below the poverty line and people going hungry.  There are many more hungry today than&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;into a realisation of what the situation is.  He appears to have no interest in the situation.  I hope the additional burden being placed on industry and the worker in general will not affect in any way the employment situation, but it is bound to have an adverse effect on industry. This is taxation.  Will its imposition mean that many more people will lose their jobs?  I believe they will.  The smaller industries will certainly go to the wall and I am sure other larger industries will follow them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, these increase are not big enough and a new look will have to be taken at the whole question. We understand that even greater burdens in relation to contributions will be placed on the backs of the workers in future.  We see the weakening situation workers are in.  When this promised review takes place I hope justice will be done.  The money is there, the money that has been taken by one con trick after another. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to bring forward this proposed review so that people will not be left in distress coming into the winter and during the winter months.  If the review does not take place until <Col N="240" /> October it will take some time to complete and, having been completed, it will have to be examined by the various Departments before the Department of Social Welfare will be in a position to make a decision.  It could well be the following October before anything definite results.  By then many of the people concerned will have passed on and will have ceased to worry.  If the review date is brought forward that will ensure that people get the improved benefits at the earliest possible moment and those on the poverty line and those who are starving will not be forced to continue in these dire circumstances. The ever-increasing queues for one type of assistance or another are a clear indication of the number of people below the poverty line.  I hope the review will take place earlier than October to ensure justice will be done to the weaker sections of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the amount of hard work he does and the concern he shows in every case one brings to his attention.  Since this Government took office there have been enormous increases in benefits but unfortunately many people are not fully aware of what they are entitled to and, as a result, we Deputies, particularly in the western areas, find ourselves increasingly involved in social welfare problems. I find that every case I send to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;&ldquo;Dear Frank&rdquo;, as we affectionately refer to him on our corridor&mdash;receives prompt and efficient attention.  For that I would like to thank him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dowling believes what he says or whether he is just indulging in an exercise of &ldquo;Please keep it going&rdquo; but, for some strange reason, he comes in here and paints a picture of vast numbers below the poverty line and vast numbers unable to get increased social welfare.  If one were to listen to Deputy Dowling for long one would really come to believe we were one of the Third World countries and had a situation here <Col N="241" /> where vast numbers, as Deputy Dowling says, would die of starvation before next October.  Anyone who is honest, and we are long enough in politics to be honest at least in this House, knows that for a number of years now people have been becoming &mdash;I thank God for it&mdash;increasingly better off.</P>
    <P>I know my constituency backwards. I know every parish in it.  At some time or other I have called to one, two or three houses in every parish in the year and over the years I have seen a steady improvement in living standards.  I cannot speak for Deputy Dowling's constituency but I can speak for the urban areas in my own constituency.  There have been vast improvements and they do not tie in with the picture Deputy Dowling paints for us of people dying of starvation and increasingly large numbers below the breadline or unable to get medical cards.  He must himself be very inefficient if he is not able to do something for these people because anyone below the breadline is entitled to assistance and gets it.  I have yet to have any application for home assistance or an allowance refused if the applicant was entitled to it.</P>
    <P>To my mind we have moved into an area&mdash;this is something we must guard against&mdash;where it is now more profitable in certain cases not to work. There are many people entitled to assistance, and I am all for giving it to them, but there are some drawing assistance who are not entitled to it.  If they examined their consciences they should realise that by claiming assistance they are, in fact, depriving those worse off of more assistance to which they would really be entitled. There is a great deal of criticism in urban areas of small farmers drawing assistance.  Perhaps some are getting it who should not but a great number who are getting it are making tremendous improvements in their farms. They are making good use of the money.  There are people who squander these allowances.  That is not the fault of the Government.  In many cases it is not the fault of the people themselves but because of an inability on their part to apply the money to the best use.  We have need of many <Col N="242" /> more social workers particularly in rural Ireland.  I am thinking now of the day on which the itinerants draw the children's allowances and other benefits.  They get a substantial amount of money and a great deal of it is squandered.  Guidance in the proper use of the money would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling wept over the burden the increase in the insurance stamps would place on the back of the workingman.  I do not believe any workingman begrudges the increase when he knows that that increase will go towards helping those who are unemployed. In today's circumstances the ability to maintain employment is controlled not by oneself but by monopolies and so on and I do not believe that anyone in employment would grudge contributing a little extra so as to help the unemployed and the weaker sections of the community. Deputy Dowling almost shed tears when asking where the unfortunate workers are to get this extra money. We must remember that workers are not only those engaged in manual labour but include all persons who work for a living whether with their heads or with their hands.  Anybody with any intelligence knows that when benefits are increased, the additional cost must come from somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Regarding pensions, Deputy Dowling seemed to forget one point, that was, that when his party were in Government the increases were paid in July each year but in some cases were deferred to October whereas they are paid now in April.  We all know that the cost of living has increased, but we know too that the Government have made every effort to offset the increases.  If Deputy Dowling is aware of the vast numbers of people who are below the poverty line he should notify the relevant authorities.  However I do not believe that such a situation exists.</P>
    <P>Regarding the social welfare structure, there are what appear to be some small anomalies.  For instance, the contributory old age pensioner is penalised in some ways.  He was not entitled to butter vouchers, which was a concession available to a person in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> I find that many of my constituents are not aware of the new schemes, such as those for deserted wives, unmarried mothers and the not so young single women.  There is need for a revision of the prescribed relative's allowance, because anybody who cares for an elderly relative should be compensated for doing so.  One of the greatest fears that old age can hold for anyone is that of being put into an institution.  Most people would prefer to remain in their own homes where they can watch their grandchildren grow up.  However, there is a tendency on the part of younger people to put their elderly relatives into State institutions.  This is a tragic situation. There are cases where people are so ill or feeble that to keep them at home would impose a great hardship on those concerned, but in the majority of cases elderly people could be cared for at home.  We owe it to them to allow them to remain in their own homes if they so wish.  That is why I suggest that the prescribed relative's allowance regulations be changed.  This would be an incentive to relatives to look after their elderly relatives.</P>
    <P>Great play is made of the large number of people who are unemployed and Deputy Dowling referred to the length of the dole queues.  But many of those who are registered as unemployed now have never been employed but qualified for benefit under the new scheme by virtue of valuations, numbers of children and so on. Therefore the true unemployment figures are not those issued each week. They are much fewer than those figures.  Unemployment benefit, while not allowing anyone to live in luxury, is adequate.  As a comparatively small nation we can do no more than ensure that people get a reasonable amount of benefit.</P>
    <P>Regarding children's allowances, I have always considered it odd that the first child is penalised.  At one time there was no allowance for the first born.  That situation was rectified but there remains the anomaly that, when increases are granted, they do not apply usually to the first child.  This is <Col N="244" /> odd when we consider that a first child involves more expenses than subsequent ones because of the purchase of such items as cots, prams and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Dowling canvassed during the by-election campaigns but I did a lot of campaigning in Galway North.  Many people I met during that time expressed pleasure at the reduction in the qualifying age for the old age pension to 67.  We hope that next year this will be reduced to 66 and the following year to 65.  In this way we are eliminating the gap between retiring age from employment, usually 65, and the qualifying age for the old age pension. This, together with such concessions as free travel, free electricity and free television licences makes life a little easier for our senior citizens who have given valuable service to their country.</P>
    <P>We must instil in our younger people a respect and reverence for our older citizens.  The modern thinking is that once a person reaches 40 he or she is out, particularly in business.  This is a dangerous trend and is moving towards the attitude that to be old is to be a liability on the State.  Those who think in this way should be reminded that, were it not for the hard work engaged in by their fathers and grandfathers, their circumstances might be very different.  I should like to see eliminated the stipulation that in order to qualify for free electricity or television licences an old person must not be living with anybody who is earning. The cost involved in investigating the circumstances of the few people who apply for these concessions must be considerable.  If you count all the energy it takes to investigate the case it would have been cheaper to have given the free licence in the first instance. Old people get great comfort from looking at television.</P>
    <P>I agree that social welfare stamps are expensive for workers and employers but somebody has to pay the piper.  We must be realistic.  If we want to give increased benefits, then we must increase the cost of the stamps. Young people under 21 paying social welfare stamps are entitled to health and dental benefits after paying stamps for six months.  When they reach 21 <Col N="245" /> years of age they must have 156 stamps before they are entitled to benefit.  This is very unfair.  I would have thought the stamps they had prior to 21 would be taken into account.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters in relation to social welfare that need to be looked into.  I do not say that everything in regard to it is rosy and that people on social welfare can live in luxury. However I take it that nobody wants to arrive at a situation where we live in luxury on social welfare, because if we arrive at that situation then we will breed a nation of layabouts and no-goods.  We must work for our rewards in life.  We were taught that from a very young age, and those of us who can must help those who cannot. That is the way I see it and that is the way I hope to bring up my children.</P>
    <P>I do not see vast poverty in this country and I thank God for it.  Many of us remember the economic war and the time when there was real poverty here.  I know there are isolated cases, but it is not the fault of the Government.  In many cases it is because of environment, heredity or lack of ability to cope with modern trends.  Assistance is available; some of those people apply for it, but others never do.  The Government are doing a very good job.  When I was a young Deputy it used to be said to me by the best of well-wishers in my constituency: &ldquo;If we voted for you, we would not get the pensions we are entitled to.  If Fianna Fáil went out of office, we would never get our pensions.&rdquo; That time has gone.  The people have now come to realise that no matter what Government are in office they will get whatever they are entitled to, no more and no less.  The day is gone when one Government and one party controlled the social welfare of this country.  If the Government changed in the morning then nobody on social welfare would be a penny worse off.  If this change of Government did nothing else it killed that bogey and I am very grateful for it.</P>
    <P>I want to end by congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary, to thank him for all his assistance in the past <Col N="246" /> and to say that unfortunately I will be bothering him again.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to say very much.  I was interested to hear Deputy Hogan O'Higgins say she spent quite a lot of time recently going around her constituency and that she could not agree with Deputy Dowling when he said he found quite a number of people on the poverty line.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is nice for the Deputy to be able to say that everything in Galway is so well fixed that nobody is on the poverty line.  Despite the fact she made the point that in cases where the pensions are proved to be inadequate there is no problem as far as recipients are concerned.  They can go to the home assistance authority or the particular health board to get their pensions augmented.  The fact that social welfare pensions need to be augmented by health board assistance establishes the charge that Deputy Dowling made that a number of people are on the poverty line.  If they were not there would be no necessity to do what Deputy Hogan O'Higgins suggested.</P>
      <P>I was interested in hearing the Deputy say, in relation to the increased charges for social welfare stamps, that one of the problems arising at present was that there was a cash advantage in being unemployed, that in some cases the unemployment benefits were such they could act as a deterrent where the people in receipt of this benefit were actually receiving more than the people who were employed.  She followed that by saying that people working were basically decent people and would not have any objection to paying the increased charges on the stamps in order to see the unemployed getting more than workers were getting. The two things did not tie in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make two points in relation to anomalies which exist in the social welfare code.  I have no experience of corresponding directly with <Col N="247" /> the Parliamentary Secretary but I was interested to hear that Deputy Hogan O'Higgins gets such favourable replies in relation to her letters to &ldquo;Dear Frank&rdquo;.  I am more of a traditionalist. I write officially to the Secretary of the Department.  The number of parliamentary questions which I put down arising out of what I feel is non-attention to my queries have been growing.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give some attention to seeing that the correspondence from Deputies who write officially to the Department rather than to &ldquo;Dear Frank&rdquo; gets similar treatment. The Deputies who write to the Secretary of the Department are entitled to that treatment.  I want to say that the position has improved as a result of complaints I made and also of raising the matter in the House. However I feel there is still room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in his speech today that there were 60 basic Acts and at least 350 regulations. I am sure he will agree that, with so many Acts and regulations, anomalies arise.  I know of a case where a lady drawing the widow's pension reaches 68 years of age this week. As well as drawing a widow's pension of £7.30 she is also drawing £7.30 blind pension.  After this week she loses her blind pension and will go over to a £7.30 old age pension only. I am not criticising the reduction in the qualifying age limit for old age pensioners but she is in the peculiar position that it would have been far better if the qualification age remained at 70 years.  She would then have enjoyed her widow's pension and her blind pension for the next two years. I am not sure if the Parliamentary Secretary can refer to this case in replying.  If he cannot I would welcome hearing from him subsequently. It is not an encouragement to old people when a woman receiving £14.60 a week in social welfare pensions has that amount cut when she reaches 68 years of age.</P>
    <P>That certainly is not a help to old people.  The regulations prevent the person from drawing a blind pension <Col N="248" /> as well as an old age pension even though she is living on her own.  I am given to understand that if a widow who has a contributory pension can show she would be worse off by taking the old age pension she is entitled to retain the widow's pension but in this case I am given to understand the person concerned has no such option. She has not applied for an old age pension, it is being forced on her.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into this case to see if the person can opt to retain her widow's pension without having to take the old age pension because with this pension she cannot continue to draw the blind pension.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>The case I have mentioned is not an isolated one.  I have had experience of two similar cases in the last 12 months and the net effect on the people concerned of having to take the old age pension has been a 50 per cent reduction in their income.  It is bad enough to be handicapped because of age but when people have the additional handicap of blindness it is a considerable hardship not to get any compensation and, in fact, to have their income cut in half.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would look at the requirement that people must spend five years in the country from the time they are 50 years of age before they are entitled to a pension.  I know of one case where a lady returned from England 12 months ago.  She lived in this country until she was 45 and she is now 68 years.  However, she will not qualify for a non-contributory old age pension until she is 72 because she must live for five years here.  She is an Irish woman who has spent most of her life here but because she has lived in this country for only one year in the last five she will not qualify for a pension.  I do not think it was the intention of the Parliamentary Secretary to deprive such people of pensions and perhaps he would consider this matter in the overall review of the social welfare code.  I gathered from him that it will take at least <Col N="249" /> 12 or 18 months to introduce a consolidated social welfare measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said there have been innovations in the social welfare system in the last few years and she included in this the provision of benefits for single women aged 68 years and over.  At present only old age pensioners can qualify for free electricity and free television licences. There are other people who consider they should qualify for these benefits and I share their view.  I am thinking of those living on their own who are in receipt of the full rate of the disabled person's maintenance allowance. Deputy Hogan O'Higgins said that pensioners who are living with other people who are working should have free television licences but I can see that there is a problem here.  At present, an old age pensioner living on his own, or living with a qualified person, has the benefit of free electricity and this worthwhile innovation has brought a considerable degree of social comfort to such people. However, I am disappointed the Parliamentary Secretary did not extend that benefit to people living on their own, even though they may not have reached the age to qualify for an old age pension.  In my constituency there are many people in receipt of disability allowances and I do not think it would cost the Exchequer very much to give them the benefit of free electricity and free TV licences. If a person of 45 years is in receipt of the full amount of disability allowances, surely it could be accepted that he would qualify as much as the old age pensioner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan O'Higgins spoke about people who left employment at 65 years but who could not get a pension until they were 70 years of age and she mentioned that the qualifying age is now 67 years.  Quite frankly, the Deputy was talking through her hat because Fianna Fáil introduced a retirement pension scheme to help these people.  However, she does not seem to have heard about it.</P>
    <P>A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies mentioned the huge increase in the cost of the social welfare stamp, both <Col N="250" /> for the employer and the employee. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to stand over his speech, where he mentioned that some of the increase of 25p from the employer and 10p from the employee is only a special and temporary increase.  I am tempted to say I heard it before, but the Parliamentary Secretary might tell me where I heard it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One would want to come from the west to fully realise the benefit these payments are to small farmers.  The small farmers have gone through such a desperate year with cattle prices that the unemployment assistance has proved a God-send to them.  They showed their appreciation in the Galway by-elections when the National Coalition increased their vote.  Were it not for the increases in assistance we would be still suffering from emigration. However it is now possible for men to remain at home, look after their small holdings and draw unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>These increases have also helped the business people.  If this money was not being paid the vast majority of the small businessmen would be put out of existence.  With the increases in October we are moving towards a better deal for west of Ireland farmers. However this does not solve the problem.  When the Minister for Social Welfare is discussing unemployment assistance with the other members of the Government he should make it clear that it is in the areas where unemployment is greatest that industries should be established.</P>
      <P>Slight delays occur in paying unemployment assistance and, in some cases, in the payment of old age contributory pensions.  This has arisen particularly as a result of EEC regulations. It takes as long as six months to finalise some cases.  This is a long time for any person to be without an allowance.</P>

      <P>I am speaking from experience.  My point is that there are not sufficient social welfare officers available to deal with these claims. Many of our social welfare and pensions officers are overworked with the result that there is great delay.</P>
      <P>I should now like to deal with a matter which occurs regularly in the west and takes up a lot of the time of the officers.  It is the question of anonymous letters which are sent to social welfare officers and to managers of employment exchanges.  As a result cases referred to in these letters are thoroughly investigated.  While the matters referred to in those letters, which are often written by jealous neighbours, are being investigated the people referred to are deprived of benefit.  Such letters should be put into the wastepaper basket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case as far as I am aware.  A direction should be given to social welfare officers and managers of employment exchanges that such letters should be put in the wastepaper basket.  These officials have told me that investigation of such complaints takes up a lot of time.</P>
      <P>The Government are to be complimented on improving the situation in regard to the means test and in reducing the age for old age pensions. This reduction will bring into benefit a big number of people.  It will not be long until the Government reduce the qualifying age to 65 years and this will bring in more people.  Every man in this country must retire at 65 and I do not see why all old age pensions should not be paid at that age.  The Government, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are doing their utmost to see that that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many homes a daughter had to stay at home to look after an aged or delicate father or mother.  The Government have seen fit to provide such a person with an allowance.  However if she lives with her brother a certain <Col N="253" /> amount of her housekeeping allowance is classified as means.  I know several such people who do not qualify or who receive a reduced allowance.  I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would investigate this matter in the near future.  Such a woman who has reached 58 years of age should definitely be entitled to a pension.  She has wasted her life because of her dedication to her father, mother or some sick person in the home.</P>
    <P>There are cases of a daughter-in-law who does everything for a sick father or mother-in-law.  Were it not for her efforts the old person would be in hospital.  In spite of that she does not get the prescribed relative's allowance because she is maintained by her husband.  The Western Health Board provide home care allowances, but they are on a smaller scale.  Such a person may have five or six young children but, for pride, she and her husband look after the old person and do everything possible for him or her in the home.  She should certainly get the allowance.</P>
    <P>At the last election in my area a respected gentleman went into various houses and stated that if the people voted for Fine Gael or Labour they would lose their pensions.  Thank God, that day is gone now.  The shilling we took off the old age pension years ago has been put aside for ever.  The Government now in power are trying to look after the under-privileged and the people in need of benefit.  During the Galway by-election campaign I met those people and they were very helpful and thankful for what was done for them.  They showed their appreciation by increasing the National Coalition vote by 2,000 in each constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not easy to analyse in the serious and responsible way in which we should, as a Parliament, analyse it because it tends to be discussed as an isolated measure without reference to much current legislation that is relevant and to the present economic situation and environment.  It goes without saying that there is universal agreement on <Col N="254" /> the principle of giving social benefits and providing social welfare for categories who need it.  It is not as simple as saying, on the one hand, that those things should be provided or, on the other hand, that it is only a matter of cost.  It is a problem that cannot be considered in isolation.  In the old days, perhaps with more antiquated views and less liberal thinking than there has been in this century, one might have seen this more in terms of black and white; but as far back and as late as the 1920s there were obviously two schools of thought on this.  At that time the Minister's party and the Parliamentary Secretary's party were at one with this party in believing in the principle that lies behind this type of legislation.  In fact, it was a significant factor in bringing about the change of Government in 1932.  On the other hand, the opposite view prevailed: that the community could not afford it.  It is a matter of orthodox financing.  A Minister of the day, and a Government of the day which happened to be the Deputy's, reduced the old age pension which was a social service.  I am not referring to this for the purpose of making a political point.  I am referring to it to make a basis for what I hope I can develop as a logical argument for an approach to this Bill both philosophically and practically. It was the Deputy who mentioned it first.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that, as far back as that but as late in liberal thinking and progressive thinking as that in the 1920s, there was a fairly clear-cut situation.  Social welfare was so minimal and so patently necessary that the progressives, the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party together, in the late 1920s made a plank of this because of the current views and the realisation of the realities of economics and finance.  We are far enough forward now to try to think objectively about these things.  The conservatives as represented by the Government of the day took the opposite view and, when it came to the question of balancing a budget or providing funds for other purposes, that Government adopted the expedient of not only not providing more for social welfare but of curtailing the allocation.</P>

      <P>With all respect to the Chair I am doing that.  If the Chair wishes I will be quite explicit and refer to the reduction by the Fine Gael Party in the old age pension by 1/- in the 1920s.  The problem today has evolved historically.  If the Chair wishes to be referred to specific enactments I will refer him to the enactments listed here: the Act of 1933, the Act of 1935, the Act of 1952, the Act of 1960, the Act of 1966, the Act of 1969, and the Act of 1970, up to the time of the present Government to whom I give full credit, but it is the Labour Party element who deserve the credit.  I will leave it to any Deputy wherever he is sitting in the House to ask what party were in power when these increased contributions were brought about.  If I am not relevant I should like to be told so.  It was not the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>I was attempting to speak objectively. I regret that I was stimulated into the approach I was adopting a few minutes ago.  I should prefer to come back to objective reality with the Parliamentary Secretary.  It will be found that over the years there was a progressive trend.  I give credit to the Labour Party.  I know their social programme was blocked in the first Coalition by the Fine Gael Party. Over the years there has been a progressive development in social welfare and in social services.  There is also the question of financing.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that we all want to give increases but there is the practical difficulty of finding the money.  There will be no dispute between us in that regard. Therefore, it becomes a question of priorities largely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time will not permit me to develop what I had intended to say before I was diverted from my purpose into making some remarks which I had not intended to make.  With respect to the Chair, I believe I was perfectly in order and within the terms of the Bill.  The big question we have to face here is not only the provision of these <Col N="256" /> benefits but how they are to be provided and how far they are benefits in real terms.  It is very difficult to discuss this Bill because one can go outside its scope in dealing with the problems of the environment which must be dealt with, to my mind, to make these benefits effectively real. I do not wish to belittle the increase in benefits.  I hope I will be reasonable in my approach to financing these benefits.  It is extremely difficult to keep within narrow terms of order in present circumstances and to deal with this Bill effectively since the economic environment has a large impact on what we are developing today.</P>
    <P>In an expanding situation or a progressive situation it is totally different. It is possible, to use a healthy and prosperous position to give increased benefits and to raise levels. It is very difficult to raise levels even for those most in need when the overall level of economic activity and employment is sinking.  I think the Chair would legitimately cavil if I proceeded to discuss that environment at too great length and when I resume the debate I will have to take account of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because for a considerable time I have been at a loss to understand the thinking of the Government who made a decision on this scheme.  I particularly do not understand the recent decision of the Minister for Local Government to suck back into local authorities and the Government a certain proportion of profits made.  The situation now is that any purchase scheme must be, in the opinion of the Minister, fair and equitable.  In such schemes there are three involvements: the tenants, the local authorities and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My problem is why, if a scheme has been considered fair and equitable at the beginning, the Minister can decide later to suck back into Government and local authority funds a certain <Col N="257" /> amount of the money made through resales.  I could understand this if gross profits were being made through speculation but any profits made in these purchase schemes must be of a very minor nature.  My party are opposed to speculation and we would always agree with any Government action to curb it.  If there was a possibility of large profits being made here we could readily understand the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>The position is however that the Minister has decided that local authority house purchasers are second-class owners with no rights.  Why did he discriminate against tenant purchasers in this way?  In the private sphere, house owners have certain rights: they can sell their houses and buy houses elsewhere.  The Minister's decision in regard to tenant purchase however has created an inferior type of house owner.  A tenant becomes the owner of his house the day he completes the necessary documents in a lawyer's office.  The position now in regard to such a person is that if he sells the house of which he has become owner within three to five years he must pay back one-third of the profits he makes on that sale.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister in his private capacity would accept such a situation.  Once the tenant purchases his house it becomes a private dwelling. The Minister knows that a house, unlike a car, appreciates instead of depreciating in value.  When the scheme was being drawn up the Minister must have been aware that houses purchased under it would increase in value.  If he is to be logical, why should not all sales of local authority property attract the same limits? Land also increases in value, so why does not the Minister insist that the local authority get back money from profits made on industrial sites sold by them?</P>
    <P>As I have said, tenant purchasers have been put in an inferior position. A person who buys and develops an industrial site owned by a local authority has not to pay back anything although he might make enormous profits.  Is it not true therefore that tenant purchasers are being victimised? <Col N="258" /> The Minister acknowledged the case made by Deputy Lemass that many tenant purchasers resell their houses to meet family requirements. The family may have grown and they may need more accommodation, so they sell their houses to buy bigger ones.  They may want to sell their houses to buy one elsewhere for employment reasons or to be nearer to schools and so forth.  One could name a variety of reasons why a tenant purchaser might wish to move.</P>
    <P>The position here is that honest tenant purchasers are being victimised. When this regulation came before us in Dublin Corporation the broad opinion of all parties was that there were unfair aspects in it.  I put it to the Minister that he should consider the situation of tenants who have occupied their houses for up to 30 years and in that time have paid substantial amounts in rent to the local authorities.  It may be argued that the tenants were provided with a variety of services during that period but such costs have been repaid many times. Tenant purchasers are people struggling for the first time to get a stake in the community through house ownership, and to turn them into second-class owners with inferior rights is very wrong.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister will have another look at the situation in the light of experience after a period of six to 12 months.  If he feels an injustice has been done then he should rectify the situation.  It is a reflection on the people who have purchased from the corporation and who endeavoured to better their accommodation for the reasons I have given already, proximity to employment, size of family or other family circumstances of one type or another.</P>
    <P>The question of snob value was raised today.  I am not concerned about that.  I am concerned about the basic rights of an individual to purchase a house.  If a fair and equitable system was operated, then there should be no real adjustment.  I do not think the amount of speculation is great, if in fact it takes place at all. People have sold houses; they will sell them again.  No matter what type <Col N="259" /> of house a person purchases, he will probably sell for profit.  Some people always have that desire to make a profit.  Nevertheless, the number of people involved must be very small in relation to the large amount of speculation which takes place through the purchase of local authority property which costs far more than any corporation dwelling.</P>
    <P>In view of the representations made from time to time, in view of the concern expressed by local authority members of all parties, I hope the Minister will give us an assurance and say he will have this examined to ascertain whether or not the arguments made are valid.  Seeing that it is operative I do not think the Minister would be prepared to dismiss it lightly. But it would be reasonable were he prepared to say at this stage: &ldquo;I am prepared to examine it to see if there is any reason for reverting to the previous situation and give local authority dwelling purchasers the same rights as people purchasing on the outside market.&rdquo;  I know that if I were confronted with this situation with regard to a house in the private sector, certainly I would not accept the stipulation whereby restrictions of that nature would apply.</P>
    <P>The Minister must have been aware when this purchase scheme was initiated that at some stage in the future the property would increase in value. I am rather surprised that, at a later stage, he found it necessary to introduce the system he did.  If this is accepted many councillors and members of local authorities feel that other restrictions may follow in time, that as credit restrictions are brought into force, some other system will be introduced to deprive local authority householders of the opportunity of selling. Some people who indicated their intention to purchase have now intimated that they are no longer interested because of the restrictions placed on them and they are prepared to rent accommodation.  That is an unhealthy situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not agree with speculation of any kind.  But if the <Col N="260" /> Minister is to tackle the situation he should do so on the broad basis that everything a local authority says is sold for profit within three or five years, would apply to tenants also. It does not apply in the field of industrial or housing sites or indeed to other property local authorities may dispose of from time to time.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to review the situation, taking into consideration the representations of councillors and experience of its operation for six or 12 months, as the case may be. If he feels then it is not justified he should rectify the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of two or three minutes I hope to add to what Deputy Dowling has said in regard to this matter.  As I see it, there are two points at issue.  One refers to the injustice which has arisen in respect of purchasers whom we might describe as post-1973 and where it can be shown now that tenants who purchased houses under the pre-1973 scheme&mdash;had they waited, had they not accepted the advice of the corporation or of the Department of Local Government&mdash;could have purchased them, in some cases, for anything up to £1,000 cheaper.  An appeal has been made to the Minister to bear in mind the plight of those purchasers in his magnanimity, and I am quite sure he can be as magnanimous as any other Minister.  It is not suggested that he would return to them an amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister will refer to his reply he will see that he referred back to answers he gave and I am taking the lead from his reply today.  However, it was not a matter to which I intended devoting my five minutes.  I was availing of the opportunity to remind the Minister that he had promised already that he would look sympathetically at the plight of those purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full lash of my disappointment with the Minister is the rather mean, regressive and obnoxious direction which he sent to local authorities last year instructing them that, in respect of <Col N="261" /> any future purchase scheme they might introduce, they would include a condition under which anybody who purchased a house under the scheme, and sold it within five years, would return to the local authority an amount equivalent to one-third of the profit involved. In late 1974 and early 1975, that represents retrogression of the worst type.  For many years the people fought for the right of ownership of land and houses.  The Minister and his Department are presuming to sell to tenants, some of whom have been tenants for 30 years, and not, as has been reported in certain areas, people who bought a house today from the local authority, sold it tomorrow and made £1,500.  They were paying heavy rents on those houses over a period of perhaps 30 years and if they made profit, more power to them.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dowling indicated, other people are making profit at what might be described as the expense of local authorities.  As far as I am concerned it is fundamental that if we sell houses to tenants, those tenants have the right to sell.  As a member of a local authority&mdash;and I am glad other members agree with me&mdash;I will not be a party to putting any impediment on the sale of those houses.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to explain how any man describing himself as a socialist would require a tenant to do that. It is retrogressive and, I would think, repugnant to the Constitution.  I doubt very much if it would stand up in any court.  I am asking the Minister now to do the big thing, withdraw the mean circular to local authorities and which has been rejected by practically all of them.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Lemass's only object is to try to prevent me from answering this stupid argument that was made here tonight, then he will not succeed.  Deputy Dowling raised this question on the Adjournment about the amount of money which is to be taken from people who purchase houses and who resell them within five years.  He alleged that this was something that was thought up <Col N="263" /> after the scheme had been introduced. Of course, if he knew anything about the procedure he would know that the order was made and it was laid before this House for 21 days.  He and his colleagues had the opportunity, if they objected to it, to have it rescinded. They did not think it worth their while and they sailed in on a question of Deputy Lemass's in order to try to ask embarrassing questions.</P>
      <P>I was interested to find Deputy Tunney coming here tonight, because I thought he was going to put the facts straight and that he would show that a mistake had been made by his party and that he wanted to explain. In fact, on 16th April, 1973, the National Association of Tenant Organisations assured me that they favoured a restriction against the resale by a tenant purchaser for an agreed negotiated period and the control of the resale market through a stipulation that the profit on resale would be restricted to covering the costs of the transaction and other expenses incurred.  Those were the views of the tenants' representatives who negotiated the agreement with me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That was on 19th April, 1973.  A deputation then came to me from the City Commissioners.  Deputy Tunney and Deputy Dowling are two of the people who were reinstated as city commissioners by me on 1st May, 1973.  They met and transacted the business as the corporation were doing.  During the transaction of the <Col N="264" /> business, when this scheme was being introduced, the commissioners decided unanimously that it would be a good idea to make representations on certain points.  Therefore, a deputation was sent to meet me on it.  When they came to meet me, Deputy Moore and Deputy Tunney were two of the people who were representing the commissioners, and I am sure they were speaking for Deputy Dowling and Deputy Lemass.  What they wanted me to put into the terms was a stipulation that there should be a restriction on the resale of the houses over a limited period so that there could not be excessive profits made by people who would buy their houses and then move out.</P>

      <P>If the Deputies opposite want to carry on like corner boys and <Col N="265" /> if the Chair allows them, they can do so, but they will hear the truth from me.  Deputy Tunney and Deputy Moore were representing the Fianna Fáil voice on that deputation, and one of the points the deputation stressed was that they wanted a restriction, and Deputy Tunney did not tell them he did not want that point of view put.  He sat there agreeing that they were putting the point of view he held. Do not try to wangle out of that here in this House.</P>

      <P>I am not taking things out of the air.  The minutes of the meeting can be obtained by Deputy Tunney or anybody else.  I am stating here what actually happened.  I agreed with them that it would be unfair that people should purchase their houses and make a quick profit, and I put a restriction of five years, when one-third of the profit they would make would be handed back to the corporation.  When Fianna Fáil were passing a Housing Bill through this House in 1966 they put in section 89 of that Bill a requirement that in the case of a labourer purchasing a cottage and selling it, one-third of the entire price would have to be paid back to the local authority concerned. They have the hard neck then to send representatives in here tonight to criticise me for something which they themselves asked for, and when it was given they were unable to swallow it.</P>
