      <P>I appreciate that, but may I also suggest that experience of the ruling of the Chair over the years suggests that the interpretation of what does or does not impose a charge on the people is somewhat wider than might appear on its face and that amendments are allowed, for instance, in regard to Finance Bills which on their face do impose charges?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 20, after line 32, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Provide that where the person making the disposal referred to in subsection (2) is not the original beneficial owner but has acquired the policy of assurance, or contract for a deferred annuity solely for the benefit of the dependants of such original beneficial owner, no charged capital gains tax shall arise on such disposal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister was not given the opportunity of taking land bonds out, but that is the way it is. This amendment deals with a matter which was raised on the Committee Stage and in respect of which the Minister indicated that he was prepared to consider carefully the points raised.  The Minister may recall that I drew his attention to a letter which had been received by a Deputy on this side of the House, and the Minister said that he had received a similar communication, which raised a point that required to be clarified.  Perhaps the best thing I could do would be to refer to the Committee Stage debate on 21st May, 1975 as reported at column 296 when I quoted from the letter in question as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As may be appreciated, when arranging life insurance on two partners who have families, it was normal up to now to arrange life policies on the individual partner's lives and then crossassign both policies.  For example, Partner A might take out a <Col N="458" /> £20,000 life policy on himself and assign his policy to Partner B, and <i>vice versa</i>.  In the event of the death of Partner A, the experts deem that the funds are in the right hands, namely, in the hands of the surviving partner who can either buy out the deceased partner's widow or purchase an annuity for her.</P>
    <P>My question is&mdash;am I correct in reading that the partner making the disposal is not the original beneficial owner in the above arrangement and that the proceeds of the policy would be subject to capital gains tax under this Bill, even though the proceeds might be entirely for the benefit of the widow and children.</P>
    <P>In the case of policies taken out after this Bill becomes law there is no difficulty as matters can be rearranged until the law is given another twist.  But in the case of existing arrangements, if I am reading the above section properly, this tax would be absolutely vicious.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could throw some light on that?</P>
    <P>Mr. R. Ryan: Something similar was received by the Minister and I have had the matter considered by the Revenue Commissioners, and I may say that generally speaking genuine arrangements such as that which is spoken of there are not intended to be caught.  I certainly would very carefully consider the position because I would not consider it desirable that such an arrangement should be caught. However, at this stage I would not want to be specific as to whether it is exempted as it stands but I will certainly look at it between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not in fact introduce an amendment dealing with this point so far as I can see and therefore I have put down an amendment which may not be perfect but which is designed to do something on the lines suggested by way of giving relief in the kind of circumstances outlined in the letter I quoted.  My primary purpose <Col N="459" /> in putting down the amendment was to give the Minister an opportunity of clarifying the position.  I assumed from the fact that the Minister has no amendment down and from what he said on the Committee Stage that he did not intend that genuine cases would be caught.  The Minister is now in a position to spell out clearly that such cases would not be caught under the section as it stands. If the Minister can give us any assurance that he does not think any problem arises I will be glad to hear it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to be able to tell the Deputy that I can give him the assurance he seeks.  His amendment meant something different to me from the situation he is endeavouring to cover.  Where there is cross-assignment between partners under a joint policy it would invariably be done without consideration of money or money's worth.  Accordingly the policy's proceeds would be exempt from capital gains tax by virtue of subsection (2) of section 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it is not done usually in consideration for money.  It is done in consideration for money's worth having regard to the fact that two people are concerned. They are partners and each would have a specific interest in the policy on the life of the other.  It would save the widow and children of the deceased partner considerable expense. Might it not be held that there was money's worth by way of consideration of assignment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. There would be no actual consideration of money's worth passing in order to acquire benefit.  The right or interest would be acquired.  That is the acid test&mdash;whether the person who obtains the benefit at the time of obtaining it pays a consideration for it or pays a consideration in order to obtain at some future date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 22, after line 42, to add:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) a dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house which is, or has been provided fully at his own expense for the benefit of a dependent relative of his.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister may recall that I drew his attention to the fact that when we were discussing this matter on the Committee Stage I understood that there was a provision in the British legislation on capital gains tax whereby when a residence is provided free by a taxpayer for a dependent relative it is added to the special relief in addition to the principal residence. I referred the Minister to that provision and suggested that this might commend itself to him.  I quote from column 371 of Volume 281 of 21st May, 1975, where the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>With regard to the dependent relative, I would be prepared to examine that point further.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, the number of such cases would be quite few and the number of cases where capital gains would be made on the disposal of a residence for a dependent relative would be even fewer because in that case the disposal would be by the person who owned the asset.  In most cases a person would not dispose of an asset made available for a dependent relative unless that relative moved into an institution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few other points, but when I asked the Minister to have a look at it the Minister agreed.  There is no amendment from the Minister to deal with this point now.  Consequently I put down amendment No. 20.  I am aware of the fact that the exceptions of this amendment would probably involve some further drafting in the section but I did not feel it incumbent on me to make the necessary consequential redraft that would arise but merely put down the amendment dealing with the specific point at issue in order to ask the <Col N="461" /> Minister why he has not put down an amendment of that kind himself having regard to the fact that he indicated on the Committee Stage that he would consider it further.  I got the impression from what the Minister said that he would consider this point favourably.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the number of cases involved would be small but the principle involved would be consonant with the exemption in the section in respect of the principal private residence.  It is sought here to provide a similar exemption in respect of a residence which was provided free of charge by the taxpayer for a dependent relative.  There is a strong case for that.  I believe that the case for it has been accepted in the British legislation.  I would think therefore that the Minister ought to make provision for a case of this kind which would not contravene the principle of the section and which would acknowledge the special position arising where the taxpayer provides at his own expense a residence for a dependent relative.  I would therefore urge the Minister to accept the amendment knowing that acceptance of it will require some consequential amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy accepts that the usual practice in this country is for a dependent relative to live with the person on whom he or she may be dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> That is not the one that is encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the usual practice.  I cannot see that there is anything wrong with it.  It is regrettable that the trend in modern society here and indeed elsewhere may well be towards expelling dependent relatives either into institutional care or into other homes.  It is a natural duty and in many cases a natural desire that families should live together.  The reality in Ireland is that in most cases dependent relatives live with the people on whom they are dependent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In England, which is a much more divisive society, the stresses and <Col N="462" /> strains of the urban environment are quite different from here.  Family units are handled differently.  Of course, in England there is a very large number of dependent relatives of a class we have not got here.  They are divorced women or separated women in respect of whom the original husband is required to provide a home.  The English law specifically refers to such cases and &ldquo;dependent relatives&rdquo; include a person living apart from her husband or a person who is a single woman in consequence of dissolution or annulment of marriage.  If we were to allow this exemption which would apply to comparatively few people in normal circumstances we would be opening the avenue to a very convenient way of avoidance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister elaborate a little on the avoidance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that it would be comparatively easy for people to establish a dependency for relations and to establish them in separate homes and thereby make a profit whenever the other home had been disposed of.  If somebody decides out of the goodness of his or her heart to provide a home for a dependent relative and ultimately makes a gain there is no loss whatsoever to the person who provides the second home for the dependent relative, on the sale.  There would be no erosion of the original capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> He should be encouraged, not discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would still be 74 per cent of any gain left as complete profit and there certainly is no discouragement in allowing people to make such a profit.  The introduction of capital gains tax here, I am quite certain, will not dissuade people who have a natural sense of their own duty from providing alternative homes if they feel the circumstances warrant it, and it certainly will not discourage people who have a natural inclination to look after dependent relatives from doing so, merely because on the death of the relative followed <Col N="463" /> by the sale of the house they may have to pay 26 per cent of the gain made during the ownership of the house.</P>
      <P>It may not be realised that to make the alternative home an exempted property means that a loss on the exempted home will not be available. The gain will not be taxable but then any loss will not be available. ture of this country the exemptions in this Bill, which are very generous by international standards, are adequate and it is not necessary to provide for the comparatively rare cases which this amendment would seek to cater for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle behind the amendment is a good principle.  It is in line with the Christian outlook that there should be a sense of responsibility and compassion in certain circumstances.  I do not think the circumstances are likely to arise very often.</P>
      <P>The Minister seems to be obsessed with the idea that people will use an amendment of this kind in order to evade liability.  If that tendency is so strong in our society the Minister ought to be able to make the provision that it would be at the discretion of the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I know of a case where some years ago an individual who was able to afford it provided a home free-of-charge and handed it over to the widow of a nephew who had died suddenly.  The position of this lady was that because of her deceased husband's occupation she had to leave the home in which they had lived.  In a case of that kind all sorts of complications would arise under the Minister's three tax Bills.  The person would be caught under the gift tax provisions or, if he kept the house and did not give it to his nephew's widow he would come under wealth tax if he were wealthy enough, and he would come in under capital gains tax if the dependent eventually died and he sold the property.</P>
      <P>I can see the Minister's point that people may study the Bill to discover how they can get around the regulations, but what Deputy Colley is talk</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that in the social strucing <Col N="464" /> about is fairly exceptional.  It is not always practical to do as the Minister has suggested ought to be done in Irish society, that dependent relatives should be kept at home.  It does not always work out.  If there are circumstances, and they would be exceptional, where an individual is willing to provide a dower residence the Minister ought to make some provision for it even, as I suggested, if it is to be at the discretion of the Commissioners so as to avoid the problem the Minister is worried about that a provision like this would be used in order to escape capital gains tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Committee Stage of the Bill would not have got as easy a passage if we had thought that the Report Stage would turn out like this.  There were many occasions during Committee Stage where the Minister undertook to make a genuine effort to accept some of our amendments.  It is quite obvious that he has no intention of doing anything about the promise given on that occasion.  I doubt if the Minister has studied the Committee Stage debate in depth, or the promises he made.  As Deputy Colley has pointed out&mdash;and has read an extract from the debate on Committee Stage to prove it&mdash;the Minister was sympathetic and indicated that he would have a look at some of the suggestions, not alone in regard to this matter but in regard to several amendments that Deputy Colley had put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would have a look at this and deal sympathetically with the matter.  Actually he has completely overlooked the whole issue. We would have challenged him to a division on the Committee Stage were it not for the undertakings given by the Minister.  He is now refusing to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  When the White Paper was published it was the Minister's intention to tax the private home and he would have done that were it not for the opposition put up by Deputy Colley to this punitive approach on the part of the Minister. The day the White Paper was issued Deputy Colley pointed out in no uncertain fashion the injustice of <Col N="465" /> what the Minister was proposing and the Minister had to change his approach.</P>
    <P>In this amendment we are looking for something quite modest.  The Minister says that it is desirable that fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law should live with their married sons or daughters.  The Minister must know very little of what goes on if he thinks that is desirable.  He must know very little about the problems that can exist between mothers-in-law and sons' wives.  It is highly desirable to provide alternative living accommodation for parents.  The situation can be quite impossible if the grandparents occupy the same dwelling as the sons or daughters and their children.  The Minister will not convince me of the desirability of his suggestion.  He will convince very few that his suggestion is a good one.  The Minister has moved away from reality since he started discussing capital taxation.  I do not think he is living in this world any longer.  Ask anyone what he or she thinks about the Minister's suggestion and 99 per cent will tell him it is unworkable. The old people want their independence and they want separate accommodation. I have a recollection of a scheme whereby, when a farm was transferred to a son, a house was built on the farm for the parents.  This was approved of by the NFA.  The transfer of the farm and the provision of separate accommodation for the parents enabled the son to get married and settle down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's demand is a very modest one.  I do not think there could possibly be any abuse.  I can certainly see no tax avoidance in this. The Revenue Commissioners will be easily able to establish the purpose for which the house is provided.  A very small section might try to capitalise on this kind of thing but, in closing any possible loophole, we will punish the average decent person.  I am more concerned about him.  A house and one acre of land will be exempt and surely it should be possible on that one acre to build a small dwelling for the parents.  This would enable them to live in the family environment, <Col N="466" /> visiting their sons or daughters and their grandchildren and having these visit them in return. That would be the ideal situation. Apparently the Minister does not think so.  I do not take the same view as the Minister.  I believe very few people take the Minister's view.</P>
    <P>I am not worried about the man sitting down in an office devising ways and means of getting around this particular provision but I am worried about the genuine case.  I agree that people should not be allowed to take advantage of a situation and the speculator must be prevented from speculating. I fully agree with Deputy Colley's amendment.  I cannot see any possibility of tax avoidance in it.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment. Deputy Colley has pointed out that the number of cases involved would be very, very few.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by Deputy Colley, Deputy Brugha and Deputy Fitzpatrick, and I challenge the Minister as to the desirability of having a mother-in-law or a father-in-law living under the same roof as a married son or daughter.  In certain oriental countries for social and economic reasons peculiar to those countries it is the custom to have fathers-in-law and mothers-in-law living under the same roof as sonsin-law or daughters-in-law.  One of the reasons for late marriages here has been the reluctance of the intended wife to live under the same roof as the mother-in-law.  The solution to that problem&mdash;there is proof available&mdash;is the building of a small house proximate to the original home, thereby enabling each family to retain its independence. Because of that and other reasons, the incidence of late marriages and the number of bachelors in rural Ireland have diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzpatrick put it to the Minister, he is a family man himself and perhaps he is different from the rest.  Surely he is not making the case that his wife would be happier living with her mother- and father-in-law. If that is the only case he is offering for refusing to accept the amendment, then one must question his case, because, as I see it, it is no case at all. <Col N="467" /> I am not concerned solely about the position in rural Ireland, because this can apply in cities as well.  It can happen that the family house might not have sufficient space to build an additional small house for the parents.  I can visualise other reasons why a small house should be built.  Unfortunately there are occasions of ill-health when either parent might be better off living in separate quarters.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say glibly that he thinks it is better socially for the two families to live together but, if so, he should substantiate his case.  I would not want him to point a finger at this side of the House and say we are suggesting that the position of our senior citizens should be reduced by being evicted from the house in which they have lived all their lives.  We are not doing that.  Nor would I like him to suggest that we are relegating elderly people to an inferior position.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are familiar with the manner in which elderly people operate, know that they are not happy living, not alone with a new wife, but later on with young children. They are very fearful of the accidents which may happen to these children. One may marvel at presents who, when they are young, probably reared eight or ten children with the natural material and paternal feelings, but they are fearful of even minor accidents which may befall their grandchildren.</P>
    <P>My reason for contributing at this stage is in the hope that the Minister will give us some indication of the reasons for not accepting the amendment. What facts has he to prove that two families will live more happily under one roof?</P>

      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers.  Many years ago our ex-President, Mr. Eamon de Valera, suggested, when there were so many late marriages that this <Col N="468" /> would be the ideal set up.  If the people could afford it, they could build a small house for either the newly weds or the parents.  We all know, particularly in early marriages, that no young girl wants to share her livingroom or kitchen with another woman.  Both women have different ways of doing things, and they will not agree.  This problem is arising all over the country.</P>
      <P>If the second house is built, both will be close enough for company and to help each other, while still maintaining their privacy.  It has been proved that the lack of a second house was the cause of many late marriages.  The mother ruled the roost and the son was afraid that if he brought his wife into the house, the two women would not agree.  If he did move in with his parents, when a difference arose he had to make a decision where his loyalties lay.  The son and his wife could move into the newly built house.  Nobody is suggesting that the parents should be put out of the family home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt in my mind that the Minister has become totally obsessed with the most remote possibility of avoidance.  In order to get over what he thinks is a possibility of avoidance, he does not <Col N="469" /> care how many genuine cases he tramples on.  He has demonstrated this time after time when dealing with our amendments.  If he can think of one very ingenious method whereby the proposed amendment could be used for avoidance purposes&mdash;it does not matter how many genuine cases will suffer hardship&mdash;he will ignore that in order, as he thinks, to prevent that avoidance.  Of course, that kind of an obsession produces a situation which is full of loopholes.  That is what the Minister is doing here, as he will discover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy describe what hardship he is alleging? What hardship can there be if a person has sufficient capital to buy two houses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context in which I was speaking I spoke of a number of the amendments we put forward in which we demonstrated the hardship being caused and the Minister did not care because, he said, there could be some avoidance.  I am speaking of his general attitude and obsession.</P>
      <P>I want to go a little further.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was perfectly right in what he said.  Reluctantly I have been coming to the same conclusion as Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I tried to avoid it but I cannot avoid it any longer.  When we discussed the Committee Stage of this Bill we raised many valid points, many points of value.  The Minister has acknowledged that in a number of his amendments.  We also raised quite a number of points the Minister has not acknowledged in his amendments. We put down amendments ourselves to deal with these matters which were drawn to his attention on Committee Stage and in all cases he indicated if not considerable sympathy with the point at least a willingness to consider it.  This amendment is no exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not suggesting that there was an obligation on the Minister in every such case to bring in an amendment. That would be unreasonable.  I am suggesting that, when one finds time after time that these points which the Minister indicated on Committee Stage would receive serious and sympathetic <Col N="470" /> consideration are now being thrown out, it is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid the impression that the Minister, in order to get Committee Stage through, indicated that he was prepared to give serious consideration to these points and, on his performance since, he was not prepared to give serious consideration to them and did not do so.  He is now trotting out the same arguments he used before and followed by saying he was prepared to give them serious consideration.  Clearly he has given no consideration to them if he is still relying on the same arguments at the conclusion of which on Committee Stage he said he was prepared to give consideration.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister now that, on behalf of this party, I agreed to a programme for the completion by this House of the Report and other Stages of the Capital Gains Tax Bill without having available to me the Minister's amendments, and in the belief that the Minister would be acting <i>bona fide</i> on this matter.  I now have the gravest doubts as to whether the Minister is acting <i>bona fide</i>.  If I had known, and if Deputies on this side of the House had known, that the Minister would adopt the attitude he is now adopting, we would not have agreed to that programme of completion.  We acted in good faith, and I do not think our good faith is being matched on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>In relation to this amendment the Minister agreed on Committee Stage that the number of cases involved would be small.  Now he says he cannot consider it because every grandaunt in the country would find herself being given a house which was the second house of a taxpayer, in order to avoid capital gains tax.  Is the Minister really serious?  Has he considered the reality of the situation?  In the amendment the relative has to be dependent and the house has to be provided totally at the expense of the taxpayer concerned.  Of course it is kept in the family while the dependent relative is alive.  All of us have to die some time.</P>
    <P>If a house is provided for one of <Col N="471" /> the surviving parents who is totally dependent on the taxpayer, at the expense of the taxpayer, and eventually the parent dies, what does the Minister say should be done?  Is he saying he should not sell the house and that that is an indication that he is trying to get in as a quick speculator and get a capital gain?  Will the Minister come down to earth instead of trying out these silly arguments on us all the time?  Let us relate this discussion to reality and not to some abstruse schemes which the Minister thinks somebody might produce to avoid liability for capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>It has been found possible under capital gains tax legislation in Britain to give this relief.  On Committee Stage the Minister indicated that he would consider it favourably and that there were only a small number of cases in which it could arise.  He comes in here today and insults our intelligence with the kind of argument he puts forward against it, an argument which he could not possibly sustain, and a suggestion that by refusing to accept the amendment he is standing up for Christian virtues.  Has he any awareness of the requirements of the community in the cities or in the rural areas as Deputy Tunney said?</P>
    <P>Is he aware of the very considerable sociological and economic advantages which are seen to be attached in rural areas to the provision of a small dower house for the parents of young married farmers?  Do I have to spell all that out for him?  Is he totally unaware of it?  Is he suggesting that where such is provided and the parents eventually die, the house should be left to rot until the son and his wife eventually become old enough to transfer to it and their children take over the farm?  What has the Minister in mind in the argument he puts forward on this?</P>
    <P>There is virtually nothing involved in this for the Exchequer.  There is a good case for the amendment in equity and from a sociological point of view.  Its rejection in the way it was <Col N="472" /> rejected by the Minister for the reasons given can only suggest to us that the Minister's approach in this whole matter is not <i>bona fide</i> but one of simply trying to get the Bill through and not really giving a damn what kind of a Bill it is.  He must admit&mdash; and on the record it is clear&mdash;that in so far as this Bill is in any way tolerable it is because of the work done on this side of the House to improve it.  It could be improved a great deal more if the Minister would act in a reasonable, rational way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting he should accept every single amendment we put forward.  I am suggesting that his attitude to this and other amendments suggests, whatever he may say, that he has not done his homework because he did not have a chance to do it.  I am not blaming him for that.  I am saying he did not have a chance to do it.  He is simply following the brief he was given and not listening to the arguments put forward.  This is a totally unsatisfactory position so far as we are concerned.  We would not have agreed to the programme for completing this Bill if we had thought the Minister would act in this way. However, we have agreed to it and we will abide by our agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear to the Minister that, in the short term, he may think he is gaining by getting this Bill through as a result of this kind of approach, and that there is some advantage to him in doing so, but there is not.  If he produces a Bill full of anomalies which were drawn to his attention and which he refused to remedy, then the longer term consequences will rest on the shoulders of the Minister, not on those of us on this side of the House who did their best to make this a better Bill. The rejection by the Minister of this small, simple amendment, for which there is a very good case, is symptomatic of the approach he has adopted which, to say the least, is regrettable.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 24, lines 46 and 50, to delete &ldquo;partly&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As further evidence of my willingness to accept all reasonable points raised by the Opposition I have prepared this amendment.  Deputy O'Malley was concerned that the words &ldquo;or partly&rdquo; would negative the exemption in section 25 because most people contemplated the possibility of making a gain at some time or other on the disposal of the property and thus the purchase could be said to be partly for the purpose of realising a gain.  The amendment specifies that the acquisition of a <Col N="475" /> private residence or the incurring of expenditure thereon would have to be made wholly or mainly for the purpose of realising a gain before subsection (10) could operate to exclude the house from relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment follows on the fact that we drew the Minister's attention to the fact that the Bill as drafted could take away the exemption in respect of the principal private dwellinghouse in many cases.  That case was unanswerable, and I do not think the Minister had much alternative but to introduce this amendment.  To the extent that he has introduced it we welcome it, but that is not the end of the matter.  The subsection which the Minister is proposing to amend has two parts.  The first part provides that the exemption in respect of the principal private dwellinghouse will be forfeited if the house was purchased wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal of it.  The Minister proposes to amend that so that it will be wholly or mainly for the purpose of realising a gain.</P>
      <P>The second part of the subsection says that the benefit of the exemption in respect of a private residence shall not apply in relation to a gain so far as the gain is attributable to any expenditure which was incurred after the beginning of the period of ownership and was incurred wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain from the disposal.  The position is that many people, including those in small houses, have added on a back kitchen or a bedroom because their family was growing.  The second part of this subsection provides that if they do that then in so far as they make any gain eventually when they dispose of the house attributable to that improvement or extension&mdash;of course portion of the gain would be attributable to that improvement or that extension&mdash;they will be taxed on that gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was considerable discussion on this point on Committee Stage, and the fact that the Minister has introduced this amendment is an <Col N="476" /> acknowledgment by him that the use of the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; means precisely what I have said, that expenditure on the improvement of the house which results in a gain on the disposal will be subject to capital gains tax.  If the first portion of the subsection should be amended by the substitution of &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; for &ldquo;partly&rdquo;, as indeed it should be, the second portion should be amended and the word &ldquo;partly&rdquo; in line 50 should also be changed to &ldquo;mainly&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My notes on the Minister's amendments were based on the list of amendments I got from the General Office.  I see that the second list is different.  I accept that the final version does include line 50 and, therefore, the point I was making is met.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide that the exemption in respect of a private dwellinghouse would now apply unless either the premises were acquired or improvements were made to the premises wholly or mainly for the purpose of realising a gain.  That is as it should be.  For that reason we do not oppose this amendment.</P>

We have had plenty of experience in this city of the situation where a person acquires a house and does some things to it with a view to disposal at a gain.

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 25, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;consideration for the disposal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The exemption proposal in this section relates to the disposal of a business or farm on retirement and subject to the conditions in the section the exemption is that where the consideration does not exceed £50,000 there will be no capital gains tax chargeable on the <Col N="478" /> gain accruing.  That is what the section provides.  The amendment is designed to have the exemption related not to the consideration but to the actual gain made.  I made this point clear on the Committee Stage but I want to make it clear again lest there should be any misunderstanding or misdirection of effort in arguing about what I consider to be irrelevant.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the fact that acceptance of this amendment would entail the alteration of the amount of the exemption.  In other words it would entail the alteration of the figure of £50,000.  I am not proposing that the exemptions in this case should relate to a gain of £50,000 but, as I have indicated before, the fixing of thresholds depends on information being available which is not available to this side of the House and is probably available only to the Revenue Commissioners to enable them to fix the correct amount that would be involved.  I want to make that perfectly clear.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with here is the principle involved of giving the exemption in relation to the gain at a particular threshold which the Minister, advised by the Revenue Commissioners, would fix.  Subject to that, the position as I see it is this: relating the exemption to consideration rather than gain first produces various anomalies and secondly leaves the amount of exemption totally outside the control of the Minister or the legislature. If you fix the exemption in relation to the gain then you are controlling the kind of exemption you give.</P>
    <P>An example which I gave before and will now give again will perhaps illustrate the problems which arise if one does not accept an amendment on these lines.  As the Bill stands a person could buy a farm for £10,000 and sell it for £45,000.  The gain he would make would be £35,000 but under the Bill he would pay no capital gains tax. On the other hand a person could buy a farm for £45,000 and sell it for £55,000 making a gain of £10,000 but he would have to pay capital gains tax on £10,000.  There is a situation in one case where a gain of £35,000 would be free of capital gains tax <Col N="479" /> while £10,000 in the other situation would be subject to that tax.  That anomaly should be sufficient to illustrate the wrong approach to the way the exemption is given under this section. It is related to the consideration. There is a necessary connection between the consideration in a transaction and the gain made.  There is no reason why a high consideration or a low consideration should yield a high or a low gain.  It all depends on the circumstances of the transaction. It is supposed to be a capital gains tax&mdash;a tax on gains.  If it is, the exemptions that are proposed should be related to the gains and not to the consideration which is irrelevant to the gain.</P>
    <P>The only plausible reason that the Minister can advance in favour of the approach of using consideration is an administrative reason.  However, I should point out that the Minister in section 16 (1) accepted the principle I am putting forward.  That section reads:</P>
    <P>An individual shall not be chargeable to capital gains tax for a year of assessment if the amount on which he is chargeable to capital gains tax under section 5 (1) for that year does not exceed £500.</P>
    <P>In other words the exemption in that case is related to the amount on which he is chargeable, that is, the gain.  In section 16 the gain is accepted as the criterion.  In section 26 the gain is not accepted but the consideration is accepted.</P>
    <P>The arguments in relation to difficulties of administration, whatever validity they may have&mdash;and I do not think they have much&mdash;in relation to section 17 do not apply in relation to this section.  First of all, we are dealing here with the disposal of a business or farm on retirement.  Of necessity, if there were no capital gains tax legislation, there has to be an official record of such a transaction.  In the case of a farm there is the record in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds as the case may be&mdash;and normally it is the Land Registry&mdash;and within the process of stamping and registering that deed particulars are delivered to the <Col N="480" /> Revenue Commissioners of the transaction. This is normal practice for years past.  It will continue.  It is not a question of the Revenue Commissioners having to get details of a transaction which normally they could ignore nor is it a case of the taxpayer having to provide details in respect of transactions which normally he would not have to give details about at all.</P>
    <P>The Minister has argued that if the consideration in a case of this kind does not exceed £50,000 the Revenue Commissioners can ignore the case and not involve themselves in the details of what the original acquisition price was or what the gain was.  I want to suggest that that simply is not so, and that if one operates on the basis of the section what would normally happen would be that the Revenue Commissioners on seeing in relation to the transaction that the consideration did not exceed £50,000 if they had no reason to be suspicious would not examine the matter further.  That is true.  If they had any reason to be suspicious they would have to examine the matter further.  They would have to ensure that there was no defrauding of the Revenue and they would have to engage in spot checks in cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that instead of consideration we would have a figure in for gain, what would the Revenue Commissioners do?  I suggest that they would do precisely the same thing. Where the returns show that the gain was below the threshold unless they had reason for suspicion they would not normally pursue it further, but they would have to engage in spot checks just as they would in other cases.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the amount of administration involved whether the figure in this section is in respect of gain or consideration is virtually the same.  There is one other aspect of the administration that the Minister was inclined to argue would present difficulties and additional work. Presumably he meant the additional would be very substantial if the logic of what we are proposing here is so strong.  I presume the Minister would not resist it unless he thought there was a great deal of work involved for the Revenue Commissioners in doing <Col N="481" /> it.  That refers to the area of administration which the Minister sees as follows: if you want to find out what the gain is you must know the consideration and the original acquisition price.  One substracts one figure from the other to find out the gain.  In any case in which the Revenue Commissioners would have to check up whether it is gain or consideration they would have to get precisely that information.  They have to know the original cost and the cost of disposal. If there is any additional work involved for them it is subtracting one figure from the other.  I do not think the Minister can seriously suggest that the obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to subtract one figure from the other is such that it would impose an enormous and unsustainable volume of work on the Revenue Commissioners. In other words, from the point of view of administration I am suggesting that the amount of work involved for the Revenue Commissioners is virtually the same whether the exemption threshold relates to gain or relates to consideration.</P>
    <P>But, leaving that aside and looking at the merits of the proposal I do not think that it can seriously be suggested that consideration can be compared with gain as a measure of what should be done here in exemptions. After all, if one is trying to give an exemption, is one giving an exemption because in particular circumstances it is something that should be done socially?  If that is the reason then should we not be concerned since this is a capital gains tax to ensure that the exemption is given in relation to a certain volume of gain?</P>
    <P>As I have indicated earlier, consideration means nothing.  You can have a relatively low consideration and a very high gain.  You can have a relatively high consideration and a relatively low gain, but there is no social reason for saying that at a particular consideration you should give exemption at another.  There is a very good social reason for saying that in certain categories if the gain does not exceed a certain amount that should be exempt but if it exceeds that it is getting into the big league and should <Col N="482" /> pay capital gains tax.  But, to say one should exempt in relation to consideration is approaching the matter purely from the point of view of the convenience of administration and without any regard whatever to the sociological implications of what one is doing.</P>
    <P>I am therefore urging that for these reasons and so that one can control the amount of exemptions one is giving then the threshold should relate to gain and not to consideration.  As I have said, since there may be an enormous variation in the amount of gain, quite irrespective of the amount of consideration, to give an exemption related to consideration means that you have no control at all; you do not know what amount of gain you are exempting.</P>
    <P>The figure here for consideration is £50,000.  It is quite conceivable that under that you could be giving exemptions in respect of a gain of £45,000.  On the other hand, you could very easily in the case of a consideration exceeding £50,000 be applying capital gains tax to a gain which is only, say, £1,000.  To me this does not make sense at all and it is abdicating the responsibility of achieving the real purpose of the exemption proposed in the section.</P>
    <P>The arguments which were advanced by the Minister in relation to section 17 do not apply in this case. To suggest that from the point of view of the taxpayer it is simpler if he knows what the consideration is, he knows he is in or out, is too simplistic a view altogether, because he has got to know what the gain is; and if the Minister says he does not really have to know, if the Revenue Commissioners happen to pick on him as one of the spot check cases then he has to find out and, in any case, most people will know pretty accurately what gain they are getting in a transaction.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that all the arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of operating this section on the basis of gain rather than consideration, that the administrative difficulties which could arise from doing so are minimal and therefore that the amendment <Col N="483" /> should be accepted in relation to this section.</P>
    <P>I repeat what I said at the beginning, because I do not want any red herrings raised in this regard: I made it clear on the Committee Stage and I am making it clear again on this that what I am doing in this amendment is trying to establish the principle that the exemption should be related to the gain, not to the consideration. I am not endeavouring to prescribe the level of exemption in relation to gain.  The only person who can do that is the Minister with the information available to him.  I do not want to have it suggested that I am trying to achieve an exemption in relation to £50,000 gain under section 26.  I am not endeavouring to achieve that.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Colley has said, this has been discussed on the Committee Stage and one would have hoped for a little more clarification.  The Minister did not enlighten me before I got up to speak.  In the absence of further illumination I must try to probe the matter myself.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Colley says, there is no question of wanting to measure the gain and, as Deputy Colley also said, in order to come to a complete and reliable judgment in a matter of this nature one would require to have the information which is available only to the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister.  Therefore, since I am not in the position of having that information I must be tentative. Nevertheless from the point of view of the Bill as a whole there does seem to be <i>prima facie</i> something here that needs reconciliation with the general principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night when we were discussing another matter the Minister appealed to the principle in support of his arguments and stood on an alleged principle in regard to section 13 and it was necessary for me to point out that the principle that he sought to rely on was already modified by the qualifying subsection (2) of section 13.  What is involved is gain and here, instead of fixing the thresholds or reliefs with <Col N="484" /> respect to the gain, the fixing is done with respect to the consideration.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, consideration and gain are totally different matters.  I could carry out a commercial transaction such as is visualised in this Bill, a transaction the Bill is basically designed to cover, and I could make a small gain.</P>
    <P>This Bill, if the Minister's philosophy is to be understood in any coherent sense, is primarily aimed at capturing big commercial transactions where gains are made and taking a percentage of those gains to the Revenue.  It is very relevant then to understand that a transaction, the consideration for which was £1 million, may result in a large gain, a small gain, no gain or a loss.  A transaction in terms of £1 million could result, for instance, in a gain of merely £5,000 and that is all that would be taxable.  I make this point not with specific reference to the circumstances visualised in the section but to get at the basic point that consideration and gain are two totally different things, and that the gain is attached to the consideration to some extent in an accidental way and to take consideration as a measure does not bring any logical measure of gain with it.  As Deputy Colley pointed out, a very clear example was given by him early on the Committee Stage.  Speaking at column 1761 of Volume 280 of the unrevised Official Report on 10th May last, Deputy Colley said:</P>
    <P>As an example, under the Bill as it stands, a person might buy a farm for, say £10,000 and might sell it for £45,000.  The amount of the capital gains tax he would pay on the £35,000 gain under the Bill is nil.  But, on the other hand, a person might buy a farm for £45,000 and sell it for £55,000 and be liable to capital gains tax on the £10,000 gain.  This arises because the amount of the consideration is the criterion used in the Bill for assessing the basis of the capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>That drives home in a very clear way not only the general point that the measure of consideration is not a measure of gain and, furthermore, <Col N="485" /> within the specific contemplation of the type of thing here in the section, and directly relevant to the amendment we are discussing, clearly consideration is not a proper measure. That is the first point.  I make it separately as there are flowing from that other considerations in this approach by Deputy Colley.  Before coming to them I must repeat that it is realised that a certain amount of what I might call readjustment will be necessary if this point is taken.  Again, I feel it is quite possible pressures have been on the Minister&mdash;and there is no doubt about it nobody will fault the Minister for his personal energy in dealing with this and other matters&mdash;but it would be a pity if rushing legislation of this nature through should result in blemishes in the legislation in question.  Again, therefore, before going on to the corollaries that arise in relation to this, I would urge that we keep before us here in this Bill all the time what the purpose of it is.  What is the principle both in regard to taxation measures and to the reliefs?  If we do not do that we will be heading for the type of embarrassment I have discussed on previous occasions when considering the possible legal consequences, and consequences in court, of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The question is why was this approach adopted.  I am not altogether completely satisfied reading the Committee Stage debate&mdash;I do not intend to delay the House by reading all the relevant portions from the unrevised report and I would like to recall to the Minister that I did agree with him that, in order to assess the gain, you must know your consideration.  My agreement with the Minister that far is on record.  But that very point makes it difficult for me to believe there are administrative reasons for taking this approach.  I do not want to repeat the long argument that took place on the other occasion as to the administrative difficulties in getting the information and what information is to be got.  It is sufficient to say that the consideration is relevant because the gain cannot be assessed unless you know the two considerations. <Col N="486" /> In order to do what the Minister wants to do you need the consideration also, and so I am at a loss to understand why for administration reasons one would prefer to measure the reliefs by the consideration rather than the gain.  In fact, as in practically every other provision in this Bill, one has to ask oneself three questions.  First, what is the motivating purpose behind this provision? Last night in another situation I asked the Minister whether his purpose was sociological or was it revenue gathering?  Was it taxation?  The Minister answered that it was both, and I accept that a consideration has three aspects to it&mdash;taxation, social policy and administration.  These are the three.  We must therefore, look at Deputy Colley's amendment in the light of taxation, social policy and administration.</P>
    <P>As I was saying, every provision in this Bill has to be looked at bearing three considerations in mind: taxation, social policy and administration. Let us look at what is involved here in measuring these reliefs by consideration, instead of taking the norm and the purpose of the Bill as the measure as in other parts of the Bill, that is, taking gains as the measure, as is suggested in these amendments.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of taxation, I do not know, and only the Revenue Commissioners can say, how much is expected to be caught.  But if one has regard to all the provisions in this Bill, one can get some idea of the amounts of money the Minister wishes to capture.  I would not be far out by saying he aims at capturing gains roughly of the order of £1,000 and upwards, which he considers worth while.  I base that estimate on the fact that the measure of certain reliefs&mdash;and we mentioned this last night&mdash;was of the order of £500 and that there was resistance to an amendment which sought to exempt the £1,000 level.  Perhaps I am not far off the mark if I suggest the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister are aiming to capture gains of £1,000 and upwards.  I know, of course, that that is a very approximate estimate, and I am sure it has <Col N="487" /> not been formulated anywhere but remembering what happened to the £500 last night, that seems to be a fair figure.</P>
    <P>On taxation, taxation returns and exemption, and taking it that it is desirable to capture a gain of £1,000, let us take Deputy Colley's example.  As the provision stands, the purchase price of a house might have been £10,000, the disposal price £45,000 and the gain £35,000.  Here, Revenue are throwing away a substantial tax of roughly onequarter, approximately £8,000, a nice little sum.  The Revenue Commissioners do not throw away large sums of money.  I and other Deputies have commended them for their fairness but they have never been censured for foolishness.  If they were given discretion in this respect, eyebrows would be raised, internally and externally. But that is precisely what the Minister would be doing in such a case, unless I am completely off-bean, in which case I can only offer the excuse as Deputy Colley did, that we are not in the Minister's confidence.</P>
    <P>From the taxation point of view, for the man who bought at £45,000 and sold at £55,000&mdash;which would be a normal and probable price&mdash;there will be a gain of £10,000, of which £300 will be captured, which is below the exemption level.  There appears to be a lack of logic here.  Why?  What underlying compelling motive inspires the Minister to choose consideration as the measure here rather than gains when, from the taxation point of view, on a very simple and probable example, we find the inescapable result in the case of two transactions, that the Revenue will automatically lose £8,000 and in the other case the whole machinery will be put into gear to collect £300, which is less than the general exemption limits and considerably less than the figure we wanted of roughly £1,000. From a taxation point of view what on earth is the reason for this?  It can result in a peculiar type of anomaly.</P>
    <P>So far I have dealt only with taxation. I still have to consider the matter from the point of view of social policy and the point of view of administration. From the point of view of taxation alone, one can follow up the line <Col N="488" /> I am opening up now and ask oneself what are the possibilities for manoeuvre and evasion.  Big gains can be made on sums under £50,000 and small gains can be made on sums over that figure.  Perhaps the Revenue Commissioners see it in a different way. Naturally they are much better informed than I am and I am prepared to grant that they are wiser than I am, but there seems to be plenty of room for the cat to play among the pigeons. On the other hand, if you go for the gain, if you set your exemptions on the gain, you avoid all this.</P>
    <P>I am still talking purely on taxation. Take Deputy Colley's example. If you go on the gain, a man may buy for £10,000 and sell for £45,000 &mdash;and this would not happen unless there were some elements that would normally be liable to tax&mdash;that will be captured, and £8,000 will be caught where the £35,000 was earned and £300 will be got on £10,000 instead of taxing the £10,000 for £300 and letting off the £35,000 scot free as it stands.  From the taxation point of view, the Minister has something to look at here quite apart from the equity of the matter.</P>
    <P>I also fear that a little imagination and ingenuity may enable devices to be employed which will achieve the type of result Deputy Colley pointed out in the most unexpected cases. This is the trouble with reliefs.  I have the greatest sympathy and understanding for the Minister.  I do not want to discourage him from giving reliefs in these matters.  I do not want him to take what I am saying in any spirit but a desire to help him.  I should like him to accept that.  At the same time it is our job to tease this out.  An Opposition can be of very little help to the Government if they do not do that.  The Minister will have the superior information and resources to quote to us and we will rest satisfied if we feel we have done our job.</P>
    <P>Looking at it as a taxation measure in its own right, there is a problem particularly with the principles applying to taxation law which I will not repeat as I have mentioned sections I many times on previous sections I should like to be given some very good reasons why consideration is <Col N="489" /> adopted as the measure and not gain. I feel that anomaly may lead to abuse.</P>
    <P>From the social point of view I anticipate&mdash;and in my anticipation I not only sympathise with the Minister but I laud him on his approach &mdash;that the Minister will tell us the purpose is to give relief to a familytype business on disposal to somebody to encourage the proper succession, to pass on productive wealth, and to enable a person to retire and not hang on for too long.  For social and economic reasons the Minister can make a very good case for the principle of what he is doing and the reliefs he wishes to give.  Not only is that understood and accepted but the Minister is entitled to credit and praise for this very proper approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, and I hope in other cases, I am perfectly prepared to be as generous as I should be to say the least of it.  I want the Minister to feel that I want to help him and I give him absolutely full marks for this.  He will permit my analysis in that spirit.  I wonder whether to some extent, again taking consideration as the measure instead of gain, a difficulty does not arise.  It is clear what the Minister has in mind in this exemption.  The term &ldquo;qualifying assets&rdquo; is defined in a later part of the section and I shall not delay the House by an analysis of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By taking a limit of £50,000 the Minister has in mind a small business. I am sure it was a consideration in his mind that it would probably be a disposal to somebody who would carry on the same type of business, or possibly a disposal to a relative. We need not analyse what the disposal is to be.  The point is that it is to provide for the small business and to assess the tax on the large business. Tying it to the consideration has nothing to do with the gain.  For this reason the Minister may find that he is actually encouraging persons to make disposals of a certain sort which might not altogether be desirable.  For instance, when a person reaches 55 <Col N="490" /> years of age there may be other social considerations which could be controlled by charging on gain, but where a real temptation arises if there are large gifts.  I am worried that, over a period of years, situations can be engineered where, in the process of maturing, the assets can be distributed in such a way&mdash;when it comes to the age of maturity at 55&mdash;some interesting transactions could take place at considerable gain or adjustment.  That might be spelled out if one undertakes a detailed analysis of this and a couple of other sections of the Bill.  We have already dealt with it on Committee Stage; we are now restricted and I want to observe the Rules of Order.</P>
    <P>If there are circumstances for the disposal of assets in certain places&mdash; local varying circumstances where consideration changes&mdash;then I wonder is one achieving one's social purpose? Again, one must take into consideration a number of provisions in the Bill.  Here we get into interminable argument, with the Minister saying: &ldquo;Ah, but this section will do that&rdquo;, and I come back and say: &ldquo;This section will do the other thing.&rdquo;  We cannot engage in such today.  Therefore, I must make a general statement, being perfectly aware of the riposte that can come, knowing I shall not have a chance to reciprocate the riposte and, even if I did, there would be a further argument because we are now dealing with the Bill as a whole.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may put one idea as being relevant to this question.  One's qualifying assets can be affected very much by one's environment, and the circumstances of the physical and commercial environment may operate in such a way that consideration is not the appropriate measure at all but that gains are.  If that is so&mdash;just as in the case of taxation&mdash;so too, in the case of social policy, there may well be traps.  I know what the Minister wants to do.  Like Deputy Colley, I am in some difficulty here because I realise that a more radical adjustment than merely the amendment is involved.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister saying: &lsquo;Look, this amendment, by itself, will not be sufficient and I just cannot do <Col N="491" /> it now.&rdquo;  If that is his answer, it is a pity but I can understand it.  Both from the point of view of taxation and social policy it would be preferable if the tax and the reliefs were fixed on gains.  If the Minister wishes to exempt the very small man, then it would be simple to word it in such a way that where the gain accrued, in certain circumstances, a total exemption could be allowed. Though arguing vehemently for Deputy Colley's amendment, I find myself more than ready to understand the Minister's difficulty when this amendment is put to him.  Nevertheless, we are highlighting what may be a serious blemish on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I shall leave the question of the social purpose with the remark that the good social intentions may be capable of perversion just as is the taxation intention.  I am sorry that one of my colleagues, who has a very intimate knowledge of small businesses in this city and their circumstances, is not present because I am sure he would be able to express, in a more concrete way, some of the things to which I have been referring in principle.</P>
    <P>Lastly, there is the question of administration on which I touched at the beginning.  If anomalies exist from the point of view of taxation, if there is any ground for my fears that the Minister's social approach could have unforeseen and undesirable consequences notwithstanding his proper attitude and intentions, it is a question of administrative convenience or necessity for the Revenue Commissioners?  By the way, I see that Deputy Fitzpatrick has now returned to the Chamber and I am sure he will be able to elaborate on the question of small businesses in this city; what can happen; how capital gains can be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To revert to my point on administration, surely the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;if I am correct in my limit of £1,000&mdash;if they have to have the information as they will, about consideration to operate this section, will have to have continuing information; information about the two considerations, the difference between which gives one the gain.  I do not think any great problem is involved.  I would be obliged if the Minister&mdash;I do not expect he will have an opportunity now but he will have one before he goes to the Seanad with this Bill&mdash;would consider all the points we have put to him.  We are only helping the Minister to make this Bill a better one in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is necessary and desirable for the continuation of the work of the IDA.  However, I should like to pose a few questions to the Minister which could have the effect of making the provisions of the Bill more effective and eliminating problems for industrialists, and others who may be availing of the extended financial provisions.  I should like to know if the Minister's attitude towards imports will be helpful to industrialists wishing to expand or establish new projects.  Will the attitude of the Minister towards imports encourage outsiders to establish industries here? These people should be aware of the intentions of the Minister in this regard. They should be made aware if full protection is to be given to them in order to protect their investment, production and sales against imports. Imports of the dumping type should be stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the provisions of this Bill will be effective if the present state of affairs is allowed to continue. During the last 18 months we alleged <Col N="493" /> that dumping activities were taking place and we alleged that no action was being taken in this regard.  We told the Minister of the procedures he could adopt, but the Minister told us that it is not within his powers or those of the Government due to our membership of the EEC to do what we were suggesting in spite of the fact that the other members of the EEC took measures which benefited their economy, their industrial development and their balance of payments.  It is 12 months since we raised the question of the textile industry.  I assume that some of the finance sought in this Bill will go towards helping this industry.</P>
    <P>My interest is in the shirt manufacturing end of this industry. The Minister said that he was having problems in relation to that industry investigated, that officials from the EEC had visited this country and that he was keeping an eye on the situation. However, nothing has transpired. I asked if the abolition of VAT on textiles applied to imported textiles as well as home manufactured goods and I was told by the Minister for Finance that it did.  In other words, the people who may wish to avail of the provisions of this Bill can say that the Minister for Finance and the Government have given the same reduction of VAT to imported textiles. They have given this facility to textiles imported from Korea or Thailand.  I accept that the Minister for Industry and Commerce made an effort to eliminate the problem in regard to imported textiles, but I should like to quote for him an article in an issue of <i>The Evening Herald</i> under the heading: &ldquo;Shoe Industry If For EEC Review&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>EEC Commissioner Mr. Albert Borschette said at a news conference at Dublin Airport today that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had raised the situation in the shoe industry and the textile industry in discussions with him.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have examined possible solutions&rdquo;, said Mr. Borschette.  He pointed out, however, that as the EEC Commission had only looked at the problem for the first time last <Col N="494" /> Wednesday, he could not say at this stage what final decisions would be reached.</P>
    <P>This is an alarming statement.  For a year Members on this side of the House protested and were given promises by the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister will explain these things when he is replying but I have not got the expert knowledge which the Minister has and has available to him. I am genuinely interested in this.  I am not trying to put the Minister in a spot.  I am referring to a problem which we have discussed in this House over the last 12 months.  I prefaced my remarks by saying that the Minister made statements which I believe. When he indicates that before the end of last year officials of the EEC were in this country actively engaged in this I accept that.  I appreciate that there may be several stages of progress towards this situation. The reason I am quoting this is to get the Minister's explanation of why Mr. Borschette said that it was only on Wednesday last that something had reached somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was only raised a few days before.  He is referring to a particular initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>He said:</P>
      <P>We have examined possible solutions.</P>
      <P>That is Mr. Borschette and the Minister. The report continues:</P>
      <P>He pointed out, however, that as the EEC Commission had only looked at the problem for the first time last Wednesday, he could not say at this stage what final decisions would be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know if outside the Commission any solutions have been reached on previous approaches by the Minister.  I admit I am not terribly <i>au fait</i> with the nitty gritty finer points of EEC regulations.  I would be glad if the Minister would put this statement in context.  Was Mr. Borschette referring to the whole problem or some aspect of the problem <Col N="496" /> of the footwear and textile industries?  If, after the Minister's efforts over the last 12 months, the end result is that there is nothing taxwise, quotawise or dumpingwise the Minister can do he had better say so. Our textile industry is suffering.  I will not repeat points made here over the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I want also to raise the point of development in western areas.  I know that the regulations of the IDA provide for extra grants in western areas.  In this context I would urge that the Minister take into consideration the very special problems in counties like my own county of Donegal.  We have additional problems due to the troubles across the border.  This has affected industrial development in counties contiguous to the border.  Would the Minister consider providing special grants and facilities for industrialists who set up in those areas?  The unemployment figures are alarming and new industries are badly needed.  I would also like to know whether any of the regional fund will be added to the sum provided here for projects in the western areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say will be a little disjointed, because I will take points in the order in which they were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill which increases from £350,000 to £850,000 the amount of money which the IDA can expend without clearance from the Government. That is its sole purpose.  It is an extremely brief and concise Bill, and while I will make some reply on wider points that were mentioned I would like to indicate to the House that while the other estimates have been passed in the very recent past my own is before the House.  Apart from my own estimate I have indicated further IDA legislation in the near future, and we also have the debate currently going on on the Government's package of economic measures to which some of these wider issues would be more appropriate.  I would also like to remind Deputies, especially people like Deputy Brennan who held ministerial office, that it is not appropriate for one Minister to comment <Col N="497" /> on the area of responsibility of another.</P>
    <P>There are some points which are general to a number of speakers. Fundamental questions were raised about State participation by way of equity.  Two Deputies seemed to be under the impression that new legislation would be required.  That is not the case.  Equity participation is within the powers of the IDA and is something they practise.  This participation sometimes takes place by the appointment of a director.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that this is more in relation to the Industrial Credit Corporation. They give supplementary assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the IDA.  There may be a genuine misapprehension on the part of two Deputies in regard to their powers. The Industrial Development Act, 1969, reads as follows in section 44:</P>
      <P>Where, in the opinion of the Authority, an industrial undertaking conforms to the requirements of sections 33 (3) and 34 (3) of this Act, the Authority may out of funds at its disposal purchase or take shares in the body corporate owning, controlling or managing the undertaking.</P>
      <P>One former Minister and a Deputy made that point, not appreciating the actual situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people talked about co-ordination of State agencies of which there are a number in my Department and a number in other Departments but which must necessarily cooperate with those in my Department in the course of the development of the economy.  This raises fundamental questions which are more appropriate elsewhere.  Co-ordination is essential but pushing together of separate bodies is not essential and is counterproductive. We have developed interesting organisations of a flexible and valuable kind.  They are a part of devolution.  The IDA are referred to in this Bill.  They are able to call on a wider sector of the community than the elected representatives, and these people can participate in some of the decision-making in regard to the State's <Col N="498" /> role in the economy.  The real purpose of this Bill is to increase the level of that decision-making.  We have increased the amount of money that it is possible for them to give.  If there is not serious devolution to the IDA and serious power of a financial kind, serious people will not be interested. Such a body can only be really good if they have real power and are let use it.</P>
    <P>This seems to be one of the arguments for keeping up-to-date in money terms and keeping ahead of inflation. Co-ordination is real and important. Any good executive will defend his own area of responsibility and strive to increase it.  That is a virtue in a person. A little constructive conflict can be fruitful.  We should not try to eliminate it.  We should not eliminate all boundary difficulties between different organisations.  Organisations can be spurred on to greater efforts.  If we put them together we take away their separate initiative.  The organisation then becomes big, cumbersome and bureaucratic.  I know that Deputies were not suggesting that we put all semi-State bodies together.  Conflicts occur but as a result of my limited experience over the past two years in office these conflicts are few.  My Department is the co-ordinating body of many organisations.  Many people in charge of bodies working under my Department have regular access to me in order to discuss matters and they certainly have access to me any time they deem it necessary.  Part of the role of a Minister in my Department is to be watching the co-ordination aspect and to see that disputes do not get out of hand.  He must see that there is not fruitless conflict or duplication.</P>
    <P>In the future we might hear from Deputies whether they want fundamental reorganisation of such bodies or whether they just feel that the existing mechanisms can operate provided there is continuous surveillance.  I find that the existing mechanisms, each functioning in a separate area such as training, industrial, export promotion or the promotion of design, are working well.  Single organisations should not have separate tasks.  There should be a correlation between the structure <Col N="499" /> itself and the job it has to do.  If too many jobs are put into a single organisation situations can arise which annoy politicians and the public at large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan talked about the manpower service and AnCO and the IMI which all come within the Department of Labour.  I suspect that Deputy Brennan knows that the telephone service comes under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am painfully aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If I do not comment on those observations it is because I wish to remain in order.  It was inquired by Deputy W. Ryan that in regard to SFADCO&mdash;which he looked on as an agent of the IDA although I understand the relationship is much more equal&mdash;if there was any intention to develop the core of the SFADCO area to the detriment of the periphery of that area.  I can assure him that is definitely not so.</P>
      <P>In the matter of industrial development one functions in a real situation. One can help something to happen but when one is dealing with overseas investment one cannot say &ldquo;You must go there&rdquo;.  You can coax them there, but a degree of choice and freedom must remain to those who come in to invest.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies such as Deputies Connolly, Staunton and Enright referred to the particular regions of North Tipperary and Laois-Offaly and a particular piece of Mayo around Westport.  I want to put on the record of the House that the people with the first claim to help are those who live where the need is greatest.  That is all there is to it.  The definition of greatness of need is made on an economic and sociological basis. The only way to order the priorities is to say what has been the evolution of population, industry and income and what has happened about emigration. I will not permit any other guidelines than those objective ones of an economic and sociological kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That does mean that one can make objective lists about the <Col N="500" /> greatness of need.  Many Deputies could have spoken about every constituency in this country.  It was appropriate in the sense that this sort of objective criteria I am talking about&mdash;economic and sociological&mdash;tend uniquely to pick out these areas as being disadvantaged. They are disadvantaged but there are others as well.  I can only say &mdash;and I say it at a time when the available jobs we would like to create are fewer in a world recession than we would like and when we have to work, particularly with incoming industrialists, on a basis of persuasion and urging and not of ordering&mdash;that the guidelines are objective, that even at the risk of annoying people, which I have done, I will not permit political distortions of those guidelines. They will be and they are and they have been objective guidelines worked out statistically on the sort of criteria I have said.  All that people need to know if they want to be sure that they are at the top of the IDA or SFADCO lists is that they are the most disadvantaged. That is all that is required, and I do assure the House that the mechanism works that way.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I pointed out earlier that the Deputy had ranged over a large number of Departments.  He has now added the Department of Transport and Power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought Deputy Seán Moore made an interesting point because he talked about the sociological effects and the effect on the whole environment of the establishment of a new industry and about the need to study when an industry was put down in a certain place not just what it did to industrial jobs there but what it did to the whole fabric of life there.  That is an approach and an attitude that appealed to me very much and with which I very much <Col N="501" /> agree.  I would want to assure him&mdash; and he made the point in regard to Dublin&mdash;that in many of the larger cities of the world we are seeing a process&mdash;it is a cliche to call it alienation but that is what it is&mdash;a process of social disruption.  It is very important to analyse what industrial development does to the fabric both of cities and of the countryside.</P>
      <P>I do not want to talk about it in detail, but a commendable voluntary body is very much concerned particularly with Dublin city.  It is right that I should say that in my opinion the Economic and Social Research Institute bridges those aspects; it is economic but it is social as well.  As I understand their work, they do not like a deep cleavage between what is sociological and what is economic.  They see these as inter-penetrating.  They are very good indeed as an institute.  They are not people in my Department.  They are not, indeed, people who, apart from reading what they do, I have had any formal contact with since becoming a Minister, but on the basis of what I hear about them out of Ireland and what I read about what they produce, they are people who are able to stand comparison with any comparable institute in the world.  They are available to us.  They are very good.  It is right that we should use them very fully in looking at the sociological aspects as well and we should affirm their importance.  It is right, if there is a consensus in the House, that we should express the view which I believe expresses a consensus in the House that in industrial development their research facilities and their past work should be drawn on, not just at Government level but at local level too because there is very little joy, we could agree, in developing industrial jobs even with good employment and high salaries and high wages if in the course of doing it we tear apart the fabric of the country and the culture of the country which is very precious to us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there are <Col N="502" /> three sources.  One is requests from State sources.  Another is requests from outside sources.  The third is the generation of policy.  When I say policy I mean the generation of areas themselves which need to be looked at.  I think there are those three.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Some of the work is directed to the one good book, in fact, that is now some years out of date but to local influences and to comparing the effects of industrialisation in specific societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Without in any way deriding the important work of the ESRI, they did find themselves in conflict on major pronouncements in relation to the economy with the Central Bank.  I am afraid the Central Bank turned out to be the more accurate forecaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am neither surprised nor disappointed at this.  If you have valid academic people with a sense of liberty they may often disagree with other bodies.  Indeed, it is a little depressing for politicians trying to get good economic advice that economists of the very highest quality all over the world are continuously producing opposite economic diagnoses.  This is often difficult when you have to decide between conflicting advice from able and honourable people.  It does not surprise me that this should happen.</P>
      <P>The point was made, which I referred to earlier, by Deputy Cunningham about the right to take an interest in and to have a director on the board of the IDA.  This is important.  It is something that could be strengthened, and I have indicated that thought to them in the past but I quoted and put on the record the section of the 1969 Act which makes that possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Staunton raised a point which comes back to this matter of democracy, as to whether the transfer from £350,000 to £850,000 was not going too high.  In other words, were we moving the powers of decision too much away from the Government and <Col N="503" /> too much to the authority of the IDA. There are two replies to be made to that.  First&mdash;I say this with regret but it is the case&mdash;if you adjust for things like certain sorts of labour costs or certain sorts of material or certain sorts of charges from 1969 to now, if you take 1969 as base year and apply the increase to £350,000 you do not get to £850,000 but you get to fairly close to it.  So that we are not going very far from the reality which obtained in 1969 at £350,000.</P>
    <P>The second thought that I want to reiterate is that I believe that while a bit of centralisation and centralisation away from Dublin and to Brussels and things like that is inevitable it is only tolerable if we structure the movement in the opposite direction as well and if we push away from the centre.  People who serve on State boards do it for very little money and give a lot of time to it and they are in fact benefactors in that sense, bringing expertise to the service of the State which if they wanted to sell it elsewhere they could get a great deal of money for it.  If we want to get good people willing to do that we have to give them real power.  I believe we do want good people.  We want that sort of devolution. I had a doubt between £850,000 and £1 million.  It was in my own mind quite a narrow thing as to whether the limit should not be a little higher.  I certainly do not think it is too high.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cunningham asked me a number of questions.  I was foolish enough to reply to them because I doubt that they are relevant to the Bill.  Since I did so it is proper that I should clarify one thing.  He quoted an interview with Commissioner Borschette in the evening paper.  The particular sentence was relating to what was called &ldquo;the problem&rdquo;. M. Borschette was quoted as saying the commission had only looked at &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; for the first time. Deputy Gallagher was taking &ldquo;the problem&rdquo; there used to mean the problem of the textile and footwear industries in Ireland.  To say that the commission had only looked at that for the first time is nonsense.  They have been looking at it at my instigation since November in individual cases <Col N="504" /> and December of last year.  I want to say that the problem was not the general problem of the difficulties in these industries but the particular problem they are now faced with and how they will respond.  I have not stopped trying to get some satisfaction.  It was to that particular very recent initiative the Deputy was referring and not the general problem.  The problems of the Irish textile and footwear industries have been considered.  This is simply for clarification, though it is not strictly in order.  Within the limits of the Bill, I have tried to answer the points raised by Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of participation instead of free grants, there is provision in existing legislation, but what I am anxious to know is whether the Minister might not go entirely for participation in major legislative changes.  He may not be prepared to show his hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ready to show my hand but I would agree in a general sense with what the Deputy says.

I doubt if such another opportunity will be afforded us again.  Possibly legislation may provide an opportunity.  We are now giving the IDA power to take decisions on sums amounting to £850,000 without Government approval.

      <P>When we come to discuss the Estimate for the Minister's Department we will have to comment on the activities of other Departments such as Posts and Telegraphs, Local Government and Transport and Power and I would hope the Minister would not tell us that the matters raised were not within his area of responsibility and he could not, therefore, comment on them.  If we are to have industries in areas that are not developed as they should be these Departments will be equally involved, because industrialists will not set up shop in areas unless they have telephone communication, roads and various other facilities of a reasonably satisfactory standard. The discussion must of necessity be pretty wide ranging.  Perhaps the Minister would consult with his colleagues on these matters so that we can have a satisfactory debate on the Estimate for his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of directing industrialists to particular areas, the IDA do direct industries to certain areas and, when industries close down, the IDA direct substitute industries to move into these areas. Along the western seaboard there is <Col N="506" /> need for supplementary employment to the small holdings, which we all hope to retain, and their proud peasantry, whom we wish to see supported. We believe a more definite legislative direction will have to be given to the IDA to ensure that industries are sited where they are obviously required.  This can best be done by having a graduated scale of grants&mdash;the further away from the main industrial centre the project is the bigger the grant should be.  The IDA would not wish it to be known that they had the power to tell an American firm that it must go to Westport instead of Ballyshannon, but that can happen.</P>

      <P>With regard to directives, it may be more of a theoretical difficulty than a practical one.  We have not absolute power to say to industrialist X that he must go to town Y, if that is what is meant by direction. Of course the IDA have priorities of the socio-economic kind I have indicated. Of course, one can urge a man in a particular direction but if, at the last moment, he says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, one cannot make him.  The IDA do not have the power to direct in the finite sense but they have the power to guide and encourage.  It is my view&mdash;and these things are not done instantly and it is no harm for me to say this because we are due a little discussion on this topic&mdash;our policies have served us well in regard to industrialisation at different times.  I believe we are nearing a <Col N="507" /> time when more planning is required, and that planning should not be just a guesstimate but should have the power to make its thoughts and hopes into actuality.  We now have mechanisms for making estimates, for writing down aspirations, but we are a bit lacking in the side which is actually able to produce the realisation of those plans.</P>
      <P>This is an appropriate time, with free trade with the Community, with regional policy slowing and disappointingly beginning to develop, when we have to look at it not to dismantle any existing structures but some other structures as well.  The thoughts of Deputies on both sides of the House have been useful to me in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that I speak on this the fifth budget in just over two years since this Government came into power.  I am including in my reckoning of budgets the petrol budget, brought in before Christmas which introduced an unwarranted increase of 15p per gallon.  Worse than that was the way the Government tried to bring about this increase&mdash;through the Imposition of Duties Order&mdash;which the Minister hoped would stifle debate by the elected members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are to have consultation and open Government, as this Government promised before the last general election, and if they are to be judged by their actions, they have failed miserably. Any Government who believe that by using a device such as the Imposition of Duties Order to prevent a debate in this House must be in very <Col N="508" /> serious trouble in many ways.  We were told by the Minister for Finance that that budget would yield a further £27 million to the Exchequer.  A Governto my mind, a failure particularly when ment who resort to such tactics are, one remembers the solemn promises they made about open Government.</P>
    <P>Last January when the Minister introduced his budget he told us he anticipated another budget in the autumn of 1975.  Last week he did not give any indication if he still anticipated that budget.  I seriously hope that somebody in a responsible position in this Coalition Government, when contributing to this debate, can clear the air about this next budget.  The question I want answered is: are we to have another budget?  I hope this question will not be left hanging in the air.</P>
    <P>In April, 1973, in 1974 and 1975 we had the official budgets.  We told the Government in very clear language that any action taken in their budgets would not help the economy in any way.  We told them they did not have a co-ordinated plan which would maintain growth and improve the standard of living, but instead they tended to undermine and do unbelievable harm to the solid growth which had taken place during the 1960s, up to the time this Government came into power.</P>
    <P>When these budgets were introduced we did not knock the idea of deficit budgeting.  We resisted the pitfalls put in our way by the Government.  We were not happy that the excess amounts of the budget deficits, and the moneys which had to be borrowed to meet these deficits were applied, in the main, to the payment of our current account rather than productive working.  This was our No. 1 charge in the budgets of 1973, 1974, and 1975.</P>
    <P>If things were ordinary this would have been bad enough in itself, but when we have a recession such as we have running hand in hand with a galloping and unchecked rate of inflation this maladministration helped to compound the inflationary trend. The Government's action in doing what they did in the way they did it made things much worse than they <Col N="509" /> were.  Our party have no intention of compounding the difficulties for the economy which this Government by their lethargy, their neglect and their downright ineptitude have created.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, for many long months the Government tried to get the public to believe, as they probably believed themselves, that outside forces were responsible for the extraordinary inflation from which we have been suffering for about two years.  Practically all Members of the Government blamed the Arabs every time everything went wrong.  So much so that I smiled recently when I heard the Minister for Finance was going with his hat or his cap in his hand to the Arabs looking for money.  They could not have sent a worse person, because he was so unkind to that group of people over the past 12 months or two years in saying it was they who should be held responsible for the sad state of affairs here.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that when our Minister for Finance came back his hat or his cap was empty and he was unsuccessful?  I do not often comment on the political cartoons in the daily papers, but full marks to the cartoonist who showed in one of the papers&mdash;I forget which&mdash;our Minister for Finance coming down the steps of an Irish airline plane this time, I think, with his hat in his hand and being checked by a dutiful civil servant saying: &ldquo;Minister, as you are at home now, please put your hat back on your head.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Despite all the stick given to the Arabs by practically all Ministers in this Labour/Fine Gael Government, many of our problems could have been dealt with by the Government if they were serious and able and capable of standing up manfully to the problems of making decisions and implementing them.  A weakness of the Government is that they cannot make decisions. They cannot make up their minds as to what they should do or could do. For many months we pointed out that there were forces within our economy over which the Government have control and which contributed up to 50 per cent to our inflation.  On every possible occasion we asked the Government to take action.  For too long they <Col N="510" /> dithered and dithered.  The euphoria which attended their coming into office seemingly blinded them to and upset their vision of the harsh realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>If we look back over the two years or so of the Labour/Fine Gael Government it is fair to say that, if they are to be given credit for anything, they must be given credit for the fact that they have tried to be a Government of all things to all men at all times.  They were not strong enough to resist the many demands made on them.  This is the sad part of it.  Irrespective of the damage which might have been done and was done to the economy, they were unable to stand up to the demands which probably gained for them a degree of temporary popularity.  They must have known in their hearts that every time they refused to face realities our economy was suffering and we were sinking lower and lower and deeper and deeper into debt.</P>
    <P>The record shows clearly and without any qualification that six months ago we pointed out to them that there was still time available to them to try to do something about the economic decline which was obvious to everybody except the so-called Government of so-called all-stars who did not have their economic glasses on.  Six months ago we begged them to take action mainly along the lines now being taken. If they had faced up to their responsibilities, as they should have, things would not be as bad as they are now. Since they did not take action which they were exhorted to take, the question must be asked: Why did they not? What prevented them from doing so? If they had shown sufficient political courage to do then what they are now being forced to do, we would probably be in a much better position than we are now.  I suppose I will have to answer my own question.  The reason they did not take the action they should have taken was that they did not have the political courage to do so.</P>
    <P>Within the European context practically all the countries with the exception of ourselves show signs of coming out of the inflationary spiral.  Britain and ourselves top the lead in this <Col N="511" /> regard.  The Government should have busied themselves with things which mattered to the economy and devoted themselves to the tasks which they were elected to perform, and been aware of their responsibilities and prepared to act, instead of getting themselves involved in other matters which I believe were introduced to create a diversion and to take the people's minds away from the realities of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of the Government is hopping about the country still preaching about open broadcasting which he knows, as well as I know, was never on from the word go.  He tried to delude the people throughout the country that we could immediately, if they wanted it, give them BBC 1, that it was as simple as that.  The Minister on behalf of the Government was not too strong in his interview on the news on television yesterday after his discussions with the Minister for State from Britain who was here to talk to him about something or other.  All the talk, all the stumping around the country, all the efforts to lull our people into this state of delusion, all the energy and time spent on something that was not &ldquo;on&rdquo; from the word go, could have been better utilised looking after things that needed to be looked after&mdash; principally the economy, the way it was going and inflation spiralling along with it.  Perhaps it was a diversionary tactic&mdash;as I am inclined to believe&mdash; merely to keep people's minds off other things but, then, perhaps that is the role of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>We had other diversionary tactics also.  We had the transference of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill from this House to the Seanad on the so-called grounds of urgency.  Where is that urgency now?  Where is that Bill that had to be got through as quickly as it was said it must be got through? How serious are the Government with regard to that Bill now?  How many of the sitting days of the Seanad has it been ordered since it went there?  Is it not a fact now that the bluff of the Government with regard to this Bill and the reasons for its withdrawal from <Col N="512" /> this House has been blown wide open?  If the purpose was to create merely another state of delusion, they might have succeeded.  But so much time has been lost.  They were fiddling away for themselves, all playing different tunes at the same time while the country sank deeper and deeper.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another reason this Labour-Fine Gael Coalition failed to tackle properly the present economic problems.  I believe there is another reason why they failed to produce any cohesive, long-term strategy to deal effectively with the unbelievable spiral of inflation we witness at present.  I believe the fact of a Coalition Government, the fact that we have a Government which is a coalition, is the reason things have been allowed go unchecked, as they have at present.  I shall not speak at any great length on all or any of the old arguments against a Labour-Fine Gael Coalition.  But I have a question to ask of this Labour-Fine Gael Coalition, which is: will they plan our recovery and future economic progress on the basis of a mixed economy, which appears to be the view of the majority at least of the Fine Gael Party, or will we have a socialistplanned economy which one must presume to be the aim of the majority of the Labour Party?  That is the question being asked and not being answered.  Why is it that the Minister for Finance is unwilling to answer it? Is the Minister unwilling&mdash;or perhaps I should say, is he permitted&mdash;to embark on an economic programme?  If he is not permitted, is it because he is dependent on the tail, it being as strong as the body of the dog, to keep him in that position?  The fact that the Government and the Minister for Finance are not in a position to state what is their economic plan inspires a lack of confidence, and that lack of confidence is crucial in our present situation.  If, for any reason, a realistic programme is impossible, are we to be faced with recurring crises during whatever length of time there is left to the Government?  Are we to have a series of emergency budgets every time something goes wrong?  We do not know.  Those are the serious matters the Government have still <Col N="513" /> failed to take in hand and do something worth while about them.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that before the budget of last week, there was to be seen no Government policy whatsoever. Indeed since that budget the same can be said.  Might I say&mdash;and I had hoped to say so on the legislation which went through before the Parliamentary Secretary took over, legislation being pioneered by the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;we urged the Minister for Industry and Commerce many times to take action against the flood, and I cannot over-emphasise that word sufficiently to describe the amount of third country imports coming into this country, putting thousands of our workers out of jobs.  That Minister failed miserably to protect the jobs of those many thousands of people.  Over the months he kept throwing phrases at us, such as that he was looking for the right economic mix; phrases such as &ldquo;economic mechanisms&rdquo;, &ldquo;ongoing situations which were being monitored continuously&rdquo;.  But, while he was monitoring ongoing situations, our dole queues were growing and more people coming out of work.</P>
    <P>In recent times it is fair to say that one notices a marked difference in the attitude of some of our newspapers to the Government.  Perhaps I may be forgiven for mentioning <i>The Irish Independent,</i> a paper regarded always as being sympathetic to Government actions.  Mind you, <i>The Irish Independent</i> of last Wednesday contained a leading article of which, were I a member of this Labour-Fine Gael Government, I would take notice, particularly from a paper I believe always to be reasonably sympathetic to that Fine Gael-Labour Government.  It said that the Government had waited for a very long time to see if inflation would moderate of its own accord.  I suppose it is fair to say that certain papers cannot forever forgive.  What <i>The Irish Independent</i> said of this situation really presents the tragedy of the situation as it obtains at present.  Governments with experience know that economic difficulties and crises do not disappear of their own accord.  There is no doubt about that.  This Government, <Col N="514" /> by their neglect to use the means at their disposal at the proper time, made the prospect of recovery more difficult. The process of recovery will take longer because of the Government's failure in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Government missed out and neglected the opportunity to stave off the worst element of inflation, bringing as it did with it declining standards of living, reducing employment and investment and turning investment away from our shores.  They also drove away investment from here.  By not acting when they should have this Government missed a wonderful opportunity in relation to the situation in Northern Ireland.  By allowing our economy to sink into a situation comparable to that in Britain we lost the opportunity of inducing the Loyalists to turn their eyes to the south for hope or inspiration in their own economic troubles.</P>
    <P>For too long this Government have whistled their way past the graveyard of lost opportunities.  They wallowed in a state of indecision, they attempted to glibly talk their way out of difficulties without taking appropriate action, they have attempted by diversionary tactics to delude the public and obsecure the difficulties of the economic situation.  Many people believe that what the Government have done is too little too late.  They believe that the attempt at a solution will not come to grips with the problem as it should. It is the job of the Government to reduce unemployment and protect us from inflation.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that this budget will do these things, but it is based on the expectation that the national wage agreement will be modified.  We favour such agreements and the Government do also.  Fianna Fáil prepared the ground for the first national wage agreement and we support the Government's request for the modification of the present agreement although we know that this will make unions reluctant to enter into new agreements. This is part of the drastic price we have to pay for Government failure to act in time.  This was unnecessary and need not have happened.</P>
    <P>If the Government accepted the proposals we put to them last winter, <Col N="515" /> and repeated before the January budget, prices would have been cut and a new national wage agreement would have been negotiated on that basis.  Instead, those who could not make up their minds, who could not reach agreement among themselves, who were working without leadership, allowed the situation to develop where now we find that the unions and employers are being asked to break an agreement which was signed only recently.  There was not advance warning from the Government although it was plain to be seen that our economy could not sustain a 24 per cent price and pay rise this year.</P>
    <P>The weakening of confidence in the national wage agreement is only part of the process of undermining the existing machinery.  This Government have weakened price control by overruling the recommendations of the National Prices Commission in relation to CIE fare and ESB charges.  We have seen proof in recent days that the Government were wrong and that they weakened the National Prices Commission for no reason.  The Government have publicly acknowledged that once again they have made a mess of affairs because they tried to be all things to all people at all times in an effort to buy, at the expense of the nation, the popularity which they believe is so necessary for good Government.</P>
    <P>I smiled a sickly smile when I heard the Minister for Finance say that his budget was one of the most significant ever produced by a Minister for State in this House.  If one had time, and the energy, to analyse that statement one could make a case why one would feel as I did, sickly, at the suggestion that it was the most significant budget ever.  The deficit last January stood at over £120 million and with this new budget the deficit will rise to £241 million, twice as much as it was six months previously.  It is no wonder that the Taoiseach went on record as saying that we were living in borrowed time; we were living on the goodwill of our creditors.  The Taoiseach made that statement before the <Col N="516" /> budget and when we had planned for a deficit of over £120 million.  What will the Taoiseach say now with regard to living on borrowed time and the goodwill of our creditors?</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach was going to the same function as he did when he made the statement I referred to it would be worth one's while to listen to him because things are twice as bad now. It is a poor show on the part of any Taoiseach to hear his Minister for Finance say his budget was one of the most significant introduced.  I do not believe that statement, and I reject it entirely.  He would have needed about four tongues in four different cheeks when he made that statement. He did not fool anybody on this side and, judging by the amount of applause he got from the back of the centre on the Government side, it would appear that he did not fool too many on his own side either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I myself and my Department, and, indeed, other agricultural husbandry experts, have already been emphasising to farmers that it is false economy to curtail the use of the necessary level of fertiliser application to grass and crops.  Even at present prices, it still pays to apply the optimum levels of fertiliser and I have been continuing to point this out at various meetings.</P>
      <P>I also recently brought together a committee representing all the interests concerned with a view to undertaking promotion work for increased fertiliser use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be especially important during the remainder of the present <Col N="517" /> growing season to take full advantage of suitable fertilising of grassland in the interests of ensuring adequate supplies of fodder for the winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>As the interested parties did not take the advice of the Minister or his Department, what steps does he now propose to take to ensure that this decline will be halted, a decline we are told is in the region of 40 per cent?  This is a decline more in the use of phosphate and potash than of nitrogen and it could have a very harmful effect not only on the economy but on the very land of the country for future years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add. I have established the fertiliser promotion committee consisting of CAOs, Department officers and representatives of the fertiliser industry to undertake publicity and advisory measures aimed at increased fertiliser consumption.  I do not know what the Deputy is expecting beyond that.  In various public pronouncements at every suitable opportunity I have urged farmers to continue the steady application of fertilisers, even at present prices, stressing that a serious cut-back in purchases is false economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the decline in the use of fertilisers is due to the spiral in prices which commenced when the Minister for Industry and Commerce removed the controls?  This was the cause of it.  Did the Minister ever try to have the controls reimposed or has he considered subsidisation now that there is some money available for agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind the Deputy that he said the same thing about the lifting of controls on feeding stuffs.  The result of it was that we had the lowest priced feeding stuffs in the whole of Europe.  There is nothing whatever to indicate that the removal of controls on fertilisers in fact put up the prices.  It did nothing of the sort. It happened all over Europe and the reaction of farmers all over Europe is the same as the reaction here.  This is the only country in Europe where <Col N="518" /> there is any subsidy on fertilisers at present.</P>

      <P>This question relates to the Liffey.  So far as the Liffey is concerned the remedial action is a common one and it is taken by all boards in regard to UDN disease. It is to remove badly infected fish from the water.  That is the first factor. If the Deputy wants information on a national basis I would advise him to put down a question and I will be only too pleased to give him all the information at my disposal because I do regard it as a very important item.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing that the Parliamentary Secretary cannot give us more figures in relation to the catches.  Does he think there is any future for this fishery?  This is probably the only capital city in Europe with a salmon-bearing river going through its centre.  I do not get much confidence from the answer I have received.  Are there any plans to ensure that this fishery will be preserved? It is about the oldest fishery in these islands and it is unique.  I must record my deep disappointment at the answer I have received today. The attitude of the Government is defeatist.</P>

      <P>The need for conservation of the salmon stocks in the Erne system was discussed with the fishermen concerned in February, 1972 following on which a bye-law was made prohibiting net fishing in <Col N="529" /> the estuary.  While not provided for in the bye-law, the intention of my Department, based on the scientific advice available to it, was that the suspension would be lifted as soon as a satisfactory escapement of salmon upstream had taken place.  There was no agreement with the fishermen that the closure would be for a period of four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The latest position is that officers of my Department had discussions with the fishermen at Ballyshannon on 12th June. The fishermen requested that net fishing in the estuary should be allowed to commence as soon as 1,000 fish had been recorded as having ascended upstream. The proposal has been submitted for acceptance on the ground that the run of fish this year appears to show an improvement on that of recent years, and further that the fishermen have been very reasonable in accepting restriction on their fishing in the last three years.  The Department is very impressed with the co-operation from the fishermen concerned. In view of that co-operation and the improvement this year in the run of fish it is my intention to sign an order once the 1,000 number has been reached, which I think should be at or about this time, allowing fishing there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I further ask the Parliamentary Secretary, as I asked him in an earlier supplementary question, whether at the time of the discussions and the run up to the making of the bye-law the fishermen's interests were taken into account and what say, if any, they had in regard to their rights before the ESB moved in?</P>

      <P>Prior to the making of the bye-law-this is the bye-law made when the Deputy was in office&mdash;the proposal was discussed with the fishermen by officers of the Fisheries Division.  The minutes of the <Col N="530" /> meeting contain no record of an agreement with the fishermen that the restrictions should apply for four years.  The bye-law was renewed in 1973, 1974 and 1975.  It was discussed with the fishermen in 1972.  There seemed to be general agreement.  It has continued since 1972 up to the present time, with 2,000 laid down as the appropriate figure.  I am reducing that to 1,000 in this year and, as indicated already, the 1,000 mark should be reached shortly, as more than two weeks ago the number stood at 675.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if certain Irish firms, qualified under EEC regulations, have been refused training grants from the European Social Fund because of restrictions under existing Irish regulations; and if he will endeavour to have such regulations altered to allow these firms to benefit from the fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the situation under which some types of training expenditure by Irish firms could be eligible for consideration for aid from the European Social Fund if such expenditure were first aided from Irish public funds.  The types of expenditure at issue relate to rental or depreciation of materials and buildings used for training purposes and to certain types of teaching aids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, training grants payable by <Col N="543" /> the Industrial Development Authority are limited to the amounts of trainees' remuneration and expenses and of similar costs relating to instructors, advisers, and so on.  The question of amending this Act to allow grants in respect of additional type of training expenditure is a matter for decision by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that a number of firms who qualify under European standards have already been refused aid under this scheme simply because of the Irish regulations which apply?  Would the Minister consider that the 1969 Act should be amended as a matter of urgency?  Will he press on the Government the necessity for its amendment so that these firms can benefit from money which is available within the European Social Fund? The country would also benefit as a result of their getting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It would be a mistake to think that if there were a change in domestic legislation to permit of a wider interpretation of grants from the ESF there would be an automatic matching grants from the ESF to home expenditure in this area. While the amount of a firm's expected contribution is not set out in the fund's regulations it can be expected that an acceptable breakdown of expenditure would arise from any change in home legislation to permit participation by private firms in these wider areas.  The breakdown of expenditure would be something like the firm contributing one-third, the European Social Fund contributing one-third, and the Exchequer contributing one-third.  In view of the fund's regulations there would not be a 50-50 matching of contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If a third of the expenditure was contributed by this fund would it not be an added income to the country as well as to the firm? Is it not true to say that some firms have not received financial assistance from Europe who would receive it if the 1969 Act were amended?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that apprenticeship courses normally available in the construction trades at the Dublin Training Centre will not be commencing this year due to the large number of second, third and fourth year redundant apprentices and that the first year course has been postponed indefinitely; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>As a result of the situation in the construction industry considerable numbers of existing apprentices in the building trades, particularly in the Dublin area, have become unemployed or redundant and employers in the industry are reluctant to sponsor apprentices on first year off-the-job courses.  Consequently it has been decided, as a temporary measure, after consultation with the Industrial Training Committees representative of unions and employers, to divert resources from first year off-the-job courses in the Dublin Training Centre to the provision of training for apprentices who are out of work.</P>

      <P>Does that not prove that there are serious problems in the building industry?  Despite the answers we have been getting from the Minister for Local Government regarding the building industry is the Minister not aware now of the apprenticeship situation being an adequate barometer to show that problems exist there?  Might I now ask the Minister for Labour if he would at last advise the Minister for Local Government that what we have been saying for so long is correct?</P>

      <P>As I have already pointed out to the Deputy, the position in the construction industry and its peculiar nature is that any problems there cast long shadows before and especially into the area of apprenticeship training.  There is this problem of apprentices in the industry. The Minister for Local Government has been talking about his undoubted achievement in building more local authority houses this year and last year than in any other period since the second world war.  I think Deputies will agree that is an achievement in conditions of the present world recession.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 22:</P>
    <P>In page 25, lines 4 and 5, to delete &ldquo;consideration for the disposal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be helpful were I to come in here because there has been a great air of unreality about this amendment.  Section 26&mdash;and section 27 is allied to it&mdash;provides for exemptions to deal with the special problem of family businesses and farms.  They are not the kind of cases illustrated here this morning.  The suggestion has been made that the amendment be accepted because it is unfair to give total relief for transactions with a consideration of less than £50,000 and to impose tax above those levels.  Then there could be a bigger gain under £50,000 than on a transaction where the consideration exceeded £50,000. But we are dealing with cases of disposals of moderate businesses or farms after a lifetime's use.  The exemption is not available unless the asset has been worked for ten years before the transfer takes place.  Furthermore, the exemption can be enjoyed only by persons of 55 years of age and over.  Thirdly, it cannot be enjoyed more than once in a lifetime. We believe that consideration is the correct test and not the amount of the gain.  If one takes the cases of a consideration of up to £50,000, and there is a substantial gain, the probability is that the gain reflects the length of time the asset was held. Because the exemption is related to the disposal of a lifetime's work, as it were, we consider it appropriate that a substantial gain, which reflects the <Col N="553" /> longevity of the holding and the working, should be free from tax liability. From what has been argued from the opposite side on other sections, I believe that is a view to which they can subscribe.  It is in relation to those qualifications and tests for exemption that one must look at this amendment. Therefore, it will be seen that a great deal of the argument advanced for the better part of an hour this morning on this amendment, when set against those tests, collapses.</P>
      <P>Let us now look at some specific figures.  Supposing an asset is acquired for £10,000&mdash;and remember this is an asset which a man of 55 years of age or over is selling, under section 26, because he is retiring from business &mdash;he has worked it for ten years; he is over 55 years of age and can enjoy this once in a lifetime only.</P>

    <P>I want to give some specific examples. Supposing a person acquires an asset for £10,000; he operates the business for 20 years; he sells it for £45,000: he has a gain of £35,000 &mdash;that is under £50,000 and there is no charge to tax.  But supposing he acquires an asset for £10,000; sells it, after 20 or 30 years, for 55,000, if there was not the special provision in subsection 1 (a) (ii) of section 26, the tax would be £11,700.  But, because there is a limitation on the amount of tax where the consideration exceeds £50,000, the tax would be £2,500 only on a gain of £45,000.  We consider that is not inappropriate having regard to the long period over which <Col N="554" /> the gain would be likely to have arisen in the case of a family farm or business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 50 per cent of the excess over £50,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy Colley mentioned the case of a person acquiring an asset for £45,000 and selling it for £55,000.  Again, that would be taxed at the same level as the last case I mentioned&mdash;it would be £2,500&mdash;because the probability would be that such a gain would have made over a shorter period than the previous one which, though, larger, is being charged at the same rate.</P>
      <P>I think these are the correct approaches to the limited type of case with which we are dealing, that is, the giving of relief to people on retiring from their business.  In section 26 if it is a disposal to a stranger he will get the relief up to £50,000 consideration and under section 27 it is £150,000 if it is disposed of to a member of the family of the person retiring.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the effect of the amendments would be to give substantial relief to comparatively welloff people.</P>

      <P>In tabling his amendments the Deputy set the ceiling of £50,000 and £150,000 gain. The Deputy could have put down a gain of £10,000 or £20,000 if only he had given a little thought to the matter.  I assume that he has given thought to the matter and he has taken much higher ceilings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has exactly the same information as is available to the Minister for Finance or the Revenue Commissioners.  The information is available in the annual <Col N="555" /> accounts published by the Revenue Commissioners.  Time and again I have stated that the State has not got records of all the wealth disposals because there has not been a need in the past to keep these records and there has not been the means in many cases of detecting these movements. Therefore, there has to be a certain amount of speculation as to what the consequences may be but we know what the value of businesses may be. We challenge anybody to contradict that those with greater wealth are in a better position to pay tax than those with less wealth.  Nobody can deny that.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a capital gains tax, rather belatedly and subject to so many generous qualifications that it is hard to except that they are genuine&mdash;and the Opposition have said that they do not object in principle to a capital gains tax&mdash;we must have a level and thresholds.  It is appropriate that there should be exemptions.  We have set thresholds which we consider are reasonable, below which people will not be asked to pay tax at all in certain circumstances as set out in sections 26 and 27.  People above those levels will be asked to pay tax on the gains which are made.  In order to provide marginal relief so that there is not a sudden jump from the person who consideration above £50,000 we have provided marginal relief in subsection (1) of sections 26 and 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These considerations show that we pays nothing below £50,000 to the person who gets a gain and has a have correctly tailored the sections and we have adopted the correct methods.  It has been accepted by the Opposition that it is more convenito have consideration at the test rather than gain, and that convenience exists for the private citizen as well as for the Revenue Commissioners. There is finality about values when they are related only to the price at the time of disposal, but if all transactions had to be worried over by the person disposing of the property and if all transactions had to be examined in detail by the <Col N="556" /> Revenue Commissioners it would cause quite an amount of annoyance to the private citizen.  The private citizen would have to keep detailed accounts of all expenses on improvements on the property while the property was held.  It would cause a great deal of extra work for the private citizen as well as for the administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is conscious of the necessity to avoid imposing workloads upon the administration which would not be commensurate with the tax yield which such work would generate.  Bearing all these things in mind, and trying to strike a fair balance between the contesting issues which have to be considered, we have produced reasonable reliefs in sections 26 and 27.  We have properly gone for thresholds of consideration rather than gain because, in the special circumstances of sections 26 and 27, the larger the gain the greater is the period of ownership.  Therefore, the greater has been the lifetime contribution towards the maintenance and building up of the business.  If it is under £50,000 in section 26 it is not inappropriate that extra relief should be earned by the person who has worked and held the property for a longer period than the person who has had it for a short time.  Similar disciplines apply to section 27.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises how real and valid the Opposition's proposals in relation to capital gains tax turned out to be compared with the degree of confusion that lies in section 26 (1) (a) (ii).  It seems that the Minister could have got out of his difficulty easier if he had said that any person who having attained the age of 55 years disposes of the farm or business would merely be obliged to pay a lower level of capital gains tax on any gain realised. The introduction of consideration does not relate to any increase in value when an asset like this is being disposed of by a person who is retiring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person buys a farm for £20,000 or establishes a business of that value and 20 years later decides to retire and sells it for £80,000, under the subsection I have referred to the capital gains <Col N="557" /> tax on that would be £15,000&mdash;50 per cent of the difference between £50,000 and £80,000.  That charge would be equivalent to a capital gains tax of £60,000, if one takes half of the difference between the threshold of £50,000 and the selling price.  Deputy Colley's amendment is not directed towards the particular amount of the gain so much as to establish that the tax will be payable on the gain rather than at a threshold of £50,000 below which a person would have no capital gains tax to pay.  It is theoretically possible for somebody to buy a farm for £5,000 and, with inflation as it is, to sell it 15 years later for £45,000 and not have to pay capital gains tax.  The amendment highlights the sort of uncertainty that lies in this method being put forward by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is a certain sense of justice in asking somebody who has worked very hard over a long period to pay far less than somebody who has made a quick profit.  That is the real difference between the Minister's and the Opposition's proposals on capital gains.  It is totally ridiculous to require anyone to pay a flat rate of 26 per cent on any gain realised over a period of from five years to 25 years' hard work and on the other hand apply the same rate of tax to somebody who was very good in the market business, moved in quickly and made the same amount of money in perhaps six or 12 months.</P>
    <P>The philosophy behind the Minister's approach to capital gains is totally unjust.  It is not directed at what one may reasonably describe as exploiters, people who make money very easily, I urge the Minister to look at this section.  I appreciate that he is making an effort to be a bit fairer to the individual who has worked for a considerable time.  The minimum of ten years which has been inserted makes a distinction between the person who has worked and the person who has not. Such a person has made his money because he was able to juggle or had the knack of getting his eye on a good piece of property and making a quick profit on it.</P>
    <P>It is not realistic to talk simply in terms of leaving anything below £50,000 free and if there is a gain <Col N="558" /> on anything above that capital gains tax will be charged on it.  The Minister read out the figure of £55,000 and said that the tax on it would be £2,500.  I believe that type of case will cause more trouble than it is worth.  He should take a look at the thinking behind Deputy Colley's amendment.  The Deputy said he was not trying to spell out the amount of gain as that was a matter for the Minister.  He was trying to spell out something which would be more equitable than what is contained in section 26.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would also like to support Deputy Colley's amendment, which is to substitute the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo; for &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;.  We must look at the particular section in the Bill which comes under the category of special reliefs.  I believe the principle in this section is good but there is also a social reason attached to it. A man who has reached 55 years of age may decide, because of ill-health or because he has worked for a considerable length of time, that he wants to dispose of his property.  Certain consideration should be given to him.</P>
      <P>I believe the Bill would be very empty if it did not take into consideration people in that category who have contributed quite a substantial part of their lives to their business or farm.  Any Minister could not dream of coming into this House with a Bill like this which did not give consideration to this group of people. Unfortunately, the Minister is not precise as regards his beliefs.  We are discussing a Capital Gains Tax Bill and capital gains in general, but when we look at the section which gives special reliefs in relation to capital gains the Bill is not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave figures, if this particular section was not in the Bill, of what a person would pay on the disposal of this type of property if it was bought at a certain figure.  The Bill should be far more specific to deal with this category of people.  A man should be able to look at this Bill and say that if he has made a capital gain of £X he will be exempt or he should be able to look to the future when <Col N="559" /> he reaches 55 years of age and say that he will develop his property, plough back a certain amount of his capital, give his time to that property and know that he will be assured of getting something for his work.  This particular section does not say that. It only refers to a property which is bought at a very low price.</P>
    <P>Deputies Colley, Brugha and de Valera gave examples today of the anomalies which exist in this particular section.  A man could have bought a farm for £10,000 20 years ago.  He probably never worked that but let it on conacre during that time.  If he sells that property now for £50,000 he will be exempt even though he has made a capital gain of £40,000.  That is fair enough, but it is a different matter when we look at another situation where a man acquires a property when he reaches 45 years of age.  He may have worked hard all his life and accumulated capital or the property could have been left to him by some relative.  If that man decides to buy a farm at £40,000 he has ten years to wait before he can qualify for this exemption.</P>
    <P>A man could decide that his wife and himself would run a farm, that for the next ten years they would plough back into it whatever profits they get.  They could expand that farm by building out-offices, fertilising the land and making it valuable.  It would probably be necessary for that man to employ people because he has expanded the farm.  He might decide to do this in the hope of selling it at 55 years of age believing that the money he has ploughed back into it would not be subject to capital gains.  The only amount of capital gain he can look forward to is the difference between £40,000 and £50,000 when he is selling the property.  There is no great encouragement to that type of man to plough back earnings or to spend his time and energy in expanding.  We are not confining ourselves to the threshold Deputy Colley has here, but if a man could see at 45 years of age that he could expand the farm, plough back earnings and spend time <Col N="560" /> building up assets in the knowledge that he would be entitled to make a certain figure of capital gain on which he would not be taxed he would have an incentive.  That is not being done here, or it is being done in a different way.  A man who was wise enough and had sufficient knowledge to acquire land in any area where he knew there would be industrial development and who held the land&mdash;the Bill does not provide that it has to be worked once it is held&mdash;would be exempt at 55 years of age.  Unlike the instance I gave earlier where a man ploughed back his earnings and spent his energy in creating assets, this man does not have to spend money.  If he has the information he can acquire say four acres of land for £10,000 at the age of 45 and hold it for ten years and he will be exempt at age 55.</P>
    <P>There are other sections of the Bill equally confusing, and whoever drafted these Bills has no knowledge of business incentive or what is necessary to generate it.  The Bill may present administrative problems&mdash;that theme runs through the Capital Gains Tax Bill, the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Bill.  Everything presents problems; we are here to solve them. Whether running a business or a Department we have problems daily.  It should not be too difficult to solve this problem.  If the Minister deleted the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and put a specific figure into the Bill people would know where they stood.  The Minister was able to do that in one section of the Bill where it is stated that a man or woman is entitled to exemption in any one year on £500 of capital gain. The only thing wrong with that is that it is too low but at least you know where you stand, and that is positive thinking which business people expect in a Bill rather than the woolly thinking that is here in &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; up to £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister should spell out what he wants to give a man who is retiring at 55.  Many farmers and business people will obviously be misled by this section in the same way as we were discussing last night in regard to getting valuations going back to our great grandfathers.  Many people acquire property at 40 or 45 years of age and <Col N="561" /> this section does not deal fairly with them.  It is all right if a man acquired property 25 years ago when land or property was cheap and when he was perhaps 25 years old.  Many people have not sufficient funds to acquire property at that age, and many will reach 40 or 45 before they have enough money to acquire property of this type. They get very little consideration and very little incentive to expand, and I would be more concerned about that. A man buying property at 40 or 45 would need to be a head case to plough back his time or money if he intended to sell at 55 years of age.  Unfortunately, one-third of the people will not even read the section but they believe there is something in the Bill for a man retiring at 55 years of age.  I can tell them that a man who purchases a property at 45 years of age and pays £45,000 for it will find damn-all in the Bill if he is to retire at 55.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Inflation or no inflation, there is only £5,000 that he can plough back into the business.  That is no encouragement. If the figure were £10,000, £20,000 or £30,000, something positive, the person concerned could make up his mind to work the property on the basis that he could make a capital gain of a certain figure and on reaching the age of 55 that gain would be exempt because this was provided in the Bill. But according to the Minister that would present administrative problems and that is the important thing with all these Bills; it makes no difference what happens the taxpayers.  To me what happens the taxpayer does matter, and I believe this Bill has the effect of damping down expansion&mdash;not just this section but various other sections which have the same philosophy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drafting a Bill such as this you should put yourself in the place of the person for whom you are drafting it.  I do not say you should please him but at least you will get your thinking right.  Recently, I was discussing the design of property with a man who was doing some building and I disputed the proposed layout.  I said, as I am saying now, that he should consider the frame of mind of the <Col N="562" /> person he was designing it for&mdash;it was required for a certain purpose.  I believe the Minister had something in mind here but as it appears in this Bill it will not work for the type of person about whom I am speaking, the man who is in the last ten years of his working life and wants to retire with his wife and, perhaps, buy a small house by the sea and who only got the opportunity of going into business at 45 years of age because he was not financially able to do so earlier.  Because of present inflation what business can be bought for under £45,000?  There is no concession in section 26 for that type of person. When we take inflation running at 25 per cent into consideration we see that it would be easy for such a person, if he never ploughed back anything, to get £60,000 or £70,000 when he sold the business.  It would have to make that much.  As far as the Minister is concerned, inflation does not exist.  There is no account taken of it in these Bills.  The Minister should accept Deputy Colley's amendment. We are talking about gains.  The Minister has brought in the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; because it suits him to bring it in.  It reads well in the Bill.</P>
    <P>A man who wants to retire at 55 may be under the impression that there are substantial exemptions for him in the Bill.  There are exemptions for a certain category only.  There are precious few for the type of person I am talking about.  If he wants to retire at 55 and goes to his solicitor I can imagine what will happen.  He will be told: &ldquo;You bought the property for £45,000 and you are selling it now for £60,000.&rdquo;  The man will say &ldquo;I thought there was a concession for people retiring at 55 years of age.&rdquo; The solicitor will tell him: &ldquo;Unfortunately under section 26 (1) you are only allowed up to £50,000.&rdquo;  There will be many people very disappointed when they find out about this section as the years go by.</P>
    <P>The more one goes through this Bill the more one sees the confusion that exists.  If it is confusing for us here it is certainly confusing for people outside the House.  It is quite obvious that the public will not understand <Col N="563" /> the Bill or the other Bills, particularly the Wealth Tax Bill, in regard to the thresholds and the anomalies concerning two single people as against a married couple.  The Minister refuses to accept that there are those anomalies. We are told about administrative difficulties.  That is the important thing.  The Minister does not mind about the taxpayer.  He will not understand it anyway.  He will think there is something good in the Bill.  I believe people should be told exactly what those Bills contain and their implications.  If the public knew what was in those Bills I do not think the Minister would have received the bouquets which he did receive when death duties were abolished.  I thought it was a great thing until I studied the other Bills.</P>
    <P>The Minister has failed to grasp the significance of Deputy Colley's amendment. A man retiring at 55 should be getting special reliefs in regard to capital gains but there are no special reliefs here.  What happens if a person buys a business at £50,000 and there is no increase in value?  I know of a business in this town that was offered for sale last week.  It had been purchased for £175,000 and the owner was offered £120,000 for it.  There is a consideration for you.</P>
    <P>I have been speaking about farms. The same applies to businesses.  A man going into business at 45 with the intention of retiring at 55 would be hoping to build up a little nest egg in the ten years.  If he looks at section 26 (1) of this Bill it will not encourage him to expand to any extent.  A person in business may work until ten or 12 o'clock at night.  How does one measure that type of work in money? It is very difficult for the Revenue Commissioners to assess it.  Many business people have to work 15 and 16 hours a day.  The smaller the business the longer the hours because in a small business it is not profitable to employ a large number of people.</P>
    <P>If the section were worded properly and if it were specific we could say to that person that he could plough back his profits into the business and <Col N="564" /> that he would be rewarded in the long run for the time he has spent in it. The section is not specific.  He will be told that once he sells his property and its value exceeds £50,000 he will be charged capital gains tax.  In those circumstances the person will reconsider his philosophy.  If I met him in the morning I would tell him exactly what his situation will be if he puts his time, energy and money into the business and intends to retire at 55 years of age.  There is no provision in the Bill for inflation.  It is important in the context of any Bill to tell the people the truth as to what it entails.  I would tell the person who purchased property for £45,000 and is now 45 years of age and intends to retire at 65 years of age what his position will be under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The time spent by a man in his business is of great importance.  We know how much has to be paid per hour to an employee.  Very few business people put a sufficient value on their time.  They draw a weekly salary from the business, enough to keep them going, and the rest goes back into the business.  If the average businessman were to draw his salary according to the hours he spends in the business the business would not survive, he would be closed down by the bank manager within a very short time.</P>
    <P>If I were drafting a Bill I would encourage businessmen, at least in the last ten years of their working life, to expand.  It is only by encouraging expansion that the economy can be uplifted. There is discouragement inherent in this Bill and in the other capital taxation Bills.  The businessman should be told that if he expands and ploughs back money into the business he will be rewarded.  If I were Minister for Finance I would encourage expansion on the basis that it would build up the economy and create more wealth and ultimately produce revenue and provide employment.  That is what we must try to do.  That is the direction in which we must proceed Instead, there is a negative approach, a socialistic approach, as if it will work. It will not work, and that is becoming more obvious every day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> I appeal again to the Minister to make at least this small gesture.  It is very small but at least it will show people where they stand.  The man whom I have specifically referred to, at the figure I have mentioned, £45,000, will know that there is something in it for him, some encouragement to work and to plough back his reserves.</P>
    <P>As a result of this Bill people will not reinvest money.  I can visualise business people taking the easy way out.  They will take weekends off and play golf.  The people who spend their time building up industry are the people who will uplift the economy. It will be a bad day when we all work from nine to five, take full salaries and wages out of businesses and spend it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is bent on a socialistic policy which is alien to our way of life, which is undermining confidence throughout the business community.  Ask the IDA what they think about confidence being undermined and the effects on the inflow of capital.  Ask any businessman what he thinks about wealth tax.  He will tell in no uncertain fashion his opinion of the wealth tax and the detrimental effect it will have on economic expansion.  These are the people one should talk to when drafting Bills.</P>
    <P>I am not against the speculator being taxed, but the Minister has the highest regard for the speculator as against the genuine working person. The section comes down in favour of the speculator.  If he acquires property and acquires four acres of land and holds it for ten years without working it or fertilising it, providing he comes within the specified period of ten years he will be able to make a profit of £40,000 if he sell it for a consideration of £50,000 having paid £10,000 for it.  The Minister is giving the speculator the very same concessions.</P>
    <P>We put forward amendments in the early stages of the Bill which would give concessions to a man who had spent a considerable length of time building up his assets.  We wanted to give relief on a sliding scale according to which the stage <Col N="566" /> would be reached where he would be exempt after 13 years.  The Minister said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  He is treating the shortterm speculator, the fly-by-night man, with the same leniency that he would apply in the case of the genuine Irishman. He is treating them both equally.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I would say with respect that the Deputy may possibly be ranging far away from the amendment in a manner which is not in order, particularly on Report Stage.  None of the matters to which he has made reference in the last 15 minutes refers to the amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Let us confine ourselves to section 26 subsection (1) which deals with the £50,000 exemption for a man of 55 years of age.  If a man can acquire four acres of land on speculation he is not required to work it, fertilise it or develop it.  He buys it at the age of 45 years.  He knows there will be commercial development around it and that it will become valuable property.  He can sell it ten years later, on reaching the age of 55 years, for £50,000 and make £40,000 profit. If that is not speculation within the context of this section, what is?  That is what this section says.  It also says that if he buys the property for £45,000 at 45 years of age and spends his time and money for the following ten years, and sells the property for £65,000, having spent money on it, expanded and built it up, he will still be allowed exemption of only £50,000, the same sum as is applied to the speculator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain amount of speculation in this section.  It comes down all the time in favour of the speculator. I do not know whether it is for administrative reasons or whether it is that the Minister has some special affinity for speculators&mdash;I am not sure which it is&mdash;but it is there in the section whether or not the Minister agrees.  That is the kind of thinking we have with regard to speculators where the Minister is concerned.  We have been accused over many years of protecting the speculator but the Minister can never again, in the light <Col N="567" /> of this Bill, make that accusation against us.  He is treating the speculator the same as the hard-working businessman.  That is the substance of this Bill and many people do not realise it.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to have a fair and just Minister for Finance, a Minister for Finance with a social conscience. I cannot see any sign of a social conscience in this Bill.  If I did I would be the first to give the Minister credit for it, but I cannot give him credit for something that is not there.  Once more, I would appeal to him to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  It is one that would improve the section no end.  I appeal to him to delete the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.  I ask him to look at this in depth, see the significance of what I have pointed out and the psychological difference acceptance of this amendment will make.  If it is accepted a man will know exactly where he stands, let it be on the farm or in business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to cure considerable defects in section 26, defects which lead to very strange anomalies, to a number of which we have referred on this side of the House.  These anomalies arise because of the confusion of thought behind section 26, the confusion of thought to which Deputy Fitzpatrick referred.  This is a Bill to tax capital gains.  What do we find in this relieving section?  The relief is not related to capital gains in at all.  It is related to consideration, to the cost of the asset, to the price at which it is sold.  It has nothing to do with the gain.  That is the basic problem and that is how all the anomalies arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not as though the Minister found it impossible either in principle or administratively to give exemptions related to gain because that is precisely what he does in section 16; there he gives an exemption related to gain but here, when it comes to this exemption related to the disposal of a business or farm on retirement, the whole concept of gain, which is what the Bill is supposed to be about, is <Col N="568" /> thrown out the window and we get this consideration which means nothing in relation to gain.  As I said earlier, it does not matter how big or how small the consideration; that does not affect the gain, which can be large or small, depending on circumstances; and, of course, the principle involved is that this could be related to gain and, if that were done, there would not be any of these anomalies we pointed out.</P>
    <P>I must confess I have learned now in my dealings with the Minister not to be surprised by very much that he says on anything.  Despite that, I will confess that I was practically flabbergasted when I heard the Minister for Finance tell us, in justification of this section, about the very important principles whereby the reliefs and/or amount of capital gains tax should be related to the length of time for which the asset was held.  Goodness knows, we spent long enough trying to tell him this was the right principle.  We moved an amendment designed precisely to do that, to relate the tax payable to the length of time for which the asset was held, and the Minister refused the amendment and brought in the Deputies behind him to vote it down.  We pointed out that, by approaching it in this way, one was on the one hand taxing the speculator heavily and, on the other hand, recognising the value of the contribution of people, whether they be farmers or engaged in business, who had worked hard for years to build up an asset.  We talked at considerable length on this and the Minister refused point blank.  He gets up today and proposes that very principle as a good one to be followed.  If the Minister meant one word of what he said this section would, of course, provide that the exemption in it was related to the gain and that that was on a sliding scale related to the length of time for which the asset was held. There was no difficulty in the Minister doing that if he believed in the principle we put forward, the principle he himself enunciated today.  But that is not what is in the section and that is not what the Minister is defending.</P>
    <P>He is here defending a totally illogical and inequitable provision <Col N="569" /> whereby he purports to give relief to persons of 55 years, or over, who are disposing of a business or farm on retirement, but he is doing it in such a way that, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, in some cases people will get no relief and in others people who happen to be fortunate enough to make a very large gain will not pay any capital gains tax whereas others, at a slightly higher level, on a much smaller gain will pay capital gains tax of a very substantial amount.  There is no possible justification for this approach, none in logic and none in equity, and I would suggest none either from the point of view of administration.</P>
    <P>When I was proposing this amendment I went into some detail in regard to the supposed problems of administration both from the point of view of the Revenue and from the point of view of the taxpayer.  It is significant that the Minister, when he was replying and giving his point of view, simply asserted that there would be difficulties for the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer and made no attempt at all to meet the case I had put forward.  The Minister has admitted that the effect of this section, as it stands, will be that he will have no control whatever over the actual exemption that is given; in other words, the extent of the gain made by a person will be irrelevant to whether he is exempted or not and a man can have a gain, as I indicated in one example, of £35,000 and pay nothing and, in another case, on a gain of £10,000 he will have to pay capital gains tax.  There is no control at all in this section over that situation and there could be and should be such control.  Of course, if the Minister meant one word of what he was saying he would ensure that the exemption was related to the amount of the gain and, furthermore, that the exemption would rise in proportion to the length of time the asset was held. The Minister does not mean a word of what he says.  If he does, it is impossible to reconcile that with what is in this section and with his attitude on the very fundamental amendment <Col N="570" /> we put forward on the Committee Stage on this precise principle.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps, even compounding the iniquity of this section that the marginal relief which is provided in subsection (1) (a) (ii), to which the Minister referred, is itself related not to the gain, but to the consideration. The provision is that one will not have to pay more in capital gains tax than the amount by which the price one sells the asset exceeds more than half that difference.  The factors involved are: the price at which one sells and £50,000; one does not pay more than half the difference.  None of those figures relates to the gain.  There is no logic or thought behind this provision. This amendment has sought to introduce some logic, thought and equity into this section.  It is not as though the Minister had been taken by surprise.  This matter was gone into in some detail on the Committee Stage but he is persisting in this attitude. It is extremely regrettable that he should do this.</P>
    <P>The Bill has many retrograde and undersirable features, and this is one of them which will affect people who are disposing of their business or farms on retirement.  In some cases it will affect them quite seriously.  It could very easily have been so arranged that such persons would get relief related to the gain they made, and in recognition of the length of time they spent building up their farms or businesses.  The Minister refuses point blank to do that.  That is regrettable, but it is more than regrettable for those who will be affected by it&mdash;it is a serious hardship and inequity.  The responsibility for that hardship and inequity rests on the shoulders of the Minister and those who vote with him in the lobby. It will not rest on Members of this side of the House, because we have done our best on the Committee Stage and on this Stage to point out the difficulties, the remedy and urged the Minister to take this course.  He has refused to do so and on his head be it.</P>

      <P>In page 26, to delete lines 21 to 34, and to substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;qualifying assets&rsquo;, in relation to a disposal, includes the chargeable business assets of the individual which, apart from tangible movable property, he has owned for a period of not less than ten years ending with the disposal and the shares or securities which he has owned for a period of not less than ten years ending with the disposal being shares or securities of a company which has been a trading or a farming company and his family company during a period of not less than ten years ending with the disposal and of which he has been a full time working director throughout that period:</P>
      <P>Provided that there shall be taken into account for the purposes of this definition&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the period of ownership of a spouse of the individual as if it were a period of ownership of the individual,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> (ii)  where the chargeable business assets are new assets, within the meaning of section 28, the period of ownership of the old assets as if it were a period of ownership of the new assets,</P>
    <P>(iii)  where the qualifying assets are shares or securities in a family company to which paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 applies, the period immediately before the transfer to the company of chargeable business assets during which those assets were owned by the individual as if it were a period of ownership of the individual of the qualifying assets or a period throughout which he was a full time working director, as may be appropriate, and</P>
    <P>(iv)  a period immediately before the death of the spouse of the individual throughout which the deceased spouse was a full time working director as if it were a period throughout which the individual was a full time working director.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agreed, on Committee Stage, that there should be a provision to put beyond doubt that the period of ownership of qualifying assets of a deceased spouse should be added to that of the surviving spouse in applying the ten-year test.  This is done in respect of assets in paragraph (i) of the amendment.</P>
    <P>For directorships, continuity between spouses is provided for in paragraph (iv).  It was agreed also that where assets replaced other assets the period of ownership of the old assets should count so that, when the new assets are disposed of, the periods of ownership of both the old and new assets would be aggregated in reckoning the qualifying period of ten years. That is provided for in paragraph (ii). For this purpose the terms of section 28&mdash;that new assets are assets which replace other assets&mdash;are imported.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (iii) deals with the case where a business is transferred to a company.  In paragraph 6 of Schedule II there is continuity, for the purpose of base cost, on a disposal for <Col N="575" /> shares of a company.  Paragraph (iii) ensures two things: in the first place, the period of ownership of the assets of the unincorporated business is to be added to that of ownership of the shares of the company in reckoning the qualifying period of ten years of ownership of the shares.  In the second place, the period of ownership of the business is to be treated as if it were a period during which the individual had been a full-time working director.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I acknowledge that the amendment the Minister has moved meets a number of the points we raised on Committee Stage, particularly in relation to an amendment I had down and, I think, meets them quite satisfactorily.  However, there are one or two matters I should like to have clarified.  If I might refer to the Official Report of our proceedings in this House, on 21st May last, at columns 398 and 399, where I outlined a particular case I might quote because it illustrates the point on which I want clarification.  The quotation is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that a fairly common situation can arise in which this relief should be given but, in fact, in the section as drafted would not be given.  One such situation would arise where, say, a man had been a full-time working director of a family company throughout his working life. Then ill-health strikes him.  The normal pattern would be that he would try to carry on as long as he <Col N="576" /> could.  But ultimately he might well be told by his doctors that if he continues any longer it will probably mean his death.  Therefore, he does not have any choice.  He has to give up the full-time working directorship.  Of course, in the meantime, an effort is made to carry on the business.  Eventually&mdash; and again this is the common pattern&mdash;as a result of the absence of that man from the business, the business deteriorates until ultimately it becomes necessary, in order to avoid further losses, to dispose of it.</P>
    <P>Of course, the same thing could apply in the case of a farmer, as indicated in the discussion on the previous amendment.  But in either case&mdash;as the section is drafted&mdash;this relief would not be obtained because, in the ten years immediately prior to the disposal of the assets, the man would not have been a fulltime working director.  He might have been a fulltime working director for 25 or 30 years but, because of the ill-health situation and his retirement from the business for some time before it becomes necessary to dispose of the assets, he loses the benefit of the relief given in the section.  That is one situation.</P>
    <P>My concern in this regard is to ensure that, where the wife of a man who becomes ill takes over from him, she will get the benefit that would have accured to him.  In some cases that is provided for in the amendment; in other words, she steps into his shoes and the two periods of ownership are counted for the ten-year period.  That meets the requirement there.</P>
    <P>When we come to the case of the full-time working director, I am not so sure the amendment meets it unless the woman, who will eventually become a widow, is, or becomes, a full-time working director immediately the husband becomes so ill as to give up the full-time working directorship. In other words, if there is a gap in that period during which he was a full-time working director and she becomes a full-time working director, does the amendment ensure and, if <Col N="577" /> so, where, that the benefit of the relief will be given to her, as it would be given where there is not a question of full-time directorship but simply of ownership?</P>
    <P>My next query&mdash;I think the amendment covers it but I should like confirmation from the Minister&mdash;perhaps can best be dealt with by a quotation from the Minister, in response to points raised on this side of the House where he is reported in the Official Report of the 22nd May last, at columns 432 and 433, as follows:</P>
    <P>As far as this particular section is concerned, I am prepared to look at the possibility of amending the subsection in such a way as would ensure that in the case of people who have at the time of retirement assets which have not been held for ten years but which are similar to ones which were previously held the relief might be given.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give me his assurance that his amendment covers that case, including the case of farmers.</P>

      <P>In relation to the first question posed by Deputy Colley, I dealt with the matter on the last occasion, when I explained that the <Col N="578" /> Revenue Commissioners interpret the law in a humane way.  They do not send inspectors around after people who are indisposed to ascertain whether they are in full time control of or in full time management of their businesses.  In the circumstances described by Deputy Colley they would not refuse the exemption provisions of sections 26 or 27 because a person was, through indiposition, less able to devote as much attention to the business as he would have had, had he been in the whole of his health.  There would be no difficulty about the succession of the spouse to the spouse who died or the spouse who became ill and was unable to attend to the business on that account.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 26, after line 47, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>27.&mdash;Where a widow disposes of a farm or business which she acquired on the death of her husband, such disposal shall be free of capital gains tax in respect of so much of the consideration as does not exceed £50,000.</P>
      <P>This is similar to an amendment we had on Committee Stage.  However, the provision of the amendment which the Minister has brought in obviates the necessity for my amendment.  Contrary to the position obtaining in the section, where a widow is left a business or a farm by her husband under the section if she disposes of it she would be liable for capital gains tax without the reliefs which are provided in cases similar to that.</P>
      <P>It seems that the effect of the previous amendment is to place the widow in the position of the husband for the purpose of qualifying for the ten year period of relief.  If that is so it does not seem that my amendment is necessary. Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to confirm that my reading of the previous amendment is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A widow aged 55 years will get relief on the disposal of a farm or business within the family <Col N="579" /> for a consideration of up to £150,000. The age limit has been set at a comparatively low level&mdash;much lower than most retirement ages specified here before&mdash;and the relief will be available at a time when the widow would normally be expected to have a child in a position to take over from her.  In those circumstances a further extension would not be justified.</P>
      <P>It seems that if the Deputy's amendment was accepted it would require no condition as to age or disposal to the family.  The only condition would be that of widowhood.  In view of the exemptions given in the Bill any furthere extension would not be warranted. The purpose of sections 26 and 27 is to keep property within families and in the majority of cases that is the anxiety of a widow.</P>

If a widow is disposing of an asset outside the family presumably she would make a gain, otherwise there is no charge to tax. If there is a gain she will be charged with the tax at the rate of 26 per cent on the appropriate gain and she will still have the original capital cost and 74 per cent of the gain also.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I welcome that amendment. We do not have to stretch our imagination too far to see where this situation can arise as regards the time limit of ten years.  As the Bill stood if the husband died after five years the widow would not qualify if she had to dispose of the property during that time. If she held it for an additional five years she would qualify as regards the time.  However, that amendment is of no significance in its own right.  We are aware that a wife is usually five or six years younger than her husband, and this pattern has obtained in regard to marriage here over a number of years.  In spite of what the previous amendment gives to the wife this would not solve her problem.</P>
      <P>We are placing widows at a disadvantage here.  There are plenty of examples of where a man had built up a business without the assistance of his wife in that business.  We all know of cases where a wife has no knowledge of the business her husband is concerned in: she has had to devote her time to rearing her family.  This can happen in agriculture just as it can happen in business.  In this type of situation the previous amendment brought in by the Minister would be of no help to that widow.  Under section 26 (1) to qualify for this concession you must have attained 55 years of age.  I am speaking about selling outside the family circle, in case there is any confusion about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> That is true.  We have a situation here where this widow, who has no knowledge of running the business, will be forced to hold on to it until she reaches 55 years of age.  This could be for a period of 15 years.  The particular business I am speaking about is not very large.  It is not the type of business which is run by a manager and staff or by a board.  I am talking about a family business which was run by this woman's husband. When this man, who was complete manager of the business, dies and the widow tries to carry it on it often turns out to be a complete failure.  It <Col N="581" /> would be much better for her if she disposed of that property shortly after her husband's death.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill, unless she is 55 years of age, this woman is subject to capital gains.  This is a big weakness in the Bill especially where the widow is concerned.  If the Minister does not amend this here I hope he will bring in an amendment in the Seanad to cover this particular type of case. There are not many people in this category but they are people who deserve the consideration of this House. The widows I am talking about have spent all their lives since they got married rearing their families and left the running of the business entirely to their husbands.  Consideration should be given to such widows so that it will not be necessary for them to reach 55 years of age before they come within the qualifying benefits given in section 26.</P>
      <P>The other amendment giving the widow credit for the number of years her deceased husband spent in the business, if it is five years, so that she will only have another five years to wait before she qualifies for the ten years, will not be of any great significance, because the majority of widows will have qualified within their own right of ten years before they reach 55 years of age and benefit under this section.  The Minister should think seriously about this particular amendment which can be changed to fit into the type of situation I have in mind.</P>
      <P>We have given concessions to a man, irrespective of whether he is a bachelor or a widower, who has spent ten years in his business to enable him to qualify when he reaches 55 years of age.  I can see merit in that although it does not meet the way we consider it should be assessed.  It is quite understandable that a man can easily carry on his business and qualify under this section.  It is no problem to him if he is in fairly good health. Even if he is not the fact of his presence without working is sufficient to enable the business to be carried on and get within the time limit of 55 years of age and having it in his possession for ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The widow I am talking about will certainly not be left with this option. <Col N="582" /> Quite often she has no knowledge of the business when she steps into her husband's shoes and the business often goes broke.  If that woman is forced to hold on to a business&mdash;and she is only 45 years of age&mdash;until she reaches 55 years of age, it would be very bad for her.  If she is not capable of running the business it will only go downwards from the day she takes over.  It will be found by the time she is 55 years of age that the assets will have deteriorated and considerable debts will have mounted up.</P>
    <P>An opportunity should be given to this widow to dispose of a certain part of her assets up to £50,000 and get the relief.  I do not believe there will be any great avoidance in relation to this.  It should be possible for the Revenue Commissioners to devise a system whereby such a widow is exempt if she finds herself in this situation.  I ask the Minister to delete 55 years for this particular type of case I am talking about.  Deputy Colley and several other speakers in relation to a previous amendment pointed out the anomaly in relation to the ten years.  The Minister should now consider the proposal I am putting to him and take into consideration the circumstances in which a widow can find herself.  There is also the case of a widow who is entitled to something under her father's will. Under the Succession Act she would be automatically entitled to 50 per cent, I think, but if the father made a will whereby the remainder of the assets were distributed among the sons and daughters this would force the widow to sell at the age of 45.  There would be no choice then as regards capital gains tax although the business might be worth only £50,000.  There are many other anomalies if one studies the Bill and went into the various examples that could be put forward.  I ask the Minister to consider those I have put forward and make some concession to a widow who would find herself in that kind of situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous amendment moved by the Minister met a number of points we had brought <Col N="583" /> forward on the Committee Stage and it gets rid of a number of difficulties and anomalies which would otherwise have applied in the case of widows who have attained the age of 55. The problem is not solved at all in the case of widows who have not attained 55.  There are two broad categories with which I would be concerned&mdash;there are others, of course&mdash; in the case of widows who have not attained the age of 55.  The first is the case where the husband dies having been running a business or a farm, and the widow is left, not having sufficient knowledge or skill to run the business or farm.  If she continues the business would simply deteriorate and in effect she is forced to sell the asset, but because she has not attained 55 years of age she does not get the relief under this section or the next section and she becomes liable for capital gains tax at 26 per cent.  I think many people believe that in many cases of this kind the widow would not be liable at all because, first, there is the question of the transfer on death from the husband to the widow and that does not attract capital gains tax.  But there is also the belief that there is a generous exemption limit in regard to inheritance tax.  That relates only to the property passing to the widow and not to a situation in which she is, through economic circumstances, forced to dispose of it.  In such an event she would be liable for 26 per cent capital gains tax.  There is a very good case for consideration of the widow who is in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other broad category with which I am concerned is where, in the case we have described of the widow under 55 years of age, she transfers the assets to a child or children of hers.  In that case one does not expect money to change hands because she is not in the position of having the liquidity to meet the capital gains tax; nevertheless, even though the transfer is to her children, because she is under 55 years there is no exemption and the liability for capital gains tax at 26 per cent arises.  I would strongly urge the Minister to <Col N="584" /> consider these categories, particularly where circumstances arise in which the widow finds herself forced to dispose of the asset.  In a case like that I think there is a very strong reason why special provision should be made in this Bill to give relief to the widow, and I strongly urge the Minister to consider this amendment.  Does the Minister wish to say yes or no?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 26, lines 52 and 53, to delete &ldquo;consideration for the disposal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have discussed similar amendments in relation to an earlier section and I do not wish to go over the same ground again but, perhaps, taking these two similar amendments separately will at least afford the Minister an opportunity, if he wishes to avail of it, to reply to the very cogent case put forward on the similar amendment in relation to the previous section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly, the case was and is that to relate capital gains tax or relief from it to anything other than gain is not only illogical but produces inequities.  It is possible for the Minister to so amend the section as to relate, in this case, the relief to the amount of the gain and ideally to the amount of the gain with rising thresholds related to the length of time for which the asset is held.  I have added that proviso about rising <Col N="585" /> thresholds related to the length of time for which the asset was held because the Minister astonished me on the last occasion by arguing very strongly in favour of this, having resisted that argument on the fundamental approach to the Bill which we had put forward early in the Committee Stage.  Since he did put it forward in relation to a similar amendment I am pointing out that if he is prepared to accept that principle it would give us considerable satisfaction and would improve the Bill enormously.  He can do this by relating the thresholds based on gain, not consideration, to the length of time for which the asset was held.  This can be done and it will mean that there is a direct control over the level of exemptions, not a blind situation which related to consideration and you do not know the extent of the gain you are exempting.  Further, I invite the Minister on this occasion to do what he did not do the last time, that is, to deal specifically with the difficulties he said would arise both for the administration and the taxpayer.  Just to refresh his memory I would point out that, in regard to the administration of the matter, we are dealing here with the assets which in the normal way have to be registered; details have to be given to the Revenue Commissioners concerning them; and even if there were no capital gains tax legislation, in so far as the Revenue Commissioners have to look at a transaction and decide whether in this case the amount of the consideration exceeded or did not exceed £150,000, the Revenue Commissioners would normally, if they saw the details of the transaction showing the consideration to be less than £150,000 and had no reason to be suspicious, they would accept this and go no further.  If, on the other hand, apart from having reasons for suspicion, they constituted, as I would expect them to do, spot checks in cases like this, the position would be no different if in fact, what was involved here was the amount of the gain and not the amount of the consideration. If it were the amount of the gain, as we seek to include here, <Col N="586" /> again, I would suggest, exactly the same procedure should be followed by the Revenue Commissioners.  Where the details furnished show the amount of a gain to be below whatever threshold was fixed they would, if they had no reason to be suspicious, accept it, but they would also have to apply spot checks, as they would where consideration is attached.  From that point of view there is no extra administration involved.</P>
    <P>If they are investigating, they have to discover what is the consideration and what is the gain.  There is no point in their investigating if they do not go into that question.  To do that they have to know the cost of an original acquisition, and the mere subtraction of the one figure from the other gives the gain.  If the criterion involved were gain, they would have to do the same thing.  However, even if some additional work were involved, I do not think the Minister can seriously suggest that the volume of the work would be such as to make this unworkable, unwieldly or a tremendous burden on the Revenue Commissioners. If he does suggest that, he has an obligation to spell out in considerably more detail than he has done up to now what the difficulties are that he sees.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that, from the point of view of the taxpayer, the use of consideration rather than gain made the matter simpler for him. That argument is a fallacy because the taxpayer, perhaps more than anybody else, even the Revenue Commissioners, is concerned with the gain he is making, if he is making a gain, and the ascertainment of the gain will certainly not be a major difficulty for the taxpayer.  If the taxpayer knows that at a certain level of gain he is entitled to exemption, he will have all the more reason to want to know what the gain is, even if he did not have other reasons, which he would have.</P>
    <P>The Minister's argument in regard to convenience or, to put it the other way, difficulties, either for the Revenue Commissioners or the taxpayer, are greatly exaggerated, and, indeed, in so far as there might be any difficulty <Col N="587" /> for the taxpayer, the fact that he has to ascertain the gain but by doing so can ensure exemption would be a price that he would certainly be willing to pay.  Any difficulties of administration which the Minister envisages are not, on the evidence he has given us so far, of any major significance at all, and are certainly not such as to justify throwing aside the benefit which can accrue from using gain as the criterion rather than consideration, thereby controlling the amount of exemption you are giving and ensuring that what you are doing will not create the kind of anomaly and inequity which we elaborated on earlier, where a large gain can attract no capital gains tax and a much smaller gain can attract the tax.</P>
    <P>All of these anomalies can be avoided if the Minister approaches the matter in the way we suggest.  However, as I said, I do not wish to go over all the same ground again and prolong the discussion on it, but I would hope that on this occasion the Minister would endeavour to deal with the arguments put forward on their merits and, in particular, if he relies on the difficulties of administration either for the Revenue Commissioners or the taxpayers, that he would be more specific in spelling out the difficulties he sees than he was the last time.</P>

      <P>It is three times higher.  We are providing for a situation again not of general disposal&mdash; and this is very important in relation to section 27&mdash;but disposals within the family.  We are dealing with the situation in regard to a person of 55 years of age where the assets have been held for ten years and where they are held for ten years thereafter by the beneficiary. This is an exemption clause. I think it would be totally wrong to amend it in the way suggested by Deputy Colley.  It would have this effect: it would confer exemption on people of considerable substance and would not give any additional relief to people of modest means.  If you agree with the principle of capital gains tax, you must surely accept that it must start biting at an effective level and not at such exceptional levels that it is only a handful of millionaires that are caught by it.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed in the Minister.  He tells us that we must start biting at some level.  I go along with that to some extent, but the Minister has said also that he is abolishing death duties and introducing a fair package of taxation.  The first argument I have in regard to the wording of subsections (1) and (2) of section 27 is that the Minister will make money anyway although the thresholds are fairly high.  He will make money because of inflation.  One of our arguments is that people who have property are of value in that <Col N="590" /> they contribute already by creating wealth and by providing the Exchequer with a considerable income. However, the Minister's mind seems to be directed towards discouraging such people, discouraging enterprise and drive.  That is the effect of his saying that we must start biting at some level and not confine these taxes to millionaries.</P>
      <P>The result of all this will be that the economy will have the worst of both worlds.  There is no point in pretending that we are applying social justice if, at the same time, we are discouraging enterprise and the creation of employment.  I cannot understand the Minister's thinking in this regard especially at a time when there is so much at stake for the economy and for people who have no jobs.  The Minister's action will not provide any jobs but will result in the loss of many.  He and his colleagues may have the satisfaction of saying that they went after wealth, but this can be done to a point where the 40,000 or so young people who will be seeking jobs shortly will have to go elsewhere because there will be no work available for them here.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Colley is proposing is reasonable, that is, that there should be some indication of the level of tax. The Minister has accused Deputy Colley of arguing that a gain of £150,000 should be exempt.  Deputy Colley is not advocating any such thing.</P>

      <P>Our proposals are not intended to annoy the Minister or upset his policy. They are constructive and intelligent. I am afraid his reaction to them will cause people who have provided employment and have created wealth to become fed up.  The Minister must get into his head that this country is not situated in the middle of China, that the people who need work here are largely provided with it by the people who have the energy and drive and are willing to put aside some money to create industry and employment. If the Minister persists, we will eventually reach a stage where the attitude in this country will be: &ldquo;I will not be continually hounded by the Revenue Commissioners who now want to get me on capital gains, on wealth, on gifts.  I am better off spending my money&rdquo;.  Deputy Fitzgerald talked about people who work 14 and 16 hours a day.  Are they to be discouraged day after day by the approach to enterprise and drive being displayed by the Minister and his colleagues? Eventually the Minister will have to answer to the electorate for his failure and the failure of his colleagues to provide jobs, to encourage enterprise.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We are discussing a capital gains tax Bill and we should be talking about gains not &ldquo;considerations&rdquo;. When we come to special reliefs in the Bill we talk about considerations but when we come to taxing and to finding the base at which a thing is purchased we talk about gains.  Deputy Haughey moved an amendment yesterday which would mean that the value of a property would be assessed at death when it would be passing on to the nephew or the son.  The Minister last night stated that the value would be taken at death where a nephew or a son took control of the property.  On this section it is not a consideration on death we are talking about.  The Minister is going right back to when the father or grandfather acquired the property.  That is the attitude of the Minister when he wants to get his capital gains tax.  I am more against the principle than I am against either of the two figures&mdash;£50,000 or £150,000 &mdash;because I am convinced now, seeing that the Minister would not concede on the £50,000, that there is very little hope of our succeeding with this amendment.  He would not even consider the case I put to him that an unfortunate widow forced to sell her property at 45 or 48 years of age would not benefit by the qualifying provisions in section 26.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am objecting to the method the Minister is using in taking the consideration and not the gain.  The Minister has changed his stance on many occasions to suit himself.  He did it in connection with the Wealth Tax Bill and he has done it in regard to this Bill.  Cash transactions are not allowed against a loss or a gain but in another section he changed his stance.  The same situation arises here.  He has <Col N="593" /> talked about the administrative difficulties involved in acceptance of the previous amendment.  In this type of transaction the Revenue Commissioners will scrutinise every transaction of this size to ensure that the size of the property is within the limits laid down in section 27.  The Minister is not taking the gain into consideration.  We believe this to be basically wrong.  The same principle applies irrespective of the size of the transaction.  It affects the larger transaction on a larger scale. Take a man operating at the level of £150,000.  I could quote the examples that I have cited already but the scale would be larger involving greater injustice.  Land could be acquired and a substantial benefit could be gained. The reasons I put forward on section 26 apply with equal force on this section. The Minister does not seem to have studied the proposition we put to him.  If he did, he would see the merit in Deputy Colley's amendment to delete the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.  It is obvious that the Minister is determined to have the Bill as he saw it in draft.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I thought the Minister was giving serious consideration to the suggestions we made as we discussed the various sections. I believed that the Minister would come back to the House with a substantial number of amendments in which he conceded there was certain merit.  I do not say that the Minister should introduce amendments to suit every one of our demands but I believed as we went through the Bill that amendments would be introduced on Report Stage to satisfy our demands to some extent.  The Minister has failed to do that.  By his failure to take into consideration our constructive criticism, the Bill when it passes will not be as we would like it to be.  We put our objections at the very early stages.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stray from the section, but I have the same objection to section 27 using the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; as I had on section 26.  The Minister uses this method to provide his type of technique for collecting tax.  We are talking about reliefs.  He uses the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;. <Col N="594" /> When looking for his tax of 26 per cent on property that passes to a son or nephew, he does not take into consideration passing on death.  He specifies very clearly where he will take his value from.  It is spelled out in the Bill that if the father purchased the property 20 years previously, that is the date on which value will be established for the purposes of taxation at 26 per cent.  This does not apply here.  The section is not specific.</P>
    <P>The Minister may contend that in section 26 and in section 27 he is giving concession in regard to £50,000 and £150,000.  There could be a situation where there would be no capital gain at all in property of this value.  In that type of situation a person can say to the Minister, &ldquo;Thanks for nothing&rdquo; because he is getting nothing in respect of a capital gain. That is what it cost him for the property and there is no capital gain included in the figure.  I have seen considerable devaluation of property over the past 12 months.  Ask any auctioneer or valuer as to what the position is.</P>
    <P>Inflation is running at 25 per cent. The Government have undermined the confidence of the business world, so that the inflation will not be counteracted.  The Minister should seriously consider Deputy Colley's amendment to delete the word &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.  The persons I have in mind in dealing with section 26 and 27 will then know what we are talking about.  As the sections are worded it is difficult to know whether the Minister is giving any consideration in regard to a gain or not.  It all depends on circumstances and it would depend on the time the property was acquired.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier, I asked that the amendments be taken separately from similar amendments down to the previous section.  I did that for two reasons.  First, because when we discussed a similar type of amendment on Committee Stage in relation to section 17 the Minister made great play with the fact that there they were dealing with moveable chattels <Col N="595" /> and the difficulties of administration which would arise.  I had, of course, similar amendments down on Committee Stage to sections 26 and 27 and pointed out to him that in those cases we were not dealing with moveable chattels, we were dealing with fixed chattels of which there was a record which had to be given to the Revenue Commissioners.  The Minister did not respond to that argument at the time.</P>
      <P>In case the Minister wishes to distinguish between what was involved in section 26 and in section 27, as he did on a previous occasion, I asked that they be dealt with separately so that we could deal with the arguments in relation to the different sections separately.  That was the first reason. The second one was that I realised that the position of the Minister was likely to be, as it turned out to be, that after he had spoken on the amendments to the previous section there were other speakers from this side and, because we are on Report Stage, he did not get an opportunity of replying to them and I thought it only fair to him that he should get an opportunity of dealing with the arguments put forward.  He did get the opportunity as a result of what I had asked the Ceann Comhairle to do earlier today, to treat this separately, but he did not take it.  He did not use it.  He did not attempt to deal with the arguments.</P>
      <P>I tried to save time in proposing this amendment by not going over all the ground again and, in particular, I did not repeat what I had said on Committee Stage, or what I said on similar amendments earlier today at the beginning of my proposing speech, and at the end of it, and when I was concluding which was that, of course, I was not proposing that if the word &ldquo;gain&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; the figure in the section should remain.  I explained <i>ad nauseam</i>, I should have thought, that I was not in a position to assess what the figure should be if &ldquo;gain&rdquo; were to be put in place of &ldquo;consideration&rdquo;, and my belief that the only person who could do that was the Minister with the benefit of the advice available to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> However, because I did not refer to this again, the Minister tried a silly L and H trick and tried to make out I was proposing that there should be an exemption in respect of a gain of £150,000.  The Minister knows just as well as I do that I was proposing no such thing, but that was the main part of the argument he made in response. I suppose it points to the paucity of argument available to him in the face of the clear logic and equity in favour of this amendment. I specifically spelt out the last time, and again this time, the details of the alleged problems of administration for the Revenue Commissioners and for the taxpayers.  I did it the last time and the Minister did not comment. He asserted that there were difficulties.  He did not answer the points I put forward.  I put them forward again on this section and specifically invited the Minister to comment on them.  He failed to do so.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, some significance in his failure but, at this stage, it being quite clear the Minister has no notion of even considering the arguments and the reasons put forward for the avoidance of the numerous anomalies he himself is creating, I think it is reasonable for me to comment on the fact that I believe that, because now there is a time limit for the passing of this Bill, the Minister really could not care less.  He is simply going through the motions and not bothering to deal with the arguments put forward.  He is entitled to do that. It is a tactic.  I want to remind him that the reason there is a time limit on the passing of this Bill is that I agreed, in good faith, with the Whip on his side to that time limit.  I agreed in the belief that the Minister would bring forward the amendments he indicated on Committee Stage, and also in the belief that he would genuinely try to meet the case put forward by this side of the House on the Report Stage and meet the arguments made, not as I said earlier, and as Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, in the naïve belief that the Minister would or should accept all the arguments put forward but that he would meet the situation in a <i>bona fide</i> manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> His performance on this amendment cannot be described as <i>bona fide</i>.  It was disgraceful, and I want to tell him now that he can tell the Whip on his side of the House not to come to me again seeking agreement on the conclusion of any Bill with which the Minister for Finance is concerned. He will find in the longer term that it does not pay to act in the way the Minister has acted.  You can abuse the good faith of the Opposition once but, if you succeed in abusing the good faith of the Opposition twice, then that is a black mark against the Opposition and I do not intend to have that black mark chalked up against me.</P>
    <P>I referred in passing to the fact that the Minister's approach to this matter was a Tory approach.  That seems to surprise or amuse him.  The Minister might try to think what word he would use to describe an approach to a Capital Gains Tax Bill which treated equally the speculator and the person who had over the years built up his business or his farm.  That is the Minister's approach.  I use the word &ldquo;Tory&rdquo; to describe it.  Maybe the Minister can think of a better word. I cannot.  Just in case he was mystified I will explain to him what I had in mind.  It is quite clear that we are simply wasting our time in putting forward this amendment and, indeed, a number of the other amendments.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister was at least giving some semblance of dealing with the arguments.  He has now apparently given up the effort at even putting a gloss or a veneer on it.  That does not mean we will stop, because we have a duty to perform as members of the Opposition, a duty particularly in relation to legislation of this nature, a duty we are discharging and, if I may say so, discharging in a way it never was discharged by the Opposition we had when we were in Government because they did not have either the time, the energy or the confidence. One of these was missing.  They never dealt with legislation in the way in which this Opposition are dealing with it.  If the Minister thinks that because he is now in a position where he knows he will get his legislation through by <Col N="598" /> a particular time, and he can therefore simply ignore the arguments put forward and make no effort to answer them, to explain his own position or his own thinking, he will, as I have said, learn in due course that that kind of response does not pay off.  In the meantime, it will not prevent this side of the House from doing its duty in relation to this capital gains tax legislation and, whether or not we are wasting our time trying to persuade the Minister, the record will show that we tried to make this a workable measure.</P>
    <P>We are trying to make it a workable measure in this amendment, which seeks to get some degree of straight thinking into the legislation rather than the muddled thinking which talks about taxing capital gains and, when it comes to exemptions&mdash; some exemptions, not all&mdash;ignores gains and talks about consideration, something that has as much relation to gains as chalk has to cheese.  That is the kind of logic we have in this section, this crazy logic that can be followed by the Minister for Finance.  We certainly cannot follow it and I doubt if many people can.  The Minister did not attempt to justify it, of course, on logical grounds, but we have sought to introduce some logic and some equity.  We have tried to relate exemptions to gains.  That would seem, on the face of it, to be a reasonable and acceptable principle but, as far as the Minister is concerned, apparently it is not.  In due course those affected will have the opportunity of judging whether the Minister's or our approach is reasonable.</P>

      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, was speaking on the budget last Friday he said that the absence of so many Deputies from the House showed that they were tired of the budget and were doing better work outside the Chamber.  That is probably true because most people are tired of the budget.</P>
      <P>It is depressing to realise that the deficit since the last budget is now £240 million.  What is more staggering is that this year we had to borrow £842 million.  Naturally this money must be repaid.  When one realises the amount of interest which must be repaid on this large sum, one realises the rake's progress type of Government we have.  It may be argued that this budget is subsidising foodstuffs and taking VAT off certain articles. The Minister is subsidising electricity because he had previously given the ESB permission to increase their charges.  Even so, people will now be paying more for electricity.  The Government may say that if they had not taken that action the people would be paying even more.  To my mind, this represents typical Government thinking on financial programming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people were very sore at the suggestion that the trade unions and employers should revoke the recent national wage agreement.  Fianna Fáil have always been in favour of national pay agreements.  As a matter of fact, we initiated them.  When the national pay agreement was being negotiated, the Government knew the financial state of the country.  Yet they sat back and let the Employer-Labour Conference hammer out the agreement, got the trade unionists and employers to vote on it and it was carried.  All that time, the Government knew that the country could not afford this agreement.  They now come along and tell us that they are introducing food subsidies and taking VAT off certain foodstuffs.  They asked the Employer-Labour Conference to get together again to tone down or reduce the benefits which would accrue to the wage and salary earners from the national pay agreement.  That was a clever stroke because if the employers <Col N="600" /> and union leaders do not fall in with the Government plan to correct inflation, they will be blamed for whatever happens.</P>
    <P>Let us look at it another way.  The Government, having made a mess of the national economy, are looking around to find somebody to take the blame and they picked on the Employer-Labour Conference.  They are laying the blame for whatever happens at their door.  This does not instil confidence. If there is one thing we need more than anything else, it is confidence in ourselves, and confidence to lead us from the road to disaster. If the Government had been honest with the employers and the unions some months ago and told them the true picture, the people would have responded, as they would respond to good and honest leadership.  But, for some unknown reason, the Government decided not to interfere with the negotiations for the national pay agreement. Even then, people were wondering why the Government were not giving the conference information that they could not go beyond a certain figure because the economy could not bear it.</P>
    <P>The Government have become so accustomed to denying that anything is wrong that they could not resist the temptation at that time.  They deny our assertions that the construction industry is in a very bad way&mdash;20,000 people unemployed.  There may be a further drop in the number of craftsmen, helpers or people employed in that industry.  Yet the Government say there is no crisis in that industry. This type of reasoning has led the Government into their present trouble &mdash;their refusal to face the facts of economic life and to budget to correct those faults.  We will have to pay for that, and pay dearly.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in this House that we may have to face yet another budget.  We may have to face much more than that, because in his statement the Minister threatened further cut-backs.  He said:</P>
    <P>The Government intend, therefore, to adopt a policy of moderation in regard to non-capital expenditure generally in order to conserve scarce resources for productive <Col N="601" /> purposes.  The naïve notion that all can be provided by the State if enough clamour is generated will have to be replaced by a patient realisation that nothing more can be provided until extra resources become available.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is being naïve.  I suggest it is the Minister.  He also stated:</P>
    <P>Existing expenditures are being reviewed to identify those that might be curtailed or eliminated.</P>
    <P>He said that some things will have to be shelved until the present economic difficulties have been overcome and resources once more become available to meet additional costs.  There is a threat there to certain organisations and to different bodies receiving money from the Exchequer.  There is a threat of a cut-back.  It will not need another budget to do this.  The Minister has stated this, and tomorrow the Government might decide to cut-back grants for the IMI or people like that.  Nobody is exempt.  The Government can say that the Minister spelled out what they were going to do.</P>
    <P>They have insulated themselves against any clamour.  The Minister anticipates clamour but says he will not give in to it.  Nobody would say that a Minister was wrong in not giving in to clamour at certain times, but it would be wrong if he deprived some of these bodies who are doing such good work of grants or subsidies and told them to look elsewhere. Where else could they look at such short notice?  Even if they could find some other source of revenue, surely it is a breach of faith that only a few months ago in the first budget this year there was no mention of this.</P>
    <P>This part of the budget is being played down.  The Minister should spell out what he means.  Despite a certain amount of ambiguity there is a threat.  All the bodies who receive money from the Government should be trying to find out where they will get the money to keep going. Even at this late stage, the Minister and the Government would be well advised to withdraw the budget and to say to the Employer-Labour <Col N="602" /> Conference and the other bodies aimed at in the budget: &ldquo;Things are so bad that we have to work out a new budget together&rdquo;.  They should be honest with the people.  Otherwise we will have to face a very trying time.  People have lost faith in the Government's handling of the economy. They no longer believe, if they ever did believe, the publicity men who portrayed the Government as the Government of all the talents.</P>
    <P>The Minister appealed to the patriotic fervour of the people to rally behind the Government to restore prosperity.  We were told that the first budget this year would curb inflation, regenerate our lagging industry and revitalise the economy. Many people believed that.  Even members of this House believed it. This second budget has shown us how bad things are.  It is not long since a sum like £842 million would be the total expenditure in a budget.  In this budget that is the amount we will borrow this year.  It gives us no satisfaction on this side of the House to say things are bad.  We know they are bad.  Even making allowance for the fact that there is a worldwide slump in trade things are worse here in proportion to other countries. European countries are arresting their rate of inflation.  The United States with their rich vast economy are also checking this rate.  It may be said that it is foolish to compare this country with giants like the United States, West Germany and France. The point is that those Governments have taken action in the right direction, and they are arresting the drift towards complete financial anarchy towards which we seem to be heading. Perhaps it is the knowledge of what happened in the 1920s in Germany which forced the Germans to adopt a realistic attitude towards inflation.  Those of us who are old enough to remember the 1930s will recall that things were bad then.</P>
    <P>Today things will be even worse unless the Government drop their silly pretence of dealing with the economy and provide a real economic programme which the people will back because they believe in it.  The Government must first remove the <Col N="603" /> doubt which exists in the minds of people that this second budget this year is not the last.</P>
    <P>I do not bemoan the fact&mdash;and I never did&mdash;that there is a deficit in the budget.  The interests of people come first rather than trying to make a very neat bookkeeping entry with both sides balancing out which might hide hunger and desperation.  Each day people seem to be losing the will and the energy and the dedication to back the Government in their fight against inflation.  This is no wonder because they feel betrayed.  They feel the Government have led them astray and that they can no longer trust them.</P>
    <P>Some concessions were given in the budget which might ease the burden on the people generally, but they realise that these concessions could be eroded by the still growing rate of inflation or by the inactivity of the Government.  While those concessions are welcome, we know that this budget will not lead towards economic reconstruction. It does not give any hope to the 100,000 people unemployed, or to the people who are worried as to whether their jobs will last much longer.  When a Government lose the confidence of the people, they have a duty either to examine their policies and see where they have gone wrong and correct them or to go to the people as the final arbiters on whether or not they want a change of Government.  I could go on talking about the benefits which would arise from a change of Government.  At the moment the economy is in such a very bad and parlous state that it will take every effort to correct the rot which has set in.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to look back and ask: where did we go wrong?  We might say: this is the conflict between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  But, somehow, I do not think it is.  I do not think Fine Gael have become imbued with some sense of socialism or that the Labour members of the Government have become conservative. It is merely lack of a policy: there is not that dedication or ability within the Government to get down, with the help of economists, in saying: this is <Col N="604" /> the programme suitable to our needs which we believe will not alone stop inflation but give people some hope that we can reduce the number of unemployed to minimal proportions.</P>
    <P>Anybody going through these Financial Resolutions and finding something that gives them hope is welcome to it. I saw one good point only in the budget, and that was the employment premium.  That was a good provision and one that should be expanded and explored further.  But I think also that it is outweighed by the deficiencies of the budget; in other words, that that good provision may well be negatived by the forces omitted from the budget on which the Government failed.  This time next year, if the Government are still in power and continue the same economic policy, the unemployment rate may well have increased considerably.</P>
    <P>Of course, it may be said that we have no emigration, but we do have some because, traditionally, our people have always emigrated to Britain or the United States.  At present there are not many openings in either of those places but more of our people are heading for the European mainland and, once that emigration commences, it is very difficult to stop it.  Over the years we have suffered from emigration and unemployment.  Indeed, it makes one shiver to ask oneself: are we heading back to the days of the late 1950s when, in this city, we had almost solved our housing problem, not because we had too many houses but too few people?  I can see that happening again unless the Government get down to business, not that of placating any section in the Government by paying tribute to their economic idealism&mdash; whatever that may be&mdash;and it is not beyond the comprehension of men of average ability to assess just what is wrong and set about developing our own resources.</P>
    <P>The Government may contend that the rates granted in the recent national wage agreement were too high.  I am not an economist by any means but I feel always that too much stress is laid on wages and not sufficient on production.  If a man earning, say, £50 a week can produce goods to that amount at least&mdash;allowing for <Col N="605" /> other overheads on them&mdash;if one pays him more and he produces more, that is the answer rather than pleading for cut-backs in wage or salary demands and contending: this is your inflation.  Inflation has been described as too much money chasing too few goods.  I know economists may differ on that.  But there are ready markets for lots of our products throughout the world, or at least amongst our EEC partners, if we can produce them at the right price.  But simply suggesting that a cut-back on the national wage agreement will constitute a solution to all our problems is very negative thinking and will not get the Government out of their present difficulties. Rather, through a policy of industrial reasonableness, we could approach the trade unions, workers and employers, and say: we have got to &ldquo;up&rdquo; the national output; we have got to become very competitive; we have got to turn out goods so that our people can buy them.  And we have a proud tradition in the quality of our goods.</P>
    <P>I feel that our people buy inferior, imported articles only because they are so cheap.  Therefore, in a period of raging inflation, people who might think better otherwise, who want to be good Irish men and women and buy the home-produced article, may find it beyond their means.  Therefore, they go for the cheap, foreign article.</P>
    <P>Most of us could pursue a policy of purchasing Irish-made goods more consistently than we do at present. People generally, and traders in particular, could ensure benefit to the country by insisting on buying our own manufactured articles.  We can all relate stories of going into shops trying to buy some article, of clothing particularly, and the difficulties we experienced in trying to find an Irish-made article.  Perhaps it is the profit margin on the foreign made article that makes it more attractive to the trader to sell.  That is something that might be examined in any price control policy.  I do not think that has ever been undertaken.  While the National Prices Commission do examine each application for price increase, I do not know whether they <Col N="606" /> examine the profit margin of the article concerned.  That is an aspect of price control that might pay us very well to have examined.</P>
    <P>Therefore, with regard to the sale and promotion of Irish made goods we might well decide that we will get our traders to push their sale.  Since we joined the EEC it may not be fashionable to be insular about one's own products, but I think that is a very foolish notion.  Even though the German, Frenchman or Dane may feel part of the EEC, he will still retain his native pride in buying the products of his own country first, and those of others afterwards.  That is understandable.  It would be even more understandable here, we being the smallest unit, apart from Luxembourg, in the EEC.  The EEC Commission, in its wisdom, allowed us certain concessions because of the state of our economy and the fact that it has not yet been fully developed, as is the case in some other countries.  Surely they understand our Government pushing the sale of native goods.  It is unfair to suggest that this should be done by the Government alone.  Every individual should buy Irish, but the Government should tell our people that if we are to get our men and women back in employment we will have to buy our own goods.  The Government should ensure that Irish goods are available at prices people can afford.  The quality of the vast majority of Irish goods is very high and it would pay people to buy them rather than buying shoddy foreign articles.</P>
    <P>The Government plans to cut-back on everything should be dropped.  It is a negative approach.  I wonder what the reaction of the trade unions will be to the proposal that the national wage agreement should be revoked or rescinded.  I accept that unions are responsible, but it should be remembered that they have a responsibility to their own members.  Some months age they had to give and take in working out the agreement.  They accepted certain figures but they are told now that they cannot have them.  If the unions rap the Government over their delay and their procrastination <Col N="607" /> in this matter they cannot be blamed. The success or otherwise of this budget depends on the acceptance by the employers and unions of a change in the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>What will happen if the unions do not accept?  What will happen if they insist on the agreement on the basis that they obeyed the wish of the Government when negotiations were in progress?  It should be remembered that we could have had a free-for-all in wage bargaining but, because of the wisdom and the patriotism of the trade unions and employers, a national wage agreement was prepared.  Many hours were spent preparing this agreement and we were all grateful when it was accepted.  The people accepted the agreement as a good one because they realised that there are influences outside the country which dictate to us certain economic trends.  If the national wage agreement is altered will any trade union in future have the temerity to ask members to sanction a new agreement on the basis that it has the blessing of the Government? I am sure they will reply that in 1975 an agreement was prepared, with the blessing of the Government, but after a while the Government said the workers could not have the increases.  This kind of thing shakes the faith of people in a Government.</P>
    <P>While no country can have a perfect Government we expect our Government, on a broad issue like this, to stand by an agreement reached.  It may be difficult to do it now, but what is wrong is the fact that the Government refused to participate in negotiations for a national pay agreement. After the negotiations had been completed the Government told the unions and employers that things were so bad that the country could not afford the agreement.  The Government said that they would introduce certain food subsidies and remove taxes on certain items, but they put it up to the unions and employers to forego parts of the agreement so that the Government could balance their budget or prevent the country going into absolute chaos.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of a Government to <Col N="608" /> rule.  The trade unions and employers are not the Government although they play an important part in the life of a country.  It is wrong that the onus should be thrown on them of accepting responsibility of whether or not this budget will work.  If the trade unions agree to cut back a certain amount it will not solve our problems. The budget is wrong and it constitutes wrong economic planning.  My views on this are respresentative of many people in the city, and they cannot all be wrong.  With the exception of the employment premiums the economists who advised the Government on this budget were well out.  It is easy to say that because the world economy did not come up to expectations we went wrong.  We have no guarantee that the world situation will improve although we get encouraging reports from the United States, and from other European countries.  It should be remembered that, compared with those European countries, our economy is poor.  The workers in Europe have a higher standard of living than we have.</P>
    <P>In view of the action taken by the British Government to restrict wage increases will our Government tell the trade unions here that if they do not cut-back enough British goods will be cheaper here?  The Government should withdraw this document and get down to drafting a blueprint for prosperity. Unless the Government elevate their sights we will be accepting the same old things again&mdash;the high rate of unemployment, the ever-increasing cost of living, the despondency and the lack of confidence in ourselves. We need a blueprint for the future. The Government should be prepared to say that they will stand by any agreement.  Had the Government warned, some months ago, that they would not stand by the wage agreement the trade unions and employers would have taken a different approach in the matter.  It is not surprising that they are cynical when they hear advice from the Government as to what should be done when the Government do not know what to do themselves.  If the economy is to be damaged irreparably by some of the <Col N="609" /> blunders made the Government should ask themselves where they stand in regard to the future of our people.</P>
    <P>They must be convinced that their policy is not getting us anywhere.  It is not reducing unemployment by even one person or a dozen people.  We fear, and I am sure the Government side must also fear, what the figure will be in the autumn when there will be a fall in what is called seasonal employment. What will be done for the young people who are leaving school and cannot get jobs?  This afternoon the Minister for Labour told us what AnCO are doing.  They are doing a fine job, but when one considers that the total number of people being retrained is so low it gives one no confidence. We realise how bad things are when we see a semi-State concern like the ESB having to let their apprentices go.</P>
    <P>We pointed all those things out to the Government a long time ago.  When we told them what was hapening in the construction industry we were abused for daring to suggest this, even though we showed from official Government figures that there were 20,000 people unemployed in that industry.  When we told them the ESB had let some of their apprentices go and we showed that the private sector of the construction industry was in a bad way we were told that everything was in apple-pie order.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Government have given an extra £10 million to the house building industry and they have told us that the banks will give £40 million in housing loans.  When one examines the bank figures one realises that if somebody can afford a loan he has no need to go near a bank.  Even if the Government had a document which said that things were bad at the moment but their policy would cure all these ills we know that it would not.</P>
    <P>We may have a third budget shortly, which will add more taxation to an overburdened public.  It will just be a further stop gap which will hold off the doomsday which now seems to be facing us.  It gives nobody any satisfaction to be a prophet of doom because we all suffer by it.  When one is a politician it does not save his <Col N="610" /> family or friends from the depression we are in.  Life can be made very intolerable for people on a fixed income when they face ever rising costs.  I know that the Government have given some concessions to help people out, but we all feel in our hearts that things will get worse because the Government have not got the ability to grapple with the problem.</P>
    <P>Can the Government see what our basic problem is?  I believe it is that we cannot record any worth-while economic growth.  Until there is some growth in the economy we will go on devising ways and means of keeping people on some kind of State pension.  I heard unemployed people being criticised in the House because they were not working. Only a very minute section do not want to work.  The vast majority of people want to have gainful employment. It is good for the moral fibre of a people to be employed.  Any normal human being wants to devote his talents to some employment, whether he is using a shovel or working a computer.  A man should be given an opportunity to exercise his ability to create wealth for himself and his fellowmen.</P>
    <P>The Government are not encouraging growth.  They are doing a holding up operation in bringing in at least two budgets in a year in the hope they can stave off the day before the whole lot comes tumbling down.  Various suggestions are put forward by the Government about what they should do.  One canvassed at the moment by some members of the Government parties is that we should break the link with sterling.  While one feels this might not be a bad idea, surely it is an important matter on which the Government should say yes or no?  There has been mention of this by the Minister on occasions, but I have never seen a definite statement by the Government saying if they intended to sever the link with sterling.</P>
    <P>We live so close to Great Britain and we trade so much with that country that if we broke the link with sterling it would have great repercussions here.  I, with my lack of knowledge of the matter, say that we should break the link, but then the <Col N="611" /> experts might not agree with that. One of the famous presidents of the United States said that the experts were very often wrong.  I know that the task before the Government is not an easy one, and they should take it much more seriously than they have done up to now.  I believe if they have to bring in a third budget that democracy will suffer.  Not alone will the Government parties suffer but the democratic institutions of Parliament may suffer grievously because people can become impatient with such dithering on the part of the Government and demand real action.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people do not want riches.  They want a reasonable standard of living.  I do not believe it is beyond the wisdom of Government to so frame our financial policies towards that end.  We have had many times a much higher rate of unemployment than most European countries.  I cannot understand why we cannot become just as prosperous as the Danes, the West Germans, the French or any of those other countries.  When one visits those countries one sees the very high standard of living in them. We look around for this magical formula which makes those countries prosperous.  Generally speaking, our people work as hard as anybody and, indeed, because of some defects in our organisation they have to work harder than Europeans.  That is why I stressed that the Government were failing in this budget to encourage production.</P>
    <P>The potential of Irish industry and agriculture is great but the Government are so busy trying to stop leaks in the economy due to their own policy that they have no time to produce an instrument for economic development to give us some measure of prosperity.  It sounds crazy to me to have 20,000 people unemployed in the building industry when in this city alone the corporation housing waiting lists show over 5,000 families or individuals in need of proper dwellings. There are people in the Dún Laoghaire or county area also waiting. It is sad to think that men and women, particularly men, must wait for the day when the economy picks <Col N="612" /> up again before they can go back to gainful employment.  We are paying men, say, £25 a week in unemployment benefit, and a man with his family will struggle along with that, but surely the Government could devise some way of using their resources to give that man an extra amount per week and say: &ldquo;We would much rather have you working, building houses or factories.&rdquo;  The satisfaction for a man to know that he is wanted again in society would be great and the fact that he is off the dole and back in productive work helping to create wealth and can see a finished building which will mean that some families will have a better life, would boost his morale.  Instead, we sit back and say: &ldquo;We cannot help it; outside influences are too great.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government should have some confidence in themselves and in the people and say: &ldquo;We will inject sufficient capital into the construction industry to get the industry going at maximum potential.&rdquo;  That could apply to other instances also, but the construction industry is the national barometer of economic progress or otherwise.  Men should be put back into productive work in the construction industry.  I have heard much criticism of office blocks but I am not against them <i>per se</i>.  I object when they replace houses, but many a man earned good money and pursued his craft building office blocks, factories, churches or houses.  When we see 20,000 unemployed in that industry the Government should withdraw this budget and go back to the employers and trade unions.  They should take the people into their confidence and say: &ldquo;We will mould a new weapon in a financial policy which will be designed not only to get us through the present slump but which will be a blueprint for prosperity in the near future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister's appeal to the patriotism of the people will succeed if he can convince them that the Government are in earnest, that their policies are the right ones, but let us not talk of prosperity around the corner or tell the people they are not really badly off.  There are certain <Col N="613" /> facts that are depressing: we have over 100,000 unemployed and a deficit of £241 million and we have to borrow no less than £840 million this year.  The Government could still save the day, but it must first drop this budget and confer with the various interests so as to have their backing before the next budget&mdash;not after it.  They should be fair to the trade unions and employers and say: &ldquo;To save the country, we need your help.  We think the wage increase should be £X.&rdquo;  The Government should get the co-operation of these bodies to join in a great stride forward. Otherwise, if this budget stands and even if the trade unions and employers agree to forego their wage increases it may not be enough. The Minister has sown doubt regarding the making of future national pay agreements, and some Government will pay dearly for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this budget; I think it is a realistic one.  I think it caught the Opposition somewhat on the wrong foot and that is their main problem with it.  Before looking at the budget itself a brief examination of the economic background in the past year or so is required.  Inflation has steadily increased since the mid-sixties but in the past few years the rate of increase has been faster.  Between 1972 and 1974 the bulk of the inflation could be attributed to external causes although part of it was domestic.  In the past year domestic causes of inflation have predominated, and this is why we must now tackle inflation.  We had not much control over external inflation, but domestic inflation has gathered momentum and if allowed to go on it would cause great hardship. Obviously, that is why this budget was brought in: inflation was rising to a dangerous level which would cause widespread unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economy is vulnerable in two ways.  In the sixties our economic growth was helped by the boom in the world economy.  In the 'sixties Europe was prospering and we tended to move along with that prosperity which was a tremendous help.  However, the growth of those years, for instance, <Col N="614" /> 1969 and 1970, the period of the Third Programme, was not as high as had been projected, because the growth in exports had not reached their target, so that instead of a growth rate of 8.8 per cent it was only 4.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is a clear indication that the slowing down in our growth had been coming for a considerable time and was not something which has just hit us overnight.  Part of the reason for our slow growth in exports was stagnation in the British economy.  Britain is our major partner, and once their demand slows down we are bound to be affected. This has been happening over the last number of years as a result of the falling £, which is again causing alarm in international financial circles.</P>
    <P>Another problem we must contend with is that we have been chasing high rates of remuneration for our labours. The tendency seemed to be to get what we could and worry about the effects afterwards.  The effects are now catching up with us.  We have to face the reality of being in a Common Market with the highly industrialised nations of the world.  They do not owe us favours and if we want to live with them we have to compete with them. This budget is seeking to curb the high demand for wages by subsidising various commodities which are in great demand by the housewife: bread, butter, milk, footwear and other items, the price of which were causing her concern.  These subsidies give the housewife greater purchasing power than she had and automatically slow down the rate of inflation with which we have had to contend over the last number of years.</P>
    <P>People talk about patriotism, but even for purely selfish reasons we must realise that if we go on wanting to pay ourselves far more than we can afford, the chickens must come home to roost and unemployment figures will rise. People have been asking, who governs the country and why did we not introduce tougher measures.  I believe that Governments lead and consult, and we can get more from people in that way rather than by laying down statutory regulations.  I am convinced that if we bring home the seriousness of the situation to the people they will respond in the right way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> That is why I am hopeful that the national wage agreement will be renegotiated on the basis of consideration for the country, for the unemployed, for the people who at the moment are feeling the full effects of inflation. The trade union movement have, over the years, been a very responsible body.  They were always concerned, and rightly so, with the welfare of their members, to achieve good working conditions and good earning power for them.  They will see from the evolving situation that a 25 per cent or a 28 per cent increase is not meaningful if costs are rising as quickly and if we are pricing ourselves out of world markets.  If that continued we would be in a doomsday situation, and I feel sure the trade union movement will advert to this.</P>
    <P>The employers also have a responsibility to respond to negotiations and to put forward concrete suggestions on how they can achieve higher growth rates and create more jobs.  The Government have given a first-class incentive by way of the £12 for people taken off the live register.  Firms might be in a position to develop but might feel they could not take on staff at this time.  This incentive will create the right atmosphere for the taking on of staff.  Then when the time is ripe and when this recession has passed and world markets are opening up again, these firms will be in a position to move in and will not find themselves lagging behind because of lack of trained personnel.  There is no doubt that things will improve.  They obviously are not improving even in the highly industrialised countries as quickly as was hoped.  We were one of the countries most vulnerable to the oil crisis.  I know people will say we are blaming the oil crisis for everything, but of all the EEC countries we are the most dependent on imported fuels.</P>
    <P>The high prices we have had to pay have affected our balance of payments considerably.  Many of the oil-produc-ing countries are now developing their economies as a result of the increased prices they are getting and they are <Col N="616" /> buying products from some of the more sophisticated European countries. Unfortunately we are not benefiting in this way.  As a small country we are vulnerable in this respect and consequently we must be always endeavouring to seek trade.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a planned economy.  It has been said that in a high inflation situation it is difficult to plan since figures projected for, say, this year could hardly come up to expectations. However it should be possible to devise a plan.  We have sufficient expertise for this purpose.  As somebody pointed out recently the problem regarding some of the previous plans was that they were based on a four-year period, at the end of which time they were reviewed so as to ascertain whether they had been successful. What we need is an on-going economic development plan, a plan which would be reviewed each year to take account of the various factors&mdash; inflation, and so on.  Planning programmes of this kind instil confidence in the country, especially in business so that industrialists and others will themselves plan for expansion.  We must realise that during the coming years many people will be leaving the land and that there will be greater mobility within the general employment area. This is accepted throughout the western world and it means that there must be continuous training and retraining for new industries.</P>
    <P>The IDA have played an admirable role in bringing industry to this country.  They have every right to be proud of their achievements.  AnCO, too, have been doing tremendous work in a relatively short period in the field of training and retraining.  While there are some mobile training units in the country, there is need for them in many areas.  Now that moneys are available for this type of development from the social and other EEC funds we should concentrate our efforts in this regard. Technical training is very important. Our universities are turning out large numbers of academics for whom there may be no work while, at the same time, there may well be a shortage of technical and skilled people during the coming years.  This is an eventuality <Col N="617" /> for which we should have been gearing ourselves, because we should have known that there would be an overflow into this country as a result of our joining a sophisticated industrial market. We are on the border line of change in this respect, but the change must come quickly because when industrialists become interested in investing money in a country they ascertain whether there is a reasonable degree of expertise and trained work force available.  If we gear ourselves to this need we can be optimistic for the future of industrial employment here.  There will be a need for the creation of some new types of jobs to cope with the influx into the working arena.</P>
    <P>We should establish further colleges of technology, because the type of expertise we will require can be acquired in these institutions.  We must concentrate on regional policy and development and rid ourselves of our cityorientated attitudes so that there will be a greater spread of employment throughout the country.  Industrialists tend to look to the cities because they think that it is from the larger urban areas they will get a labour force.  Colleges of technology should be established in centres of population, other than the cities.</P>
    <P>Budgets are only on a year-to-year or half-yearly basis.  Whether budgets are every three months or every six months is not of great concern to me or to most people.  What is important is our planning for the future and how we can control inflation, and budgets have a part to play in this.  I hope this budget will begin to bring down the spiral which is certainly getting out of hand.  The employers and unions must now come together &mdash;the Government have given the lead&mdash;and must have a look at the national wage agreement.  Some speakers spoke about welching on an agreement.  If things are going wrong one should tackle them.  If the national wage agreement is not particularly right at this time because of high inflation let us have a look at it. We are not looking at it in an arbitrary way.  We have given the incentives. We have made it possible for the trade union movement and the <Col N="618" /> employers to sit down on the basis of the subsidies, on the basis of the removal of value-added tax from various items.  In those there is a basis for renegotiation.  They have meant a meaningful increase in the purchasing power of the housewife, and she was the person who was most vulnerable in the inflationary situation. She had to bear the brunt of it daily to make ends meet.  I know that housewives are very happy about this budget.  The last speaker said we should drop the budget.  Of course that just is not on.  The budget does not satisfy everybody but budgets are not intended to satisfy everybody. They are intended to remedy certain situations and attack maladies which exist.  This budget will go a considerable distance in that direction.</P>
    <P>One of our major industries is the building industry.  The banks have agreed to lend £40 million over the next two years for the building industry. That is first class.  The Government are injecting an extra £10 million. As I said here last week the building societies are again attracting considerable sums of money.  In two months last year the sum was £2.6 million.  In the corresponding two months this year it was £11.2 million. That is a clear indication that there is confidence in the economy and confidence in the Government.  It is now a question of getting the building industry in full flight.  Indeed it was never in the state in which a number of people on the far side have been saying it was.  We have built more houses since we got into Government than they built.  We built roughly 52,000 houses in two years.  In a climate of inflation, with costs rising, we were still able to exceed our targets.  With the further injection of £40 million from the banks and £10 million from the Government and the additional money flowing into the building societies there is no doubt that there will be quite a big development in that industry giving a much-needed impetus in employment.</P>
    <P>I always say that the building industry here is like the car industry in the United States.  When the car industry <Col N="619" /> in the United States is going well the economy is going well.  The same applies to the building industry in Ireland.  With the money now being pumped into it it will have a substantial employment content.  That is only one aspect of our economic life.  When that develops, the spin off from it will be experienced right through the economy and we will see a significant improvement in our whole economic climate.</P>
    <P>Some of the dismal jimmies now are talking about a rate of inflation of 18 per cent by next February.  When we consider that we are now in the area of 23 or 24 per cent that will be a significant drop, but it should be only a start in a programme of getting down to a realistic level.  People feel that high wages bring higher standards, but if they are not matched with productivity they certainly do not bring higher standards.  It is just higher costs all round and greater leaping of inflation which causes more unemployment, as we have seen over the last couple of years.  The Government have been couragous in tackling this inflationary situation.  They have laid the grounds for it.  We must look to the unions, the employers, the banks, the people to respond.  You can call it patriotism or anything you like.  Ultimately it is the people who will decide what they want.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The substance of the report laid before the House by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is that the committee has been unable properly to investigate the matter before it.  Deputies Molloy and Crinion would not produce evidence to substantiate their allegations against the Minister for Local Government made by them in the House this week. The Minister for Local Government made a personal statement in the House yesterday in which he emphatically denied the veracity of the allegations made against him by Deputy Molloy.  Deputy Molloy repeated the allegations again and in this was supported by Deputy Crinion.  The matter was then referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Minister for Local Government indicated his willingness to submit all relevant material to the committee which might help it in its task.</P>
      <P>The nature of the allegations directly affects the Minister for Local Government in the performance of his duties as Minister and the matter cannot be left unresolved.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has been unable to fulfil its task for the reason I have stated.  So, the question of the veracity of the allegations remains unresolved.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to ensure that the people are left in no doubt as to the veracity of these allegations.  If the Dáil cannot resolve this matter one way or the other, then the Government, acting in the public interest, must ensure that the facts are fully established.  Such allegations if left unchecked and unanswered must take from the authority of this House and damage the standing of a member of the Government elected by the people.  Accordingly, at the request of the Minister for Local Government the Government have agreed that a judicial inquiry should be held in accordance with the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 and, accordingly, I move the following motion:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance, that is to say <Col N="621" /> whether the following allegations made in Dáil Éireann by Deputy Robert Molloy and confirmed by Deputy Brendan Crinion on the 2nd July, 1975, affecting the Minister for Local Government are four:</P>
    <P>1.  That the Minister for Local Government has a business connection with a builder referred to as Robert Farrelly (otherwise James Farrell) of Rockfield Road, Kells, County Meath.</P>
    <P>2.  That the said Robert Farrelly (otherwise James Farrell) had an account with the Northern Bank in Kells to which cheques issued from the Minister for Local Government from his account in a Drogheda bank.</P>
    <P>3.  That such a cheque was issued every Thursday for payment of staff employed by Robert Farrelly (otherwise James Farrell) and was signed personally by the Minister for Local Government;</P>
    <P>4.  That some time after the 12th December, 1974, the said account of the said Robert Farrelly (otherwise James Farrell) was changed and that thereafter money paid by the Minister for Local Government was sent to the Ulster Bank, Athboy, Co. Meath.</P>
    <P>There is one typographical error in what I read out in the beginning after the words &ldquo;the Minister for Local Government are&rdquo; I used the word &ldquo;four&rdquo;.  It should be &ldquo;true&rdquo;.  I think it is a misprint.</P>
    <P>When this motion is passed by both Houses it is my intention to appoint a tribunal of inquiry pursuant to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  The tribunal will have the powers of the High Court to enforce the attendance of witnesses, examining them on oath.  The proceedings will be public unless in the opinion of the tribunal in the public interest it is thought expedient to bar the public for reasons connected with the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given.  I doubt if that will be necessary in this case.  I imagine there should be no difficulty about having all the proceedings in public.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="622" /> It is of the greatest importance that the tribunal be set up as quickly as possible.  I hope, therefore, it will be possible to conclude this motion tonight so that the Seanad which will be sitting tomorrow can also debate the terms of reference and pass the necessary resolutions.</P>

      <P>In so far as the report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges was inconclusive, I think it is only right that there should be a tribunal of inquiry established in order to ascertain the facts of these allegations.  The Taoiseach has moved under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  In the course of his statement he states four specific matters of urgent public importance that should be inquired into. Not being in possession of the Dáil Debates my only query at this stage is whether the terms of reference are comprehensive enough.  It seems to me at first sight that they are not, that there may have been other allegations contained in the Dáil Report which are not included.  I am making no specific point other than that I would like to be sure that all matters touching on these allegations will be inquired into.</P>
      <P>If the allegations can be substantiated, then they should be and if they cannot be substantiated, then the Minister should be vindicated in the interests of justice and in the interests of the good name of this House.</P>
      <P>I want just to make a short comment on the preamble which the Taoiseach read to the formal motion in which he said that neither Deputy Molloy nor Deputy Crinion produced evidence in support of their allegations. Of course, that is technically true but it ought to be pointed out that the Deputies asked when they were called before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges whether any statement they made would be covered by the privilege which attaches to proceedings in this Chamber and that you, Sir, stated that it was not certain that such privilege would attach.  I am pointing out that as a matter of record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned one typographical error and substituted the <Col N="623" /> word &ldquo;true&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;four&rdquo; at the end of the first paragraph. There is another typographical error in paragraph 3. Again, it is only a technical matter but in so far as we are dealing with a judicial tribunal it should be specific and clear.  The copy I have reads at paragraph 3:</P>
    <P>That such a cheques was issued every Thursday for payment of staff,</P>
    <P>
      <i>et cetera</i>
    </P>
    <P>and was signed personally by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>May I inquire whether we are dealing in this paragraph with a cheque or cheques?</P>

      <P>It is well to clear up that matter.  There is one other matter I want to refer to.  The 1921 Act refers to a tribunal which would have all such powers, rights and privileges as are vested in the High Court.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>A witness before any such tribunal shall be entitled to the same immunity and privileges as if he were a witness before the High Court or the Court of Sessions as in the case of Scotland.</P>
      <P>May I inquire from the Taoiseach whether, in fact, it will be a member of the High Court who will be comprising the tribunal or will be chairman of the tribunal if it consists of more than one person?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 27, line 40, after &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or assets acquired for the purposes of the trade and used only for purposes incidental to the trade&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This matter was referred to on Committee Stage and on 22nd May last, according to the record, at column 561 of Volume 281 of the Official Report, I referred to a particular decision in a British case and the Minister inquired as to the reference. I gave it to him and then I said: &ldquo;The Minister will look into that?&rdquo; and the Minister replied: &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo;. Since there is now no amendment in from the Minister dealing with this point I put down this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point at issue is that there is a phrase used in this section which is also used in the British legislation.  It is in section 33 of the British Finance Act, 1965.  The phrase used in the section is &ldquo;used and used only&rdquo;.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I understood this phrase had been interpreted in the British High Court and I gave the Minister the reference on the Committee Stage.  The judge dealing with the case said that he was not prepared to give any definition in regard to the words &ldquo;used and occupied&rdquo; in subsection (6) of <Col N="625" /> the British section 33 and the result was a refusal to allow rollover relief on an asset which, in that case, was land acquired for the purposes of the trade and disposed of on proving unsuitable for those purposes.  On the basis of that decision it was suggested to me that this section we are now dealing with should apply to assets acquired for the purposes of a trade and not used for any other purposes, unless they were incidental to the trade, in order to avoid the kind of situation which arose as a result of the decision in Britain.  I have, therefore, put down this amendment which seeks to insert additional words in line 40: after &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or assets acquired for the purposes of the trade and used only for purposes incidental to the trade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to cover the situation where assets were acquired for the purposes of the trade and were then found to be unsuitable for those purposes because of the circumstances of the particular trade and, as in the British case, were subsequently disposed of.  One would obviously have to be very careful in a situation like this not to open a very wide loophole, and I have sought in the amendment to restrict it by providing that the assets were acquired for the purposes of the trade and used only for the purposes incidental to the trade.  That should certainly prevent the abuse which could arise if assets could be acquired ostensibly for the purposes of the trade but not used at all for the purposes of the trade or for purposes incidental to the trade and then disposed of at a substantial gain. They would, of course, thereby escape, for the time being at any rate, liability to capital gains tax because roll-over relief would be available and it could be carried on.  One does not want to create a loophole like that.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, it is conceivable that in a genuine situation you could have assets acquired for the purposes of a trade but used for purposes, as I said, incidental to the trade, which eventually might have to be disposed of; it would seem that these assets would be liable to capital gains tax immediately and roll-over relief would <Col N="626" /> not be available.  In so far as the amendment would cover a genuine case and not open the loophole, I do not think the Minister would have any objection to it.  It may be that he will feel the wording is such that it might provide some kind of loophole and I would not like to contend with any degree of certainly that it will not open any loophole.  I do not think it will.  Consequently, if the Minister believes that the effect of the amendment would be to leave some loophole, I suggest that he should at least indicate his acceptance in principle of what is sought to be achieved here and undertaken to ensure that a genuine case will be catered for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Committee Stage I have examined the case of Temperley v. Visibell Ltd.  In that case the issue was as to whether or not land was being used, if it was not occupied as well as being used, for the purposes of the trade.  It was decided that, unless the land is occupied as well as used for the purposes of the trade, roll-over provisions would not apply.  The provisions in section 28 of this Bill have the same result unless the land is occupied and used for the purposes of a trade.  The decision in the British case depended on whether the land was used and occupied.  That is a matter for determination on the facts of each case.  The judge in the British case said: &ldquo;I find it impossible to say that the mere visits to the site, coupled with the intention to build and application for planning permission, can satisfy that section&rdquo;. The words in the section ensure that roll-over provisions will not extend to mere speculation in land.  In the light of the situation that arose in the British case it is felt that each case should be dealt with on the facts and on its own merits.  We are satisfied that genuine cases are fully catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;, as Deputy Colley anticipated, is one that contains so many uncertainties and risks that the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners would not welcome it.  &ldquo;Incidental&rdquo; suggests a certain element of accidental association. Its introduction into tax law could <Col N="627" /> generate a great deal of ambiguities which it might be better to avoid.  So far as the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; is understood generally, it means associated with a trade and the roll-over effect would probably apply.  I use the word &ldquo;probably&rdquo; deliberately because the facts of each case would want to be assessed.  One could not with certainty forecast what the Revenue Commissioners, the Appeal Commissioners or Judicial Tribunals might determine on the facts of any particular case.</P>
    <P>An asset which is used for operations which might be regarded as incidental to a trade, for income tax purposes is regarded as being used for the trade.  If an asset is used for, say, private purposes as well as business purposes, the provisions would not apply.  This would not create any difficulty for a company because a company's assets, by definition, are not available for private use; they remain the property of the company.  I am satisfied that this exclusion will not cause any hardship.</P>
    <P>Under subsection (6), what I might call mixed premises, which are used partly for business and partly for private purposes, are specifically dealt with, so that the roll-over provisions as far as the business premises are concerned can take effect.  These provisions will cater for the majority of cases in mixed situations of private and business use.</P>
    <P>In the case of plant and machinery which is not used fully in a business, but, is used intermittently, there will be no restriction on the availability of relief for such plant and machinery. The full roll-over provisions will be applied in such cases.  As I mentioned, in the case of companies there cannot be a mixed, private and business use situation, so no difficulty arises there.</P>
    <P>The provisions in section 28 are wide.  They cover most, if not all, uses of property which would be entitled to this roll-over benefit.  I respectfully say that in genuine cases no further relief is required.  We might be introducing undesirable ambiguity if we were to accept the words suggested in the amendment.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> There should be no ambiguity of any description in this section, which is one of the most powerful in the Bill.  It shows where a farmer or businessman can avail of the roll-over and the reinvestment in the same type of property.  Am I to take it that in the roll-over a man will not be entitled to the full concession?  I can visualise a case where a man who owns a farm sells it and reinvests the money in a different type of business.  What I want to know is: does he have to work that business himself?  It could happen that because of ill-health he would not be in a position to work the business.  This can happen to both land and property. The property may have to be leased and the land may have to be re-let on an 11 month basis.  Would there be any ambiguity or confusion here as to whether he would be fully entitled to this concession of the roll-over?  A change could take place where a man may not be able to work the land in which he has reinvested his money but would be getting a capital return from it in the form of rent.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to give general answers to questions of this nature, because we would have to look at the facts of each specific case. If the taxpayer is still engaged in a trade or business&mdash;he might not be personally involved in it, but one could see a situation where a trade or activity involves a person's attention for many hours and for health reasons a person might have to get out of that and put the proceeds of sale into another business which would involve less active participation&mdash;he would get the roll-over relief.</P>
      <P>In the Temperley case, the company had property for the purpose of building.  It was not property used in the course of any trade and on that account, it was not available for the purpose of a business or trade.</P>

I want to emphasise that the court has to decide on the facts of each case, whether a particular asset is genuinely an asset of the business to which the roll-over provisions would apply.  If the person conducting the business has other property or interests not connected with that business then it may not be available.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not want to delay the House on this section but I want it to be clear in my mind that the reinvestment will be allowed where there is this type of a change, especially when a man is forced through ill-health to invest in a property or buy the leasehold of a property that will bring him an income.  It might be a business property too but he may not be in a position to work it actively himself.  The Minister tells me that the Revenue Commissioners are not confined strictly within this section and that they can use their discretion to see if it accords with the spirit of the section.</P>
      <P>We will certainly find examples as time goes on of re-investments and people availing of roll-overs in section 28.  We may have confusion.  For that reason I should like clarification on how broad the scope is with regard to re-investment.  The Minister said the section is rather broad.  If the type of business I am talking about has to be occupied or has to be worked personally, that is where the difference would come in.  It may not be possible for the person who is re-investing in it to occupy it in the same way as he occupied his previous business.  The Minister seems to say he will be entitled to carry on the trade I have in mind.</P>

      <P>If it is not being used then it is not being used.  The distinction between user and occupation disturbs me if it has a connotation in regard to the section.  Deputy Colley's amendment refers to assets acquired for the purposes of the trade and used only for purposes incidental to the trade.  The section as it stands provides: &ldquo;If the consideration which a person carrying on a trade obtains for the disposal of, or of his interest in, assets&mdash;I am skipping the parentheses &mdash;used and used only, for the purposes of the trade throughout the period of ownership is applied by him in acquiring other assets...&rdquo; and so on.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that, if the distinction between user and occupation is valid as an argument against the proposed amendment, it is equally valid against the Minister's existing section so the objections to including the amendment will fall <i>pro tanto</i>.  I can understand the Minister feeling that the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; may well be enlarging his jurisdiction.  In so far as the distinction between user and occupation has substance, it is equally applicable to the Minister's section and to the amendment.  I am intrigued by the distinction.  Quite frankly I was not aware of it.  How far it goes in either case I do not know.  The Minister is proposing: &ldquo;...assets used, and used only, for the purposes of the trade throughout the period of ownership is applied by him in acquiring other assets, or an interest in other assets... which on the acquisition are taken into use, and used only...&rdquo; It goes on and the roll-over provisions apply.  If you provide: &ldquo;...assets acquired for the purpose of the trade and used only for the purposes of the trade&rdquo; you are not enlarging the section. You are doing something which Deputy Colley suggests would be beneficial.  I admit that there might be an argument on the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;. If you exclude the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo; you may have made yourself too limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are back to a point made frequently on Committee Stage, the enlarging of the provision sufficient to <Col N="632" /> enable the Revenue Commissioners to have, at the same time, a guideline and also a discretion to apply common sense and equity to the particular case.  That is the kernel of what we are at in this section.  Therefore, enlarging words of that nature are not dangerous; they are the conferring of discretion.  For instance, were one importing a clearly defined legal term, or a phrase judicially interpreted, the case might be different.  But, using a word such as &ldquo;incidental,&rdquo; which would be taken in its ordinary common-or-garden meaning, all one does whether it be the Revenue Commissioners in the first instance or any appellate jurisdiction thereafter, is to give the necessary discretion to decide what is the proper thing to do in such cases as occur in practice.  This is clearly a case where I do not think any widening can be done.  It is not as if one were conferring a right on the taxpayer here; one is not.  It would be very difficult to visualise a case where a plaintiff taxpayer, in any legal sense, would be able to plead, the phrase that Deputy Colley suggests should be inserted as having greater strength than what is in the section already.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be able to deal with it in this House, though in this case I think probably he could.  It might be something to consider in the next House to which it goes, always on the basis of achieving the double objective of giving a guideline and support to the Revenue Commissioners in this matter of relief, which is always the best approach where relief is concerned, and, at the same time, a discretion to meet equitably each case as it arises, not tying it to formality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I proposed the amendment I indicated that I thought there were genuine cases which might lose the benefit of roll-over relief if the section remained unamended.  On the other hand, I indicated also that I had no desire or intention of opening a loophole whereby people could avoid their proper liability to capital gains tax.  I think I could fairly summarise the Minister's attitude as saying that he believed the section, as drafted, does <Col N="633" /> cover the genuine case and that, on the other hand, the inclusion of the words in the amendment runs the risk of providing this loophole none of us wants.</P>
      <P>Again, as I said when proposing the amendment it is difficult to pronounce with any degree of certainty on this, and certainly I am not attempting to do so.  However, there is considerable force in the argument Deputy de Valera has just made, that since this is a restricting and restrictive provision, since the word &ldquo;incidental&rdquo;, as far as I know, has not been given any special or technical meaning, then if it were, as it would be, interpreted in its ordinary sense, the ultimate effect of the amendment would not be to create the loophole the Minister fears but rather, as Deputy de Valera says, to enable the Revenue Commissioners or any appellate jurisdiction to interpret the section in a way which would allow discretion in the genuine case.</P>
      <P>There is considerable force in Deputy de Valera's argument to that effect.  Nevertheless I am not in a position, nor do I claim to be, to pronounce with certainty on this matter.  It is important that we should have drawn attention to the potential problem.  If the Minister is still convinced that acceptance of the amendment or something on those lines would create a loophole, obviously he cannot accept either the amendment or something similar.  I do urge on him the force of Deputy de Valera's argument, but if he finds himself unable to accept it, it is not a matter I would push any further, for the reason that I am not prepared, and do not claim to be in a position to pronounce with certainty on what would be the effect of the section or the amendment.  One can only use one's best judgment.  But in matters of fine distinction of this kind, certainly I do not think any of us here would claim to be able to pronounce with absolute authority and certainty on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the force of Deputy de Valera's argument.  I would ask his to accept the amendment, or indicate his willingness to amend the Bill on those lines.  But if he is not <Col N="634" /> in a position to do so, I shall not press the matter any further.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 29, to delete lines 1 to 12, and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8) (a)  This section shall apply in relation to a person who carries on two or more trades which are in different localities, but which are concerned wholly or mainly with goods or services of the same kind, as if, in relation to the assets used for the purposes of the trades, the trades were the same trade.</P>
      <P>(b)  This section shall apply in relation to a person who ceases to carry on a trade or trades (the old trade or trades) which he has carried on for a period of ten years or more and commences to carry on another trade or trades (the new trade or trades) within a period of two years from the date on which he ceased to carry on the trade or trades as if, in relation to the old assets used for the purposes of one of the old trades and the new assets used for the purposes of the new trade, the two trades were the same trade.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is yet another case which proves my reasonableness and readiness to accept suggestions made by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate the point was raised, I think, by Deputy Fitzpatrick, that the original section did not provide for a situation involving more than one trade.  We are producing this amendment to ensure that there will be no limitation even though a person carries on two or more trades in different localities.</P>

      <P>It all depends on one's point of view, but I would have thought that this amendment was further evidence of efforts being made by <Col N="635" /> the Opposition to improve the contents of this Bill.  The fact that some of those efforts are meeting with success&mdash;not enough of them in my view&mdash;is welcome.  This amendment represents an improvement in the Bill brought about by the efforts of the Opposition.  In my view the amendment does a little more than the Minister said.  It is true that it meets the case I mentioned that the section as drafted dealt only with two trades. The amendment now covers two or more.  It was necessary, in order to introduce the phrase, &ldquo;two or more&rdquo;, to do redrafting.  That has been done but there are matters I should like to raise on this.</P>
      <P>During the discussion of this matter on Committee Stage I drew the Minister's attention to another aspect, the administrative difficulties and possible loophole.  That existed by reason of the fact that what was visualised was that if a person ceased to carry on a particular trade but within a period of two years embarked on another or similar trade then he would not be liable to the capital gains tax involved because he would be getting the roll-over relief carried forward over the gap of up to two years.  The Minister may recall that I drew his attention to possible difficulties in the sense that where the person ceased to trade he could, by indicating to the Revenue Commissioners his intention of embarking on another trade within a period of two years, apparently prevent the collection of capital gains tax.  I drew the Minister's attention to the possibility that by the time the two years had expired his assets might have been so depleted as to leave him not in a position to pay the tax.  Then he might not proceed into the other trade.</P>
      <P>I suggested to the Minister on Committee Stage that in addition to dealing with the point which he has dealt with here he might have a look at that possible loophole or danger to see if something could be done to avert that danger.  On the face of it it seems that the amendment is doing so, but when the Minister is replying he could clarify that and indicate his attitude in regard to the danger I have referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter I wish to draw the <Col N="636" /> Minister's attention to is in relation to some of the wording in paragraph (b) of the amendment.  I notice that there are in the amendment two phrases in brackets, &ldquo;the old trade or trades&rdquo; and the &ldquo;new trade or trades&rdquo;.  Paragraph (b) has these words in brackets to obviate having to refer to them, apparently, except in the terms of the words in brackets and, presumably, that is good enough as a purpose of definition. I note that further on in the paragraph where the words in brackets are used they are used in conjunction with the phrase, &ldquo;new assets and old assets&rdquo;.  There is no previous reference to &ldquo;new assets and old assets&rdquo; in brackets, and I am wondering if it is necessary to put the &ldquo;old trade or trades&rdquo; and the &ldquo;new trade or trades&rdquo; in brackets.  Should it not also be necessary to put old assets and new assets in brackets?  I am drawing the Minister's attention to this so that if a change is necessary it may be done in time.</P>
    <P>My primary concern is in relation to the other matter to which I referred on Committee Stage, the apparent gap in the administration with the attendant loophole.  What does the Minister think should be done in regard to that?  Does the Minister regard this amendment as dealing with that?  On my reading of the amendment I do not think it covers that situation, but perhaps it does in a more subtle way than might appear to show on reading the amendment on its face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of these cases where the change in form&mdash; I am not detracting from the Minister's co-operative and reasonable attitude in his approach to this amendment&mdash;is necessarily made but it seems to import some incidental changes of meaning that may not be intended.  It would seem that in order to implement the fundamental point, that it was not to be limited to two trades, a change in form of the section has taken place. Essentially the change in form is to be found in the taking of the last paragraph or clause as it is of the original subsection which applied to the paragraphs (a) and (b) together in the first subsection to give two independent paragraphs in the new section.  That <Col N="637" /> is a change in form but it can also, incidentally, bring in changes of meaning. This characterises both and applies to the original paragraphs (a) and (b).  In the substitute section proposed by the Minister now we find that that phrase is incorporated in paragraph (a) which reads:</P>
      <P>This Section shall apply in relation to a person who...</P>
      <P>There is no change so far.  It continues:</P>
      <P>carries on two or more trades which are in different localities,</P>
      <P>The only difference here is that the original had &ldquo;two&rdquo;.  If we interpolate after the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; in line 2 of page 29 the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo; we come to the first change.  The subsection then continues:</P>
      <P>which are in different localities, but which are concerned with goods or services of the same kind.</P>
      <P>The amendment introduces the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;.  In the amendment the words &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; are put in after &ldquo;concerned&rdquo;.  The section continues:</P>
      <P>as if, in relation to the assets used for the purposes of the trades.</P>
      <P>There is quite a change here because the interpretation of that in the original is much more doubtful.  The words &ldquo;old assets&rdquo; are used because this has to be related to paragraph (3).  The end of paragraph (a) reads: &ldquo;the trades were the same trade&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you parse paragraph (a) in that way the significant amendment made by the Minister boils down to two things.  The original paragraph (a) is simply amended by the addition of &ldquo;two or more&rdquo;.  Instead of restricting it to two it now reads &ldquo;two or more&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; is qualified by &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo;.  Thereafter, leaving out the words &ldquo;old assets&rdquo; and leaving out the ambiguity which seemed to be in the original section, the relation to old assets and the relation to new trades and other trades brought in a certain ambiguity as to whether it was referring to (a) or (b). <Col N="638" /> Omitting the words &ldquo;successively or at the same time&rdquo; may be justified by reference to paragraph (b) as it stands. It now reads:</P>
    <P>This section shall apply in relation to a person who carries on two or more trades.</P>
    <P>I believe our discussion has been justified in relation to this and I am glad we were of help to the Minister. It shows that constructive debate in the House can be of use to both sides. If one goes on with the parsing of paragraph (b) the way I did paragraph (a) the significant thing here is the omission of &ldquo;successively or at the same time&rdquo;.  Paragraph (a)  of the Minister's amendment relates to a person who carries on two trades simultaneously but it does not apply where there is a succession.</P>
    <P>In the case of paragraph (b) it may be argued that the Minister provides by postulating or providing that he will cease and commence at another period.  The Minister seems to have achieved a proper tidying up of the section but he has carefully avoided in this the proviso for &ldquo;succession in time&rdquo; simultaneity as an alternative in the first draft.  Is there a deliberate purpose in doing this or does this way he has dissected and recast the section?  In other words, by separating the case for simultaneity in different localities from succession has he restricted the operation of the section in any way?  It is quite clear, for instance, in his new draft that with the addition of the words &ldquo;or more&rdquo;, &ldquo;wholly or mainly&rdquo; he has clearly covered the case of simultaneous carrying on of a number of related trades&mdash;that is quite clear.  He also deals in the second section with successivity, when he speaks of somebody who carries on a trade or trades but are these trades in different localities?  Has he, for instance, restricted the operation there?</P>
    <P>It is a little more difficult on Report Stage than on Committee to do this kind of essential analysis in the House but I think it is essential.  Does the Minister get my point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In the original section, because it was used at the same time, simultaneity applies as well as successivity&mdash;to coin a queer word&mdash;in paragraph (a).  It combined this with &ldquo;different localities&rdquo;.  Is it clear that in the new draft paragraph (a) applies only to simultaneity in different localities?  Paragraph (a) is unobjectionable; it is a good amendment: I am not querying the addition of the words and it is difficult to see how you would import succession into paragraph (a).  That leads me to ask is there any reason for the omission? Or, is it accidental?  Is there any reason why &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; do not appear to be provided for in section (b)?  This may be quite accidental but, if so, I should like to draw it to the Minister's attention.  If there is a reason for it, I am sure the Minister will tell us.</P>
      <P>Reading the Minister's amendment we find no mention of &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; in paragraph (b): the two paragraphs stand on their own as if they were separate subsections.  The new draft is such that you could equally have included each of these paragraphs as self-contained subsections because they contain all the operative words. Therefore, simultaneity and &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; are provided for under paragraph (a) in the new draft and you have succession but no reference to &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of the new draft.  On the other hand if you take the original draft, in its very nature from the opening phrase stating its operation and in its final clause stating the effect of the application or what the application is, the words &ldquo;successively or at the same time&rdquo; and &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; are so linked as to, in all reasonable interpretations, apply to both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I have made the point clear I am not asking the Minister any more than: is this accidental or was it intended? If it was intended, is there any reason why the succession should not apply in different localities and is there any danger, in point of legal interpretation, that if this matter were to be tried in court, because of the contrast between the wording of paragraph (a) of the amendment draft containing the words <Col N="640" />&ldquo;in different localities&rdquo; and paragraph (b) a point might be made that the omission from paragraph (b) had a purpose and only applied to successive trades caried on in the same locality?</P>
    <P>I hope I have indicated what I mean.  It is a matter completely for the Minister, but if there was a reason why one would consciously exclude the extension to &ldquo;different localities&rdquo; in paragraph (b) it would be interesting to know it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This was raised on the Committee Stage of the Bill&mdash;broadening the scope as regards the investment. The Minister is right to introduce this section, which certainly gives broader scope to somebody who wants to avail of the roll-over, and it provides a much wider choice.  There is one part of the Minister's amendment that I should like to have clarified before going further and that is Section (b) of the amendment. Section 28 (3) of the Bill indicates to me that three years are allowed for reinvestment.  Subsection 3 (6) says:</P>
      <P>This section shall only apply if the acquisition of, or of the interest in, the new assets takes place, or an unconditional contract for the acquisition is entered into, in the period beginning 12 months before and ending three years after....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the Minister's amendment seems to be different and he seems to specify a period of two years.  He is not as specific in subsection (3) in the Bill and it seems to me there is a great length of time available for reinvestment under subsection (3) than the Minister is giving in his amendment. I presume that where there is direct reinvestment in the same property subsection (3) will apply but, by introducing this amendment, the Minister seems to be putting in certain provisos as regards a two-year period.  I believe this will apply to a man whose property is acquired compulsorily and I think the Minister will agree that anyone who has had property and has to reinvest may invest in an entirely different type of business.  If I am wrong I should like the Minister to intervene at this point.  My line of <Col N="641" /> thought may not correspond with what the Minister is trying to do in this amendment but, as I see it, the amendment specifies within a period of two years while subsection (3) of the Bill seems to mean that you can invest up to three years afterwards.</P>
    <P>To reinvest in a property is a slow process and can often take a number of years.  I do not have to tell people in this House who have sold their property that it can often take a considerable length of time, far in excess of the two years provided in the Minister's amendment, to get back into business again.</P>
    <P>I believe this amendment will also apply to people who want to reinvest where their property has been compulsorily acquired by a local authority. Take a town in a remote part of the country where your property has been acquired for road widening by a local authority.  You have your private house and your children are going to school in that town.  You could be running a hotel, a draper's shop or whatever it might be.  The Minister knows as well as I do that very seldom would the type of property in which you would be interested come on the market in that town.  Your options there would be very limited, and it is not always possible to move 60 or 70 miles away to Dublin or some other city.  You have established your roots in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe that two years is too short a period to allow a person, especially one whose property has been compulsorily acquired to reinvest his money.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell me that this provision does not apply to this person if he is trying to get back into the type of business he was running before his property was compulsorily acquired.  He could be in the licensed trade or the hotel business and he might be advised by his doctor, now that the local authority has acquired his property, that it would be unwise to invest in that type of business again.  He might like the opportunity of reinvesting his money and it seems he would be confined to a period of two years under this amendment.  I am not sure why the Minister did not apply the same provision <Col N="642" /> as in subsection (3) of section 28 which gives a little more latitude as regards reinvestment, namely three years, although even the three years is not sufficient for reinvesting and going back into a particular business.</P>
    <P>People I know sold their property because they got what they thought at the time was an attractive price for it. Many such people have regretted that decision and if they had the property back again would never sell it.  They found that when they went out to reinvest their money it was extremely difficult, especially in the property business, to get back again, especially when they were confined to a particular part of the country in the circumstances I have outlined where property is acquired by a local authority.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage and on Committee Stage of the Bill I expressed the view that three years was not sufficient to avail of the roll-over.  Maybe the Minister was worried that the assets would be used and it would not be possible to recover the appropriate amount from the person who had sold his property.  He was probably concerned that by leaving it too long without being reinvested the money might be gambled or wasted.  That is an administrative point of view, but I am talking about individual cases I can visualise. I would prefer to see some arrangement whereby the Revenue Commissioners would be assured of their money, if it was not reinvested, by means of a provision written into this Bill which would at the same time, give the proper time to that person to reinvest his capital.</P>
    <P>There are people who will be fighting against this deadline of two years.  A year-and-a-half will have elapsed and they will have failed to reinvest their capital.  In such a situation bad decisions can be made as regards investment in business.  A price could be paid for property far in excess of what it was worth in order to keep within this amendment.</P>
    <P>As I have already said it is not easy to find a suitable property to get back into business.  In a remote part of the country or in a provincial town the number of occasions when a property <Col N="643" /> will come up for sale to suit your requirements will be very limited.  When the Minister takes his Bill to the Seanad he should at least give the same concession of three years which he has given under subsection (3) of section 28.  That will go part of the way towards what we seek here, but, as I said, I am not happy even with the three-year limit.</P>
    <P>I welcome provision for an option regarding two or more trades.  As drafted originally there could have been many problems, but since the Minister has gone so far now he could at least have brought subsection (3) into the amendment.  I trust that he will be able to tell me that the fears I have expressed are unfounded.  I should be happy to think that the time limit provided for in subsection (3) will operate also under this amendment.</P>

      <P>I, too would like to hear the Minister on this.  I welcome the broadening of the options in amendments (a) and (b) of subsection (8) to two or more trades.  I welcome, too, the inclusion of trades which are concerned wholly or mainly with goods.  This is followed through in subsection (b) by the inclusion of the words &ldquo;another trade of trades&rdquo;.  In this way the Minister is allowing for some degree of initiative, the sort of initiative that is needed if the Minister is to insist on having capital gains tax of the type being presented to us because this, in itself, deters initiative. These two amendments combined will help to encourage some degree of initiative for people who might be willing to engage in trade.</P>

However, should it become the practice we would have to enforce it is such a way as to prevent such loss of revenue, but I would not like to make the innocent suffer with the guilty or to impose what might be an unfair restriction in relation to the handling of one's resources pending reinvestment in trade or business.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera pointed out quite rightly that the two paragraphs stand on their own, that they are self-sufficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It removes the ambiguity which it could be said existed in the original draft.  The reason for using the phrase &ldquo;in <Col N="645" /> different localities&rdquo; in the first paragraph was raised in the course of our Committee Stage debate, specifically by Deputy Fitzpatrick, who I know is interested in trade.  It is not infrequent for people to carry on similar business in different localities, but where more than one business is carried on in the one locality it tends to be treated as one trade.  We wanted to show in that paragraph that the mere fact that similar trades were carried on far removed from one another would not deprive them of this benefit.</P>
      <P>The idea of succession is involved in the second paragraph and does not have to be spelled out because it refers to the replacement of an old trade by a new trade and that involves the idea of succession, without introducing that word.  The reference in paragraph (b) to different trades being carried on in succession means that although they may be carried on in different localities, they are not excluded from the benefit.  Where two or more trades are being carried on simultaneously it is necessary to introduce the cause relating to different localities to show they are not outside the relief.  If one ceases one trade and starts another, the question of its location does not matter.  It is a question of the succession in trades which is involved in so far as paragraph (b) is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was pressing the question of the two-year period in paragraph (b) as against three years in subsection (3).  He will recall that on the 22nd May, during Committee Stage, he and I were debating this question and concluded with some degree of agreement.  I said that we were providing in paragraph (3) for a case where a person disposes of assets or a business and acquires a similar business within three years.  When it is a case of the same kind of activity, it is much easier to treat it than the case we are dealing with in subsection (8).  During the Committee Stage I said that there is a big difference between a person continuing a business, disposing of assets in that business and reinvesting in it, and a person who disposes of an entire business and asks to have tax postponed until <Col N="646" /> such time as he becomes involved in a new business.  There is a case for having a shorter period in the case of a person changing business compared with the person who remains in the same type of business but is simply changing assets.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said he accepted there was a difference.</P>

Thus, if the value of shares in such a company is depreciated because of the transfer of assets out of the company an adjustment will be made in the costs allowable to a shareholder in respect of those shares in the same way as is done in a case coming under section 35.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I know what the intention is.  As the Minister has indicated, I did ask on Committee Stage that the shareholders in the Irish resident company be put on the same footing as the shareholders in the non-resident company and I know that is what the Minister's intention is.  However, I should like clarification as to how precisely this will work.  If the Minister refers to subsection (1) of section 35&mdash;we are dealing now with a resident company&mdash;that provided:</P>
      <P>(1)  If on or after the 6th day of April, 1974, a company which is a controlled company transfers an asset to any person otherwise than by way of a bargain made at arm's length and for a consideration of an amount or value less than the market value of the asset, an amount equal to the difference shall be apportioned among the issued shares of the company, and the holders of those shares shall be treated in accordance with the following provisions of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> In other words, to the extent that the gain is below market value a sum is added on equivalent to the shortage in market value and apportioned out among the shares and then the shareholders are treated as having got that portion of the gain.  That is the treatment provided in subsection (1) of section 35.  If the Minister looks at subsection (2) of section 36, it provides:</P>
    <P>Subject to this section, every person who, at the time when the chargeable gain accures to the company&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  is resident or ordinarily resident in the State,</P>
    <P>(b)  if an individual is domiciled in the State, and</P>
    <P>(c)  holds shares in the company,</P>
    <P>shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as if a part of the chargeable gain had accrued to him.</P>
    <P>Am I right in thinking that under subsection (1) of section 35 the whole of the amount by which the transaction is below the market value is apportioned amongst all the shareholders&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas, in the case of the non-resident company under section 36 only so much is apportioned out as relates to shareholders who are resident in the State or, if an individual, domiciled in the State?  Would that be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 36 (2) a shareholder who is resident or ordinarily resident in the State, who is domiciled here, is liable to the tax on the appropriate part of any chargeable gains made by the company, as if the gains had been made by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If we assume that there are, say, five shareholders in a resident company and five shareholders in a non-resident company, and if we assume that the amount by which the transaction is less than the market value is £1,000 in each case, in the case of the resident company, £200 <Col N="650" /> will be attributed to each of the shareholders&mdash;assuming they hold the shares equally between them&mdash;that is, one-fifth of the difference will be divided between them and they will be responsible for that.  In the case of the non-resident company with five shareholders, three of whom are domiciled here and two of whom are not, do you then apportion out only £600, in other words, to those who are resident or domiciled here and ignore the other £400 because the shareholders are outside the jurisdiction? Is that the position?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the only way to do it, but the thought in my mind is this: if we are trying to put them on an equal footing, in those circumstances, should we not be attributing the £1,500 in the case of the non-resident company to the three resident shareholders?  The Minister, I am sure, knows what is in my mind. One can gain a substantial advantage by having a non-resident company in this way, by having the bulk of the £1,000&mdash;in the case I was talking about&mdash;attributed to the shareholders outside the jurisdiction and thereby effectively avoid liability to the extent that it can be attributable to shareholders outside the jurisdiction.</P>

    <P>In page 42, to delete lines 41 to 57, and in page 43, to delete lines 1 <Col N="651" /> to 9 and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Where an option which is an option to acquire assets exercisable by a person intending to use them, if acquired, for the purposes of a trade carried on by him or which he commences to carry on within two years of his acquisition of the option, is disposed of or abandoned then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if the option is abandoned, the abandonment shall, notwithstanding subsection (3), constitute the disposal of an asset (namely, the option), and</P>
    <P>(b)  paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 (restriction of allowable expenditure for wasting asset) shall not apply.</P>
    <P>(6) (a) Where an option to subscribe for shares in a company, being an option of a kind which, at the time of disposal or abandonment, is quoted, and, in the same manner as shares, dealt in on a stock exchange in the State or elsewhere, is disposed of or abandoned, then&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  if the option is abandoned, the abandonment shall, notwithstanding subsection (3) constitute the disposal of an asset (namely, of the option), and</P>
    <P>(ii)  paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 (restriction of allowable expenditure for wasting asset) and subsection (4) shall not apply.</P>
    <P>(b) Where an option mentioned in paragraph (a) is dealt in within three months after the taking effect with respect to the company granting the option, of any reorganisation, reduction, conversion or amalgamation to which paragraph 2, 3, 4 or 5 of Schedule 2 applies (or within such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing allow), the option shall, for the purposes of the said paragraphs 2, 3, 4 or 5, be regarded as the shares which could be acquired by exercising the option and section 49 (3)  shall apply for determining its market value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to meet some criticism of the layout of subsection (5) of the section during the <Col N="652" /> Committee Stage debate.  If I remember rightly, Deputy de Valera was the main critic, although I am not attributing the blame or credit to any one person. Two new subsections are being substituted in place of the old subsection (5), and apart from one further point which arose during the debate there is no change in substance involved.</P>
    <P>These subsections exclude certain options from the provisions of subsection (3) of the section and of paragraph 9 of Schedule 1.  Among those excluded is an option to acquire assets with the intention of using the assets for the purposes of a trade. There was some doubt expressed as to whether the trade would have to be in existence at the time of acquiring the option and I said that I would look at the wording and, if necessary, make it clear that the subsection covers cases of genuine trading intentions, even, if the trade did not exist at the time of the acquisition.  The insertion of the words &ldquo;or which he commences to carry on within two years of his acquisition of the option&rdquo; ensures that where a trade is commenced within two years, an option to acquire assets by a person intending to use them eventually for such trade will qualify under the subsection.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3)  (a)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  a company incurs expenditure on the construction of any building, structure or works, being expenditure allowable as a deduction under subparagraph (1) in computing a gain accruing to the company on the disposal of the building, structure or works, or of any asset comprising it,</P>
      <P>(ii)  that expenditure was defrayed out of borrowed money, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  the company charged to capital all or any part of the interest on that borrowed money referable to a period ending on or before the disposal,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the sums so allowable under the said subparagraph (1) shall include the amount of that interest charged to capital except in so far as such interest has been taken into account for the purposes of relief under the Income Tax Acts, or could have been so taken into account but for <Col N="654" /> an insufficiency of income or profits or gains.</P>
    <P>(b)  Subject to clause (a), no payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I undertook on Committee Stage to produce an amendment to provide for relief for interest paid to the extent possible, having regard to the need to preserve the anti-avoidance provisions in relation to interest in the income tax code.  As was pointed out during that debate, in the case of a company, because of the requirements under the Companies Act, 1963, to produce audited accounts, a clear distinction can be drawn between interest charged to income account and interest charged to capital account.  It would not be possible to maintain such a distinction in relation to the accounts of individuals.  Accordingly, if relief in respect of interest charged to capital were extended to individuals, the income tax anti-avoidance provisions in relation to interest could, so far as individuals are concerned, be circumvented to the extent that interest disallowed under these provisions could be represented as being charged to capital and therefore become eligible for relief at the capital gains tax rate.  In the circumstances it is considered that relief in respect of interest charged to capital should be restricted to companies.  This would not involve a significant degree of hardship to individuals as those owning smaller amounts of property are catered for adequately by £2,000 limit for relief fixed under the existing income tax anti-avoidance provisions, and other property owners could avail of the relief proposed in this amendment by incorporation which is comparatively simple and inexpensive.</P>

      <P>There was no question of any other tax impinging on the individual from day to day, apart from death duties or something like that.

      <P>The reliefs available under the income tax code will not be available in regard to capital gains.  Starting with that premises, we find that the original draft says that no payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph. Provision is made for sums allowable as a deduction from the consideration in the computation under the Schedule of the gain accruing to a person on the disposal of an asset.  I take it the Minister's approach is that, if it stood as it was although logically and properly applicable to an individual, it would operate in an anomalous manner where a company was concerned.  Am I right so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to look at the position of a company as well. A limited company is governed by the Companies Acts the latest of which was our own Act of 1963.  We had the 1908 Act before that.  Under the provisions of those Acts, including the Schedules and tables, there are very definite accounting provisions which contemplate and provide for the allocation of company earnings and expenditure to what one might call revenue and capital accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the question of taxation which has two aspects. First of all, there is the specific corporation profits tax or a specific tax which does not apply to the individual. Secondly, there are the provisions in regard to income tax.  A common enough thing which occurs with companies is that when they expend money on, say, building or the acquisition or the creation of a capitalisable asset, the question very often arises as to what <Col N="657" /> expenditure is to be charged to revenue and what expenditure is to be charged to capital.  Approaching the matter from that point of view we arrive at the genesis of the section.</P>
    <P>In this case am I correct in saying that it is usual for the company, very often through their auditors or with the assistance of their auditors, to agree with the inspector as to what is an equitable apportionment of the expenditure involved from the point of view of capitalisation or writing it off to revenue.  Is that not another consideration? In other words, the question will often arise as to whether a particular expenditure is to be written off as a cost against revenue and, therefore, <i>pro tanto,</i> reduces income, or whether it is to be capitalised, in some other way to attract tax.  That is usually a matter which is agreed and worked out in an individual case on well-defined principles and works fairly uniformly and equitably over the board as far as companies are concerned. Therefore the Minister is faced with the problem that in regard to the individual capital taxation is something completely new, the idea of individual capital is new to taxation law and comes under the code the Minister is now putting through the House. On the other hand the concept of capital and capital assets is well established already in the case of corporate bodies.</P>
    <P>If I am correct in that the Minister's amendment becomes intelligible.  Since this is not Committee Stage I should be much obliged to the Minister if he would correct me if I am going off the rails, which would save him time when replying.  As I see it what the Minister intends doing is this: Maintain the original subsection (3) in so far as it affects the individual, and provide additional and specifically for the case of the company in the circumstances outlined, because if one looks at the Minister's amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It does need to be spelled out in this way.  In effect the Minister is letting his original draft stand; letting the deleted paragraph (3) stand by its reintroduction as subparagraph (b).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now qualified by clause (a).</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not even a qualification.  Clause (a) is an addition, because it is subject to clause (a). Clause (a) essentially is an addition. The Minister is perfectly right&mdash;it does, of course, except companies covered by subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii).  It does except companies, in that case, from the omnibus capture by the original paragraph (3).  Am I correct in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, what the Minister is doing here is this: that in the particular case where a company incurs expenditure on the construction of any building, structure or works, being expenditure allowable as a deduction under subparagraph (i) in computing a gain accruing to the company on the disposal of the building, structure or works, or any asset comprising it,....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the first prerequisite is that there is expenditure on the building, structure or works.  This is a very frequent and usual happening&mdash;a company builds new premises&mdash;it happens every day.  There has to be a decision as to whether that interest shall be charged to capital or to revenue.  That is really what it means.  Take the case of a company that borrows for capital purposes and pays interest on that borrowed money.  How is that interest to be treated?  Is it to be written off against revenue or is it to be capitalised? It is the same type of problem.  I <Col N="659" /> do not think that is unknown.  Therefore, I do not think there is any administrative or unknown feature in it.</P>
    <P>Coming to subparagraph (ii) reading:</P>
    <P>that expenditure was defrayed out of borrowed money,</P>
    <P>I take it, that is where the interest originates, that the payment of interest originates out of the borrowing.  It seems, at first blush, somewhat naïve to introduce subparagraph (ii).  On the other hand, it is equally conceivable that the ingenious evader might try to label something &ldquo;interest&rdquo; in some other way and that the best guarantee that the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister could have that this is genuine interest is to specify the sum on which the interest accrues.  Although it does appear to be somewhat naïve, it is probably a necessary addition to the conditions under which the company applies.</P>
    <P>Then there is subparagraph (iii) reading:</P>
    <P>the company charged to capital all or any part of the interest on that borrowed money referrable to a period ending on or before the disposal,</P>
    <P>That is necessary because, if it was charged to revenue, it would probably attract income tax relief and there would be then the application of double relief under the first part of the Schedule.  Therefore, I can see that it is desirable to say that the interest has been charged to capital; in other words, that that interest has been capitalised.  Again, that is quite a usual thing.  The Revenue Commissioners will be very familiar with the circumstances under which such matters arise.  The amendment for that states:</P>
    <P>the sums so allowable under the said subparagraph (1) shall include the amount of that interest charged to capital except in so far as such interest has been taken into account for the purposes of relief under the Income Tax Acts or could have been so taken into account but for an insufficiency of income or profits or gains.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> It is in this part of the new section that I enter a hazy area.  I understand what the Minister proposes when he considers reliefs under the Income Tax Acts.  We are in an area that is not completely new.  However, I am not clear as to how far the interest that is clearly specified as accruing on the borrowed money under the conditions of subparagraph (1), (2) and (3) will be included as allowable under subparagraph (1) of paragraph 3.  I should like to ask the Minister for elucidation as to the content of the words &ldquo;or could have been so taken into account but for an insufficiency of income or profits or gains&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clause B is the reimportation of the deleted subsection (3), subject to the qualification and the addition of paragraph (a) of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The original subparagraph (3) which the Minister is now deleting read:</P>
      <P>No payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage we pointed out the enormity of that provision.  To the extent that this amendment is allowing interest now in respect of companies it is a step forward.  I referred to the enormity of that provision because one of the major items of cost involved by anybody in making any investment is the cost of the money itself.  Money has a cost just like any other commodity and to allow various other deduction and not to allow a deduction in respect of the cost of money was, of course, an enormity.</P>
      <P>To the extent that the Minister is now proposing to allow it in respect of companies it is a step forward but I do not think it goes far enough. The Minister has to take another step because he is excluding the benefit of this deduction which clearly he accepts now, in the case of companies, should be allowable from the individual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear compulsion here on one to become a company. <Col N="661" /> The Minister said that in so far as individuals were concerned the cost of setting up a company was relatively small and they could get around the difficulty that way.  That is no answer to the people who are already liable for capital gains tax, who have already incurred liability for interest&mdash;I am speaking of individuals who have not yet formed themselves into a company.  There is no remedy for them in that suggestion of the Minister.  I am not sure that the Minister is justified in trying to force people to form limited liability companies if they are to get the benefit of this deduction which he clearly acknowledges by this amendment is a justifiable deduction and, whether he acknowledged it or not, it is selfevident. The effect of the amendment is to force an individual to form a limited liability company if he is to get any benefit by way of deduction of interest in respect of capital gains tax.</P>
      <P>As Deputy de Valera said, this is the first piece of legislation which brought forward the concept in the case of an individual of capital on the one hand and revenue on the other. It might be said that under the death duty code that is a capital tax and that is true but I do not think it was necessary under that code to make the kind of distinction that has to be made here.  The Minister finds that because of the accounting difficulties involved in order to get round them he will give the concession to a company and if one is not a company he should form himself into a company to get it, but in the case of an individual he cannot be coped with.  It is like the computer that cannot cope with certain problems put to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is introducing <Col N="662" /> this legislation, and I do not think he is justified, in order to make people fit neatly into his administrative machine and not to have an escape hatch from capital gains tax, saying that they should form themselves into a company or they do not figure in his calculations.  If a person is formed into a company he will get all the deduction but if that person dares to express his or her individuality by refusing to form a limited liability company that person will not get it.  That could be a major interest factor at this time.  I do not think it is sufficient justification to say: &ldquo;If I do not do this, then there is an avenue of escape.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With the introduction of this legislation there is an onus on the Minister to devise a method whereby one can distinguish between capital and current expenditure on the part of an individual.  After all, it is a problem which originally had to be faced in regard to companies.  It will have to be faced now in regard to individuals. Because it is difficult it does not mean it should be shoved aside and people told, &ldquo;you conform to our requirements&rdquo;, instead of the law being made to conform to the requirements of the individual.  There is too much of the big brother about this whole approach involved in paragraph (b) of subparagraph (3) as introduced by the Minister in this amendment.  A great deal more is involved in that than appears on its face.  I put it to the Minister that the onus is on him introducing this legislation, since he acknowledges the justice of the claim for deduction of interest, to ensure that he devises a machine which will accommodate the individual and not merely a limited liability company.</P>
