      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When we reported progress yesterday I was speaking on the building industry and the effect the budget will have on it.  I believe it will have a very significant impact on it because of the type of money that is now flowing in, the £40 million over the next two years from the banks and the £10 million current expenditure by the Government.  The building societies are taking in very considerable sums of money in comparison with last year and that will make a big difference in the employment content. The building industry has a very high employment content and a low import content and that is why it is important to get it into full swing.  I have no doubt the coming months will see this happen.  Increased employment will mean less social welfare to be paid out and also a greater revenue from tax, and this is very important from the point of view of the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about the fall in sterling and about what we should or should not do.  We have not reaped the full benefits from the fall in sterling because rising wages have made our goods more expensive.  When you have depreciation in your currency your goods are cheaper to export but costs must be kept right at the same time if you want to obtain full advantage of the depreciation. Imports are dearer because of depreciation, <Col N="668" /> which means that manufacturers are in a more competitive position on the home market but this depends on keeping wages and other costs as low as possible.  This we have done and in this way also we have not gained as much as we should from the depreciation in sterling.  I am not advocating depreciation in money, but if it comes about we should reap any advantage it may offer.</P>
    <P>I think that breaking the link with sterling is not on at present because of our high inflation rate.  If we had lower inflation than England we could, perhaps, consider a break with sterling, but I am not an economic expert and I would not see the full implications of such a move.  One does not need to be an economist to realise that if costs are rising at a higher rate than that of the country with which you are operating sterling, if you consider breaking with sterling, you must face the question: where do you go?  Who wants to know you?  It would be an unwise move.  We should be concerned rather with trying to develop exports and expand our markets and so increase production.  This would also affect the home market because, as goods are produced in greater quantity and as we are now in the EEC, we have an open market for them and it is a matter of getting into the particular market for which we have suitable products and developing that market.  This would lower the cost on the domestic market, helping to stabilise the situation.</P>
    <P>It is important that before we talk of breaking with sterling or changing our financial structure in any way we must put our house in order.  We must become more viable, and that can only be done by restraint.  The options are clear: if we want more out of the economy, higher wages and profits for our own benefit, that would only lead to more unemployment which would tend to lower standards.  The more unemployment the lower standards will become even for those currently working.  Their standards will drop because they will be bearing a greater tax burden and their spending power will be reduced even though in figures they may be getting a greater amount of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> By concentrating on exports and developing markets we can improve our balance of payments and within a period of time work towards a surplus, and when we achieve that situation we can, if we wish, examine the question of a break with sterling. Many people who talk of a break with sterling seem to believe that this will be a panacea for all our ills.  That is woolly thinking: nobody will solve our problems but ourselves.  Unless we get down to hard work and face our responsibilities we shall continue to be in trouble.  We should get our present problems solved without indulging in any airy-fairy ideas.  There is no easy way.  Many people, when we were going into Europe, thought that would solve our problems, but we must solve them ourselves.</P>
    <P>I was glad that the Minister some time ago announced the setting up of an all-party committee to look into semi-State bodies.  There have been astronomic increases in some charges in semi-State bodies.  They have no competition and it is very difficult as a result to get a yardstick to measure their performance.  Therefore, it is very important when this committee is set up that they can examine the running of the organisation. I am not criticising semi-State bodies, and, indeed, the committee may find that they are highly efficient and doing the best possible job, but so long as they are not in competition and are not answerable to the House it is very hard to come to grips with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They are under starter's orders, too, in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are.  It is important that when the all-party committee is established it should scrutinise all aspects of semi-State bodies because of the amount of money we are asked to give them from time to time without any real accountability.  I hope this committee will be set up fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increased Government expenditure is another reason given for increased inflation.  Obviously the fact that Government expenditure is so high does <Col N="670" /> cause inflation, and it is important that such expenditure is seen to be used in the best and most effective way and that there is no waste involved.</P>
    <P>In the field of public expenditure, education is a matter that should be examined.  I see the Opposition spokesman is there and he might be able to contribute something in that respect.  The subsidisation of education does not seem to be fair or satisfactory. The people who pursue higher education reap great benefits from the money spent in that direction, but those who do not go further than the primary school have very little money spent on them.  According to a survey carried out in 1972-73 the amount of subsidy for a primary pupil is £76 per annum whereas for a university student it is £525 per annum.  In other words, somebody going to a primary school for seven years gets the same amount by way of grant as a student going to the university for one year.  That is a tremendous differential.  It will be seen therefore that the less well-off are paying tax which is benefiting the better-off in the community.  The people who can afford it should pay tax.  Those who are paying additional taxes now will benefit from the large subsidies towards the education of their children.  I am not saying they are all getting it, but we can see that it is the middle and higher income groups who receive most benefit from university education.  If we want to pride ourselves on being a just society, we should have a strict sense of justice.</P>
    <P>As I said the last evening, our whole education system is geared to the academic.  In joining the EEC we have entered among the most industrialised countries of the world and we are not equipping ourselves properly. The Minister for Finance should ensure that we get the best value possible for the money spent on education.  We must consider the question of vocational schools and colleges of technology and see what greater incentives and benefits we can give.  The grant system should be reviewed.  Should we not give money <Col N="671" /> by way of low-interest loans paid over a period of time, and should we not give greater encouragement to the lower income group by way of investing more money in primary education?  It is a cliché to say that all the children of the nation should be cherished equally, but it is obvious from the manner in which our resources are distributed in regard to education that we do not cherish all our children equally.  Therefore when money is being allocated for educational purposes I hope all these aspects will be considered.  People who can afford it should pay additional tax.  They may say they are being mulcted, but we do not ever hear a whisper when large amounts of money are expended by the Government on education for their children.</P>
    <P>I think this is a first-class budget in the sense that we were all expecting something a little rougher, but it is easy to see why the Minister's action is correct.  Imposing additional taxation in various areas would only increase the cost of living and what the Government intended to do was to reduce this spiralling inflation.  The subsidies which were introduced will do this effectively.  As I have said, the £12 will give an incentive to the employer who will want to be an pushing forward in the industrial sphere.  Undoubtedly there will be an upturn in the world economy, and certainly the larger industrial nations are not expecting the downward trend to continue.  The predictions are that there will be an upturn in the economy in 1976-77 but if we are to cash in on this improvement, we must be geared for it.</P>
    <P>The £12 employment premium will give to employers who may not be in a very strong position the opportunity of taking on people because this premium will go some way towards meeting their costs and consequently will help them to equip themselves for the predicted upturn.  Depressions seem to occur in world economies at intervals of ten or 15 years but we have enough faith in ourselves <Col N="672" /> to weather the storm of the present economic difficulties.  In this budget the Government have made a start but it is only a start.  They are giving the employers and the trade unions an incentive to renegotiate the national pay agreement.  I believe that common sense will prevail and that the agreement will be curbed in the interests of the workers and also in the interest of ensuring more employment.</P>
    <P>There may be other ways in which the problem can be tackled but the best way is by incentive and encouragement because our people will not respond to dictation or to statutory measures in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are very concerned about the high rate of borrowing. They say that there is not enough investment in such areas as education, the building industry and so on but at the same time they oppose increases in taxation.  Perhaps, they might tell us what are the alternatives.  If we are to expand we must have money and either we can raise this by way of borrowing or we can impose heavier taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are doing both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>They have done both but we are raising taxation equitably. Although capital gains and wealth taxes are accepted in most other countries, the Opposition have been fighting their introduction here. One can only be surprised that capital gains tax was not introduced long before now.  The Opposition must face up to their responsibilities.  If they have plans which in their opinion would cure our ills they should let us hear them but so far there has been nothing but criticism from them.  At least some of the Opposition realise the necessity and the desirability for these wealth taxes if we are to develop our economy.  They know, too, that we must take the money from those who can afford to pay and not from others.</P>

    <P>Much hysteria has been engendered in relation to the wealth tax in particular.  From listening to the Opposition one would think that this tax was some sort of <Col N="673" /> socialist ploy devised to rob the rich in order to feed the poor.  It is devised to ensure that we have sufficient capital to develop our economy. We can look forward to the development of our natural resources in the coming years.  This development will play a significant part in our future but in the absence of a wealth tax, people would be making vast sums of money and making very little return to the Exchequer.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has succeeded in getting an admirable deal in respect of our offshore oil and gas.  He has done what is best in the interests of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a tax system that is geared to changes we can expect in the future because we will need money to re-equip and develop and to meet the increasing demands on social welfare, health, education and all the other services, demands which, for a small country, are very great in the context of our present resources.  The Government are gearing us for this situation by laying the foundations now.  I commend the Minister on this budget and I am confident that the people will respond to it and that, consequently, the inflation rate will begin to decrease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to comment briefly on these financial motions.  The Minister's speech was bespattered with such words as &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;, &ldquo;emigration&rdquo;, &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo;, &ldquo;revision&rdquo; and &ldquo;renegotiation&rdquo;, all of which point to a failure on his part.  The Minister did not do his duty in directing, persuading and guiding the Irish economy.  He has been guilty of neglect and he conveniently looks around&mdash;that is traditional with interparty or Coalition Governments&mdash;because the cause of course is not himself; it is not his own Administration. It is Suez or Korea or, in this case, world conditions.  It would not be fair to claim&mdash;in fact, it would be palpably dishonest&mdash;that world conditions do not affect our economy.  They affect all economies and, as has been said, particularly an open economy.  We listened to this hvmn about world affairs, this hymn about all the deficiencies in our <Col N="674" /> economy being due to world conditions, for a long time until, finally, the Taoiseach spoke out and said that much of the inflation was domestically created and many of the problems were created at home and we would have to face up to that.  The Central Bank, the commercial banks all pointed out the effect domestically created inflation was having and asked that something be done but, until we had reached crisis proportions, nothing was done.  Then the Minister comes in with a second budget this year.  As had been pointed out by other speakers on this side, there is a concatenation of budgets issuing from this Administration&mdash;two in this year already and nobody knows what will happen in the Fall; it is generally expected it will be necessary to take corrective measures and bring in yet another budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in his budget statement that a resumption of the export-led growth depended on what is now called the upturn in the world economy.  There is one thing I should like to ask the Minister about individual industries.  It is generally realised, even by the Minister for Industry and Commerce now, that the shoe and textile industries are in very dire straits. I should like to see precisely, leaving out the macro elements altogether, a costing done.  I should like, for example, a statement as to how much wage increases were responsible for the decline and fall of the footwear industry in places like Carrickmacross and Dundalk.  I should like to see that stated specifically.  It is easy to talk in broad terms and to paint with big brush strokes when dealing with the economy but, when one makes a statement that wage increase are mainly responsible for our present unsatisfactory condition on the export market, then I should like to see costings done specifically with regard to one pair of shoes or one bale of cloth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, commenting on the budget, explained to us what had happened to the footwear industry.  These explicatory economics have always puzzled me because these economists seem to be able to tell one when things went wrong, why they went wrong only after the whole <Col N="675" /> thing is over.  It is one of the facets of what is called the science of economics. Now I do not want to act the Philistine with regard to economics. Economics are very important, but I should like a little diagnostic economics and a little more ability to tell beforehand what was going to happen and I should like Government to take action on that particular diagnosis. Full employment, the Minister tells us, will depend on export-led growth.  I think the exercise I have suggested is a very necessary one if you are going to have an economy depending on export-led growth.  The costings should be done.  They should be available at micro level and they should be available to management, staff, <i>et cetra.</i> Then we might see&mdash;I do not know&mdash; that there are other very important factors and that hammering wage increases, which is a national pastime, is not the only answer for the failure of many of our industries.  For example, what effect have imports from Third Countries had on the industries about which I am talking?  How does that effect relate to the effect of increased wages?  How do the quality of the machinery, the organisation and the management in particular industries contribute to the difficulties as compared with the difficulty created, and it is a difficulty, by increased prices?</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that public sector pay and social welfare payments are now about 50 per cent of the current costs of running the country. One shudders to think what the position would be had not this party, when in Government, admittedly aided by the Fine Gael Party, led the country into the EEC because the vast increases and the vast amounts of money available as a result of membership of the EEC were distributed in social welfare payments.  We must continue to remind the expert economists of the Labour Party here that they opposed our entry and consequently opposed these sources of finance for the payment of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>It is frightening to think of the amount of money being paid out in the service of debt and this particular <Col N="676" /> budget adds yet another £10 million to the amount required for servicing our debt.  Time and time again the Minister talked about the growing uncompetitiveness of Irish industry and stated that lay-offs and short-term working are directly the result of this uncompetitiveness.  Again, I appeal for a spelling-out at micro level of this because we have never got that.  We have not got the proof&mdash;perhaps the proof is there&mdash;that it is the rise in wages and the rise in wages only which is responsible for our lack of competitiveness in export markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien talked about the world economy and the upturn in the world economy.  Again big bold brush strokes.  The whole thing seems to me to degenerate into a swapping of clichés.  What exactly does this upturn in the world economy mean?  Does it mean a steadying of the economy in Britain which takes a great deal of our exports?  Does it mean heavy reflation in Germany and France?  That has not been spelled out.  It seems to me to be a useful kind of alibi for the Minister for Finance in his present circumstances.  The world economy is an exhausted lion and the Minister is watching, waiting for it to wake up, and feed its cub, the Irish economy. He should, in fact, be telling the cub that it should be up and foraging for itself and it will then be able to take advantage later on of whatever breaks will come from an improvement in the world economy.  There seems to me to be a washing of hands and a standing aside, waiting for the world economy to revive, and I believe that is not worthy of an Irish Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister said something which bears out the accusation I am making:</P>
    <P>Events have shown that our economic difficulties would be less acute if these precepts had been taken fully to heart.  It is now clear that the current national pay agreement gives increases in pay, including increases reflecting taxes on alcoholic drink and tobacco, which cannot be paid in present economic circumstances without doing serious economic and social damage.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister knew that when <Col N="677" /> this national wage agreement was being worked out.  He stood on the side-lines.  He allowed the Employer-Labour Conference to work out an elaborate wage agreement.  Only now he has the honesty, when he is forced into it, to admit that it went too far. Where was his fiscal leadership?  Did he exercise his muscles in such a way as to impress on the Employer-Labour Conference that this was the position?  Did he introduce subsidies which would make it easier to work out a realistic wage agreement?  No, he did not.  Not that he was not told that could be done and should be done, and that it would have an effect on the national wage agreement.  This is <i>post factum</i> administration.  Let the thing go.  Disaster is looming and then intervene.  The more positive approach would have been far better but the more positive approach was not followed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Already the baby has been handed over to the Employer-Labour conference and already there are rumblings. Shots are being fired by the FUE.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions are a source of recriminations. There is talk about equal pay.  There will be a quarrel about that.  There is talk about the 5 per cent ceiling.  The unions are agreeable to indexation but the employers say 5 per cent must be the limit no matter what happens to the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>You can see the line of argument I am following.  Had the Minister taken action in time, had he listened to the Opposition, the wage agreement would have been more realistic.  He did not do so.  Like Micawber he was waiting for something to turn up.  Perhaps the thing would iron itself out.  Maybe with a bit of luck the world economy would take an upturn.  If so, everything would be all right.  That is not fiscal leadership.  That is not financial leadership.  That is not the way to run the country.</P>
    <P>I mentioned revision and renegotiation. Every &ldquo;re&rdquo; is an indication of failure on the part of the Minister for Finance.  We had the Minister for Labour trotting out the old shibboleths in his speech when he said that shortly they would turn on dividends. Speaking on the Wealth Tax Bill, I <Col N="678" /> pointed out that there is a lot of musty thinking about modern industry and modern business.  I pointed out that in the large industries the shareholders have very little say and that power lies, for the most part with management.  I pointed out that it was more than important that money should be available to industry from their own funds for development.</P>
    <P>It is popular in the Labour Party&mdash; and it is near their ideology I would hope to find myself but not with allegiance to outworn shibboleths which are not relevant to a modern industrial society&mdash;to say: &ldquo;We will stab those who are making the big money out of business and industry.&rdquo;  This is what is frightening people with capital and business and industries with capital which must be used for development. I have with me the Cement Roadstone Accounts for 1974.  It is worthwhile quoting the percentages to indicate what I mean by the statement that the Labour Party are following outworn shibboleths.</P>
    <P>Of the total amount of money involved, 62.0 per cent went on materials transport and other costs.  Wages and salaries accounted for 27.4 per cent; taxation 5.2 per cent; invested in the business, reinvestment, the type of money I have been talking about on the Wealth Tax Bill, 3.1 per cent; and dividends were at 2.3 per cent. What the Minister for Labour was saying was great heady stuff.  It goes down very well at Labour Party club meetings but it is not realistic. It is related to a different age and a different phase.</P>
    <P>We must discard the shibboleths. We must realise what modern industry means.  It means capital and I, for one, would be very glad to watch capitalists very carefully and to see to it that they have neither an undue influence in the economy nor too much return for their capital.  It means labour, skilled labour, technology. It is important that they have their own capital and that they can form their own capital.  This kind of Administration with the emphasis on wealth tax, capital gains tax, capital acquisition tax, gift tax, and all sorts of tax, will not create confidence <Col N="679" /> among the people upon whom we must rely to develop the economy.</P>
    <P>Woodrow Wyatt, the Labour theoretician in a comparatively recent book pointed out that the modern imperative for the Labour Party and any other party is to create wealth, to make more wealth, and to concentrate the effort on making more wealth, because you cannot distribute wealth equitably in the economy until wealth is created.  Hurler-on-the-ditch administration, waiting-for-something-to-turn-up administration, depending-on-the-Employer-Labour Conference administration, will not direct the economy in the way it should go so that more wealth will be available for social welfare payments and for everything else.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech there is also the indignity of a threat.  He speaks of a revocation of the price reliefs if he does not get what he wants.  This goes back to where the rot started.  This side of the House pointed out that certain subsidies which the Minister has agreed to give now could have been introduced at the end of 1974.  They would have been taken into account when the wage agreement was being worked out and negotiated.  This was not done.  Now we have the threat: &ldquo;Look here, you chaps.  Come to an agreement on the wage agreement.  Scrap one of the phases or lower the two phases.  If one does not, then the price reliefs will no longer be available to one.&rdquo; Judging by the amount of courage the Minister for Finance has put into his financial policy since he assumed office, I do not think he will have the courage to revoke the price reliefs as he says he will.  I do not think he will have the courage to do so even if no progress is made with regard to the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the public capital programme, there are plenty of suggestions. These are not &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; suggestions for the improvement of the economy, for the preparation for the time, the millenium, when all the economies of the world are going well again.  I failed to get in yesterday <Col N="680" /> on the Industrial Development Bill, but in my own area the IDA have pointed out that there is vast need for infrastructural work, for roads, telephones and water, all over the area to enable them develop the area industrially.  This is a field the Minister should consider if the employment situation worsens.  He should consider it anyway at present but, if the situation worsens, he should consider it very seriously indeed.  Actually Dublin Corporation, I think under the leadership of Deputy Seán Moore, have some kind of suggestion about a public works programme to relieve unemployment in this city.  I agree with the Minister and with people who maintain that such public works programmes should not be programmes merely to provide employment; they should be implemented on an organised basis with a definite purpose. In the infrastructural activity, in areas that are so under-developed such as the area, part of which I represent, I suggest that is the way the public capital programme should be developed.</P>
    <P>Deficit budgeting has come under the hammer.  This was an imaginative and worth-while advance in economic thinking when first introduced.  It was pointed out from this side of the House that it is effective in improving the economy only if used in its promotion. Most of the deficit budgeting seems to be now for current account spending which, as the Minister well knows, does not produce any economic progress.</P>
    <P>There is contained in the Minister's speech a fairly ominous paragraph.  I do not know whether it was highlighted very much by the media&mdash;it may have been but I missed it anyway&mdash;reading:</P>
    <P>Existing expenditures are being reviewed to identify those that might be curtailed or eliminated. Such expenditures would, for example, include those which are no longer appropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>This is a kind of sibylline statement</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of changes in the circumstances which gave rise to their introduction in the first instance or because of changes since then in <Col N="681" /> the circumstances of the sectors or groups of individuals who benefit from them.</P>
    <P>I call upon the Minister, in his reply, to specify precisely what he means by that sentence.</P>
    <P>There is another point&mdash;and this must surely gall the Labour Party&mdash; the Minister continues to say:</P>
    <P>Consideration will also be given to making realistic charges for public services which are either provided free at present or are charged for at uneconomic rates.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister also to make it clear to the House and the people what exactly he means by that.  In fact, I ask him to make it clear to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health, does he mean health charges, for example, or how does this square with the Tánaiste's view that all, no matter how wealthy, should be provided with free hospital services.</P>
    <P>The Minister says then:</P>
    <P>This may involve a review of the pricing policies of some State bodies.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House realise what has happened to the ESB in rural Ireland.  The pricing policies of the ESB there have put electricity out of the reach of very many young people building houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister says further:</P>
    <P>Exchequer subsidies to various bodies which should more appropriately be supported from other sources&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>again, unidentified&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;will also be looked at critically. In general all low-priority services, particularly those which have a small or negligible employment content,</P>
    <P>I do not mind that&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;will be reviewed to see what economies can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The House and the country are entitled to some elucidation of that paragraph.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, the subsidies are welcome, as is the removal of VAT from clothing and footwear.  It seems to me that this is a kind of lifeguard or beachguard action on the part of the <Col N="682" /> Minister for Finance with regard to the footwear and clothing industries.  We on this side of the House, and in particular Deputy Faulkner, have been hammering the Minister for Industry and Commerce to do something about the footwear industry long ago.  The Minister, when he speaks, is most persuasive, rational and calm&mdash;everything is under control&mdash;but he seems to be paralysed when it comes to making a decision or taking any action.  Deputy O'Malley has been in Brussels a few days this week and we hope we will have some kind of word from him about what will happen with regard to footwear and clothing.  This rescue exercise seems to me to be too late. The Leader of our party said the budget was too late and too little.  The rescue operation seems to me to be too late, particularly for the footwear industry.  The Minister is swimming out to rescue the bather and, it seems to me, will come in with the corpse of the footwear industry in this country. It is really bad, and it is no consolation to know that the funeral expenses will be free from VAT.</P>
    <P>I support the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party when he says that every effort should be made to deal with the national wage agreement problem in the interests of the country.  But if what is happening now with regard to the national wage agreement were to be in any way damaging to the principle of a national wage agreement, I would demur.  I do not think it necessarily will be but if it is I would prefer it not to be a success than that the principle of a national wage agreement be damaged utterly and irrevocably.  Do not forget that, under Fianna Fáil Administration, national wage agreements were worked out and, more than important, were paid.  I would be chary of this Government because their economic forecasts have been so wide of the mark.</P>
    <P>With regard to the employment premiums I find it difficult to see how they will operate.  We await with interest the statement by the Minister for Labour, fore-shadowed on this morning's Order of Business, as to how they will operate.  They were welcomed and, in so far as they may increase employment, they are to be welcomed. <Col N="683" /> Of course, it will be important that the £12&mdash;and £6 later on&mdash;will be added to sufficient money to bring wages above, say, the pay-related plus unemployment benefit rates.  This will be important seeing that the pay-related benefit period has been extended and power has been taken to extend it still further.</P>
    <P>If the amount of money involved is reasonably large I wonder why a public works programme of the useful nature I mentioned earlier could not have been embarked upon instead.  If the Minister for Finance wants to know where I think this public works programme could best be initiated I will tell him without charging him any fee.  In my constituency we need roads, telephones, water and power. In that constituency there are 52 per cent under-employed in agriculture and we have the lowest number employed in manufacturing industry in the country.</P>
    <P>Of the £27 million increased public capital provided for in the industrial section £4 million goes to Fóir Teoranta. There is no consolation to me in the extra money allotted for industrial development in the budget.  Fóir Teoranta is a rescue operation but if we have not the industry we cannot rescue it.  I would have thought that £5.2 million would have been better distributed on the areas that are so far behind in industrial development.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the same section of the population seems to be hammered all the time.  The loan charges on the Local Loans Fund are increased by 1 per cent and the period for repayment of these loans has been shortened.  That will be an extra hardship on the people.  It may not be as significant as the increase in the interest rate but it is a hardship.  The people who are being hammered all the time are those who are buying houses and want to have their own houses.  The sluggard who says, &ldquo;To hell with this game, I will make the local authority provide me with a house&rdquo; is not giving the same hostages to fortune; he is not giving the chance to people to raise interest on him.  His rates and rent may be increased <Col N="684" /> but he has his built-in safety device if he hits bad times.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent surcharge on income tax is hammering the people who have initiative and who are great contributors to the economy.  The idea of tax all the time can be very frustrating to people who are in that category.  According to the issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3rd July the governor of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. John Ryan, was critical of the Government, as the Central Bank and individual banks have been.  He suggested a compulsory savings scheme, which might be a better idea.  I should like to know from the Minister if this was considered.  Admittedly, if it is a savings scheme the Minister will have to pay interest and he will not get the direct result he gets by adding 10 per cent to 35 per cent, bringing income tax up to 38.5 per cent on certain categories.  If this scheme was studied in the Department of Finance why was the decision made to add extra taxes?  We are gone crazy on taxes.  Everything is taxed.  When Deputy O'Brien spoke about this a few moments ago he referred to the position in other countries.  Anybody who talks like that should read the industrial history of our country.  They will realise that many of the countries they are talking about had a long start in industrial and social development on us.</P>
    <P>The deficit of £241.6 million is frightening; so frightening that I will not talk any more about it.  Reference was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the inflow of money here and he said that this showed a confidence in our economy.  There is no doubt but that there was an inflow and that gilt-edged securities were bought up a few weeks ago.  I will let someone who is more expert in these matters elaborate on why this was so.  Is it dangerous money?  Is it money that could just as quickly be taken out? Had it anything to do with the kite Senator Halligan flew about breaking the link with sterling?  The Minister for Finance should answer these questions for the people because they are entitled to answers.</P>
    <P>On the day the Minister announced <Col N="685" /> his budgetary measures I had a question on the Order Paper asking the Minister for Finance if he would think of introducing a CPI related saving scheme.  The House had reached to within two questions of my question and it would have been interesting to see how it would be handled seeing that it was incorporated in the budget.  I suppose there would have been a kick to touch to take us over the half-hour or so until it was revealed.  However, I am pleased with the Minister's measure.  In his speech the Minister said there were certain dangers in it but that he was announcing the details later.  He also said that he was introducing the scheme for the right people.  This is fair, just and good.  Old careful people who have saved money and have a fixed income got scared with the erosion due to inflation.  In most cases those people have given service to the country and have been solid citizens.  This kind of scheme should cushion them against the type of inflation we are having.  It is a good idea and one that should commend itself to everybody.</P>
    <P>Breaking the link with sterling has been mentioned by a number of people by way of kite flying.  It seems to me that international monetary reform, economic and monetary union in Europe, all need political action.  I am informed by somebody who should know that there is a system ready, blue printed, for dealing with the international monetary situation in the light of the failure of the Bretton Woods Agreement which operated so well for so long.  I understand that all that is needed is the political will of the committee of nations to bring this about.  It is essential for the growth and health of all economies.  We have not made progress in Europe.  I do not know about the whole sterling business but we went into the snake and came out fast.  I believe one month was enough of the snake and we had to come out when Britain left.  The effect on the common agricultural policy, the compensatory payments and so on, makes planning and ecomic life difficult for us.  There must be a solution.</P>
    <P>People will begin to say, &ldquo;in the <Col N="686" /> formally controlled economies one does not have this; one only has this because jugglers with finance are making good money out of this international money game&rdquo;.  There would be a lot of ignorance in that criticism. Nobody here would advocate the kind of formal control of the economy that means interference with people to the extent that people are interfered with in the formally controlled economies.  Nobody can stand for that.  The idea of freedom is a poor consolation to a man who has not a job.  A great number of people will come to that conclusion if unemployment rises.  They will come to the conclusion, which was enunciated by a Senator in the Upper House a few days ago, that this so-called free economy, the so-called free economic system, is not worth a canter and that we should turn to something else.</P>
    <P>I know our power to influence settlements on the international monetary scene may be very light but the size of the wallet does not always indicate the size of the material between the ears.  We could have a contribution to make in that particular line.  We could have a political contribution to make in hammering away at the people responsible to come to some international monetary arrangement to replace the Bretton Woods' one, which served reasonably well for so long.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about youth.  The youth of Ireland were beginning to stay in the country. It is very important to provide employment and further opportunity for them at the moment.  It is important that they retain the confidence that has been building up in them over the last few years.  I have been amazed in my own area at the recovery of the rural community.  It has not shown itself in increased population except in areas where small industries have been developed.  In such areas the last census showed a rise in population.</P>
    <P>Emigration became a habit of mind and I believe we were just breaking it. A serious onus rests on the Government to stop that habit of mind developing again.  It will develop if unemployment increases because emigration from all areas, particularly <Col N="687" /> from rural undeveloped areas, is the collorary of unemployment.  People with ambition and initiative will not stay around no matter what social payments you make them.  There is a serious obligation on the Government to see to it that that habit of mind, the solution being the boat, is not an easy one nowadays because Britain, which took a lot of our young people, is in a serious economic position.</P>
    <P>There is a serious obligation on the Government, and I do not think they are living up to it, to see to it that the confidence of youth is not shattered. They are better equipped, educationally, due to decisions taken in the past than we were.  I am asking them to stand their ground.  This side of the House, and particularly the Government side of the House, are all too smug where decisions have to be made.  We should see to it that pressure is brought on the administration to provide jobs so that our youth will not go away as people had to do in the past.</P>
    <P>There is no greater obscenity in a community than unemployment.  Perhaps an equal obscenity, the result of it, is emigration.  I plead with the Government to examine the position, particularly in regard to young people who are now coming out of school. The Minister for Finance spoke about open-ended grants and when the money was exhausted schemes would have to be left over for the following year.  Does he include in that grant money for university students?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know if university grants are included in that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will deal with that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope university grants are not included in that.  We heard a good lot of simplistic talk about education from Deputy O'Brien this morning when he talked about one year in the university, seven years in the primary school, and he said that we were too academic.  I believe a great deal of nonsense is talked about that nowadays.  We have more technicians than we have jobs for.  In a recent survey by Dr. Roy Johnson of Trinity College it was pointed out, <Col N="688" /> although I think it needs a bit of qualification, that we have more technologists than we have technological jobs.</P>
      <P>Many of the top economists and business executives in the world claim that a liberal Arts degree is about as good a foundation as can be got on which to build expertise in commerce, business and economics.  We talk a lot of nonsense in that line but I hope that out of it there will not come any urge to curtail still further spending on education.  It is worthwhile to read people like Ilya, who is a bit daft and a bit theoretical, but from his ideas on that we can examine our consciences as to whether we are spending money on things like education and wealth in the best possible way. I would not like a climate of opinion to be created that there was too much money spent on education.  We want people with expertise and we want them on the ground in Ireland.  We want the jobs which they fill.</P>
      <P>These are my comments on the second budget of the year.  If the Minister for Finance, backed by the other Ministers in the administration, cannot provide the economic climate I have been appealing for young people, let him go in dignity but let him go and leave it to somebody else to try because that person cannot do worse than he has been doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with other speakers I welcome the provisions in the budget.  The subsidy in regard to CIE is particularly welcome. It is much better to fill our trains than to give CIE huge sums every year. When we have to travel by road we find the roads are overloaded with traffic, much of which could be accommodated on the trains.  The provision in the budget is the right way to subsidise a transport system, which will always have to carry some subsidy.  It would also help if something could be done with certain aspects of the road haulage system.</P>

    <P>CIE are providing an excellent train service on the main lines.  It is a good safe way to travel.  Deputy Wilson said that everything was &ldquo;re&rdquo; this and &ldquo;re&rdquo; that, but there is one &ldquo;re&rdquo; I would like to mention here, that is <Col N="689" /> reaction.  The reaction to this budget has been most favourable throughout the country.  That is the best way to judge any budget or any piece of legislation.  I can certainly say that the people are charmed with this budget and they believe it is a start to try to conquer inflation, which is rampant in these islands.  The Minister has started in the right place in trying to hold the cost of living, the cost of food, footwear and clothing.  It is not fully appreciated until you find a pair of shoes are £1 or more cheaper.  That is very significant in the cost of living.  With this excellent start by the Minister I am confident that everybody will row in.  The whole exercise could be abortive if everybody did not co-operate in getting the economy moving in the right direction. We are totally dependent on exports.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have to get money either by borrowing or by taxation but there is a third very important source of income&mdash;profits from sales&mdash;and that is the source I should like to have fully explored.  It is the best way of getting revenue in the long run.  As in the case of private enterprise borrowing is not the best way for a country to do business.  No banker will be very pleased if you cannot improve your fiscal position and if you continue borrowing year in, year out.  You must reach a profit-making situation.  We can do that through exports and by buying our own products.  Everybody talks about buying Irish but very few do anything about it.  There is no EEC regulation which says you may not buy Irish.  This must be hammered home. When it is said that we cannot do anything about imports from EEC countries, that we must accept Italian shoes and all sorts of goods from Europe, we should realise that these goods can be left on the shelves.  There is nothing to stop an Irish citizen who is serious about his country's future and the prospects of his children from buying Irish products, which are as good if not better than anything coming from abroad.</P>
    <P>I would agree with the previous <Col N="690" /> speaker about some of the advice given by top economists.  I should like more common sense and perhaps we should take the advice of more business people rather than economists. Economists are like retired generals, always fighting the last war.  Very often their projections are wildly inaccurate. They can tell you why such a thing happened in the past but, for goodness' sake let them give an honest projection of what will happen in the future.  Very often a good businessman can do this better than an economist. We could, with advantage, also have a savings scheme.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch briefly on agricultural exports.  Since we entered the EEC I think we have become a bit lazy in our sales efforts.  We have far too much reliance on intervention and so on and not sufficient emphasis on what really got this country going, our ability to go out and sell our products. Years ago when I was a member of a small co-operative society we were looking around for markets for conventional dairy products when somebody suggested: why not try something not so conventional? That type of approach actually got this co-operative out of its difficulties. At that time it was moisture-free butter for the Lebanon, followed by frozen cream for the Heinz complex. This got us going, and the same considerations apply today.  The French and the Germans and others will buy our agricultural products if we go out and sell them and make them attractive in packaging and so on.  Much work has been done in this regard and we should not allow images such as that built up by Kerrygold to be neglected.</P>
    <P>The same thing could be done for beef because without doubt we have the best beef in the world.  Because of the way it is put into intervention at present it is not always the most attractive proposition for our salesmen. I have that information direct from people making a living selling our products abroad.  These people should get the type of product they want but, at present, due to EEC regulations and other factors they are not getting it; they have to buy a product <Col N="691" /> out of a ship in Bantry, unstamped and unmarked, and they cannot determine the quality until they get a reaction from the customer, which very often does not come for five or six months.</P>
    <P>What is being done about our adverse trade balance with countries like Japan?  There are all kinds of Japanese products on sale here, cars, motor cycles, television sets and electronic equipment, but how much processed foods are they buying from us, if any?  We have good stocks of these products.  If somebody sells something to me I like him to buy something in return; that is the only way we can survive.  There is no use in going to people with whom we are not dealing at all.  We have Czechoslovakian tractors in practically every farm.  Some of this equipment is good and comes at the right price, but the Czechs should be compelled to buy from us in proportion to their sales here.  Are they doing this?  If they were I do not think we would have some of the sales problems that we have.</P>
    <P>The budget is really only a starting point.  There is a great future facing the country at present in view of the finds of gas and oil and our new industries. There are great opportunities for the young people.  I appeal to the Government to get on with the job in regard to gas and oil.  One of our problems at present is the high cost of fertiliser, but here we have in the gas a ready source of nitrogenous fertiliser and the sooner that is landed and spread the better for everybody, apart from our present difficulties in regard to employment.  Probably 500, 600 or 700 people could be employed in actually laying pipes.  We should get on with this job and not wait any longer.  This is the right type of borrowing we should engage in, borrowing for productive purposes.  Every Government would be justified in borrowing to the limit of what the gas and the oil are worth in order to get these projects going.</P>
    <P>The previous Deputy mentioned the technological side of this question. Whether we like it or not, a substantial number of technological people are still coming from abroad.  Especially <Col N="692" /> in the petro-chemical industries we shall have in Cork Harbour, we shall not have the personnel to fill all the top jobs.  Therefore I would like to see more emphasis on technological training.  I am all for a Cardinal Newman type of education for people; a degree in Arts is a very good thing to have, but from the Leaving Certificate stage onwards we should be thinking in terms of training people for the type of jobs that are and will be available.  At the moment we are doing very little to prepare people for employment in the petro-chemical industries that are about to be set up.  I do not see why every industrialist should be allowed to bring in people from all over the place, because invariably they stay here and it means a loss of jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion in regard to the public works programme. This £12 premium scheme is a very good idea, but seeing that dole money has to be paid out of the Exchequer, this scheme should be extended to cover public works and any type of work that a local authority could provide, such as cleaning hedgerows or painting railings.  Were it not for the drought, the weeds would be meeting in the middle of our roadways. It would be better for people's morale to employ them on such work than have them queuing up for the dole each week.  On both sides of the House it is our responsibility to provide jobs wherever possible.  Surely local authorities can provide such jobs.  We are relying on a few machines in each county to clean our hedgerows.  It is work that was always done well by a comparatively small number of people and it could be done again.</P>
    <P>Group water schemes could also benefit from the scheme.  In my own area there are 50 or 60 of these schemes in abeyance for one reason or another.  Water will have to be provided sooner or later and if some of these people were employed on these schemes it would be a great help.  I would also like to see the £12 extended to agriculture to cover an additional worker on our farms. While our farms have been understaffed <Col N="693" /> in the past due to mechanisation, we have come to the stage where the law of diminishing returns is starting to apply, where farms are producing less because of not having enough staff to use the equipment.  As well as being of benefit to the farmer, this would be a useful way of employing people.</P>
    <P>Now that the wages of agricultural workers are coming into line with those of industrial workers, farm work must be an attractive way of life for young people in the future.  I know what I am talking about.  It is a tough life for part of the year but it has its own rewards and attractions. Young people who have had a short experience of working in a food processing plant or in a factory will tell you that if they thought there was a future in it they would prefer to work on a farm.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would like to see courses in our vocational schools which would train people for farm work, for instance, dairying.  Places like Moor Park are doing a limited amount, but this should be extended to our vocational schools to give an opportunity to young people who want to go into farming.  Maybe at a later stage the Land Commission will change their mind about the allocation of land and give such people a farm in due course, and remove the stupid stipulation that you must own some land before you can get some land.  That might have had some relevance in the past but not any more. Numbers of young people who would have made excellent farmers have been deprived of land because of this stipulation.</P>
    <P>A serious effort is being made in this project to stop the spiralling of inflation.  There will be some control on the price of food and clothing, which are very important items in the family budget.  We must not let things drift back into the situation where prices will increase again and there will be further inflation.  We must get industry and employment going. Somebody said we should wait for something to happen, but I think we should make it happen.  We can all help in our own way, for instance, <Col N="694" /> with local co-operatives, or if there is an industrialist coming into the area we can talk nicely to him, facilitate him by providing a suitable site and so on, and, most important, provide the people to take up the jobs thus created.  From my experience of being involved with food factories and co-operatives, I have met many people, and I can say that boys and girls working in industry are anxious to see their particular industry succeeding. They are anxious that their industry be able to continue in production. Despite the difficulties most of our industries are doing well.  Very often, though, there is not the market for a good competitive product.  This is where we fall down.  Every effort should be made to put the best salesmen we have in the market fields in Europe because we have the products and it is for us to ensure the best market possible for them.</P>
    <P>We have, perhaps, the most stringent regulations in Europe regarding milk and milk products.  We had the bacterial test for milk long before it was introduced in Europe.  Although this test and other such tests sometimes involved hardship for the farmers concerned, they realised the necessity and the importance of it and we can now boast about the hygiene that we apply to our dairy products. Our Irish Blue cheese, for instance, is probably the best such product in the world.</P>
    <P>I would like to see greater quantities of our meat being marketed directly rather than adopting the attitude of letting meat mountains occur.  We should endeavour in so far as possible to ensure that for every £'s worth of goods we import from European countries, they should import goods to the same value from us.  A nation like ours which depends so much on exports, particularly agricultural exports, cannot survive by importing inferior goods from Teheran or elsewhere and, at the same time, hoping to export our food products to people with whom we have no trade.</P>
    <P>We must endeavour to begin the exploration of our mineral resources as quickly as possible.  The gas that is off our coasts will not be of any use until it has been harnessed and is being used <Col N="695" /> for energy and for the production of fertilisers.  On the question of fertilisers, perhaps the Government would consider the introduction of subsidies in this area.  It would seem that because of the sudden big increase in fertiliser costs, there has been a cutback in the use of the products.  I would not consider that to have been a good reaction to the situation, but in order to maintain employment in the industry it is necessary that the Government take some action.</P>

      <P>Adequate use of fertilisers now will ensure greater milk and beef yields next year.  In regard to borrowing, credit must be given to the Minister for borrowing money that will be used for productive purposes. I trust that these measures proposed by the Minister will bear fruit and that the people will row in behind the Minister and accept their responsibility in these times of difficulty.</P>
      <P>The question of the link with sterling must be kept under close observation. Should the British economy continue on its merry downhill trend, we could not afford to follow suit.  The time may well come when we shall have to look at our economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the British one and we may have to bring our rate of inflation down to the level of whichever economy we may latch on to, whether it be Belgium, Germany or elsewhere.  In such case we would have to think in terms of an inflation rate of 6 or 7 per cent.  Therefore, before we begin to consider the break with sterling, we must begin to control our inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse everything being done by the Minister in this budget.  However, this is only a beginning and we can only hope that in the months ahead there will be co-operation from everybody so that we can get our economy moving again.  We can look forward with confidence to the future because of our oil and gas finds and also because of our ability to produce topquality goods at the right price.  We have always boasted that we could produce goods cheaper than they could be produced elsewhere in Europe.  We have always produced better than our <Col N="696" /> counterparts in the United Kingdom. That was our boast.  If we adopt that sort of selling attitude now there is no reason why we should not succeed. There is no reason why we should not succeed as the Germans did after the last war if we make the effort.  Our people are as good as the next.  The goodwill is there and so is the energy. There is nothing to stop us.</P>

      <P>This budget, the manner of its presentation and the whole exercise surrounding it, reminds me of the man who some years ago used to cycle across the Border every Thursday with a bag of sand over the handlebars of his bicycle.  The customs officers were very interested.  When the man reached the customs post he emptied the bag of sand and then refilled it.  The men on duty never found any contraband.  This went on for quite some time and then one of the customs officers was being transferred to another area; he met the cyclist in a pub and asked him to satisfy his curiosity and tell him why he carried this bag of sand.  The man looked at him, and said: &ldquo;It was bicycles I was smuggling.&rdquo; That is what is happening in this budget.  A bicycle is being smuggled.  The attention of the people is being focussed on subsidies to take their minds off the massive deficit which will reach £300 million by the end of this year.  How much longer can we expect to be treated to Government policies expounded in a manner resembling share promotions?  That is what this budget is.  A deficit of £300 million is beyond the comprehension of most, so far beyond that it does not have any impact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to understand the effect we must first of all understand what a deficit means.  It means the Government have spent or are spending more than they will get by way of revenue and the only way they can bridge the gap is by borrowing.  Now the borrowing has to be serviced by interest payments and ultimately the principal has to be repaid.  The country cannot find the money and consequently the bulk of the borrowing is done overseas outside the sterling area.  In addition to having to pay interest the lenders will also require certain guarantees to compensate <Col N="697" /> for the reduction in the value of the £ sterling: £100 million borrowed in 1971 at 9 per cent is now actually costing 9 per cent plus 30 per cent of 9 per cent; this is the additional interest for compensation for the diminishing value of sterling since 1971.  That means the Government will be meeting interest charges at a rate of nearly 12 per cent on that part of the deficit financed by overseas borrowing. In addition, the capital sum to be repaid has also been increased by nearly 30 per cent.  That means that if the Government borrow £100 million they will have to repay £130 million for each £100 million borrowed already. If sterling continues to decline at the same rate as it has declined over the last four years the Government will have to repay almost double the amount borrowed with a ten- to 12-year life, together with interest, and the real cost will be up to 20 per cent per annum.  We see now what the smuggled bicycle means.</P>
    <P>How can any self-respecting Government continue the pretence of being in control of our economy when it supports the Minister who has mismanaged our present and is mortgaging our future?  We should not, of course, be surprised at the mismanagement. We all know what happened last December.  The same Minister for Finance tried to persuade the people that the 15 pence extra tax on petrol was for their own good.  He also told us that sales to Northern Ireland motorists at the time were a drain on our own reserves and not a gain. In due course he lost the substance of that argument, as we know, and produced a shadow of an excuse; he said these sales did not get into our statistics and overseas lenders looked at statistics.</P>
    <P>Is this not proof that last December the Government were aware of the real financial state of the economy, out did not admit it.  They were concerned to dress up the accounts, as it were, for the benefit of foreign lenders.  That is what was going on. That can only be described as share pushing.  The Minister should tell us now how he proposes to service public debt and repay the borrowing entered <Col N="698" /> into to meet the deficit.  This is something we should be told.</P>
    <P>We have heard it suggested by a Senator who can be regarded as being in the inner councils of the Government that we should break the link with sterling.  That was so much kite flying.  As a result of that exercise between £30 million and £40 million came into the country in the purchase of Government securities from across the water and the Channel Islands. This money came from speculators, not from investors.  The reference by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to overseas investment of this amount in the first five months of the year is a misrepresentation of the facts. The movement of this money was pure speculation.  If we separate from UK sterling as was indicated by a recent statement from a Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise.  If we break with sterling Irish stocks will be designated as foreign securities. This will enable the proceeds of the sale of these stocks to benefit in time from the dollar premium which is now costing somewhere approaching 100 per cent.  That was the purpose of this speculation.  The statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Brussels in the past few days will add further fuel to this speculation.  To feed the flame of speculative demand, the Minister for Finance created a further issue of this gilt-edged stock to Government Departments and so the share pushers' merry-go-round rolls on and on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the road to ruin.  The Government are driving the country to ruin.  They are not fooling all the people, and they will not continue to fool anybody for very long.  The Government should tell us in detail how they can propose to service the borrowing which is necessary to finance the deficit.  They should also tell us how they propose to absorb the Government stock which they have pushed on overseas investors when, in fact, there is no separation from UK sterling.  The <Col N="699" /> Government have used the share pusher's rumour factory to convert what were unmarketable stocks held by Government Departments and they are now spending the cash realised as fast as they can.</P>
    <P>That money can only be spent once.  When it is spent, what will they use to pay for the same stocks when they are put back on the market by disillusioned speculators?  Will they proceed to monitor the ongoing situation in the normal way to the point where the gilt-edged market, like everything else in the country, goes completely out of control, thereby leading ultimately to an economic crisis?  If it were not so serious, it would be laughable.  The Government of the so-called talents are displaying a complete inability to manage our affairs.  They seem to be incapable of seeing the problems their inactivity has caused since the question was first posed in 1973.  They are ready to blame everybody but themselves for our present predicament.</P>
    <P>We are intitled to remind the Government of the old Truman motto: &ldquo;The buck stops here.&rdquo;  They have moved so far away from where the buck stops that this debate on this budget is not even real.  We do not know whether the proposals before us will be carried out.  The Government tell us this will depend on the reaction and agreement of others.  We have been elected to this Dáil to determine policy for the benefit of the country as a whole.  The two parties opposite decided to coalesce and form a Government. There should be no passing of the buck to the Arabs, or the multi-nationals, or the FUE, or CII, or the Congress of Trade Unions. Undoubtedly participation by these bodies is worth while, but this is the Government's baby.  However unfit they have shown themselves to be in the past two-and-a-half years, it is still their baby and their responsibility, not the responsibility of the Congress of Trade Unions, the FUE and the other bodies to which they have kicked it over.</P>
    <P>Until they are thrown out of office <Col N="700" /> the Government will have to continue to govern.  We are entitled to demand that they do their duty and govern. They should not use groupings outside this Chamber who are not answerable to Parliament for this purpose as they have been doing.  The financial effects on the country of the Government's lack of action and inability to cope with the problems of the increased cost of oil and energy are now very evident.  At the time of the energy crisis I repeatedly tried to draw their attention to the economic effects of the energy cost increase, but nothing happened.  There was no action except that we were told we would never again have cheap energy. We still do not see any action or any attempt being made to deal with our energy problem.</P>
    <P>Now that the situation has become so desperate I see a continuation of the new management techniques which this Government practise so adroitly to such an extent as to justify any change, or any type of share pushing, or any means of getting money, such as the means we have seen over the past few weeks with regard to the gilt-edged market.  Our financial difficulties cannot be corrected by these gimmicks.  The deficit cannot be made to disappear.  To finance a deficit of this magnitude it will have to be serviced and repaid, and we are entitled to ask how do the Government propose to do this.  I estimate that this is virtually impossible without imposing an intolerable burden of taxation on the people, further taxation on the already over-taxed work force.  The cost of the interest for the Government's deficit forecast for 1975 would absorb more in taxation on its own than we raised with all the increased taxes in the January budget.</P>
    <P>Do the Government intend to move into a simple form of tax raising such as pricing a packet of cigarettes at £1, or a pint at £1, or a glass of spirits at £1, or by raising the standard rate of tax to 50 per cent or more, and pricing a gallon of petrol at something like £2?  Is this what the Government intend to impose on an already over-taxed population?  This <Col N="701" /> is the reality.  These are not figures taken out of the sky.  A deficit of the present size in a country of this size cannot be sustained, whatever the political pressures behind the Government. The Government's policy of inaction and continued vacillation in every sector has brought our economy into an area which is fraught with danger.</P>
    <P>There is no sign in this House that this situation is being dealt with honestly.  We do not believe it is being dealt with properly.  The measures announced a few days ago will not have the effect we would all like to see in order to correct the rate of inflation as it is running today and, above all, to get people back to work. We do not see that happening as a result of these measures.  It is very wrong and very irresponsible for any Government elected by the people to govern the country to try to put the responsibility for corrective measures on to the trade union movement, or the Federated Union of Employers, as the Government have done in this case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now discussing what could be described as the second official budget this year.  We seem to have budgets every second day.  If there was ever an incomplete package brought into this House, this budget is one of them.  The power that should be vested in Dáil Éireann is being taken from it completely.  Yet it was a budget which was heralded with high publicity at a cost to the ordinary taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have been in power now almost two-and-a-half years and, at the end of that period, we can see we are going from bad to worse.  We and the public were led to believe there were days and nights of hard work; the midnight oils being burned; Ministers sweating in their shirt sleeves, meeting anybody and everybody; they were going to produce a super budget to cure all our ills.  After all the labour pains and time spent in the labour ward, they produced this budget which could be described only as a little dormouse.  In the papers we were told and, through the Government Information Bureau, <Col N="702" /> one person after another was sending out Press releases to the effect that they had met this organisation and that organisation.  The Minister in his speech expressed his thanks to all the representatives of labour, industrial and agricultural interests and to the National Economic and Social Council. After all those discussions one would have thought the Government would have introduced something that would not have to be referred further. The success of this budget seems now to revert to the Employer-Labour Conference. Certainly it is a body that should be consulted, but I claim that nobody has the right to decide what should happen except the democratically elected representatives of the people in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>If this Government introduces similar budgets in the future they will be saying to the agricultural community: &ldquo;The success of our budget is over to you now.&rdquo;  Of course, there is no fear that the day will arrive when the unfortunate recipients of social welfare will be asked: &ldquo;Will you accept this?  We cannot put the budget through if you do not accept it.&rdquo;  No; they are not sufficiently strong; they are not a pressure group; they are not a sufficiently-united group and have not sufficient organisations to speak for them.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there were differences of opinion between the Government Parties as to what would be done when this budget was presented. Once again they kicked to touch, took the easy way out and brought in an incomplete budget.  They tried then to put across that they were a Government of consultation, a Government who would meet the people, a Government who wanted to be generous with everybody.  Of course, that is merely another fallacy.  There are people affected by this budget who cannot kick out.  There are changes to be implemented in the income tax code affecting many people.  Were those people consulted before these proposals were introduced?  Certainly, they were not.  At the end of last year were the motorists of Ireland consulted before an extra 15p per gallon was put on the price of petrol?  Were young house builders consulted before <Col N="703" /> the increased mortgage rates were announced in this budget?  No; the Minister thought he was in a sufficiently strong position to take a swipe at certain sections of our community but he thought others might rebel, causing him some annoyance and trouble, and he decided he would not bother with them.</P>
    <P>It is obvious and agreed by everybody that inflation must be tackled. Deputy Hegarty said this morning that a start had been made.  We, in Fianna Fáil, told the Government last autumn, and long before, that remedial measures would have to be taken.  But they refused to implement such measures at that time.  They went away budgeting for this or that deficit; at all costs they would remain popular; they were the people who, at all times, would hand out the goodies. But the day of reckoning has to come. Now the pigeons are coming home to roost; the country is in a shocking mess; there is no confidence in the building industry amongst industrialists, amongst the agricultural community or workers, when they see factories and so on closing down all round them; they see the unemployment figures rising.  Conservative estimates show that, for the first time in our history, we may hit 130,000 unemployed around next September or October. God forbid that that will happen but what measures are being taken to prevent it?  Unfortunately the provisions of this budget will not counteract it. There are not measures in this budget which will create employment.  Where do our school leavers, young boys and girls, stand today?  Where do people who have undertaken courses and obtained their Higher Diplomas in Education stand?  I can speak of my own area, where the Cork County Vocational Committee held interviews last week.  They had approximately 30 vacancies and 520 applicants. In order to curtail it to a manageable size&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary is as aware of this as I am&mdash;nobody who received their H.Dip this year was considered for a post.  That is very sad indeed and is the result of mismanagement of the Government. <Col N="704" /> This was not the position obtaining three or four years ago&mdash;approximately 103,000 unemployed with a prospective jump of another 25,000 or 30,000.  Our economy was handed over in good repair to the present Government.  They have completely mismanaged it for the simple reason &mdash;as we pointed out on many occasions&mdash;that the two philosophies of Fine Gael and Labour could not join for the good of the country in producing policies so that we might go abroad and hold our heads high amongst the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>Government speakers are all attempting to say that there is nothing in this budget except that it is up to the Employer-Labour Conference. But even in that respect the Minister's statement is contradictory, where he says&mdash;on the subject of inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>By whatever detailed renegotiation is necessary we must take immediate steps to ensure that the measures which the Government are taking to wind down inflation will be matched by an appropriate provision of the remaining national agreement increases&mdash;for example, by dropping the third phase or by modifying the third and fourth phases or some equivalent adjustment. How exactly the agreement should be revised to achieve this end is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Employer-Lobour Conference and I am asking the Chairman of the Conference to have it convened urgently to put this examination in hands.</P>
    <P>I wonder was that discussed at all in all of the pre-budget talks we heard about?  Was it ever discussed and, if so, what was the result?  What happened? Was there disagreement and, if there was, are the Government unwilling to take a decision?</P>
    <P>The Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>I want no misunderstanding to arise.  There is no question of reneging on or abandoning the national agreement.</P>
    <P>In the past, national wage agreements were established under Fianna Fáil and were always honoured; it was understood always that once they were made they were honoured.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> The Minister continued further to say:</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand modifications of the national pay agreement should be refused or if they should be inadequate, the government would be reluctantly obliged to consider revoking the price reliefs which are a significant feature of this budget.</P>
    <P>What is that?  Is that a threat?  Is it a declaration of intent or policy, or will the Minister implement it?</P>
    <P>Then the Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>If people insist on maintaining all the terms of the national pay agreement intact it would simply not be possible for the Exchequer to meet the increased cost of today's package of proposals plus the cost of implementing in full the national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>How can one equate those two statements? In one part of his speech the Minister told us that there was no question of reneging or abandoning the National Wage Agreement but in another part he told us that if people insist on maintaining it the Exchequer will not be able to meet the increased cost.  The Minister should explain what he means by those statements.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister's statement the ICTU rejected his proposals and the FUE have indicated what they think should be done.  Are we back to where we were a long time ago? Are we back to the stage where renegotiations will have to take place?  The Minister for Finance is the cause of all this. Responsibility for this rests on his shoulders and he should try and rectify the position.</P>
    <P>If there was ever a loser in this budget it is agriculture. That industry only gets a few lines in the Minister's statement.  It has become the poor relation of this Government, who seem to have thrown it to the wind.  We were told that £3 million would be given to agriculture, but what is that to be used for?  The Minister should tell us how it came about that that money is wanted in the agriculture industry.  There is no word in the budget statement about <Col N="706" /> the undeveloped areas.  What about the £6 million that was passed in the January budget?  Was that spent on something else?  The undeveloped areas were mapped out and brought about in a reckless fashion.  Mountain ranges were divided and people living on one side qualified while those on the other side with the same type of land did not qualify.</P>
    <P>Agriculture, and those involved in it, have taken a severe knocking from this Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary who comes from an area of small farmers knows that.  He and the Government have thrown their hats at the agriculture industry and let those involved in it sink or swim.  The farming community were never worse off.  They cannot buy fertilisers and men are being laid off in Goulding's because farmers are not using fertilisers. Were did the rot set in?  In my view the rot set in when the Government took away £1.2 million in subsidies for fertilisers after they were one month in office.  At that time I said it would have a bad effect on the farming community and would result in less fertilisers being used.  I also pointed out that it would result in less produce from the land and, ultimately, result in unemployment at the processing plants.  The Government were told those things when they rushed around trying to save money.</P>
    <P>What about the price of milk?  Nobody knows what milk will make.  The leaders of the farming organisations, the economists and the Government speakers at one time told the people that the price of milk delivered by farmers to creameries would be 32 to 33p per gallon.  The farmers were told that this concession had been received from the EEC.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries when he arrived back from Brussels on one occasion announced that he had negotiated a great deal for the farmers and forecast an upswing in price. The farmers can tell the Minister that in their June cheques for the May supply very few were paid 29.5p per gallon.  Where has the other money gone?  Millions of pounds are involved in this. There is no incentive to produce <Col N="707" /> if the farmers do not know what is going to happen.</P>
    <P>We know that the pig industry is in a bad state.  I hope there will be an upswing and that it will go back to the traditional producer.  Pig producing has fallen into the hands of the bigger producer, and that is a pity.  It was a source of income to small farmers who had to produce something other than milk on account of their small holdings.  The Minister told us that he had discussions with the banks in relation to intervention beef.  He stated:</P>
    <P>The commercial banks have accepted, following consultations with the Central Bank, that it is appropriate that moneys for intervention purposes should be provided through the banking system and have already agreed to provide £58 million for this purpose, being the amount advanced by the Exchequer for this purpose to 31st December last.</P>
    <P>Do I take it that the Government do not have to provide that money now?</P>
    <P>The statement continued:</P>
    <P>Discussions are now being opened with them on the additional £38 million required in the coming year.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister refers to a story in one of today's newspapers to the effect that there was a racket in the Irish beef intervention system.  That story was to the effect that there was a racket of the magnitude of £10 million. The Minister should tell the House whether that is true or not. The hint in the newspaper was that from discussions in the EEC they would not allow Ireland to participate in the intervention scheme this year.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the £38 million?  How will it be distributed? We had the shocking spectacle last year of the £58 million falling mainly into the hands of a few people.  It did not work its way down to the man who produced the cattle or the small farmer who had to sell off his cattle. I understood the Government had initiated an inquiry into this system and had sought advice on how the system should be changed this year. <Col N="708" /> I expect to hear some proposal in the near future.  The Minister should see that the £38 million is distributed to the man who rears the calves and has to sell them when they are young stores.  We should not allow the situation to continue where marts are filled with cattle, buyers paying big prices but farmers are not adequately compensated for producing the animals.  We brought that to the notice of the Government several times last year but they took no action.  Will we have the same position in 1975?  It appears that the £38 million will only benefit a few while the hard-working and depressed small farmers will be thrown to the wind.</P>
    <P>There was no discussion with the farming organisations before the Government decided to do away with the subsidies on fertilisers.  Discusions take place on matters that suit the Government and they take decisions if they think they will be popular or if they think the group affected cannot have a swipe back at them.  If powerful groups are involved the Government do not seem to be able to reach a decision at all.  Agriculture deserves an injection of millions of pounds.  I should like the Minister to tell the House what money is owed to the ACC: what money was not paid on the gale days on which it was due? What money has been lent to farmers, in general, by that organisation compared with the amount lent to the co-operative societies? I am convinced that most of the money lent by the ACC, an excellent body, goes to the big co-operative societies.  Many farmers cannot meet their commitments to the ACC to pay back their loans.</P>
    <P>There is no mention about any commitments we may have to the intervention system for skim milk powder. I do not want to hear sorrowful stories from the Minister for Finance during the summer recess about what he had to provide for it.  It is obvious that stocks are building up all over Europe and that they are also building up in this country.  Would the Minister let us know if we will be paying money for this or if he has arranged with the banks to provide <Col N="709" /> money for the intervention system for skim milk powder?</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees that we should be tackling inflation and creating employment. It is very important to provide employment now because the emigrant ship is no longer available for people out of work.  During the time of previous Coalition Governments when people were out of work they went on the emigrant ship and could be working in London, Coventry or Birmingham the following morning, but this can no longer happen.  This budget has done very little to create employment.</P>
    <P>We are told in the budget that employers who employ men signing on at the labour exchanges will get £12 per person.  This is a good innovation but it is hard to know how it will work.  What categories are involved in this?  We are told that it is a temporary scheme of employment premia for manufacturing industry other than some highly seasonal food-processing operations.  The Minister told us:</P>
    <P>This will subsidise employers who recruit from the Live Register net additions to their full-time work force.  Up to 31 March, 1976, the premium will be at the rate of £12 a week for each additional worker employed.</P>
    <P>Is this not a very narrow area in which to employ those people?</P>
    <P>Farmers during the summer months often employ extra labour.  If any of those farmers employ an extra man to trim hedges, carry out farm improvements or do work which is badly needed on his farm, will he qualify for this employment premium?  Surely he is entitled as much as anybody else to avail of the £12 premium? Those people seem to be cut out again in the budget.  Agriculture has suffered in the proposals in the second budget of 1975.  The Government seem to have thrown their hats at them and left them behind and do not seem to care if farmers sink or swim.</P>
    <P>Some other Deputy mentioned local authorities.  If they have water extension schemes, sewerage schemes or any other schemes like that can they <Col N="710" /> qualify if they take men from the Live Register?  They are giving as good a service as anybody else.  This scheme can be a good one if it is properly implemented.  What about builders?  Are they involved in this? It would be a good thing if they took on extra men and were given a subsidy. Somebody has to place the order with the manufacturing firm before he can take on some of those people on the Live Register.  You cannot employ a man if you cannot sell the goods.  A builder cannot build a house unless somebody has ordered it and will live in it.</P>
    <P>A man who is working is much happier than an unemployed man, unless he is a complete dosser.  We all want to get work and take pride in our work.  The Minister should state clearly if the building industry will qualify, if farmers will qualify and if he has a scheme for local authorities. There is no mention in the budget for the development of bog roads. Would such a scheme not be a good one to get local authorities involved in?  If they were subsidised at the rate of £12 per person for everybody they employed developing bog roads it would give access to many of our bogs which have not been used for years. Anybody who lives near bogs knows that people are going to the bogs day after day.  They are cutting and saving turf the same way as they did 30 years ago.  As I commented before, between shahs and sheiks you can meet many people on the road with sleans and pikes.  That is the position today.  We are not providing access roads to bogs.  Some of them were taken over by the Land Commission but they will not repair them.  Flooding and hardship during the winter have created such bad conditions on those bog roads that lorries cannot travel over them.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of this budget is the increased charges which people who get house loans have to pay.  The Minister said in his budget speech:</P>
    <P>As from today, therefore, interest on new advances from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities for these loans will be increased from <Col N="711" /> 10 per cent a year to 11 per cent and the repayment period will be reduced from 35 to 30 years.  As a consequence, the normal interest rate of loans to new borrowers will be increased from 10½ per cent to 11½ per cent a year.  For those who avail of the maximum loan of £4,500 the net additional charge to the borrower will be approximately 75p per week when income tax relief at 26 per cent on interest payments is taken into account.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister know what he is talking about?  Is he taking into consideration that most of the people who build their own homes and have a loan of £4,500 to pay back have to furnish them and have a fair standard of living and they have not got an income high enough to be taxed? They are mostly people with young families of up to five children who are finding it very hard to live.  It is no consolation to them to tell them that the additional charge they will have to meet is 75p per week because most of them do not qualify for that.</P>
    <P>Why should they be at a loss of 75p per week?  Why should anybody, who has been thrifty enough to save £3,000 or £4,000 and had to pay tax on it and who, if he invested it in a bank or elsewhere had to pay further tax if the interest was over £70 per annum, when he seeks a loan of £4,500 have to pay from 75p to £1 per week more now in order to build his own home?  For being thrifty, for paying tax while at work and for paying further tax on savings the Minister for Finance says in effect you must pay another £52 per year.  This is nonsense when we are trying to create employment.  These people would create employment if we gave them a chance.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil introduced a motion during the year to exempt people from double taxation to a certain limit.  That motion suggested that if £4,500 were invested in a building society the interest would be free of income tax.  That was a good motion and one which the people want to see implemented.  Are young people who are being taxed at work not entitled <Col N="712" /> to try to put together the price of a house and try to build it with the aid of a local authority loan?  But the Government seem to be trying to ensure that people who are thrifty and try to help themselves will be taxed to the hilt.  That message runs through all Government policy.  It may be right to tax people at one level but we should not tax thrift.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government talks of all the houses local authorities are building but instead of providing extra money would it not be better if the Minister said the loan interest will be 11½ per cent if your income is £X and it will be reduced <i>pro rata</i> down to 2 per cent if your income is at a lower level and the £4,500 will become £6,000.  That would be a good policy because the State will have to pay for building houses in any case.  Is the man who gets a loan even at a low rate of interest not better than a man filling up a form for a council house while himself and his wife live in a bad home?  Even though under the managerial system public representatives have no function these people go from one public representative to another, as we all know, asking them to intercede so that they will get a decent house to live in.  Would it not be better for the State if that man with an income of, say, £30 or £35 per week could get a loan almost free of interest to build his own home?  Such people would take more pride in that than they can take in the degrading system whereby the house is built for them and they have to wait in a queue and then be told that they have to wait for another three years or so. They are exasperated because they are taxed to the hilt and cannot get a proper house.</P>
    <P>You do not get good citizens unless they have good homes to live in.  We want private enterprise and not State monopoly which is what we are heading towards.  It seems to be Government policy that the State should first own all the houses and then hand them over to the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my views clear on that matter.  We have had changes in value-added tax.  In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>As I stated earlier, the Government have decided that, with effect on and from 1st July, 1975, the zero rate of VAT will be applied to the following categories of goods which are at present subject to the 6.75 per cent tax rate:</P>
      <P>(a)  clothing and clothing materials and footwear;</P>
      <P>(b)  electricity and heating fuels generally.</P>
      <P>That is very welcome and should have been done, as we have said, long ago. At the time of the introduction of the green £ we said that food subsidies should then be introduced.</P>
      <P>As regards clothing, I should like to know what is the position about stock on hand?  The Minister should explain that.  Many people have a good deal of stock on hands and have paid VAT on it and would be selling it at a certain price.  Will they have to sell to the public at the old price or can they be recouped from any source?  If they get in new stock VAT at zero rate will apply.  The Minister should clarify what will happen regarding existing stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that imported clothes and footwear will qualify for zero rating even if they come from Taiwan or elsewhere.  Can that be remedied? These are not EEC countries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows all the mechanics of the position. These goods are imported here using England as a back door.  Why should they qualify for an advantage of 6.75 per cent?  Why should we have to subsidise them if this can be avoided?  We should be increasing VAT on such goods because they have a detrimental effect on our textile and footwear industries.  We have exhorted the Government many times to try to safeguard our footwear and textile industries which are now in a shambles. In Brussels now we are at last trying to do something about this but in the past we have been lackadasical and it <Col N="714" /> is now very late in the day.  I will pay tax with any man but I do not feel happy paying tax to reduce the price of imported goods manufactured in the Far East by big industrialists who pay only slave wages to their workers. There is a big principle involved here.</P>
    <P>What are clothing and clothing materials?  I am very interested in this matter because in my area there are factories that manufacture blankets among other things and I am told blankets will not qualify.  If you go into a shop and you belong to the chinchilla or Canadian squirrel grade to buy a fur coat you will get a good reduction.  There is something completely wrong if a man in the upper stratum of society can buy his wife a Canadian squirrel for £3,000 and get a 6.75 per cent reduction while if Mary Murphy, an old age pensioner goes in shopping for her husband who may be sick at home and if she wants to buy three sheets and two blankets, the shop-keeper will tell her there is no reduction in VAT on those items.  That is the position at present. Are we mad?  Should people try to make a dress out of the blanket?</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter and I want to point out the bankruptcy of the Minister's speech.  It was silly.  Let him say that clothing, footwear and bedclothes will qualify for zero VAT rating.  The wealthy person who buys beautiful clothes will get the full benefit of zero rating.  On a fur coat costing £2,000 6.75 per cent would involve a considerable reduction.  The amount of money involved in that could be used to reduce the price of blankets and sheets for the poor person, who does not seem to matter nowadays with the pseudo-socialists and super-socialists that are around. They seem to have sold out on their socialism.</P>
    <P>There has been a reduction in the price of butter.  There has been a reduction in CIE fares.  There is a complete lack of policy.  Not so long ago the Minister gave permission to CIE to raise fares.  Now they are to come down.  I understand the axe is to fall on CIE personnel and that the nice hostesses on the trains are the first to be given protective notice.  What is <Col N="715" /> the policy?  Will there be further increases in rail fares?  I have always said that the railways should be regarded as a social service.  The railways reduce the number of motorists on the roads.  People who commute to Dublin would travel by train if the cost were comparative.  If rail fares are increased people will be driven on to the roads which are not geared for the heavy volume of traffic coming on to them.  What is the policy in regard to CIE?  What will the rate of subsidy be from now on?  Will they merely have to present their accounts to the Government and be subsidised? Can I take it that in the next 12 months there will be no further increases in CIE fares?  We need a clear declaration of intent from the Government in regard to train fares and CIE in general.</P>
    <P>The price of butter is reduced by 10p.  One week after the 15p was put on the gallon of petrol the price of butter increased.  The Minister explained that the increase of 15p on a gallon of petrol was to make the price the same as in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  He widened the gap between the price of butter here and the price in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  It was proved to me at that time that because of the differential in price a person who smuggled in ten tons of butter from Northern Ireland could make a profit of £4,600. Smuggled butter from Northern Ireland was selling freely in my county because it was cheaper to the housewives. The Government removed the subsidy although we exhorted them to leave the subsidy on butter.  Now they are giving a subsidy of 10p a lb.  The price differential will not be so attractive to the person anxious to make a quick profit.</P>
    <P>The price of liquid milk is to be reduced by 2p.  Milk is an essential commodity and the ordinary person should be able to buy it at a fair price. What is the policy?  Will the subsidy continue?  Will the subsidy continue on the loaf of bread?  Will there be smaller loaves?  The yo-yo policy of taking off and putting on subsidies undermines confidence in the Government and in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="716" /> As a nation we are not paying our way.  There is a huge deficit, a huge budget deficit.  The balance of trade is not favourable.  Measures must be taken.  Otherwise the child born today will have no means of repaying the national debt.  Everybody at ministerial level is in the air.  The Minister for Finance has been in the Middle East negotiating a loan.  Rumour has it that he has not been so successful.  As a layman I would like to know the position. If the £ keeps falling what will we have to pay in respect of these loans in addition to the normal interest rate?  Rumour has it that the Minister for Finance is to take to the air again and to have further talks in the Middle East in regard to loans. Experts writing in the papers say that money is not as plentiful in the Middle East as people believe it to be.  There seems to be nothing in the Government kitty, no money available for necessary things.  The Minister, for all his travelling abroad, does not seem to have brought back the money.  I understand that our EEC partners must act as guarantors in regard to all these matters.  When the Minister is concluding the debate I hope he will refer to that matter and give us the true position.</P>
    <P>The budget was designed to reduce the consumer price index and to give employment.  There are certain categories of people who have been badly hit by the budget and who will continue to be affected.  They are people who are thrifty and inclined to save. People now say there is no point in saving or being in credit in the bank, that it is better to be in the red nowadays because those who were thrifty are being taxed on their savings.</P>
    <P>A people can be divided into three categories, the young, the able-bodied workers and the unemployed, the aged and the infirm.  The able-bodied workers have to support the rest of society.  These people are becoming poorer and poorer and have to pay more and more and they are becoming fed up.  There are people working very hard today only to find that the last penny is being taken from them in taxation.  If a single man has about £800 in the bank and is looking forward to marrying the girl of his choice <Col N="717" /> and having a home of his own, the bank manager reports him to the Minister for Finance and the interest on his deposit is taxed.  This is in addition to the ordinary income tax.  There is taxation on top of taxation.  The Minister should ensure that people who are thrifty and want to help themselves are recognised and helped by the State. The budget has done nothing to help those people.</P>
    <P>The budget offers nothing for agriculture which is our greatest national asset.  We have not the raw material for manufacturing industry.  The Minister must make a much more elaborate statement on this matter when he is concluding the debate.</P>
    <P>We have a Government who have been guilty of a lot of patronage.  This is what happens when you have a lot of patronage.  People are infiltrating the civil service, sons-in-law of various people.  I will not dwell on that.</P>
    <P>What this country wants is clear thinking on where we are going, and it is obvious this Government cannot provide that.  It is about time the people had an opportunity of finding out who wants to govern.  No Government could have made a greater mess of things than this one.  They are devoid of idea, thought and purpose, and the only way to bring back credibility in our standing, not only here but throughout the world, is to have a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that the circumstances of great difficulty in which the economies of the world in general and of this country in particular find themselves at present would furnish something of a dilemma to an Opposition. At times of difficulty, of rising unemployment and very severe inflation, the temptation to indulge in destructive criticism can often, particularly to inexperienced people, be almost irresistible.  I even made reference in previous debates to that tendency on the part of the Opposition and my argument has been countered with the reply that I was simply trying to head off perfectly valid, correct and justified criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before entering on to the main part of what I intend to say, I want <Col N="718" /> to give an example of the sort of destructive criticism from Opposition speakers in this debate which I came on reading the unrevised record.  I shall give as close a reference as I can, although it is not from the formal record.  Not alone does it exemplify the sort of opposition we have been having, which perhaps is depressing because we have criticised that sort of opposition, but it is extremely damaging not simply to the work of Ministers and the Government, because they are fair game in difficult times and the Opposition must make the best they can of the straws they can pick up, but to the efforts of dedicated public servants.  I want to give the example and then I want to put on record some statistical material, not to indicate that the situation is easy, because we know it is not easy, not to make the difficulties go away with words, because we know they are real, but to put them into the context of difficulty but not destruction or despair.  Let me give this example which I found so profoundly shocking. I am quoting the unrevised typescript of a speech by Deputy Colley on 26th June at approximately 4.40 p.m.  I cannot give a more precise reference than that but it will appear very soon in the Official Report.  I quote:</P>
    <P>If you put yourself in the shoes of a foreign investor and take a look at what is happening here because of inflation and the heights to which it has been allowed to go, the effect that has had on wage rates, would you seriously consider setting up a business in this country so long as that kind of thing is allowed to go on?</P>
    <P>Now comes the sentence to which I want to draw attention:</P>
    <P>It would be cheaper to set up an operation in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>That is not the casual crossroads, churchgate, backbench throwaway line.  That is the considered statement of a man who has had a number of posts in Government, most recently in the Department of Finance; that is the Finance spokesman for the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that in a moment.  There is the sentence: &ldquo;It would be cheaper to set up an operation in the United States of America.&rdquo;  I have a document which was prepared in the public service but prepared some months ago not in reference to that speech, because nobody could know at the time that Deputy Colley was going to say such a thing, but in relation to the costs in different countries.  It is a column of 15 countries around the world and by accident the first of those is the United States of America and the second last is Ireland.  I shall give the total labour costs, which are made up of the hourly earnings plus the indirect labour costs in pence per hour, first for Ireland, and it is 88p.  The figure for the United States is £2.24. That comes from a document not prepared to refute that monstrous sort of statement but prepared in the public service.</P>
      <P>In the first place the rate is nearly three times ours in the United States, and, secondly, we have a larger battery of State aids, which are very near the limit of what is possible in the Community and which we are continually defending, and of a kind which the United States do not have. All the aids we give&mdash;export tax relief, direct grants, training grants, subsidies, help with exports, help with design, help with research and development, help with finding sites, and infrastructural things&mdash;would have to be added to that difference in labour costs.  Yet, Deputy Colley, who has been a Minister for Industry and Commerce concerned with promoting industrial development and who has been a Minister for Finance, can say it would be cheaper to set up an operation in the United States of America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Put that statement into context now.  Leave the Minister out of it.  This country has a staff of very dedicated public servants who are scouring the world at this moment to the detriment of their health trying to keep up industrial investments.  Deputy <Col N="720" /> Colley knows them.  He was Minister for Industry and Commerce and travelled with them.  Apart from the give and take of political abuse, what is he doing to them, to their efforts, to their morale, when he is quotable in every country in the world on the record of this House as an ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce and Finance as knocking the basis from under the efforts of those people trying to promote industrialisation, job creation, exports.  What a thing to do at a difficult time?</P>

In those circumstances, how can an ex-Minister hand them that weapon to use against us?  It seems to me, of course, extraordinary but also to exemplify the sort of damaging and begrudging opposition we have been getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on the record something of our general economic performance.  I have affirmed the difficulties, but let us please put those difficulties into context.  My responsibility is with industry so I shall talk a little about industrial production. I hear again from the Opposition a certain resentment to making international comparisons, but we had moved into a free trade situation before our membership of the Community by way of the various GATT rounds.  We are shopping for investment all over the world.  We are part of a Community of nine which may grow bigger.  It is not only permissible but obligatory to measure oneself against comparable places.  This is the only way to measure performance whether in good times or bad times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to quote now from the most recent issue of a periodical which gives the main economic indicators and which is published by OECD.  I am referring to the June, 1975 issue in which the figures for industrial production are given.  These figures are a little out of date because up to date figures are never given in international statistics.  They are half a year out of date.  For the last quarter of 1973 compared with the last quarter of 1974, the whole of OECD industrial production was down by 5 per cent. In the whole of the EEC&mdash;a smaller group and more initmately related&mdash; industrial production was down by 4.3 <Col N="722" /> per cent.  If one takes the worst country on the list, Japan, one finds that their industrial production was down by 11.9 per cent.  All countries suffered a decline but the best on the list were Belgium and the Netherlands with a rate of decline of 0.8 per cent during the 12 months.  We find that our decline was 1.9 per cent, that in the UK it was 2.7 per cent, in Italy, 7.5 per cent and in Germany&mdash;the economic miracle and the tremendous strength &mdash;the figure was 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>Nobody likes a decline but there was not a rotten performance on our part.  The figure for Ireland was better than the average for the whole of the OECD and for the EEC countries. Only two of the EEC countries had a smaller decline than ours.  I am not saying that this is good or that this Government are satisfied with the situation, but in context the figure is not an indication of catastrophe or incompetence.</P>
    <P>We are entitled, too, to put the unemployment situation, serious as it is, into context with the rest of the Community.  Comparing the period to April, 1974, with the same period in 1975 our increase in unemployment was 41 per cent.  For the comparable period in Denmark the figure was 340 per cent, in Germany, 110 per cent, in France, 72 per cent, in Belgium, 70 per cent, in the Netherlands, 55 per cent and then are listed the countries in which the situation was slightly better than ours&mdash;Britain and Italy.  But of the nine countries, one starts at 340 per cent increase and that does not make allowance for the &ldquo;guest&rdquo; workers who went home from such places as Germany, the Turks, the Spaniards, the Portuguese and the Algerians who did not come back because the jobs were not available for them.  Here again the figure so far as we are concerned is not an indication of catastrophe or incompetence, although it is very serious, but let us put it in context.</P>
    <P>It is suggested, too, that we have some sort of catastrophe in our export industry which bears directly on me because it is in that area that I have Ministerial responsibility.  If we take the months January to April, 1975, <Col N="723" /> and compare them with the same months for 1974&mdash;I am taking those peculiar months because I have not got reliable figures which go beyond April&mdash;we find that the figures for manufactured exports show an increase in value of 20 per cent.  This amounts to very little growth in real terms but what there is is a very substantial growth compared with lots of other countries.  I read in today's <i>Financial Times</i> that Japanese chemical exports are declining.  Our chemical exports were up by 42 per cent during that 12 months.  This was in the middle of a desperate world recession. Our machinery and transport equipment was up by 34 per cent while the general category of manufactured articles not exactly specified was up by 20 per cent.  Regardless of what the Opposition may think, I am very proud of the performance of our industrial exports and of the people who are chalking up that performance. They are doing extremely well in desperate circumstances in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>While agreeing with the Deputy, I think the point is still valid.  I have been talking about industrial export performance but I have not mentioned other areas such as the food industry.  It is worth noting that food and live animal exports are up by 47 per cent.  That is an excellent performance.  All of this reflects itself in our balance of trade.  Traditionally we have always had an import excess. I have here accumulative totals for the previous 12 months&mdash;one takes a 12 months' which ends in, say, April and, then, the 12 months that end in May and one rolls on the 12 months' excess from month to month&mdash;and these figures indicate that the import excess is the lowest, in May, 1975, of all the figures before me.  There are <Col N="724" /> various other ways in which this can be turned around but let me quote from the CSO figures for the 18th June, 1975 which show that external trade for May, 1975 was £27.7 million. I note that in May, 1974 the figure was £66.7 million.  The change since the same month last year is that we have £39 million less of a gap between exports and imports.  I am not trying to minimise the seriousness of the situation.  I am trying to put in the context of a world recession and of the performance of other countries what are in many instances the heroic efforts of our industry, of our exports.</P>
      <P>It would be damaging and harmful to indicate that our situation is worse than it is.  Our balance of trade is improving dramatically.  I should add that, in a way, that is not especially cheering because while our exports can go on increasing, part of this is due to a diminution in the demand for imports which would be used in manufacturing for subsequent export. Part of the narrowing of the gap is due to a slackening of imports because of a slackening of industrial activity.  However, it is still a very heartening narrowing.  It means that our rise in exports is bigger and more dramatic than our rise in imports, and that is something that is very useful at a difficult time.</P>
      <P>Before going on to talk of other matters I wish, merely for the record, to try to answer what I consider to be a damaging assertion, not, perhaps, damaging for the Government, though Government deserve damage if they are acting improperly, but damaging for industry too because we are at a time &mdash;this is not my opinion; it is the indices&mdash;of crisis.  On that point of indices, let me quote a source if people want to look it up: a magazine in the United States keeps a very up-to-date analysis of statistics.  I wish our statistics were as up-to-date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an up-to-date analysis of a very wide-ranging series of indices of the level of business activity and it does show that the American recession is not any longer going down; it is on the bottom and there are signs of it lifting.  There are signs of recession <Col N="725" /> lifting in other places as well.  One of the points here is we are getting out of synchronisation.  Our problems are continuing when other people's problems are beginning to end.  That means we must be ready for the upturn when it comes and that means that confidence is important but, apart from confidence, it is the task of the businessman to see the situation exactly as it is and the task of the industrialist not to be too pessimistic or too optimistic but to see things accurately as they are.</P>
    <P>I am simply trying to restore balance to counter the accusation that, and I quote &ldquo;this Government is doing nothing about support for industry&rdquo;. I am not going to enter into details.  I just want to put the global picture in my time of responsibility for public moneys for industry on the record.  Before doing that, I would point out that our level of support both in the form of money and range of services is among the greatest in the world and is much greater than it is in many of our Community partners and competitors.  Indeed, there is a school of economic thought which says they are too high and therefore detrimental.  I hasten to add that I do not belong to that school, but they are very high.</P>
    <P>Let me give you now the movement in budget funds for industry in the public capital programme in the last year of Opposition and in the period in which I have been Minister for Industry and Commerce, either by direct subvention, through the IDA, or SFADCO, or Gaeltarra or by nonfinance industry.  We will take those two as global sums because I do not want to drown either the record or the House in statistics.  These two categories together show that in 1972-1973 the total sum was £42 million; in 1973-1974 it was £50 million and in 1975 it was £89.6 million.  In the period of two-and-three-quarter years form 1972-1973, before we changed the basis of our financial year, the total sum subvented to industry was increased by 112 per cent and there is now, as announced by the Minister for Finance, an additional £4 million for Fóir Teoranta and an additional <Col N="726" /> £2 million for Gaeltarra Éireann, apart from the employment premium scheme and moneys for the building industry and other payments.  This is &mdash;let me say it again for the sake of the record and for the sake of balance &mdash;a support for industry, for economic activity, using public money to provide the range of services which, both in the form of money and extent, is unprecedented, matched by very few countries and, indeed, being monitored continuously by the Community. With very great difficulty, if at all, can it be increased under the Community rules and the thrust of Community action is to bring it back. We are doing all that much in a relatively poor country by way of support for industry in all sorts of ways and to say we are doing nothing is simply a monstrous travesty.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to some particular activities of my own Department because this is a special time. It is a time that calls for special measures.  We have had a good record from Córas Tráchtála of promoting exports.  Córas Tráchtála is a promotional concern.  I want to tell the House now that the Government have decided to participate with a number of prominent private business concerns in the establishment of an Irish trading company.  I do not have authority to give the names of the participating firms, but there is an equal share by the individual large companies and the State.  The intention is that this trading company will purchase products of Irish manufacturers and sell them in selected overseas markets, which will bridge the gap in the marketing resources of many Irish companies and their potential because there are export markets all over the world which the little company cannot reach.  A trading company, such as the kind that has played a very great part in this field in Japan, will bridge that gap. It will also in appropriate circumstances buy up raw materials and other products required by Irish industry which many smaller firms have difficulty in procuring.</P>
    <P>We are convinced that the time has come for the State to play a more <Col N="727" /> active role in export promotion.  Perhaps the word &ldquo;promotion&rdquo; there is wrong because I have used it already in a restricted sense in regard to CTT. CTT does very useful work.  It is a service of exhortation.  It cannot participate in direct buying and selling. When we saw the great success of the Japanese trading companies we thought this action was appropriate here and the certain share of State participation indicates a standing and stability which should improve the trading capability of this country in some eastern countries.  I do not suggest it will produce a dramatic change. It obviously will not.  That kind of change will take some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister visualise the company working? Will it be in competition with private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The mechanism is that a number of companies which have themselves large sales will inject their products into the company and move their own products.  If other companies come to them and say they cannot have a selling network all over the world and ask if they would like to handle their products they can do that.  It will be used for selling to and purchasing from; it is not visualised as a competitor.  It is visualised as an aid to a company which has a good product but is too small to sustain an overseas trade.</P>
      <P>I want now to return to the matter of buying Irish, which has a long history and which generated in the past admirable things and a little cynicism as well.  It is desperately important now, important as a matter of survival for people's own jobs.  In the slogan of the transport union they should put their money where their jobs are. It is also very important that people buying Irish and using Irish are critical of the Irish product, not to the point of rejection of it but to the point of making their criticism known so that Irish products will become in every sense in the international market place more acceptable and more and more competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered what the past campaigns <Col N="728" /> had achieved.  I thought while they had been temporarily successful in the way of exhortation for the consumer only, there were large areas of information and large areas of purchasing, such as industrial purchasing and farm purchasing, as distinct from what a person does at the counter of a retail shop, which had not been touched in past campaigns.  I set up a small committee some months ago which produced a report.  It is a practical report. It is not a flag-waving exercise.  It is not a high profile exercise.  I did not ask for a public campaign.  There was a limited campaign before Christmas.</P>
    <P>The task of the committee I set up was not to indulge in a public campaign then but to look at all the organisations in the State which could be co-ordinated into a public campaign, to look at the target areas, to suggest to me a budget and an organisational structure for particular target areas, so that we could have a long and sustained Buy Irish campaign which, in the circumstances of the freeing of world trade, as exports become more and more important for us and therefore the market acceptability of our goods is more and more important to us, in the circumstances of the on-going liberalisation of trade within the EEC, would be not just a once off romantic spasm but a conscious and sustained will to Buy Irish which is extremely important for the future of our whole industry.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the working group saw as one of the most urgent tasks the need for an effective system of communication to both the distributive trade and the consumer; in other words a knowledge of the wide range in variety of Irish merchandise available, an information role.  They decided also that there was an urgent need for a specific identification symbol for Irish goods.  The details of this symbol are not yet in final form but will be made available to Irish manufacturers who are committed to the concept of consumer satisfaction and its use will be monitored by the working group. Of course, this will be promoted by a campaign in the various media.  I believe and hope that Irish manufacturers will quickly realise the advantage of using the symbol as a sophisticated <Col N="729" /> marketing tool and as a continuing reminder&mdash;I will use the phrase again because it seems to me to be a good one&mdash;to people to put their money where their jobs are.</P>
    <P>The question of promotion, lecture campaigns, the whole use of the media has been examined by this committee. We had people who were experts in communications on it and they will continue to use their expertise in the mobilising of the whole of the media in this way.  The National Development Association, whose general manager is acting as the co-ordinator of the working group, has already a trade and consumer shopping service of limited scope in Dublin in Ireland House.  It is proposed to extend this service.  I am making available a sum of £60,000 in the current year for these activities and that is over and above the Exchequer allocation of £40,000 already made to the National Development Association for their on-going work.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that I think work like this should not be a brief spasm at the consumer end.  It has to permeate every buying decision. Immense buying decisions are made by people invisible to the public in industry or in agriculture or in the State sector.  It should be continuous. It should be sophisticated.  If we do not expect miracles, if we use all modern techniques, and if we stay with this task in the circumstances of Community free trade, it will prove useful and helpful.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to something which has been the subject of criticism, rather to my surprise.  I want to refer to the matter of export credit finance.  We had a scheme which existed in the past and I often had occasion to intervene on behalf of particular companies in the operation of the scheme, companies who are having some difficulties with export credit.  Although it got harder and harder, in the vast majority of cases we did not lose trade because of lack of export credit finance.  As I say it was getting harder and harder and there was a real danger that we would begin to lose trade as other countries made their export credit package more attractive which, for <Col N="730" /> example, the British seem to be doing.</P>
    <P>Recently we announced new arrangements.  I think it fair to put them on the record of the House and to make a few points on them.  The first is that this is the first time in the history of the scheme that there has been a State subvention to it.  It was operated as a result of what you might call exhortation by the commercial banks in the past.  Secondly, there is no ceiling on total lending. Thirdly, it is available at preferential rates.  This is a new departure because it is committing public moneys to subsidising the availability of preferential rates.  This scheme has been welcomed by industry.  It is a good one.  Therefore I was a little surprised to hear it criticised.  I wanted to put those points on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to say something now about clothing and footwear.  Let me try to give the House a statistical picture first.  This I know&mdash;and I know it for the best possible reason; I know it from intimate contact with firm after firm and delegation after delegation &mdash;these two traditional industries in Ireland are in severe difficulties.  From large amounts of public money at one end to the invoking of Community action at the other end to defend us against Korean imports&mdash;and we were the first Community country to do this&mdash;we are carrying out a continuous range of activities aimed at minimising the dreadful effects of world recession.  I could give figures from all over the world to indicate that there is no country in the market economy world where there are not very severe difficulties in the textile and footwear industry.  I want to try to put that into context.  If we do anything unilateral for the alleged protection of domestic industry without agreement, we run the risk of reciprocation and, in areas where we are important exporters, that reciprocal restriction on us will hit us harder than facing the competition we currently experience, even though I am completely at one with the spokesmen of the industry in indicating <Col N="731" /> how severe that foreign competition is.</P>
    <P>Let me try to give a picture about clothing.  It is alleged in the clothing area that our industry is being simply destroyed.  I cannot put a lot of figures on the record, but I want to quote a number of tariff headings for clothing.  Under the tariff heading that covers knitted underwear, which excludes legwear, comparing the most recent figures we have for 1975 with a comparable period in 1974, for that category, our imports went down by £9 million.  Our exports rose and the difference over that 12-month period is that, where there was an excess of imports last year, there is an excess of exports this year.  I merely choose that as the first category tariff heading on the list.  For example, in the biggest category, in terms of volume and value&mdash;women's, girls' and infants' outerwear&mdash;imports this year, for a comparable quarterly period last year, rose by £500,000.  Exports rose by very nearly £1 million.  That is a category, as are most of the categories on this list, in which we export more than we import.  But in those 12 months of world recession and of terrible recession in Britain, the excess of our exports over our imports&mdash;and indeed in most of the tariff headings categories in front of me&mdash;rose.  If one endeavours to put that in global terms, one can say that in regard to clothing we would lose more than we would gain by dramatic restrictions across the board.  Of course, that is not to say that if we could possibly prove there was dumping we would not be able to act legally and briskly and that we would not get advantage from so doing.  Of course, we would. What I am saying is that if one seeks across the board restrictions then, in the case of clothing, the loss would be greater than the gain.</P>
    <P>I wish I could say the same of footwear, but I cannot.  We observe a very dramatic, increasing penetration of imported footwear into our home market.  For example, in the first quarter of this year compared with the first quarter of last year, we see that production is down, that imports are down a little, that exports are <Col N="732" /> down dramatically, that home consumption is down.  We have a recession with which to deal as well as intensifying competition from imports. As a result of that, we see that imports as a percentage of total consumption have gone up in the past year&mdash;as indeed they have for a number of years past.  It is not a new phenomenon but is a particularly and acutely accelerating one at present which poses a fundamental threat to the continued existence of our footwear industry.</P>
    <P>Last December we approached the Commission.  Of course, we have had contacts also with the United Kingdom under EFTA.  Last December and at the beginning of this year, when the task force came to Ireland &mdash;that task force from the Community looked for very detailed statistics, sector by sector, different supplying markets, different categories of imports, different markets we supply, different categories of goods, different sorts of shoes, different sorts of clothing and textiles&mdash;we did not then have the statistics we have now. In the light of the most recent statistics I have declined to accept the adverse response we got from the Commission earlier this year.  We have gone back to the Commission, specifically on footwear, in the particular context that we could make the case, different from footwear and from clothing I indicated very briefly here, without using a wealth of statistical detail.  I am unable to tell the House what is the result of that. But I want to assure the House that we have always acted to the limit of what is possible without upsetting the apple cart.  But when the footwear and textile industries of the world and of competing countries were experiencing as severe and in some cases more severe damage than ours, we continuously had to weigh the danger of provoking a retaliation which would have damaged us as an exporting nation more than the endurance of competition.  There is a distinction to be drawn between on the one hand clothing, where our exports exceed our imports, and on the other hand footwear.  Specifically on the footwear issue, we have not accepted the <Col N="733" /> previous response and have gone back again, though I cannot say what will be the outcome of that most recent approach.  I have had an Assistant Secretary in Brussels in recent days. I have had some discussions here also and on the telephone with the responsible Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I wanted to say those things in the course of this debate.  I have done two things.  I have indicated some initiatives relative to my Department and I have endeavoured to put the very real difficulties into context.  I have endeavoured to indicate&mdash;I gave an example at the beginning&mdash;that in regard to criticism which starts out perfectly validly I, and the Government, will bear responsibility for things we do inadequately or wrongly. We are not trying to evade that.  We also have sufficient self-confidence and courage to accept obviously good suggestions coming from the Opposition. I hope I never would, not would my colleagues ever reject a good suggestion merely because somebody else in Opposition thought of it first.  That is all a perfectly proper and legitimate working of the democratic process. But I did draw attention to what seemed to me to be a passing over of criticism into an area where it inflicts real damage and I gave an instance I found particularly shocking.</P>
    <P>In concluding, let me spend a few minutes speaking about the place of our economy in the world and what should be our strategy.  Let me speak of the global situation.  Last year we had very severe inflation.  It was due to causes which we could enumerate, which were enumerated at the time, and which we do not need to reiterate; they are known.  They triggered off very severe inflation.  Whether it was raw materials, the fact that we were adjusting our agricultural prices to the EEC, whether it was high world interest rates, whether it was speculation in some commodity, the downfall of sterling or whether it was&mdash;I put it last, though it was not last in importance&mdash;the increase in the price of oil, all of those things were genuinely matters over which we had no control and were applicable in other countries also.  Those real causes outside our <Col N="734" /> control, as a small, open, trading economy did trigger off a round of inflation and that, in turn, triggered off a round of wage demands.</P>
    <P>Last year, when other countries' rates of inflation were rising also, when they also had to pay increased prices for oil and increased interest rates, there was a difference in the performance on the one hand of many world economies and on the other hand those of the United Kingdom and ourselves, the latter two being extremely closely tied.  We find now that our inflation is not ebbing as it is elsewhere. We find also that a lot of that inflation is generated internally by a round of wage demands, triggered off by external causes but which can be self-perpetuated because those wage demands can raise prices which in turn raise wages.  The whole thing is selfrenewing, self-perpetuating and a vicious circle.  Then one might say: &ldquo;Ah, yes, but what difference does it make because the prices go up, wages go up; nobody is really any the worse off, because one rise is compensated by another?&rdquo;  Were we a closed system that would be true but we are not.  We are a small, open economy that must export.  If that process continues here at a rate two or three times as fast as it does in other places to which we have to sell, the net result, quite quickly, would be that we could not sell there.</P>
    <P>In classical times it was said that there were two ends of the tug-o'-war, that as employment went up inflation came down, and as inflation went up employment came down.  It is not that way now.  Things are linked now because of the fact that we are part of a larger system but we are not behaving in the same way as the other bits of that larger system.  If we go on now as we are we will not have the jobs because we cannot sell the stuff.  We are not a closed system and we have to look at what other countries do.</P>
    <P>Recently Britain took a vigorous move but late.  Their lateness, indeed, was an embarrassment to us in two senses&mdash;firstly, because there was a referendum and that influenced so many fundamental decisions here, and, secondly, because our two economies <Col N="735" /> are ultimately connected. There is a serious economist who contends that we cannot diverge more than a percentage point or two from their inflation rate whatever we do.  That may be a bit pessimistic, but obviously what happens to their economy influences us profoundly. They are taking resolute action.  The whole content of this budget is concerned with, as was emphasised by the Minister for Finance, immediate measures.  The budget does not contain middle-of-the-year measures, between the main long-term or medium-term measures.  It is an immediate package to deal with the situation, an immediate but very dangerous situation.  That situation is that our competitiors control their inflation while we do not.  Our cost structure then becomes impossible and we lose our employment and exports.  It amounts to the same thing; if one loses one, one loses the other.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to lecture any sector or to dwell on whether past price rises caused wage rises or whether wage rises caused price rises because sometimes it was one and sometimes the other but mostly it was a bit of both, they both led and followed each other.  We are now at the critical juncture where, if we can get by with calm and discussion, agreement and recognition of the peril, a dramatic scaling down in the rates of increase of the quarterly consumer price index, and match that with a corresponding scaling down in wage increases then we have turned the vicious cycle into a benevolent one. Instead of having what in electronic circuitry one calls a positive feed-back, where the response gets bigger and more dramatic, one would slow it and have negative feed-back.  We are at the time when we want to turn a self-accelerating destructive cycle into a self-slowing benevolent cycle.</P>
    <P>I have contended with figures that we do not need to be ashamed of our economic performance, that it will stand comparison with other places, that we do not need despondency, alarm, wringing of hands or wailing. <Col N="736" /> We need to see the difficulty as it is in the context of some serious failures, serious inadequacies and some strong points and some victories.  In that context this is a package saying it is significant because of the divergence of our performance from the performance of other countries.  We have done our part to try and break one cycle and start an opposite one.  If we get a response that process can go on and we can get our inflation rate down and get our wage explosion rate down.  If the two decline at the same rate nobody is worse off; it does not mean robbing anybody; it simply means that internationally we can compete better.  Industrially it has shown itself in this difficulty, agriculturally it has also shown itself, in this difficulty.  We may get some input from resources and, hopefully, with peace we can resume growth with input from tourism also.  With those four inputs potentially there and if we get through the next slowing down period of one year or 18 months we are basically sound, our future is basically bright, strong and healthy.</P>
    <P>The task for us is to do what we can, to make dramatic efforts to curb the rate of price increase and calling, in response, on those who determine wage levels, to make a comparable dramatic effort so that we contain the two together.  Nobody loses by containing the two simultaneously in relative positions, and everybody gains. That is the whole trust of this; it is the task of it.  I hope all sectors, Government, Opposition, people, trade unions and employers will so see it.  If we were to believe our situation worse than it is now we would take hectic and ill-judged decisions which would in fact produce the crises that the Jeremiahs are predicting, because sometimes the prophesies can become self-fulfilling.  If on the other hand we see circumstances are difficult but not impossible, and if we do the appropriate things, as I believe the Government have done in this budget in their area of responsibility, I am convinced we will look on this as a gap of danger, retrospectively, through which we came successfully and through which we came in a way that proved the stability <Col N="737" /> and maturity of our people and of our institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister for Industry and Commerce one must say that he had a beautiful bedside manner, but, unfortunately, as far as the patient is concerned, he is not responding to the treatment the Minister has prescribed.  The patient is dying fast in his hands and in the hands of the consultants whose responsibility it is to rectify matters.  In his speech the Minister has given us a great deal of statistics in relation to what the Government have been doing, in relation to spending, the work of the IDA and other organisations.  However, he cannot get away from the facts and figures which show that our unemployment situation has never been as bad, that we have been over-borrowing and that we have a huge deficit in this budget.  These are the statistics which the ordinary citizen has to face and which this country at some time will have to try to overcome.</P>
      <P>We were told by the Minister that the budget was introduced to try to do something urgently to help in a serious situation.  We have been pointing out over a period that it was necessary to take steps similar to those taken by the Government to rectify the serious position which had occurred.  If the Government had taken the necessary steps at the correct time they, and the nation, would not now have to face the terribly serious position we are in. There is an Irish saying to the effect: &ldquo;Tosach maith leath na hoibre&rdquo;.  If any Government in the history of the State had a chance to make some impact this Government, when they took office had an opportunity to get the economy booming.  Having come before the people with all the answers and &ldquo;a guarantee of strong and stable Government capable of dealing with the nation's problems&rdquo; we expected more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget gives us an opportunity to go back over the ground and see how far the Government have gone to live up to that responsibility or reputation.  One of the main planks in their 14-point plan was stopping the price rise.  They told us that the immediate <Col N="738" /> economic aims of the new Government would be to stabilise prices, to halt redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. We have seen the result.  There has been no effort made to stabilise prices.  As a result, we have had increased wages and housewives unable to buy the necessities of life for their families.  The Government took over two years to wake up to their responsibility in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a Bill before the House dealing with social services.  We were told that the result of this Bill would be to reduce poverty but we have seen what has happened.  In my county it will mean that we will have to put a huge sum on the rates to meet the Bill even though the Government, when going into office, promised to reduce the rates and help local organisations. Instead of that we have had increased unemployment and no effort made to do anything positive to help the country.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to many aspects of industry has got worse since they came into office.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and other Ministers give the impression that everything is fine and that there is no need for complacency.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheres was quoted recently as saying:</P>
    <P>Let me nail the old chestnut of the small farmers losing all asides after 1977.</P>
    <P>The fact is that part-time farmers have lost many advantages provided in the EEC schemes.  The Minister does not seem to realise this, particularly where the small farmers of the west are concerned. Many of them are part-time workers and they are not in a position to avail of many of the grants which were there for them up to recently.</P>
    <P>In relation to fishing, the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheres have been making very little progress.  In 1982 the Treaty of Accession will be open for renewal.  Article 103 states:</P>
    <P>Before the 31st December, 1982 the Commission shall present a report to the Council in the economic <Col N="739" /> and social developments of the coastal areas of the member states and the state of stocks.  On the basis of that report and of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall examine the provisions which could follow the derogations in force until the 31st December, 1982.</P>
    <P>If the Government do not do something about producing a fisheries policy we will not be able to convince the other member states that we are in a position to exploit our waters.  We will then have foreigners coming right on to our doorstep.  It is necessary to have some plan prepared to ensure that progress is made in relation to this industry.</P>
    <P>The Government recently voted against the idea of preparing a plan which would help to get over our problem when the Treaty of Accession comes up for renewal.  There is no planned development and the Government in the budget do not make any reference to the necessity of doing something in this respect.  There are many aspects of the proposals which the Minister put before us which will not confer any benefit.  When we look at the record of the Government during the last two years and the promises they gave us when they came into office there is a vast difference.</P>
    <P>We were told that as an integral part of their economic and industrial relations policy the new Government would introduce worker participation in State enterprises and the election of worker representatives to State boards. If one goes back on the record of the past two years, one finds that nothing has been done in that respect.  The various points put forward at that time have been forgotten.  We were promised that price rises would be stopped and it is only now, after two and a half years, that the Government have decided to do something positive in this respect.</P>
    <P>We were also told that there would be a great deal of social reform and that we would have the elimination of poverty.  We do not find any of this in the present budget.  Instead, people are finding it harder to live day by <Col N="740" /> day.  Small farmers in the west have not benefited in any way and although the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries tries to give a different impression there is no aid or protection for the small farming community.</P>
    <P>In this country we encourage people to build their own houses and this is commendable but in their 2½ years the Government have done nothing as regards increasing the loans available to people who want to build their own houses.  It is easy to prove that no grant is being given by the State at present because the amount collected in VAT balances the grant payment. You may get the grant but you may pay it out in VAT charges.  That has been the case for the past 2½ years even though we are told that this is the Government of all the talents with all the answers for all the problems.  In simple matters concerning the everyday life of the people they do not seem to realise what is happening around them.</P>
    <P>We have seen no attempt to stop prices rising.  Before this Government were formed one of the points put forward stated that the immediate economic aims of the new Government would be to stabilise prices, halt redundancy and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development.  We know what happened.  We can go through all the points in the package put forward by the two parties now composing the Government and we find that none of them has been honoured. It was said&mdash;this is one that might apply to my own area&mdash;that small farmers would be helped by curbing non-farmer speculation in agricultural land, a vigorous land reclamation programme, encouragement of long-term leasing of land and low interest loans.  We were told the Government would plan greater investment in harbours and fisheries so that our fishermen would get maximum advantage out of the opportunities offered in the EEC.  I have seen no example of that and I do not think that this package has done anything to help in that regard.</P>
    <P>We have the same story in education. We have large classes; we have <Col N="741" /> a great number of teachers trained and now we have a situation in which they will find it impossible to get jobs because the Minister for Education failed to honour a promise to reduce the size of classes.  One can go on talking about the mismanagement of the Government but they still try to paint the picture that they are the be-all and end-all of everything.  If the people had their chance at this stage, I think they would give the Government the answer they deserve.  I hope we do not have to wait too long for that day.</P>

      <P>May I seek the permission of the House to make a statement?  Before making it, may I say that I regret that the Minister for Local Government cannot be here to hear me make this statement due to the short notice which, unfortunately, I had to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statement is as follows: Over the past eight months information has been coming to me, purporting to come from three different sources alleging that Mr. Tully was connected with Robert Farrelly, otherwise James Farrell, Rockfield Road, Kells, County Meath.  After I raised the matter for the first time in the Dáil these allegations were repeated to me. Written statements, however, were not supplied to me from any of these three people.  Since the Taoiseach announced the setting-up of a Tribunal of Inquiry into a matter of urgent public importance following my statements made in Dáil Éireann on 2nd July, 1975, alleging a business connection between Robert Farrelly, otherwise James Farrell, of Rockfield Road, Kells, County Meath, I have been in touch with these three <Col N="742" /> people, two of whom have refused to have their names disclosed or to give evidence.  The third person has satisfied me that the allegations made by the other two, upon whose information I primarily relied, were not correct.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances I now wish to withdraw unreservedly the allegations I made concerning the Minister for Local Government and a Mr. Robert Farrelly, otherwise James Farrell, and I further wish to publicly apologise to both of them for any distress caused resulting from my statement in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I need hardly say that the procedure adopted in the very grave circumstances of these charges is almost unprecedented.  The notice has been so short that it was impossible for me or the Chief Whip to get in touch with the Minister for Local Government.  He had left the House to fulfil some public engagement and we were trying to get in touch with him.  At this stage the matter has to be left there but I think it should be made absolutely clear that there was not a scintilla of evidence to justify these absolutely unscrupulous allegations against him but, unfortunately, because of the manner in which they were made they got wide coverage not only in this country but even as far away as the BBC and in the circumstances I think the matter will have to be further considered, subject to your <Col N="743" /> discretion, by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I was saying before the interruption of the budget debate that the leader writer seemed to be under the impression that Fianna Fáil were not interested enough to continue with the debate.  I hope his colleagues will inform him of our interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to a speech made by Deputy Colley at the opening of the debate on the budget.  The debate, he said, had not yet been published.  We had not yet got the Official Report. However, he quoted from the unrevised version and said that Deputy Colley had done a disservice to the country by implying that it was more expensive to set up an industry in this country than in the United States.  It is very easy to take a section from a speech out of context.  I have no doubt that if the rate of inflation continues at 25 per cent per annum approximately, and the movement seems to be up although I hope it goes down as a result of measures in the budget, as compared with the rate of 8 per cent in the United States, what Deputy Colley said will become true in a very short period of time and any industrialist comparing the rates of inflation is bound to be hesitant before setting up an industry here unless he is certain that we have grappled with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people want a strong Government. They have shown in the past that when they are asked to tighten their belts and to make sacrifices they will do so.  News commentators have compared this budget with the hair shirt Fianna Fáil budgets.  The fact is that when Fianna Fáil acted harshly in order to get the economy right it had <Col N="744" /> its reward in that it retained the confidence of the people.  For two periods of 16 years Fianna Fáil were continuously in office.  There was a short interruption.  After a period of three years of the first Coalition Government Fianna Fáil were returned again.  Then there was the second Coalition Government and within a short period that Coalition went out of office.  The first Coalition were elected because the Fianna Fáil Government had to take rigorous measures in order to put the economy right.  At that time the people did not realise the necessity for the measures.  However, after the second period of Coalition Government the people got the message correctly and Fianna Fáil were in office for 16 years. I have been told by a person who up to recently was a Government supporter that next time Fianna Fáil will be in for 32 years because of the way the Government are behaving.  The message must be getting through to Members of the Government because already the issue of whether we should break the link with sterling is being floated by certain prominent members of the Labour Party.  Perhaps this is the breaking of the link with Fine Gael because the message is getting through that the people are not satisfied with the performance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted figures for unemployment as compared with the figures for other countries.  I do not want the Ceann Comhairle to think that when I use this quotation I am calling the Minister a liar.  There is an expression I am very fond of and often quote, namely, &ldquo;Figures cannot lie but liars can figure.&rdquo;  You can do a lot of things with figures.  I have an example here of what can be done with figures.</P>
    <P>I have a copy here of a report of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment of the European Parliament. It gives the figures country by country and the definition of &ldquo;young&rdquo; is under 25 years of age.  It gives the figures for the number of young people unemployed for the month of November in Belgium, for September in France, for September in Germany and so on.  The figure it gives for Ireland is for the under 18 age group. <Col N="745" /> The figure of unemployment in the under 18 age group from 1973 until 1974 increased by 125 per cent.  The figure for the United Kingdom was given as 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>I put down the following question on 17th June:</P>
    <P>To ask the Taoiseach the percentage increase in unemployment in the under 25 age group for the year 1974 in comparison with 1973; and how this figure compares with the corresponding figure in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>An analysis by age group of the numbers on the live register is available at one date each year only and relates to males resident in incorporated towns.  Between 14th September, 1973 and 25th October, 1974 the number of males under 25 years, resident in incorporated towns, on the live register rose from 3,830 to 5,571&mdash;an increase of 45.5 per cent. The percentage increase in unemployed males in Great Britain between July, 1973 and July, 1974, the only date available, was 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>There was use of different figures from those which were available.  I had in my possession the answer to the question I was asking and put down the question in the public interest.  The answer I got was very different.  I decided not to raise the matter on the Adjournment but I have mentioned it here.</P>
    <P>There is another example in relation to unemployment figures which the Minister for Industry and Commerce quoted for European countries.  I interrupted the Minister to ask him was it not a fact that the compilation of the figures varied from country to country. The Minister agreed.  I can give an example again from this European report on social affairs.  Recent figures of overall unemployment in the Community were also made available by the member states.  Population criteria differ from one state to another.  In some the entire working population is used as a statistical basis where as in others, like France, only actual employees <Col N="746" /> are counted and they exclude whole groups like the armed forces. That makes it difficult to compare figures.  In some instances the percentage is calculated on the basis of working population, in others on the basis of the total number of employees, in others on the basis of the membership of the unemployment insurance fund while, in others, the whole population is taken into consideration.  With all these different bases, it can suit us to say our figures are a great deal better than they are in other countries, but we have to know how the comparison is made.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said we were a rotten Opposition; I think that remark was as a result of something said on this side.  I agree that we are not perhaps as effective in Opposition as we were in Government. The Government were a long time in Opposition and very few of their members had any experience of Government before this.  They may be less, shall I say, responsible in their contributions than our party who spent many years in Government and know the problems of Government.  I would say they are a rotten Government.  I may be accused of arrogance now when I say that the proper place for us is on the other side of this House.  We should really swop places.  We were far better and more effective in Government than the present Government were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I have been asked frequently what would I do in such and such a case. Last January the advice given by our spokesman on Finance, Deputy Colley, was taken by the Minister for Finance in his budget, but unfortunately six months too late, and so the advice had lost some of its effectiveness.  We gave advice in the case of the green £ and it was not taken until the situation had deteriorated almost beyond redemption.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government are doing too little.  They are not acting as decisively as they should.  If people understand the situation they will rise to the situation.  I have a feeling we will have a general election during the recess.  Only the Taoiseach knows whether or not we will have a general election, despite the gossip between <Col N="747" /> the rank and file.  I believe this budget is an indication that the Taoiseach is preparing to call for a general election before the situation deteriorates more; it would be better to go earlier than later, and cut the losses, as it were.</P>
    <P>I am worried that our creditability abroad is rapidly deteriorating.  Our creditworthiness is being questioned. It is all very well to say that we should not talk like this, but these are the facts.  If one goes to a bank to borrow one is asked all sorts of questions about one's creditworthiness. The Government, when borrowing, have to go through the same procedure.  They have to prove their ability to repay the loan.  I hope, when we get back into office, that we do not discover our assets have been put in pawn to outside interests.  The Government must be warned about this.  Hitherto agreements made by one Government were honoured by the next Government.  That situation has changed in relation to the taxfree holiday where mining is concerned. We must be very careful not to pledge our natural resources to outside interests.  A future Government might find themselves in a very embarrassing situation.  We must be very, very careful.  If the Minister for Finance is not successful in getting the money he needs to meet commitments I can see the dissolution of the Government coming.  I can see the Labour Party preparing to break with the Fine Gael party.</P>
    <P>This suggestion of breaking the link with sterling may be a device to attract money into the country.  It is a device designed to attract the speculator and speculation may have been responsible for a certain inflow of funds but the funds will not stay long unless there is evidence of a positive policy and unless there is confidence.  That will not come until the rate of inflation is cut.  It is in the interests of the trade unions to ensure wage agreements which will keep a balance because, if workers continue to lose their jobs they will not just blame the Government, they will blame the trade union leaders.  Trade <Col N="748" /> unionists are not any different from other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>They also realise that their jobs are the most important things they possess. If their trade union leaders take a high-handed attitude and say: &ldquo;No. We will not reduce our wage demands. We do not agree with you that high wages are the main cause of inflation&rdquo;, the working people will say: &ldquo;Where are you leading us to?&rdquo; There may be an upheaval in the trade union movement at leadership level.  The Government should say they are prepared to make it mandatory that wage increases can only reach a certain level.  The Labour Government in England were forced to do it.  It was anathema to them.  People argue that if a Conservative Government did it there would be a revolution but the Labour Party could do it and get away with it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party should use their influence with the unions, if they have any, and tell them they must agree to wage restraints.  Many people are asking who is the Taoiseach.  Is it John Carroll or Liam Cosgrave?  Liam Cosgrave was elected Taoiseach and people want him to be the Taoiseach.</P>

It is not asking too much to suggest that the third and fourth stages of the national wage agreement should be renegotiated.  I hope the trade unions will realise that their first duty is to keep people in employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the setting up of a national trading agency.  It appears that this will be a good exercise and will be of benefit to small companies who want to sell on foreign markets.  He said it will also be engaged in purchasing for small industries and acting as an agent for them. This is very important and helpful to industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> In relation to the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign it is important that the Government should create incentives for shops and stores in our cities and towns to stock Irish goods.  Marks and Spencers in England used the boast proudly that 99 per cent of their goods were British made.  This was a goodwill exercise and it was appreciated by the public.  If our stores could say that even 90 per cent of their goods were Irish made this would generate a lot of goodwill.  There are certain stores in the city which are owned by outside interests who have no interest at all in the Irish economy and who are only interested in making money. They should appreciate that, if the Irish economy goes down, they go down with it.  There should be a far greater emphasis on promoting Irish goods.  There are certain stores in this city which are of a&mdash;I want to select my adjective carefully&mdash;high-class variety and specialise in expensive imported articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>They have shoes for £50 a pair or handbags for £30 or £40.  I have often seen them and wondered who has money to buy them. There must be some such people, otherwise they would not be on sale. If these stores want to cater for those people they should at least have an Irish section.  They should be setting an example.  Many years ago the then Deputy Corry told us he could not buy a pair of socks of Irish make in Grafton Street.  This was diabolical. The Government should devise some scheme to give an incentive to stores who will sell over a percentage of Irish goods.  What price patriotism? I do not see much improvement in the stocking of Irish lines in the stores.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of our quality products are exported and we are not left with the best.  You cannot expect Irish people to buy inferior merchandise.  It is important that we should export the best because we live by our exports and we will die by our lack of exports if we are not careful.  We depend on our exports and we must be very quality conscious.  If this is to be offset by the <Col N="750" /> best exports of other countries coming in here the effect is somewhat negatived.  A certain percentage of the goods we export should be kept back for the home market.  Irish goods are equal to and in many instances better than the best in the world. That is not a pious platitude.  It is a fact.  You do not sell in the hard markets in Europe and America unless your products are good.</P>
    <P>There is no use in trying to sell inferior Irish shoes on the home market while exporting our best shoes. There must be some way in which consumers can have proper redress against the poorly manufactured article.  They should get satisfaction either by a refund or an exchange. This covers all ranges of merchandise. People must be able to buy in the confidence that, if the article they buy is not perfect, they can change it. The Department of Industry and Commerce could probably set a lead by setting up some sort of a consumer association.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Consumer Association are still in existence. If they do exist I would be interested to hear what they are doing.  It is important that we should have a consumer association with good liaison with the Department of State.</P>
    <P>The Minister with great satisfaction referred to the fact that we are exporting more of certain types of articles than we are importing.  Certainly, I would hope so.  Were we to import more, then in respect of every single item we sold right across the board we would be in very bad shape. There are things we sell abroad not manufactured in other countries at all.  I remember some years ago when a chewing gum factory was set up here and we were exporting chewing gum to America, it was thought to be really something.  Now it is regarded as a natural activity.  We export many other items which years ago would have been regarded as selling coal to Newcastle.</P>
    <P>In relation to the performance of the Government, as we have frequently said, they have excellent Press relations.  They have ways of <Col N="751" /> giving out little titbits here and there to the odd correspondent of this or that newspaper.  I suppose this maintains the image of good public relations, which is probably very important. Our party are being attacked for the Government's inefficiency or that we are weak in drawing attention to the faults of the Government and yet within six months of our putting suggestions to the Government and their implementing them I find no credit is given us whatever.  That is not true of the entire media but there are still certain people who appear to me to have lost objectivity in reporting what this party do.  I have said on many occasions to people: &ldquo;If you want to know what are Fianna Fail's manifestoes on this, that, or the other &mdash;while people know we are preparing them&mdash;we give performance, not promises.&rdquo;  Basically that is what people want, performance and not promises.  We have given good performance in office and will do so again.  It is important that the Government cease this business of trying to please everybody by threatening to introduce dire increases in taxation and everything across the board, calling for sacrifice from everyone, and so on.  Then they come in with something and everybody breathes a sigh of relief.  I do not know whether the psychology is that used many years ago in Dublin when rumour would go out that the rates were going to be increased by 5s. in the £1.  There were headlines in the papers&mdash;Rates to be increased by 5s. in the £.  Eventually, when they were increased by half-a-crown, everybody breathed a sigh of relief; it is only half-a-crown.  Perhaps that is the psychology but it is not what we would advocate.  Rather we want proper and prompt action to deal with everyday events.</P>
    <P>One of the hardest hit sectors of industry here has been the building industry.  In spite of the fact that the Minister for Local Government keeps saying that there have been more houses built than ever before, the facts are that the building industry is in decline.  One of the sad facts about this is that when the country recovers and the recession passes, which we <Col N="752" /> hope it will, all of our skilled people will have gone away.  If the economy in Britain and other parts of Europe recover at a faster rate than ours, then there will be there greater employment opportunities.  There will always be employment opportunities for skilled people, particularly in a recovering economy.  That happened here before when the building industry came to a standstill&mdash;all our skilled personnel went to England and by the time we were back in the swing of things it took a long time to persuade these people to return and restore their confidence in the Irish economy.  That resulted in a situation in which there were many unskilled people employed in the building industry dependent on their skilled colleagues.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that the Government have done nothing about SDA loans&mdash;to increase the limit at which people can borrow.  That is an absolute disgrace because it is one of the things that hits people hardest, people who have to raise a deposit of £1,500 to £2,000 on a house.  Again, there was the announcement that the banks would make available loans over 20 years at 12½ per cent, based on 2½ times the applicants' salary while releasing more money, banks are very reluctant to give money even for this kind of purpose unless they are assured of fairly good security.  Houses are very good security provided there are people to buy them.  Unless we stop this decline in our economy, houses will no longer be worth-while assets because there will not be people to buy them.  We experienced that before in Dublin when the corporation could not find people for the 1,500 houses they had on hand.  That is one way of solving a housing crisis but not the one I would advocate.</P>
    <P>Another thing which hurt people very deeply was what I would call the petty cutting back of the amenity grants.  They amounted to approximately £600,000 only in a year but the amount of goodwill and encouragement it generated amongst local communities was enormous.  I cannot understand the Government cutting back on something so important in so many areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> There is also the question of school leavers seeking jobs.  What are we doing about them?  Are we devising any scheme to encourage them, even into voluntary work, or to work in a service voluntary capacity with an organisation such as the international voluntary service who help people in need. The Government might devise some sort of scheme to encourage young people to spend a couple of years working with a kind of Peace Corps. Young people are full of idealism.  They want to be active and, if they are inactive, it can lead to problems.  It is something about which, perhaps, we should be making more noise in spite of the fact that we may have been called an irresponsible Opposition for embarrassing the Government.  We have an enormous number of people coming on to the job market and there will not be any openings for them.  We must carefully examine the potentialities of creating jobs for these people, even if it is to be at a special rate of pay pending a return to more stable conditions.</P>
    <P>There are many importers here, small firms, who employ a staff of, perhaps half-a-dozen or a dozen people.  They have to pay cash against documentation.  A number of them find that, when they sell their products on the market here, they have to wait three months for payment.  Yet they have to pay VAT on those goods within a month of their receipt.  The difficulty of getting the Revenue Commissioners to grant them certain credit has driven many of them out of busines and created more unemployment. It is very important that such people do not fall on the State under the payrelated benefit scheme even if it is a question of the Revenue Commissioners waiting three months instead of one for their VAT receipts.  That is another matter the Government should be examining.  Considering the time this House has spent debating the Wealth Tax Bill one would think it was designed to bring in between £30 million and £40 million whereas, according to the Minister's estimate, it will bring in about £1½ million.  The Government, instead of driving capital away, should be doing everything to encourage it into the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> In relation to the capital gains taxation proposals I am amazed that the Labour Party did not go for our suggestion that those who made a quick killing on the stock exchange should pay 50 per cent of their profit to the State and not be taxed the same as a person who had spent a lifetime building up a business at 26 per cent. That seemed to be a reasonable and intelligently measured amendment. These things give me a sense of frustration. The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that if the Opposition put forward suggestions the Government would not be too proud to accept them but we put numerous suggestions to the Government and they were not accepted.  We told them on many occasions that the legislation going through the Dáil was not the type that should be passed in a time of recession.  The Government are hell bent on getting their taxation legislation through.  The result is that confidence in the country by people with capital has diminished.</P>
    <P>I cannot find the words to describe the stupidity of statements which describe the Opposition as being disloyal if we point this out.  We are telling the Government where we believe they are going wrong and events will prove whether we are correct or not.  The record to date shows that we were right in the recommendations we made to the Government.  On many occasions when I was a Government backbencher I listened to the former leader of Fine Gael, James Dillon, using the term &ldquo;The Government are bust&rdquo;.  Would we hear this term if he was a member today?  I believe the Government are bust, financially and mentally.  They have lost all credibility with the people.  They know that there is a definite swing away from them by many sections of the community.</P>

      <P>Last year I predicted that the number of unemployed could reach 100,000 by Christmas. One newspaper picked up that prediction but it was looked upon as being way out.  Unfortunately, I was proved right.  The way things are going I can see this figure reaching 140,000 by next Christmas if strong action is not taken.  The Government admit that other countries are doing better than us, that our inflation is worse than others and that an upswing or a plateau has been reached in America but not with us.  We will have to do something about this because if we are not ready for this upswing in the world's economy when it comes we will have nothing to get back into.</P>
      <P>I should like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary a story about when I was going to America for the first time in 1966.  My late father told me that if I was asked in America if this country was experiencing a recession, which the world was at that time, to tell them the following story.  It was that in 1957 when he was in America he was asked if Ireland was going through a recession like the rest of the world to which he replied that only rich countries have recessions; Ireland was too poor to have a recession. Ten years later he told me I could say to those people that we had prospered to such an extent that then we were experiencing our first recession. Only countries who prosper experience recessions.  For poor countries recessions come and go but do not affect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are down in the through at present and we must get out of it but we must not get out of it by putting into pawn every asset we possess.  We must make sure that there are no secret deals about our oil and gas resources. We must know where we are getting our money from when we are getting loans, what the money is for and the conditions attached to them. The Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="756" /> is extremely logical and I find it pleasant to listen to him as he talks with great sincerity and inner suffering. As Deputy Gallagher said, he has a lovely bedside manner but, unfortunately, the patient is dying.  It is action we want and not a fine flow of the English language and beautiful prose.  We must get this from the Government and they must take the necessary action, no matter how unpopular.</P>
    <P>When we go before the people we tell them the position as it is, that taxation may go up but not down. We do whatever is necessary to restore the economy and people trust us. The Government should act in the interest of the people and not in their own interest by manufacturing budgets which can take them one way if there is an election as a result of hopes not being fulfilled in relation to foreign borrowings.  It is no use doubling or trebling social welfare benefits if the money is not there to pay out.  We do not want the situation arising where those working in the public service will get their cheques less a percentage deducted and told that this will be credited to them like wartime credit until the situation improves.</P>
    <P>By the conduct of the Government and the manner in which they have been less than frank we know that all is not as good as it appears on the surface.  One wonders what one will find when this party get back into office.  The juggling around of VAT in the first budget created unemployment in the motor industry, and new car sales are down drastically.  Punishing rates of VAT were put on many items so that the Government could take VAT off food.  VAT, which was spread over food, was bringing in at that stage £20 million to £25 million a year and it would now have been bringing in about £60 million.</P>
    <P>It was much easier to spread that out among all the people than to put 19 per cent or 35 per cent VAT on many other items.  People whose jobs depend on the sale of these items were sacrificed.  While the Minister says &ldquo;Put your money where your job is&rdquo; in my view VAT was taken off food at the sacrifice of the jobs of <Col N="757" /> people in the motor industry, the radio and television industries and other industries, which suffer from a high rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 2p off the pint of milk, does this apply to milk sold for the manufacture of ice cream, chocolate and other forms of confectionery? Will that subsidy be passed on? Will those products show a decrease in price or will this be taken advantage of by certain sections of the community? It is important to know what will happen.</P>
    <P>I spoke to a man recently who has worked hard all his life and has saved enough money to last him for the remainder of his natural life.  He told me he has decided to squander it now because he has no faith in the future. He is not leaving it in investments or saving it but spending it before it becomes completely worthless.  He is travelling around because he has no faith whatever in the future.  This is one man talking and he obviously talks to other people.  This is an example of the malaise which is creeping in.  The credibility of the Government has never been lower than it is at the moment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary obviously feels sensitive about my reference to the fact that I sincerely believe the credibility of the Government is at an all-time low.  I am talking to people and I meet people outside, so I know this is a fact.  This is mainly because the Government are afraid to govern.  They are all watching each other and wondering who to blame.  We have heard of the Crossman Diaries and there will be a few more out before many years have passed.  There will be skin <Col N="758" /> and hair flying at that stage and those who are friends today will be telling great secrets about each other.</P>
      <P>We are all worried about the large number unemployed.  We want to create a situation where industrialists from abroad will come here and find a stable situation.  We have to stabilise and attract people from abroad. We have got to welcome people who will bring capital into the country. We are a very mixed economy.  We are basically a private enterprise and many State-owned enterprises.  We are basically a private enterprise economy. It is no disgrace for people to be successful. Some people like creating empires so we must ask them to come to Ireland and create their empires here.  If the situation improves in other countries we will have mass emigration again.  It is far more important to have Irish people working for foreigners in Ireland than working for them in their countries.  We must attract people here.  The only way we can do that is to show we are able to cut our material according to its measure.  The budget will not bring our inflation under control.  It is only firm and steadfast handling by the Government, the injection of confidence into our people and into countries abroad which can do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to that of Deputies who have expressed disillusionment with the Government in regard to the budget and the nation's affairs.  This budget is regarded by many as a yo-yo budget, prices up and prices down. There is no evidence that it will in any way relieve the great problem which confronts housewives and people in general.  The Government have shirked their responsibility in relation to the economic future of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a conditional type of budget. It is the first time during my period in the House that I have seen a conditional budget brought in, one that does not make a positive approach. This budget relies on the action of trade unionists to ensure the implementation of the package.  It is obvious when the Government introduced last January's budget that they knew <Col N="759" /> the grave economic problem facing the country.  They did not acknowledge that the situation was as serious as it was at that time.  Instead they allowed the trade union movement to go forward and negotiate a national wage agreement.  This was agreed on the basis of information supplied by various Government services, Departments and Ministers.  The workers took into consideration the economic advice, the economic projections and those of the Government in relation to the future of the nation when they decided on a particular agreement in relation to the national wage structure.</P>
    <P>The workers were grossly misled by the Government.  Now, a few months later, we are told about the great crisis that is on the nation and the great sacrifices that will have to be made.  This crisis did not occur overnight. It is the result of quite a considerable cover up.  The Government are the best cover up men in Europe. They now ask for a review and it is on the basis of that that the effectiveness of the budget will be judged. This is a mean and irresponsible type of approach.  The onus is now put on the trade union movement, who were misled some months ago, to make a decision.</P>
    <P>If the budget does not work, the Government will wash their hands like Pontius Pilate and say the responsibility is on the unions who let them down.  It is the other way round; the trade union movement have been grossly misled by every Minister in the Government, including the Taoiseach. This is complete irresponsibility, misleading the trade union movement and the employers to some extent in the wage negotiations that took place not so long ago.</P>
    <P>How can the situation be rectified? The onus will be placed on the trade unions of doing the Government's job and making the budget work.  The budget is not a solution to our economic problems, our inflationary problems, our unemployment problems or the prices problems.  It is the most irresponsible shirking of responsibility ever known in this House.  Even now the people do not know the facts of the <Col N="760" /> situation because this is only the first instalment of the budget; the second will come when the trade unions decide in regard to the modification of the national wage agreement.  The Government are looking for a scapegoat in the trade union movement but I do not think they will succeed because the workers are responsible and well understand the situation as regards being misled.  They were misled on many occasions in the past not only by the Government but by employers and others.  They now have machinery to pinpoint problems as the position emerges and the position is emerging that they have been grossly misled in the past.  I am certain they will give the Government a fair and factual answer.</P>
    <P>If the budget does not work, no responsibility should be placed on the workers.  Our party do not oppose a modification of the national wage agreement or anything in the national interest to ensure that confidence is restored and the employment situation corrected.  We hope some suitable arrangement will come about but the Government cannot shirk their responsibility and must make decisions at some stage.  Sometimes unpopular decisions must be made to correct inflation and restore employment and confidence.  The Government do not want to make unpopular decisions but want to put the responsibility on other people.  I hope the unions will see through this and take into consideration the fact that they have been misled but I emphasise to the unions that the national interest is paramount and that is why, perhaps, they may have to make sacrifices to ensure that this irresponsible Government can continue. Bankrupt as they are, they are in power and many people are dependent on the action that will be taken. Certainly, it will not be Government action that will correct the situation but the action of responsible people, workers and trade unionists and others who will decide in due course.</P>
    <P>No real decisions have been made in this House over the years.  We have seen a variety of Ministers come here with high-powered speeches processed and circulated to the Press by the information service that is backing up <Col N="761" /> the present Government.  But for that service and the slants that have been put on some situations that have developed the people would be up in arms to a much greater extent than they are at present.</P>
    <P>The confidence of the people in the Government has been shaken due to their irresponsible action.  Only a few months ago we had the previous budget and the Government did not know then what the situation would be.  Anybody would be able to make a projection six months ahead if he had groups of economists and advisers behind him, people with the latest information regarding economic trends inside and outside the country, regarding the amounts of money available in financial institutions at home and abroad.  But that was beyond the competence of the Government; they could not make any decisions a week or a month in advance.  We have had a variety of budgets, week after week and month after month in the past 12 or 18 months.  At one stage we had a budget a day.  When you have a Government that cannot plan for the future you are in a very serious situation.  The Minister for Finance in answer to a question on one occasion here told us the Government have no plan for the future because of the unsettled situation and that until the economic situation is stabilised the Government could not realistically project a plan.  You must have an aim and a plan, whether it is a plan to correct inflation or cure unemployment in the long term or the short term.</P>
    <P>Now that the Minister for Finance has returned from his trip abroad, I am sure he has made many contacts so that he can borrow to offset the serious difficulties we have here.  It is important that we have a true and factual assessment of the situation.  We must have all the cards on the table and if the situation demands it we must take corrective action.  It may be drastic action but it will be designed to correct the serious situation we have to face.  The Government cannot continue to hide the seriousness of our problems.  There must be full and frank discussion with the Opposition, with the captains of industry, with <Col N="762" /> the farmers and others on a reasonably long-term basis so that every sector of the community will be fully aware of the decision.  Only then can we have a plan.  The Government are without backbone; they wish for the best but a wishbone is no substitute for a backbone and it is backbone we need to ensure a realistic assessment of the situation and do what is necessary in the national interest to ensure that undesirable economic trends which we can control will be corrected.</P>
    <P>I hope the discussions that have taken place and that will take place in the House in the coming weeks and months will bring the Government to the realisation that there are members of this House who are prepared to go through the Division Lobby if the demand is made upon them to ensure that corrective action will be taken and funds will be made available, wherever they have to come from.  The Division Lobby is the testing point when it comes to politicians.</P>
    <P>No major decision has been taken. We have had the first instalment of a budget.  The second instalment will be much tougher, if the Government last that long.  The next instalment must be made following the decision of the trade unions.  Maybe the first instalment is an effort to keep the options open in an election campaign.  The sooner the people know the position so that they can assess it accurately, the better.  Day by day they are getting glimpses of the true picture.</P>
    <P>We now have a chance to assess the value of the reduction in the recent budget.  There is an upward spiral in food prices daily.  There is no guarantee that the reductions introduced on budget day will be maintained. In some cases prices have increased since the budget was introduced, items that could be regarded as essential.  VAT has been removed from foodstuffs.</P>

      <P>VAT has been removed from foodstuffs but there are other essentials.  We heard during the debate that the Minister for Finance was not aware of the actual percentage of VAT charged on some of the essentials of life, including clothing and household commodities.  VAT has been removed from clothing.  That produces the extraordinary situation that VAT has been removed from mink coats but has not been removed from essential household goods.  The kitchen is a very important place.  The Minister will be one who will benefit from the removal of VAT on a fur coat. This mink coat Government now have the advantage of being able to buy mink coats without VAT whereas the housewife will have to pay VAT on essential household commodities.  On some surgical applicances for the disabled VAT is payable.  There must be a realistic examination of the operation of VAT.  Luxuries should be taxed. A mink coat is a luxury.  I could not afford to purchase a mink coat but there are people who can afford it and who will benefit while the purchaser of ordinary necessaries are disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a restoration of confidence but this is not the way to get it.  We must ensure that investors have confidence in the Government and in this House, that industrialists have confidence, that every member of the community who has a vital part to play in this difficult situation has confidence.  As Deputy Briscoe said, <Col N="764" /> there is no confidence in the Government. The people have not confidence because there has not been the necessary upwards surge to take us out of the mess we are in.</P>
    <P>There should be an examination by the Government of the things that affect the family&mdash;the job, the home, foodstuffs and other essentials.  Take the job situation first.  There are approximately 150,000 unemployed. Figures given by the Central Statistics Office vary between 102,000 and 103,000 but do not take account of the number of school leavers now seeking employment and who are unable to get it.  The school leavers do not draw social welfare benefit and therefore do not appear on the live register and are not recorded as unemployed. That applies also in the case of the professional people who have lost employment, architects and others.  The live register is not a true reflection of the unemployment position.</P>
    <P>In a recent EEC publication figures were given by the Government last March which showed a shortfall in the unemployment situation of about 6 per cent or 7 per cent as against the actual figure, not taking into account school leavers, skilled personnel, outworkers and other persons who are unemployed or who have no job&mdash; whichever term one likes to use and a variety of terms can be used.  There is a vast volume of people unemployed and the Government do not seem to realise the seriousness of the situation.  They do not seem to know the number unemployed.</P>
    <P>One cannot correct a situation unless one fully understands the problem.  I would hope that the Government will re-examine the unemployment figures.  I hope there will be some system devised whereby they can assess the current position and the future position for the young people now attending who have no future whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Where are they to go when their education is completed?  They have no hope of jobs in the Civil Service, in the local authorities, in the banks, or in the other institutions that in the past have given good employment to school leavers.  What confidence can <Col N="765" /> school leavers or others who have pursued educational courses have in a Government that have cast them upon the scrap heap?</P>
    <P>This is quite apart from the vast numbers of persons who are on the unemployment register.  Over the last six months there has been no reduction in the unemployment figures.  Of course, the Government give one set of figures to the EEC and another set to Deputies from the Central Statistics Office.  I hope there will be some co-ordination between the two Government services that supply erroneous figures either to Deputies or to the EEC.  It is a very serious matter that Members of this House should be misled or that members of the European Parliament or other people outside the country who are trying to make an assessment from the point of view of the allocation of aid of one type or another or in relation to what one can rightly borrow should be misled in regard to the figures presented.</P>
    <P>The facilities for employment abroad are not there now as they were in the past.  People are not emigrating in the same numbers now because of the lack of opportunities.  Therefore we have this pile-up at home and no plan whatsoever to meet this serious situation.  Take the building industry, which gives the impetus to employment in many spheres.  There are the bricklayers and carpenters producing the homes.  There are the carpentry shops and the woodwork centres that produce the doors, windows and other fittings.  There are the carpet manufacturers, the manufacturers of furniture and fabrics for the home.  These are all affected by the running down of the building industry. Yet the Minister for Local Government has on numerous occasions informed the House that the building industry was flourishing, that more houses were being built than ever before.  I would like the Minister to tell us where the houses are, because we cannot find them.</P>

If the builders' suppliers are not supplying builders with the necessary materials to build houses, if they are not supplying cement, timber, and so on, how is the Minister getting the houses built, without timber and the other necessary commodities, and without tradesmen, because there are many of them on the labour exchange?</P>
      <P>Although the Minister has told us there are more houses and more employment than ever before, why was it necessary for the Minister in the budget to inject another £10,500,000 into the building industry in order to stimulate it?  Perhaps the Minister for Local Government is operating outside the Cabinet and that there is not collective responsibility, because that would appear to be the only explanation for the Minister misleading the House in relation to the building industry.</P>
      <P>This additional £10,500,000 will not produce any more homes because we now have the serious situation since the budget that the worker who wants to purchase a modest home has to provide himself with a deposit of approximately £3,000, while the Government have failed to make additional money available by way of SDA loans and supplementary grants. What they have done is piled an additional burden on those who are prepared to purchase their own homes. They have reduced the period of the loan from 35 to 30 years, thereby increasing the repayments, and increased the percentage the person has to pay on the loan that will be available from the local authority.  The net result is that the person who wants to have a stake in the community by purchasing his home will have to pay an additional £1 a week. This action on the part of the Government will not stimulate the production of homes, because people will be unable to afford the additional £1 a week, apart from the increase they will have to pay in income tax and other taxes that have been imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe this is an effort to ensure <Col N="767" /> that workers will be unable to purchase their homes and will have to live in local authority houses and be the responsibility of the local authority.  Does the Minister feel, as indeed other Ministers have felt, that the more people who own their homes, the greater will be the problem that arises for the Labour Party?  This is the view that has been expressed not alone in this country but in Britain.  As people become home-owners the Labour Party, who were handing out stops to them in the past, lose their support.  In this an effort to ensure that responsible workers in this city will not be able to purchase their own homes and will have to rely on local authorities in the future, because I believe this is what the bulk of the people will have to do in the future if they want a house?  They will not be able to afford the £3,000 deposit.  Neither will they be able to meet the repayments with this extra £1 per week, £52 per year, imposed on them. These are a responsible section of the community and the Government should really be giving them assistance by increasing the loan to a more realistic figure.  The present figure of £4,500 is unrealistic in everyone's view except that of the Government. Surely it is not expected that these people could save £3,000.  Such a sum is quite beyond their capacity.</P>
    <P>This is a vicious increase.  The man who wants to own his own home would need to be in the millionaire class.  It is only the latter who can afford to borrow from the banks.  I wonder how many have accounts in credit or are the greater percentage in the red?  Loans from banks are out of the reach of the ordinary worker. But it is the ordinary worker who will be the scapegoat if the budget goes wrong.  All the responsibility is being placed on the shoulders of the ordinary worker for correcting the economic situation in the proposed revision of the national wage agreement.  Not only are the workers being asked to make a sacrifice in relation to pay but they are also being deprived of the opportunity of owning their own <Col N="768" /> homes.  Surely every assistance should be given to people anxious to own their own homes instead of having them rely on the local authorities to provide them with houses.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Government fully assessed the value of the £ and then decided they would six months hence increase the loans and made a statement to that effect.  If that were done it would be a stimulus to the building industry.  There could be forward planning.  The builders want some guarantee for the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government tells us there are plenty of houses. The builders providers tell us no one is purchasing building materials.  There is an injection of £10 million into the industry.  Apparently the Minister for Finance knows the builders providers have their yards full because no one is buying building materials.  Obviously the Minister for Local Government is not aware of this.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who is with us this afternoon, will bring pressure to bear so that the loans will be increased to a realistic figure.  He is sympathetic to the workers. The loans should be increased to £6,000 to keep step with inflation.</P>
    <P>I hope the supplementary grants will be increased.  This should have been done long ago but even at this late stage an increase would help those anxious to purchase their own homes. There is need, too, for an upward adjustment in income levels.  This is long overdue.  A person earning £30, £40, £50 or £60 a week will have little left to buy the necessities after meeting the repayments on his home.</P>
    <P>Today we learn of enormous increases in the cost of hospitalisation. We heard a great deal at one stage about free medical services for all and improved social services.  The performance has not lived up to the promises. I hope we will not have a repeat performance of what happened in the last Coalition Government.  I hope we will not again have the finance companies selling up to the highest bidder the homes the workers were trying to get together for themselves. The situation is serious, so serious it verges on disaster.  It is time the Government woke up.  The people <Col N="769" /> want homes not hopes.  The Minister says houses are springing up like mushrooms, but nobody can find them. Perhaps the Minister would give us a list of these housing estates so that we can go and look for them.</P>
    <P>The Government made an effort to stimulate employment by making available grants of £12 or £6 as the case may be.  Is this an indication of what employers should pay to workers? At a time of a serious unemployment crisis the Government should initiate a public works programme so that people can be put into employment. We heard that the Government were initiating such a programme but we have not seen it yet.  I have been in some of the military barracks recently and the accommodation there is deplorable.  If these barracks are not renovated now they will have to be renovated in the future at much greater cost.  This work would put people into gainful employment. Space could be made available in the Army barracks for recruits.  They are short of space at the moment, not because there is an over abundance of people on service but because the barracks have been allowed to run down over the years.</P>
    <P>If the Government are really concerned they should set in motion the vast amount of public works which will have to be carried out in the future.  This would provide employment for people.  This would stimulate other industries because purchasing power would be increased.  This is a challenge to the Government.  I mention the military barracks because I was there recently.  Numerous jobs have been outstanding in the Ordnance Survey Office and in the Office of Public Works for years.  The more people there are in employment the more tax the Government get and the greater the return to the Exchequer.  A positive effort must be made to stimulate employment.</P>
    <P>Jobs in the pipeline are useless.  We want to reduce the length of the dole queues and put people back to work. If the Government are not prepared to do this they should get out and let somebody into office who will do it. A previous Coalition Government deserted the nation in the middle of the <Col N="770" /> night and left over 100,000 people unemployed.  Are we heading for the same situation?  To my mind we are. We have seen the non-positive approach of the Government to this budget.  We have seen them shirking their responsibilities.  They would not bring in a measure which might be unpopular but which might be in the national interest.</P>
    <P>The public will have to respond in a positive way if the economy is to be put on a sound footing.  Irish men and women were never found wanting when called upon to ensure the survival of the nation.  If they were called upon today to make great sacrifices they would make them.  Great sacrifices were made before by Irish men and women.  If the Government make a courageous approach to the Irish people they will get the support of all responsible Irish men and women.</P>

      <P>The Government do not want to take any decision that may be unpopular.  They are just ambling along from one week to another without disclosing the full facts to the people.  We hear talk about building a new House of Parliament. Such a scheme would provide work for a large number of people.  People who are serving this nation honourably in arms have to sleep in badly heated, badly ventilated, badly painted and badly maintained accommodation.  The Government should show positive leadership in providing work for the unemployed.  Do they want to maintain this rate of unemployment?  Do they feel that further unemployment is a solution to inflation?  Some economists believe that.  Is that their policy? Apparently it is their policy to have 102.000 or 103.000 unemployed.  They know that industry will be unable to avail of the subsidies for quite some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I pointed out that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said, with regard to one small item in his Department&mdash;the printing of labels&mdash;that that job is carried out by an overseas firm and the labels are imported here when I am sure our own printers could undertake such a <Col N="771" /> job.  This is a Government Department, but what does the Minister tell us&mdash;that somebody did this previously. Blame-placing is no solution to our problems.  We must be realistic, examine our problems and see how they can be corrected.  The fact that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has some of his Department's labels printed in Britain, comes along and tells us it was done by somebody in the past is no solution.</P>
    <P>The Government should take a realistic look at the situation to see what can be produced here, to ensure that wherever possible Irish goods are utilised by Government services.  Recently I asked a question of the Minister for Defence in relation to the importation of low loaders which could have been produced here and provide employment for our people. I would hope the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach would urge on his colleagues in Government that, in future whatever may be the commodity involved it is Irish-manufactured. At least Government Departments and local authorities here should be made nail their flag to the mast by ensuring that whatever is purchased is of Irish manufacture.</P>
    <P>Irish goods and workers are every bit as good and effective as their foreign counterparts.  They are sought and have achieved distinction in many countries.  But, at home they are regarded as not good enough to undertake some small jobs in Government Departments.  There is the possibility of plenty of employment here if the Government would set their minds to it.  There might be established some committee which would undertake an assessment of the jobs to be done, of the cost factor, how many people would be taken off the dole queues, how many people placed in gainful employment, how much more the Government could do to stimulate the work force, how much more they could do to ensure that every item obtained or utilised by a Government Department is of Irish manufacture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Dowling but I was here last week when he asked the Minister for <Col N="772" /> Defence that question about the low loaders.  The Minister for Defence quite plainly said that the particular item the Army needed was not made in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wanted a particular type of low loader manufactured here, I am quite sure we have the technical capacity to do so.  I am positive we have the necessary manpower to design it to the particular requirements of the Defence Forces, not merely pick it off an assembly line somewhere else and say: &ldquo;We will take that&rdquo; just because that happens to meet the situation at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are concerned about stimulating the work force of this country then we must take into consideration the capacity of our workers to do the job.  I am quite certain the Parliamentary Secretary will not deny that we have the technical know-how here, because we do make low loaders of a type&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sufficient to say that something went out to tender and that somebody's tender was a little better than the next.  We have the manpower, the technical know-how, and designers here who can produce any item the Department of Defence, or indeed any other Department, would require.  Therefore, it is not sufficient for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that the Minister gave me an adequate answer last week.  He did not give me an adequate answer.  The answer he gave&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is the third edition; I amend it each time.  I am positive that if the Parliamentary Secretary was here during the course of the discussion he would have heard a completely new speech.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>It may be difficult to listen to but it is factual, correct and shows how irresponsible are the people on the other side of the House. In the minute-and-a-half I shall probably not have time to deal with ESB bills, recent advertisements in the newspapers, the 14-point plan about which we heard so much in the past, inflation, the £841 million we have to borrow, the £80 million interest our people have to pay on borrowed money, plans for the future, PAYE, income tax, bus and train fares and all the other aspects with which I should like to have time to deal.  They are quite different from those with which I dealt in the past.</P>
      <P>I am only sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has not been here to hear all of my contribution.  But when I get a copy of the report I will send him my copy, which he can read and compare with any other speech I have made, to see if it compares favourably or contains repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to indicate once again how irresponsible the Government have been, their lack of plans and action.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will convey to various Ministers some of the things I have said in the hope that it will stimulate and, at least, give <Col N="774" /> a ray of hope to those thousands of our people now in dole queues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four minutes remaining in which, obviously, I shall not be able to make my budget speech.  I hope to put one point on record indicating the fearful position in which we find ourselves at present under the Government that claims to govern.</P>
      <P>Occasionally we can blind the eye of what might be described as the ordinary reader when we speak in technical and perhaps academic economic terms.  Oft-times, he does not see the real position.  If I say to him&mdash;and this is the point I want conveyed to the public at large&mdash;that, in the present age of the five-day week, the manner in which the Government of today are budgeting and carrying out the affairs of this country&mdash;in respect of the present year we are losing £1 million per day, £1 million per day deficit&mdash;it might shock the reader or listener into realising the terrible plight in which we find ourselves.</P>
      <P>One million pounds is a considerable amount of money.  If we want to visualise the amount involved and that which £1 million represents, we might ponder and think that since 1 A.D. until the present, one million days have not yet passed.  Perhaps this is something which will convey to us, better than merely reading the digit 1 and the letter &ldquo;m&rdquo; beside it, the extent of it&mdash;as yet, one million days have not passed since the time of Our Lord.  But this Government have budgeted in a fashion that they are short £1 million per day in running the affairs of the country.</P>
