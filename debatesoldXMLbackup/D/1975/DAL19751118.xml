    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach would he not agree that there is a need for a new Constitution in the light of the major social and other changes which have taken place since the last Constitution was enacted?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to an article which was published in <i>The Word</i> magazine when a question was put to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Deputy re-reads the article I think he will see that the Minister did not say that a new Constitution was being prepared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <P>In connection with the Estimates for 1975, it was found necessary, in the prevailing circumstances, to revise the provision for certain services including the scheme of grants for libraries in national schools.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on the Government's policy concerning (a) the publication of textbooks in Irish (b) the publication of library books and general information books for schools in Irish and (c) the commitments of previous Governments on an Irish encyclopaedia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department are involved in the publication of textbooks in Irish on two levels.  They provide a back-up service for the private publishers through the provision of standardised terminology, editorial advice and grants towards the cost of printing, publishing, editing and translating <Col N="1300" /> or writing textbooks, and they also publish their own textbooks. There is a development scheme in progress for ensuring an adequate and continuous supply of the textbooks in Irish.  This involves the appointment of additional staff; both professional and administrative, in the Department's publications branch.  Some of these additional appointments have already been made.  Although the publications branch are mainly involved with textbooks at present they are also publishing extra reading material, some of which would be suitable for inclusion in school libraries.</P>
      <P>With regard to the proposed encyclopaedia in Irish, the position is that, though it was regarded in principle as being a desirable project it was not possible because of the high estimated cost of production to enter into any firm commitment of financial assistance from the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that a very important publishing firm is pulling out of publishing altogether because of the lack of support for these publications from the Department of Education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a statement to that effect but I would be surprised if the firm in question, if I understand it to be the same as the one in the mind of the Deputy, would pull out from this publishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the standard both of text and illustration in the library books published by this firm is very high and that it commands support from the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with the firms who are doing this kind of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the particular publishing company has already spent, on a moderate estimate by a firm of qualified accountants, £83,000 on foot of a promise made by the Department of Education? Will the Minister now welsh on the promise made by the Department?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Much as I would like to defend myself against <Col N="1301" /> accusations of welshing, I would prefer not to discuss the detailed amounts of money being made available to private firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a firm which employed a firm of experts, editors and consultants, and paid them in order to be able to market this encyclopaedia on foot of a promise by the Department of Education have a right to feel aggrieved? Would the Minister agree that there is a serious moral obligation on him to stand by that promise and to make moneys available for the publication of that encyclopaedia, part of which has been circulated to people interested? There has been nothing but praise from everybody for the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions on the project took place between the officials of my Department and the company and the Department were in favour, in principle, of the production of such an encyclopaedia.  The company was not however authorised in writing to proceed with the work nor was any formal contract drawn up.  It could be stated therefore that the previous Administration did not enter into any formal commitment in relation to the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of national schools it is possible to identify the number of extra remedial teachers sanctioned as follows: 1973-74, 70; 1974-75, 100; 1975-76, Nil.</P>
      <P>In the case of second-level schools it is not possible to effect a similar identification of teachers specifically employed for remedial work.</P>
      <P>In either case it is not the practice to record the number of requests for sanction which are turned down.</P>
      <P>In the matter of in-service courses for remedial teachers the position is that such courses had been attended by 405 primary and 235 second-level teachers up to 1974-75.  It was not found possible to continue these courses in the financial circumstances of 1975-76.  Whilst I am anxious that the courses be resumed as soon as possible and that the qualified teachers be recognised as additional to normal school staffs, I can give no undertaking in this regard until the overall provision for education within the 1976 Estimates has been decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that.  The form of the Deputy's question suggests that he <Col N="1306" /> believes there is a specific grade of remedial teacher.  He knows very well there is no such grade in second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to answer the Deputy's question in specific terms without an exhaustive examination of all cases over the last few years in which the need to provide for remedial education to a greater or lesser extent may have been advanced as one of the reasons to justify the employment of additional teachers.  Such cases are not always presented on the basis of catering for remedial needs alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The improvements made in the teacher-pupil ratio in 1973-74 and 1974-75 are specified in the statement circulated with the Official Report of 15th May, 1975, Vol. 280, No. 12, cols. 2123/2124.  In 1974-75 also 150 new posts were created for remedial teachers in selected schools and for teachers of special classes of slow learners in particular schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three-year course of training was introduced in 1974.  In anticipation of the fact that no trained teachers, except for a comparatively small number of graduate trainees, would be coming from the recognised training colleges in 1976, extra <Col N="1309" /> students over and above normal requirements were admitted to training in 1973.  Thus it was possible to take measures this year which will result in meeting requirements in 1976.  I am accordingly satisfied that while it will not be possible to effect any further improvement in pupil-teacher ratio an adequate supply of qualified teachers will be available to fill all posts arising in the 1976-77 school year.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24, 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Following discussions with local school authorities regarding the future provision to be made for second-level education in the Mervue/Renmore area, my Department have sanctioned an extension to the Moneenagesha Vocational School to enable it to cater for 800 pupils.  Taken in conjunction with the number of second-level places available in Galway city, generally, it is considered that the proposed extension will meet the second-level education needs of the area for the next few years, and that the question of the provision of a further secondary school in the area does not arise at present.</P>
      <P>However, there are indications that a second school will be required in due course and my Department are keeping the situation under review.  In this connection, they will welcome discussions with representatives of local interests, including parents, at an appropriate time.  No such discussions have, however, so far taken place.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate on reflection, in assessing the number of places to be provided in the extended school at Moneenagesha, account was taken of the fact that a significant proportion of pupils in the Mervue/Renmore area attend second-level schools outside the area and that there are surplus places in most of the secondary schools in Galway city.

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the Government's decisions of 16th December, 1974, in relation to higher education was that the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, should be a recognised college of the National University of Ireland with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of the National University of Ireland, or to become an autonomous degree awarding institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with this decision the <Col N="1328" /> governing body of the institute has applied to the National University of Ireland for recognised college status for the institute for the purpose of validation of the institute's degree-level courses and for the award of degrees in the case of these courses.</P>
    <P>The application is currently under consideration by the appropriate university bodies.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to await the outcome of this consideration before making any statement about recognition of the institute as a degree awarding body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us when this decision will be made in regard to the conferring of degrees with the National Institute of Higher Education as the matter has been hanging fire now for some years? Something like 80 students will be coming out next June to be followed by some 600 students later on and is the Minister aware that considerable anxiety is felt by these students?  Is the Minister not aware that there was a public protest by students through the streets of Limerick last Saturday week asking the Minister to give a decision with regard to the National Institute of Higher Education?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 22 to 34, to delete the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; and to substitute the following definition:</P>
      <P>(a)  a stepchild;</P>
      <P>(b)  a child adopted&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974; or</P>
      <P>(ii)  under an adoption law, other than the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, being an adoption that has, in the place where the law applies, substantially the same effect in relation to property rights (including the law of succession) as an adoption under the Adoption Acts, 1952 to 1974, has in the State in relation to such rights;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are necessary to ensure that a child adopted under Irish law is treated as a child for the purposes of the Act and to make it clear that all the consequences of recognising an adoption are to follow. Originally, we considered that a child adopted under Irish law was clearly a child of the adopter's for all the purposes and consequences of the Act but some doubts were expressed about <Col N="1336" /> this in the course of the Second Stage and elsewhere.  The amendments are designed to remove any possible doubt and clarify the matter.</P>
    <P>The position now is that an adopted child is a child of his adopted parents and, by way of the provisions of the new subsection (5), he is a brother of another child of the adopters and is a lineal descendant of the adopter's father and so on through other consequential relationships.  Paragraph (b) of the new subsection (5) brings in a special provision that an illegitimate child and his mother are related as mother and child.  If, however, the child has been adopted, this relationship ceases for the purposes of the Act, as it does under the law of succession. Section 26, subsection (1) of the Adoption Act of 1952 so provides. Of course, if the child has been legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents, the provision is not necessary.  In such circumstances he would be the full child of his parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly we agree with amendment No. 1.  I would point out to the Minister that a similar amendment was introduced by him in other Capital Taxation Bills for the same reasons he has given now but that I raised this point on the other Bills and, indeed, on this one on Second Stage.  At that time the Minister indicated his view&mdash;which he has just put before the House as a view which is held&mdash;that the effect on our Adoption Acts is to put the adopted child in exactly the same position as an ordinary, legitimate child for all purposes of our law.  That was my own impression until I had a look at the Adoption Acts when, to my horror, I discovered that that was not so and it was necessary because of the wording of the Adoption Acts, to bring in this amendment and similar amendments in the other Bills.  In this connection, I want to ask the Minister for Finance if he would request his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to examine the Adoption Acts to ensure that they do have the effect both he and I originally thought they had and then discovered they did not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be totally unsatisfactory <Col N="1337" /> that it should be necessary to introduce provisions of this kind in any Bill coming before the House and dealing with the rights of children because the intention of the House was, and would continue to be, that where a child is adopted, then all the rights of what I might call ordinary children would attach to the adopted child.  It is clear from the necessity to introduce this amendment that this is not so. Indeed, a perusal of the Adoption Acts shows that that is not so.  That is an unsatisfactory position.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister for Finance if he would request his colleague, the Minister for Justice, who is, I think, the Minister directly concerned with the Adoption Acts, to introduce amendments to the Adoption Acts to ensure that that position is attained and that it will not be necessary to amend or make provisions in future Bills which come before the House to have the kind of provisions that are being introduced now by this amendment.</P>
    <P>With regard to amendment No. 10, there are a few points I want to draw to the attention of the Minister.  The first one may be regarded as a drafting point but there is probably some reason for it.  If the Minister looks at the wording of paragraph (a) of subsection (5), provided for in amendment No. 10, and compares that with paragraph (b), why does paragraph (b) not provide similar wording and say, for instance: &ldquo;An illegitimate child who has not been adopted in the manner referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition of `child'.&rdquo;  Is there any significance in using a different wording and approach in paragraph (b)?</P>
    <P>Secondly, I should like to know what would be the position in the case of an illegitimate child who could establish the identity of his father, as for instance, by way of an affiliation order having been obtained.  Would that alter the position in regard to his rights or liabilities under this Bill? The amendment provides that, in the case of an illegitimate child who had not been legitimated or adopted, he shall be deemed to be the child of his mother with all the consequences that flow from that but one can visualise <Col N="1338" /> circumstances in which the identity of the father can be clearly established. In such circumstances it seems to me that certain consequences can flow from that under this Bill and that it ought to be clear as to what we want to happen in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, I want to refer the Minister to the provisions of section 44 of the Finance Act, 1972 which deals with relief from certain duties in the case of illegitimate children.  The earlier part of that section, since it relates to death duties, may not be necessary, since the legislation dealing with death duties has been suspended but the second portion of it deals with stamp duties and I am not quite sure that it is not necessary to make provision for it in this Bill.  At any rate, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the point involved and to seek his assurance that the matter will be adverted to between now and the next Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly give the Deputy that assurance.  I would also inform him that I will ask the Minister for Justice to look at the other matters he mentioned.  The Deputy made a valid point in relation to cases where fatherhood is established. It has been said that motherhood is a matter of certainly and fatherhood a matter of speculation but one can certainly accept that there are cases where fatherhood is established in court and in such cases where such fact has been established, I can see it may be necessary to have a look at it in the way suggested by Deputy Colley.  I will certainly undertake to do so.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 17, in the definition of &ldquo;date of the gift&rdquo;, after &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;,and a reference to the time when a gift is taken shall be construed as a reference to the date of the gift.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These amendments are considered necessary to avoid any ambiguity in references to the time when a gift is taken.  The terms &ldquo;date of the gift&rdquo; and &ldquo;date of the inheritance&rdquo; are defined in the draft Bill but in some sections reference is made to the taking of a gift in relation to a date. For example, in section 9 we speak of a gift taken on or after 28th February, 1974 and again inheritance taken after 1st April, 1975.  It is felt that in order to avoid ambiguity such references need to be expressly tied to the terms as defined in the amendments. For example, in the case of a residuary estate the date of the inheritance is the date of the death and the inheritance is taken at that date, not at the date that the residue is attained for the legatee.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, lines 40 to 55, to delete <Col N="1341" /> the definition of &ldquo;disponer&rdquo; and to substitute the following definition: &ldquo; `disponer', in relation to a disposition, means the person who, for the purpose of the disposition, directly or indirectly provided the property comprised in the disposition, and in any case where more than one person provided the property each shall be deemed to be the disponer to the extent that he so provided the property; and for the purposes of this definition&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the testator shall be the disponer in the case of a disposition referred to in paragraph (k) of the definition of `disposition';</P>
    <P>(b)  the intestate shall be the disponer in the case of a disposition referred to in paragraph (1) of that definition;</P>
    <P>(c)  the deceased person referred to in paragraph (m) of that definition shall be the disponer in the case of a disposition referred to in that paragraph; and</P>
    <P>(d)  a person who has made with any other person a reciprocal arrangement by which that other person provided property comprised in the disposition shall be deemed to have provided that property;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Like the other amendments, its purpose is to avoid ambiguity which we consider may lie in the original definition. It is necessary to make it as clear as possible that the disponer is the person who is the financial source of the benefit.  The original definition left some room for doubt and it has been rewritten to clear up the doubt.  The provision at (d) meets a point which Deputy Colley made during the debate on the Second Stage when he suggested that a number of prospective donors could form a syndicate, each giving a smaller amount to each of their donees so that each donee would then get a number of smaller gifts from several different donors instead of a larger gift from one donor and, accordingly, might pay less tax or no tax as a result.  In other words, paragraph (d) is a provision which will prevent an avoidance practice which <Col N="1342" /> Deputy Colley very properly brought to our attention.</P>

Before doing so, would the Minister indicate the precise difference between the drafting in the Bill and the drafting in the amendment and precisely where the change is intended to effect greater clarity?  This is not clear to me on its face.</P>

      <P>The phrase is used both in the original draft and now in the amendment, &ldquo;the person who for the purpose of the disposition, directly or indirectly provided the property comprised in the disposition...&rdquo;.  What does the Minister have in mind in using the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo;?  Presumably that means more than the person who actually makes the disposition if we take it in its normal sense where A makes a gift to B.  In the normal sense A is the person who provided the property comprised in the disposition but presumably this wording is intended to cover something wider than that.  Otherwise I would have thought that the use of the word &ldquo;provided&rdquo; could lead to greater ambiguity.  Could the Minister say what is intended to be covered by &ldquo;provided&rdquo;?  Does it visualise that the property envisaged in the disposition came out of somebody else's property so that he was to that extent less well off when the disposition had been completed?</P>

      <P>Could the Minister indicate why paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), which were in the original draft, are necessary?  As the Minister is aware there are definitions in different cases, in the case of a will, in the case of an intestacy or, speaking from recollection, in the operation of the Succession Act.  Is it really necessary to define them in this way under the heading of &ldquo;disponer&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes it can get one into a position one does not expect. It is not a major issue but I would ask the Minister to illustrate the operation of paragraph (d) which is designed to meet the problem I adverted to on the last occasion of a syndicate getting together.  On the wording it is not clear how this will operate to prevent this.  How does one <Col N="1344" /> establish that there was a reciprocal arrangement of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other cases that have to be made by the Revenue Commissioners they may have difficulty in establishing it but I would say that if a group of persons made a gift to an individual, or to a group of individuals, it would be a cause of inquiry as to whether or not the arrangement had been made for the purpose of avoiding capital acquisitions tax.  I cannot say for certain that all such cases will be easily identified but the liability to pay tax will, nonetheless, lie on the persons who provide funds in this way for distribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy an example.  A has three nephews to whom he is giving £10,000 each.  They would be tax free under Table III.  B is in the same position. If A and B each wish to give more property to their own nephews they could then arrange that A will give £15,000 between B's three nephews and B the same amount between A's three nephews.  Each donee can afford to take a £5,000 tax free gift from a stranger.  The tax saving would be six times £540, or £3,240 in all.  The effect of defining disponer in the way we do in paragraph (d) would be that we would levy the tax at that rate as if the gifts had been made by A directly to his nephews.  In other words, the additional £5,000 would be paid by him direct to his own nephews rather than to the nephews of B.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I have not given a great deal of thought to the precise administrative arrangements necessary to combat this loophole to which I adverted on Second Stage but I am less than convinced that the answer to it lies in paragraph (d).  It seems to me that in order to operate paragraph (d) in the way the Minister has outlined it is necessary for the Revenue Commissioners to establish that there is this reciprocal arrangement or this syndicate operating. <Col N="1345" /> I would assume that people who were engaging in this kind of operation would, on the surface, appear to be as far removed from each other as possible.  I also assume that they would not be guilty of any offence if they do this.  I may be wrong there; it may be that the effect of paragraph (d) is to impose on them an obligation&mdash;it is not clear on its face&mdash;but it seems that thought might be given by the Revenue Commissioners to a more effective way of combating this.  It could lead to widespread avoidance of gift tax by very wealthy people unless a more effective method of preventing this operation is found than paragraph (d).</P>
      <P>I am not sure that it is my duty or obligation to give a great deal of thought to this but rather to draw attention to it.  I doubt if paragraph (d) will be very effective in dealing with the loophole and I urge the Minister to have the matter examined further to see if it will be possible to have a more effective administrative approach which would close the loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to ensure entire conformity with tax laws and tax obligations but at least this paragraph puts people in peril that if the device which they engage in is discovered they may be called upon to pay tax and to pay interest on unpaid tax.  I suggest to the Deputy that if persons were to engage in such a syndicate for the purpose of avoiding the proper tax on gifts to their own relations or whoever else might be the intended donee it would be an exercise in evasion and not avoidance because it would be done for the purpose of evading tax on gifts which the donors intended to be received by specific persons.  If they were to use a device which evaded that liability then it would be evasion and not avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify that because in the Bill as drafted, without this amendment, there is no question but that people could engage in this activity perfectly legitimately in accordance with law in which case it would be avoidance and not evasion.  The introduction of paragraph (d) seems to mean that if <Col N="1346" /> the Revenue Commissioners establish that there is a reciprocal arrangement then the liability for tax can be correctly assessed but it is not clear that there is an obligation imposed by paragraph (d) on the persons concerned to disclose the position.  That may be so but it is not very obvious. On the face of it, it seems to depend on the Revenue Commissioners discovering it.</P>

      <P>If people fail to make a proper return they will be committing an offence.  They are asked to make returns of gifts and if they do not give the correct particulars, including the intended beneficiaries, they will be committing an offence.  They would be putting themselves in peril on that account as well as having to pay tax arrears on interest and, therefore, there is an element of sanction.  It will not be a free and easy operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 12 to 21, to delete paragraph (h) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(h) the release, forfeiture, surrender or abandonment of any debt or benefit, or the failure to exercise a right; and, for the purpose of this paragraph, a debt or benefit shall be deemed to have been released when it has become unenforceable by action through lapse of time (save to the extent that it is recovered subsequent to its becoming so unenforceable);&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, the object of rewriting this paragraph is to remove certain obscurities and ambiguities.  I hope if Deputy Colley asks me to identify them that they will not be too obscure.  Under paragraph (h) as originally introduced, the release of a debt is a disposition and so is the allowing of a debt to go statute barred.  If a debt went statute barred tax would be payable on the amount of it as a gift, or on the value of it if its market value was less than <Col N="1347" /> its face value.  This amendment seeks to give relief from this liability in the case where the debtor pays the debt after it becomes statute barred.</P>
    <P>The simplification of the text arises from using the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo; which itself is defined to cover a wide variety of property rights.  The omission of references to powers is dealt with in section 27 (2) which provides for identifying the disposition and the disponer. Section 27 (1) deals with the general in tail in possession is dealt with through subsection (2) which expands the definition of general power to include such a tenant, and section 27 (1) also provides that the disposition is made by the tenant himself, and paragraph (d) of section 2 provides for the date of the disposition, for example, the date of death if the person dies without exercising the right to bar the in tail.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if the debt is repaid after it becomes statute barred, then there has not been a gift at all. The element of gift which we are taxing was that a person allowed the right to recover the money to be removed by effluxion of time.  If the debtor were to refund the money, the original donor would not have parted with anything because he would get the money back.  Somebody would have had temporary use of it but there would be no property passing from the creditor to the debtor or, if it had passed, it would come back again, and, therefore, there would be no gift.  It would be quite unfair to charge a tax if the money were refunded.</P>

      <P>In page 7, lines 34 to 37, to delete the definition of &ldquo;share&rdquo; and to substitute the following definition: &ldquo; `share', in relation to a company, includes any interest whatsoever in the company which is analogous to a share in the company, and `shareholder' shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was found necessary to exclude debentures from the definition of &ldquo;share&rdquo; because, of course, they are of a different nature.  A debenture is not strictly a share nor is a debenture owned by a shareholder.  A debenture is a loan, secured or unsecured, and the debenture holder is a creditor.  It is considered that you should not treat a debenture holder as a shareholder. By reason of the definition of &ldquo;private company&rdquo; in section 16, if there were a large number of persons holding debentures, there might be more than 50 shareholders and the company would be outside the definition of section 16.  The definition is now used in section 6 (4) of the Wealth Tax Act and it is considered to include stocks.  Amendment No. 9 is consequential.</P>

In regard to amendment No. 7, the note I have made for myself was whether a debenture was obviously analogous to a share, and the Minister has said clearly that a debenture is different from a share and that a debenture holder is in a different position from a shareholder. <Col N="1351" /> Then I looked at amendment No. 9 and found that the Minister proposes to insert that &ldquo;share&rdquo; includes a debenture and loan stock and &ldquo;shareholder&rdquo; includes a debenture holder and a holder of loan stock, and I am even more confused.  Perhaps the Minister can clear this matter up for me.</P>

      <P>We are dealing in amendment No. 9 with a disposition of something.  A person could be disposing of a debenture, which is something of value, and that is why it is necessary to include debenture when we are dealing with a disposition.</P>

      <P>On the other hand, in amendment No. 9 we find the word &ldquo;share&rdquo; being defined as including a debenture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We define &ldquo;share&rdquo; on page 7, as now amended by amendment No. 7, and we are specifically taking out &ldquo;debenture&rdquo; for the reasons I have stated.  We are dealing with all persons who have an interest in the company and we are dealing with the definition of disposition <Col N="1352" /> which here would include, and I will read the paragraph:</P>
      <P>(3) For the purpose of the definition of &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; contained in subsection (1), the passing by a company of a resolution which, by the extinguishment or alteration of the rights attaching to any share of the company, results, directly or indirectly, in the estate of any shareholder of the company being increased in value at the expense of the estate of any other shareholder, shall be deemed to be a disposition made by that other shareholder if he could have prevented the passing of the resolution by voting against it or otherwise.</P>
      <P>What we are dealing with are people concerned in the company and who by their decision can effect the transfer of the property, share or debenture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that should be included, but that is not the point I am making.  In amendment No. 7, where a debenture was included in the original draft of the Bill, the meaning has been changed.  It is now being taken out of the Bill, which will read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `share', in relation to a company, includes any interest whatsoever in the company which is analogous to a share in the company, and `shareholder' shall be construed accordingly;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>If one takes that, standing alone, and ignores amendment No. 9 for the moment, it could be argued either that a debenture was included in that definition or that it was not, depending on how you argued it&mdash;that a debenture is analogous to a share or that it is not.  It is not a clearcut situation.  Then one goes on to look at the definition of &ldquo;share&rdquo; in amendment No. 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;share&rdquo; would relate to the complete Bill and therefore could be introduced into section 16, which deals with private trading companies.  If each holder of a debenture was to be deleted because of &ldquo;share&rdquo; definition in page 2, then it could defeat section 16.</P>

      <P>I am not disagreeing with the purpose the Minister is trying to achieve but it seems to me that some ambiguity of conflict may arise because you provide in one portion of the section that &ldquo;share&rdquo; does not include a debenture and in the other portion it does include a debenture. It might be worth looking at this a little further so as to ensure that no ambiguity can arise.  I am not quarrelling with the purpose that the Minister is trying to achieve but I suspect that the juxtaposition of these two may lead to confusion.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 41, in the definition of &ldquo;tax&rdquo;, to delete &ldquo;leviable&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;chargeable&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Both amendments are proposed to cover drafting points.  Amendment No. 58 is designed to clear up a possible ambiguity.  Section 41, subsection (1), provides that tax shall be due and payable on the valuation date.  The reference in section 61, subsection (2) to tax payable on the death of the deceased might be construed as tax being payable on the date of the death of the deceased, and this would mean that the subsection would refer only to a tiny minority of cases.  Therefore it was necessary to eliminate the word &ldquo;payable&rdquo; from subsection (2).  The word &ldquo;leviable&rdquo; is being changed to &ldquo;chargeable&rdquo; for drafting reasons and in the interest of consistency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to paragraph (d) there could be a power of revocation in relation to the receipt of the gift which would diminish the value.  If the power of revocation were not exercised the disposition would take effect from the date on which the right to exercise revocation had lapsed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the type of case the Minister envisages, that is, a gift made with the power of revocation, there are two stages.  One is that of the gift being made with the power of revocation and the second is the failure to revoke.  In the first instance, although the value may be diminished there is some value, presumably, in the gift, subject to the power of revocation, and that diminished value would be taxable subject to the other provisions of the Bill.  In that case would there be an additional liability arising when it was established that the date for revocation had passed but that there had been no revocation? Would that gift be given a new value and, in effect, be treated as a new gift?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 is relevant here.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Where, under any disposition, a person becomes beneficially entitled in possession to any benefit and, under the terms of the disposition, the disponer has reserved to himself the power to revoke the benefit, such person shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed not to be beneficially entitled in possession to the benefit unless and until the power of revocation is released by the disponer, or otherwise ceases to be exercisable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be obvious they are not conveniently available. The Deputy will accept one could diminish one's property and confer a benefit on others by deliberate act or by deliberate omission&mdash;by allowing others, as it were, to take property and make no effort to recover it.  The placing of £1,000 on a table and letting someone else remove it could be such a disposition.  If this section were not there it could be said that the property was not given to the other person but the other person took it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine there is more envisaged than that.  I shall not pursue the matter.  I want to refer the Minister now to the definition on page 6 of &ldquo;entitled in possession&rdquo;.  I have a little difficulty here.  It is not a major one.  Towards the end of the definition it is provided:</P>
      <P>... he shall not be deemed to be entitled in possession to an interest in expectancy until an event happens whereby this interest ceases to be an interest in expectancy;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, &ldquo;interest in expectancy&rdquo; is defined as including an estate in remainder or reversion and every <Col N="1360" /> other future interest, whether vested or contingent, but it does not include a reversion expectant on the determination of a lease.  May I take it what is intended to be achieved here is that in future an interest in expectancy on reversion of a lease will form the basis for an assessment of a liability under this Bill until it becomes a present right and the taxpayer involved becomes entitled in possession to that present right?  Is this what the intention is?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming the intention is being achieved&mdash;and I am not absolutely sure that it is&mdash;I want to refer to what the Minister will probably regard as an old chestnut but I cannot let it pass without adverting to it, that is, the definition of a minor child set out in this section on page 7:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;minor child&rdquo; means a child who has not attained the age of 21 years;</P>
      <P>As the Minister knows, in the previous capital taxation measures I sought to have such a definition altered to provide that a minor child means a child who has not attained the age of 18 years.  Indeed, I sought to do so by way of amendment.  I have not put down any amendment to this effect on this Bill because it is clear that it has no hope whatever of being carried, due to the attitude of the Minister on this point.  Nevertheless, I do not think I should let the matter go without adverting to the fact that we should not enact legislation today which defines a minor child as somebody who has not attained the age of 21 years.  It is completely out of date.  It is not in keeping with practice in society.  It is not in keeping with the provision of votes at 18, a decision made by the people in a referendum and not merely by this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reason the Minister has given for not making this change is that it has implications which go beyond the Bill we are dealing with and would therefore need to be studied in some depth.  I do not dispute that <Col N="1361" /> contention.  But unless we make a start somewhere, it will never happen. I believe if the Minister had made the start in these capital taxation measures, it would have speeded up the necessary alterations in other branches of the law and would not have produced any insurmountable complications.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell on this at great length but I cannot afford to allow this matter to pass without pointing out to the Minister once again the inappropriateness of providing in legislation in 1975 that young men and young women aged 19, 20 and almost 21 years are minor children.  It just does not conform with the realities of the situation and it should not be done.  The time has come for us to amend the law wherever this arises.  We had a convenient opportunity to amend the law in relation to these capital taxation measures.  It is regrettable that the Minister should provide, as he is doing here, the old definition of a minor child as someone who has not attained the age of 21 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not set a trap, but I am afraid Deputy Colley has fallen into a trap.  The effect of yielding to Deputy Colley here would be to deny a concession, a relief, which is available to a child between 18 and 21 years of age.  The only relevance of &ldquo;minor child&rdquo; in this Bill is to Table I on page 50, that is, Table I of the Second Schedule, which sets out what the rate of tax is to be and provides that the tax will be nil where the donee or successor is the spouse, child, or minor child of a deceased child, of the disponer.  I am sure Deputy Colley will accept, therefore, that it would be advantageous to a person to be deemed to be a minor child between the ages of 18 and 21 years.  I will not pursue the other issue which we have debated at great length.  I am on record in this House and elsewhere as being in favour of having the age of majority 18 years and not 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be on record as being in favour of the age of majority being 18 years and not <Col N="1362" /> 21 years but when he had the opportunity to do something about it he did not do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy think I should not provide this concession for people between 18 and 21 years of age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  The Minister is quite mistaken in his assessment of my approach in this matter.  I am not seeking to get concessions for people as such.  In a matter like this, one ought to decide what is the right age. I am suggesting&mdash;and the Minister's last remarks show that he agrees&mdash; that the right age now for assessing when a young man or a young woman ceases to be a minor child is 18 years.  The Minister agrees with that.  We must accept the consequences that flow from it.</P>
      <P>However, I should say that if it were to be changed in this Bill it should be changed in the Wealth Tax Act and the Capital Gains Tax Act. If it were done across the board, whether there would be a balance of advantage or disadvantage I am not sure.  We would certainly have a different position from the position at the moment.  Whatever the result, whether it be advantageous or disadvantageous, I do not really think that is the point.  The point is whether this House in 1975 should enact legislation which provides that young men and women of 18, 19 or 20 years of age are minor children.  Whatever consequences flow from taking a decision on this matter of making the age of majority 18 years should be accepted.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two other points I want to make.  Perhaps I could refer the Minister to page 7 where &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo; is defined as meaning a power of appointment which is not a general power of appointment.  If the Minister refers back to the definition of a &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo; at the bottom of page 6 he will see that certain powers of appointment are excluded from that general power of <Col N="1363" /> appointment.  It states: &ldquo;... exclusive of any power exercisable solely  a fiduciary capacity under a disposition not made by himself, or exercisable by a tenant for life under the Settled Land Act, 1882, or as mortgagee...&rdquo; These are exclusions. May we take it that the special power of appointment, as defined, in effect means the exclusions from the general power of appointment?  Perhaps I might say that again.  It is not terribly clear.</P>
      <P>The general power of appointment is defined.  Excluded from that are three particular classes of power of appointment.  They are not deemed to be a general power of appointment. Then a &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo; is defined as meaning a power of appointment which is not a general power of appointment.  May we take it, therefore, that the &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo; in effect means the three kinds of powers of appointment excluded in the definition of &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The exclusion there is exclusion of a number of activities but their exclusion does not make them powers of appointment of any particular kind.  The &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo; may not be a full definition; it simply includes certain activities and responsibilities which are described there.  But the mere exclusion of the other ones does not make the other ones special.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister see any difficulty arising here if one takes the two definitions together, particularly the definition of &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo;, which seems very wide? It says: &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo; means a power of appointment which is not a &ldquo;general power of appointment.&rdquo;  That seems to be very wide.  It would seem to mean that any power of appointment which does not come within the definition of &ldquo;general power of appointment&rdquo; is a &ldquo;special power of appointment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We ought to be reasonably clear on what we have in mind here.  Even to say &ldquo;if he could have prevented the passing of the resolution&rdquo; full stop, may be better than what is in the Bill at present.  It is still a little ambiguous and we ought to be clear on what kind of thing we have in mind because what is involved here can determine whether or not there is a liability to either gift tax or inheritance tax.  We ought not to have that situation being left to the assessment of whether some kind of activity might have been indulged in and was not if we do not know in this House what kind of activity we are envisaging.  To provide that he might have prevented the passing of the resolution by voting against it is quite clear and unambiguous. But if it is envisaged that some other activities in which he might have engaged and did not could determine the liability, then we ought to know exactly what is involved before we enact this kind of legislation.  I do not imagine the Minister would disagree with me in principle on that.</P>

      <P>What we are looking at here, and what the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1366" /> will be looking at, are the intentions of the parties.  One of the valid tests would be to study the behaviour of the people involved. Obviously if they had a right to vote against a resolution then if they did not exercise that right it would be reasonable to assume that they were in agreement with the resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with that.  That is a clear-cut test one can apply.  But, as the Minister knows, the subsection says a good deal more than that.  That is what I am questioning. What other form of action or inaction is envisaged besides voting or not voting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, there might be a resolution which would never get to a vote because its validity might be challenged, or it could have been challenged as being <i>ultra vires</i> or something of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely if that were to happen the question to be determined would be whether or not it was <i>ultra vires</i> and, if it was, that is the end of the resolution.  Presumably it would not have operated.  If not, then the question of whether or not the person involved voted against it would fall to be determined.  Each of these can be clearly determined by the Revenue Commissioners with no ambiguity or argument.  However, I am not happy at leaving a phrase there which could cover anything or nothing depending on the interpretation of the officer of the Revenue Commissioners dealing with the case.  We ought to be clear on what we have in mind in passing this legislation.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is undesirable to leave extensive powers there if they are not necessary.  I would feel it safer to provide that, if a person fails to take the necessary steps available to him, to prevent a certain thing happening, then he must face the consequences of his failure.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree entirely with that proposition, but where I tend to part company with the Minister is where he says &ldquo;any activity or lack of activity on the part of the person concerned&rdquo;. That leaves a very wide discretion as to what could be involved. It is not merely a question of the Revenue Commissioners acting reasonably or unreasonably; it is a question of establishing as far as possible some degree of certainty so that a person who takes a particular attitude&mdash;let us say in a particular situation he is opposed to the carrying out of a certain operation by a company&mdash;and if, as is envisaged here he cannot vote against it, if he could take some other step to prevent the transaction being carried out, then I think you are getting into a very nebulous area which might end up with the Revenue Commissioners having to discuss with all those present at the meeting what attitude was taken about this or about that, almost reducing it to: &ldquo;Did he seem to be cross?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did he seem to be happy at the result?&rdquo;  I know that may be a little extreme but I am unhappy at the phrase being as loose as it is.  I think the Minister agrees in principle with me on that and I suggest that he might have it further examined and, unless certain specific steps can be envisaged, that the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; be deleted.  If certain specific steps other <Col N="1368" /> than voting are envisaged they should be introduced into the subsection and spelled out.  I would agree that if they can be envisaged they should be dealt with but not the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>As a lawyer the Deputy knows how memoranda and articles of association can be drawn up to meet many different situations and to confine power in certain hands in certain areas even without votes.  I think it would not be possible to illustrate in an Act all the devices that could be used to achieve a certain result.  I can understand the Deputy's concern about too extensive a power but it is not a power that will affect people who act in a normal way.  In order to capture the extraordinary devices that may be used I think we need a phrase as wide as &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Perhaps what the Minister said would provide some line of approach to this.  For instance, it might be possible to advert to powers envisaged in the memorandum and articles of association of a company, whatever way is laid down there for their exercise or non-exercise and to refer to that.  I can see some difficulty there but it is a possible line of approach.  I do not expect the Minister to agree across the floor of the House with what I am putting forward but I would urge him to have it examined further.  I doubt if the object he is trying to achieve, with which I fully agree, requires the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;. I doubt also if the object cannot be achieved with some other wording that would be less imprecise and I urge him to have it examined further with a view to achieving greater precision and certainty if possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, there is the obvious case where a donee or successor becomes beneficially entitled to possession immediately on the occurrence of the death of a person. For instance, A, by will bequeaths a legacy of £1,000 to B absolutely and A by deed settles property on himself for life with remainder to B absolutely.  In each case B takes on the death of A.  The position is the same if the donee or successor takes at a time ascertainable only by reference to the death of a person&mdash;for example, if the limitations to B in the foregoing examples were to be &ldquo;one year after the death of A.&rdquo;  A person also becomes entitled on a death if the disposition under which he takes is the will or intestacy of the disponer.  Thus, if A, by will, leaves property on trust for a certain purpose until some date in the future, and on that date to B absolutely, then B is treated as taking an inheritance, not a gift. When the benefit would otherwise be a gift but is taken under a disposition made within two years before the death of the disponer it is liable to inheritance tax and, to achieve this it is artificially labelled as it were, as being taken on a death.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only the proviso that is being deleted in section 9.  In the White Paper the issue of gifts made in contemplation of death was dealt with in paragraph 104 (c):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is considered that there should be two scales of rates applicable to each class&mdash;one referable to all acquisitions received by a beneficiary during the lifetime of the donor, the other to the inheritances acquired on the donor's death.  With a view to encouraging dispositions by a donor in his lifetime, it is proposed to set the rate applicable to <Col N="1371" /> gifts at a level 25 per cent below that for inheritances.  This approach would require safeguards to prevent avoidance of tax by donors making death-bed gifts to avail of the lower rate.  This problem might be met by introducing a gift-period of two years which would have the effect of treating all <i>inter vivos</i> gifts made during that time as inheritances and thus liable to tax at the appropriate points in the inheritance scales.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recall no representations were made on that observation in the White Paper and that leads one to suggest that it was regarded as being acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established that what is envisaged here is gift in contemplation of death.  If that is what it is and the two-year period was not related to any provision in the death duty code and is a new provision, I suggest to the Minister that two years is a long time for someone to be in contemplation of death; it is a long time to be on one's deathbed. If it is not an effort to carry in a provision that was not there before, would the Minister not consider reducing the two-year period, especially having regard to the desirability&mdash;as he adverted to in his quotation from the White Paper&mdash;of encouraging people to dispose of their property by way of gift during life rather than on death and the encouragement that is built into the rates to do that?  Having regard to all these facts, would the Minister not consider reducing the two-year period to one year without any great disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether it is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on whether one is looking at the position of the taxpayer or the Exchequer. The situation is not as black and white as it was under the estate duty code where there was total avoidance if the gift was made <i>inter vivos</i>.  We are dealing with a situation here where the most that could be avoided by a gift made in anticipation of death would be 25 per cent of the tax.  It is proper that there should be some period before death in which the gifts <Col N="1372" /> would be captured for the higher rate of tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it unduly long would be unfair as the Deputy has suggested.  I have not enough information medically to know whether two years is an unusually long span and I do not think there are any vital statistics which give any information about the duration of fatal illnesses. In my view two years is a fair enough period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister realises that once it is introduced, whatever may happen to it in the future, it is unlikely to be reduced. It is now or never.  I am not asking the Minister to make any commitment but to consider the position between now and Report Stage.  He may consider that there is justification for reducing the period a little.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (d) states:</P>
      <P>on the happening, after the cesser of an intervening life interest, of any such event as is referred to in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>I should like to know if the reference to the cesser of an intervening life interest is the death envisaged? One has to interpret that in relation to subsection (2) which sets out the events referred to in that paragraph.  The first is the determination or failure of any charge, estate, interest or trust.  Since we are dealing with a definition of the phrase, &ldquo;on a death&rdquo;, I am assuming that the death involved is the cesser of the intervening life interest and then going on to deal with the termination of an estate.  Could the Minister give an example of the determination or failure of a charge, estate, interest or trust after the cesser of an intervening life interest?  We have the same thing happening in paragraph (c) of subsection (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's failure to adapt the EEC farm modernisation scheme to suit Irish requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary, firstly, to examine the directives which comprise the farm modernisation scheme&mdash;Directives Nos. 159, 160 and 161 of 1972. It might also be possible to include <Col N="1374" /> the disadvantaged areas scheme and possibly one or two others.  When people speak of the farm modernisation scheme they usually have in mind the three directives mentioned. The ostensible purpose of these directives was to give a better livelihood to the people living on the land. The scheme has been in operation for the last couple of years and we have come to the conclusion that the time for radical revision has come.  It is reasonable to ask anybody who makes that statement about the scheme to say on what he bases his contention and condemnation of the Government for failing to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>The first criticism of the scheme one can make is its uniformity of application throughout the Community. It has no regard to the enormous regional differences within the Community.  Leaving aside the mass of national aid which further distorts the exaggerated regional differences in different parts of the Community, the size of grant in the high prosperity areas, such as the Lowlands and wealthy parts of France and Belgium, is the same as that given for the poorer regions, such as our own country, southern Italy, various parts of central France and other marginal areas&mdash;possibly the highlands of Scotland and the hill country of Wales and England.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers have on many occasions declared their intention of reducing the gap that exists between agricultural incomes on the one hand and industrial incomes on the other.  They have also declared their intention of introducing greater uniformity within the farming community itself, and the application of the farm modernisation scheme failed to do that for the reasons I stated.  In our case, the greatest drawback which limits the operation of the scheme is the income threshold, which this year is in the region of £2,080 and also in the method of determination of this income, which is very technical in nature and intricate and unsatisfactory in operation.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside any lengthy consideration <Col N="1375" /> of what happened to farm incomes during the last couple of years, it is beyond question, political or otherwise, that the income of our farming community was dealt a shattering blow.  Nevertheless, the Community have raised the thershold in the mechanical way which was ordained at the time of our entry.  It must be absolutely clear to everybody that more realistic thresholds should be made available.  Four out of every five farmers in this country are excluded from availing of the developing status to the fullest possible extent.  Nearly always he is thrust into the &ldquo;other farming&rdquo; class which provides a smaller range of grants, fixed at a lower level.</P>
    <P>There is also the extraordinary circumstance that small farmers who have a high production may find themselves classified as commercial farmers on the grounds that they have tillage operations on rented land.  For that reason they find themselves limited in the amount of assistance they will get from the farm modernisation scheme. By and large the scheme seems to be steered towards the high prosperity areas of the Community rather than the reverse.  In our case it would appear to be more reasonable to put the weight of their effort behind the people who have some prospects of becoming economically viable as farmers but who are excluded under the present conditions of the scheme, rather than the class that has already achieved that status.</P>
    <P>The thinking of the Commission apears to be firmly based on what is known as the concept of the modern farm.  There appears to be no contemplation of a change even for problem areas such as the west of Ireland or other difficult areas of the Community. It could be said that 95 per cent of the farmers in Connacht are effectively debarred from participation in the scheme.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the concept of the modern farm, the thinking and actions of the Brussels Commission, it is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the hope is entertained that a great many <Col N="1376" /> of those people will go out of farming all together.  Though I do not consider the desirability of such a thing even where there is alternative employment near at hand, as is the case in many depressed areas in Europe, this does not exist in a great many places here, certainly at the present time when we have unemployment at a level we have not seen since the foundation of the State and with no prospect in view, because of the financial lunacy of the present Government, other than an increasing roll of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In that context it becomes all the more depressing that farms of a size that become viable are not being given it while the income level is pitched at the level it is.  Another serious disadvantage is the total exclusion from this directive of part-time farmers.  I have considerable experience of this.  Because of comparatively recent developments in our rural economy, in my area we are fortunate in having some stable and viable industries in the southern parts of County Kilkenny.  There are hundreds of men who have small holdings who are working in such industries as Clover Meats, Waterford Glass, the fertiliser factory at New Ross and other such industries.  In other parts you have the same part-time staffing of such industries as Avonmore Dairies in Ballyragget where there are scores, if not hundreds, employed.</P>
    <P>The development that is taking place in that typical area is that young men coming from farms which are not really viable establish their houses and their families on the family farms but they derive the greater part of their incomes from industrial employment, remaining part of the rural communities with their children growing up in rural environments.  If this were not possible, the alternative would be that the children of those workers would become inhabitants of housing schemes in Waterford, in Dublin or Cork.  This is not a development we should encourage and for that reason the assistance being given to part-time farmers should be reconsidered and the development of our small projects, usually they are small, should be encouraged <Col N="1377" /> actively in order to ensure that the community in which we will live will be actively and positively interested in the maintenance of our rural population.  If it had no other benefit, it would act as a deterrent to the growth of dormitory towns around our cities and stabilise our rural population which has been so staggeringly depleted in the last twenty years.</P>
    <P>I do not make a political point here. The background against which we are operating is that ten years ago 36 per cent of the male population between the ages of 16 and 24 years were working in agriculture and in the ten years since, that has fallen to 16 per cent. The exodus that has taken place in rural Ireland under our stewardship as well as that of the present Government is something we must have regard to now and we must resolve that it has gone far enough and that it must stop.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to Directive 160 which in practice leaves it to national Governments to impose on themselves a discipline in the matter of land acquisition, land purchase, land revenue and land leasing.  The only demand that is made in practice on member countries is that this discipline should apply to community members regardless of where they come from.  I regret that the amount of activity in this area that has been discernible from the present Government is practically nil.  There is no indication that the Government can see the dire need there is to arrest the haemorrhage of the people of rural Ireland, the almost total demise of communities and the depressing extent to which those who remain are hermits on their own land.</P>
    <P>The pension scheme under this directive offers pensions calculated to be attractive enough to elderly farmers to surrender land so that it may be made available for the development of other farm structures.  It is no good, not worth the paper it is written on for this reason: it fails to understand the psychology of the countryman, especially the Irish countryman with a history such as ours&mdash;the fight for the possession and ownership of land was so long and bitter that it has taken a place in folk memory.  Every Deputy knows old farmers living in practical <Col N="1378" /> poverty who might be making other arrangements which might relieve that poverty but because of their ingrained love of the land they make no such arrangements.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest the Government now should consider a system under which long leases would be made, especially to farmers on the young side, through which older farmers would remain the owners of the land so that under the supervision of the land authority the land would be leased to young tenants, development farmers, for a period of about ten or 20 years.  One of the things that bedevilled Irish farming has been the 11-month system.  It should be closely examined now to see whether it should not be practically abandoned altogether.  There will always be certain pieces of land that for particular reasons it would be necessary to lease for shorter periods, but, by and large, the notion of the 11-month system of letting should be got rid of. In that regard, not for the first time in this House, I recommend that where the Land Commission are themselves letting land which they have already acquired they would only do so to farmers who would qualify for an allotment of it.  The practice is to allot it to the highest bidder who, invariably, is either one whose farm is adequate for his operations or a person who is not engaged in farming but who may be speculating in cattle, for instance.  In speaking of speculation we raise a big problem.  We ought collectively to make the decision that farmland is not for speculation but is for the use only of farmers; that it is not available, under any code, apart for very exceptional circumstances, in so far as people outside farming are concerned.  In areas of congestion, land that becomes available for sale or for letting should be designated officially as development land and its sale should be limited to farmers who are reaching development status.  I recognise that this would raise certain difficulties but when one considers the wildly-inflated prices of agricultural land, one must recognise that the possibility of the smaller farmer&mdash;the one with less financial muscle&mdash;obtaining extra land is practically nil.  We are <Col N="1379" /> witnessing the process of the absorption of the smaller farmers throughout the country.  By no means could my constituency be described as one of the poorer ones.  Perhaps, from the point of view of agriculture, it is the best but even in that area the reality is that because of the inaccessibility of land to the farmers of the type I am talking about, they are being backed slowly year after year against the wall of extinction.  I regret to say that even with the licence afforded to us under the 1963 Act and under EEC directive 160 of 1972, we are allowing this process to continue totally unchecked.  I have never heard from either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a proposal to arrest this decay.</P>
    <P>I admit that it is not today nor yesterday the decay began.  The statistic I gave extended over the period of the past ten years during which time the number of young men engaged in agriculture has decreased by 20 per cent and is continuing to decrease.</P>
    <P>Since there is effective licence under Directive 161 for nation states to take whatever measures they consider fit to stabilise the rural population on the land, it is for us to take such measures. Pressure for this type of action is growing.  I should hope that what I am saying would help to alert the people of rural Ireland to the desolation being wrought all around them.  I should hope, too, to alert the Minister and his colleagues to the fact that this issue will be a burning political one in the future.  It is right that we should recognise the situation and formulate plans to arrest the near destruction of rural society as we have known it.  It is badly impaired already.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that this desolation does not continue.</P>
    <P>The various pension schemes have been tried.  There was the scheme of a kind in the 1963 Act but that was not worth talking of.  It did not work.  The same applies to the pension scheme in connection with the farm modernisation scheme.  The reason for the lack of success of these schemes is the profound love of the land that results in elderly farmers facing poverty and discomfort <Col N="1380" /> rather than signing away their land.</P>
    <P>I am not aware that even the most modest suggestion has been made under Directive 161 which rejoices in the gobbledegook title of <i>Socio-Economic Infrastructural Reorganisation,</i> one of these expressions produced by the bureaucracy.  What it conveys to me is the recognition that there is a need for the interlocking of the various agencies concerned with the rural community and the co-ordination of their work towards an end that appears to have been lost sight of&mdash;the stabilisation of the rural population. When one considers the marital status and the average age of our farmers, one must recognise that regardless of what we do there will be a diminution in the number of people engaged in agriculture during the next decade. However, we should have as our objective the keeping of this diminution at a minimum.</P>
    <P>Directive 161 is voluminous in regard to educational training, industrial development and a whole range of assistances that may be provided by national governments under the general umbrella of the directive.  It is necessary to bring together committees of agriculture, the IAOS, the farming organisations and possibly county councils and organisations such as the ICA so that they can identify the problems of areas possibly by counties or by regions.  These organisations recognise that of farming families there will be some young men and women who will not be able to continue in farming and that for them other means of livelihood will have to be provided preferably in their immediate areas but certainly in their regions.  What I am talking of is the necessity for the development of local industries, village industries and the active participation of the IDA in this quest for new industry. The Irish as a nation have acted for long enough as a reservoir of cheap labour for our neighbours in Great Britain and in other countries.</P>
    <P>It is time we began to work for ourselves and it is up to ourselves because, no matter what the EEC may provide in the way of aid, and they have provided very substantial <Col N="1381" /> aid, unless we resolve to help ourselves and do it ourselves and identify our own problems ourselves the EEC will not save us.  For that reason I regret there has not been a single whisper, not to me at any rate, from the Government about, first of all, the recognition of the dire problems that exist and, secondly, the formulation of methods to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Before the recent by-election we had the Minister for the Gaeltacht announcing with an appropriate flourish of trumpets, the establishment of a western development board.  The notion in itself may be well enough, but what good is the flourishing of trumpets when we are not even able to fund a decent disadvantaged areas scheme?  The aids under the headage grants paid by our Government under the disadvantaged areas scheme are by far the smallest and the meanest in the Community. They must be.  Anything that depends largely on a national contribution is bound to weigh against the smaller and poorer countries and we are one of them.  For that reason I am quite sure the Minister is very well aware of this and I am quite sure he has been putting across the point that the concept of national aids will have to be got rid of as soon as possible.  But it has not been done yet and I do not think it is very realistic for the Government to talk airily and vaguely, before by-elections only, about western development boards or any other kind of development boards unless there is something else coming as well.  If Mr. O'Donnell had been willing officially to tell us what he was going to do for the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>But Mr. O'Donnell did not tell us or identify any of the problems this western development board was going to tackle. Since my time is limited I want to refer to the apparent conflict that <Col N="1382" /> exists between the price policy operated by the EEC and the social objectives that appear to be the target of the Community and the Commission in the directives under the farm organisation scheme.  The price policy must to a great degree militate against the smaller farmers because the reward is far greater to the more efficient farmer and, in coldly economic terms, the larger farmer is usually the more efficient.  But we Irish have got to talk about it in a somewhat different context because we are talking about the social implications of it as well.</P>
      <P>We do not look upon the ultimate in economic expansion upon the farm as being the acme of achievement. Rather do we look on the achievement in the light of the social development that takes place, in the reduction in the number of people who must leave farming and in the fairer distribution of the land resources we have got.  I am not now in any way talking about introducing a tyranny that would prevent progressive farmers from expanding. What I am talking about is a regime that would prevent them expanding regardless of whose expense they expand at.  There are many people who would advocate an upper limit in the acreage of land that may be given to any one man. This is unrealistic. What we should aim at is preventing one man from injuring the future prospects of two, three or four others and we have not been doing anything like enough in that regard.  As a consequence, the people of rural Ireland, especially the smaller people, not being able to avail of the grants available to development farmers are yearly approaching the ultimate point of extinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no indication, good, bad or indifferent, from the Government that I am aware of that they are aware of what is going on.  We want to tell them now.  We want to alert them to this situation which I call a crisis situation.  We want to ask the Minister immediately to seek revision&mdash;in our case drastic revision&mdash;of the directives, especially Directive 159. We want a lowering of the thresholds.  We want assistance for part-time farmers.  We <Col N="1383" /> want the identification of the objective of the whole scheme and not the establishment of modern farms as much as the stabilisation of family farms on the land throughout the Community and especially in this country.  I think it is possible for individual countries, such as ourselves, to get special measures. The Italians have done it in the case of their cattle.  I regret very much that we did not do the same.  We have an excellent case to go to the Commission and say: &ldquo;Look here, the threshold you have fixed for the rest of the Community is no good to us and the statistics on which you rely are very misleading indeed.&rdquo;  We all owe it to the Government, particularly to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Lands, to do this and do it now.  The people of rural Ireland are waiting for this and I am sure the Deputies from west Munster, Connacht and Ulster will be talking on this motion and they will give you the numbers of their constituents who are more or less debarred from participation in any effective way in the farm modernisation scheme. We urge the Government and the Minister to look for these changes and get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. M.P. Murphy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened for the last 40 minutes to Deputy Gibbons and I must say that his tone of voice and the content of his statement are far different from his tone of voice and the content of his remarks when we debated a somewhat similar motion here in the latter part of January of this year.  That debate centred on Directives 159 and 160.  I thought I would hear some condemnatory remarks from the Deputy who put down this motion but he had nothing significant to contribute.  The time of this House could be saved if he would call to the Minister's office to discuss the matters which are getting the attention of the Minister and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why the change?  In January, 1969, Deputy Collins who was shadow Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, told the House that the agricultural policy <Col N="1384" /> then being pursued would put 65 per cent of the farmers out of business. That is the actual figure.  If there is any doubt about it I can quote his statement.  The figure is not taken out of context.  Today Deputy Gibbons said that 95 per cent of the farmers in the Province of Connacht are debarred from the scheme.  That is not correct. I would say 95 per cent of the farmers of Connacht would qualify for the scheme.  Deputy Gibbons emphasised the desirability of improving the lot of the smaller farmers.  On 28th January, 1975, he said:</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Government, to the Minister, that we will never think of our people in the west as people to be treated as Indians in a reservation.  That is the way the Government are treating them and nobody else is responsible for having got them into that situation at present.</P>
    <P>They were strong words.  That is not so, and that statement is not factual.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Deputy's tone of voice in making his contribution.  It is impossible to condemn the Minister and the Government for their agricultural policy.  We are most fortunate to have the two directives mainly referred to in this debate dealt with by Deputy Mark Clinton, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, and Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick, Minister for Lands.  The Irish people have every confidence, and justifiably so, in both Ministers.  They know they are delivering the goods and will continue to deliver the goods.  I do not throw bouquets around too often.  We are entitled to reply to a motion which sets out to condemn the Government.</P>
    <P>I owe my membership of this House over a period of 25 years largely to the support I get from small farmers in Cork south west.  I am interested in their welfare.  In previous discussions on farming matters, I was not slow to voice my opposition, irrespective of what Government were in power, to measures I thought were not to their advantage.  We all know the difficulties and problems confronting the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  His portfolio is completely <Col N="1385" /> different from what it was in days gone by since our entry to the EEC out of which grows the farm modernisation scheme.  It is the Minister's job to negotiate our terms, to deal with his colleagues on the Council of Ministers and to ensure that he gets the best deal possible for Irish agriculture.  I assert this is being done. It is generally accepted throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Since Deputy Gibbons made his statement about the Province of Connacht being grossly neglected by the Government and particularly by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;a statement which was more or less supported by the suggestion that 95 per cent of the farmers of Connacht are debarred from the scheme&mdash;what has happened?  Unfortunately, three of our colleagues have passed to their eternal reward and consequently we had three by-elections, one in West Galway, one in North Galway, and one in Mayo West.  These are three rural constituencies largely, with the exception of Galway town.  I will not go over the election results but this is the best yardstick by which to measure public opinion and public confidence.  In no uncertain terms the Government got an endorsement of their policies from the three areas.  That endorsement came largely from the smaller and medium sized farmers.  I am sure the number of commercial farmers in Galway and Mayo is small.  It is not imposing unduly on the time of the House to mention that fact.  To my mind it is a vote of confidence in the Government and in particular in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Lands, and an encouragement to them to continue agricultural development in the western areas.</P>
    <P>Since the Government took office two years and eight months ago they have paid particular attention to agriculture.  That has helped the Minister very much in the work he is doing.  The Government, supported by all their backbenchers, are mindful of the fact that agriculture is our main industry and naturally it is entitled to reasonable levies on the Exchequer <Col N="1386" /> for development and for the improvement of the standards of living of those who engage in it.</P>
    <P>I have not the slightest doubt but that the Minister's work has been made relatively easy, that despite the economic recession taking place all over the world the Government, since assuming office, have been as liberal as possible so far as the provision of funds for our agricultural industry is concerned.  Why I say that is because many people, at least a sizeable number, even some of our farmers, have the idea that since we became a member of the EEC all the moneys paid out under the farm modernisation scheme come from Europe.  As every Member of the House knows quite well, the bulk of those moneys comes from the taxpayers' pockets and the amount of money paid out under that scheme which is obtained from Community funds, to which we contribute, is relatively small.  I am sure I would not be out of place in saying it is less than 10 per cent, though I have not the actual figure.</P>
    <P>What are the complaints?  From what I could gather from the mover of the motion they are few and far between.  I have disposed of the first one, that was concerned with grants in poor parts of the country and the question of a sizeable number, or almost all, of the farmers on the western seaboard being debarred from the scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons mentioned that the number of farmers getting into the development category was relatively small.  I believe the figures are 18 per cent development and 3 per cent commercial. The table I have here indicates that the transitional farmer is not a big loser by not being classified &ldquo;development&rdquo;; he is a man who is moving towards development.  The feeling seems to be abroad that, by virtue of being classified as transitional, it will not help farmers to be considered for, say, Land Commission holdings which are to be divided.  That is not so.  The idea behind this scheme is to bring about a situation, if land is available, in which transitional farmers' claims will be scrutinised and, if approved, they will be awarded <Col N="1387" /> portions of land in the same way as are development farmers.  In my view a transitional farmer moving towards development is even more entitled to that land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being paid up to date.  In fact there was some cribbing of late that they were being paid too early.  The Department are mindful of the fact that farmers want their money, possibly in some cases urgently, to formulate other schemes, to develop their holding or to provide for additional works on their holdings. We do not do what the Deputy's party used to do&mdash;hold up payments until some Fianna Fáil Deputy was approached to make representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to mention also the farm retirement scheme because it is something to which I have addressed myself over the years.  I am now expressing a personal view but one firmly held.  Even though the retirement scheme is advancing reasonably well, as shown by the statistics available, there is in south-west Cork&mdash;and I am sure this is typical of what obtains in other parts of the country&mdash;a tradition of handing over farms, if at all possible, to a close relative, that is in the case of an owner who has no family, perhaps a single man, Naturally, that is the major hindrance in this scheme under Directive No. 160.  I see nothing wrong in that system.  It is an Irish tradition. It has worked reasonably well in the past and I have no doubt it will work reasonably well in the future.  It is something the Department of Lands must take into account in determining whether land should be acquired for distribution among congests or whether a person should be allowed pass it on to a relative.  My view is that the relative takes first place if he or she is a young person likely to get married in the not too distant future, a person who understands farming and is capable <Col N="1390" /> of working the holding.  I have expressed that view before and I have not changed it.  So far as Directive No. 160 is concerned, the Minister is doing a good job when one takes account of all the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has used a very apt term.  I know that the payment was much appreciated. The taxpayers' money is limited and the level of £300 was quite fair and was acknowledged as such.  Naturally there is criticism that the areas are not extended but wherever we draw the line there will always be people outside it who are anxious to be included. These things cannot be done. The work of the Government with regard to the disadvantaged areas scheme is much appreciated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All the schemes are part of a package and it is the Minister's job to apply it and to try to adapt the schemes to the general needs of the country.  Today the Opposition told us the Government were not doing this but it was said in a weak voice, without any force or drive.  Deputy Gibbons did not speak with the same voice as he did in January, 1974, when he was preaching gloom and disaster, when he complained about bad cattle prices and said that calves were being thrown into the bogs, as happened years ago.  One felt the Deputy got a certain satisfaction from that.

      <P>I agree that possibly there are areas that need change.  This directive is three years old and I do not think it is the final one.  Deputy Gibbons spoke about people leaving the land.  If farmers move out of uneconomic holdings the number on the land will decrease, but we are hopeful that later on it will show an increase.  Unfortunately there are bachelor farmers in many parts of <Col N="1392" /> the country but we hope that this trend will not continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>There are farmers who are living on uneconomic holdings and I should like to see these people taking up jobs locally rather than going to the labour exchange. Undoubtedly there is some change needed here.  Under the scheme we are discussing, a person will not qualify unless he gets 50 per cent of his income from and spends 50 per cent of his time on the land.  I have no doubt the Minister will try to get that changed.  I know of several small farmers who, if jobs were available in nearby towns, would take work in those towns.  That is the way in which we can save the small farmers and I hope the Minister will be able to effect some change here.  A farm held by a farm worker is totally different from a farm owned by a professional man, a merchant or a shopkeeper. For the latter the purchase of a farm is regarded as a speculation.</P>
      <P>I wish to discount what Deputy Gibbons has stated.  All Irish farmers, whether large, medium or small, have complete confidence in the Government and in the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Gibbons put down this motion for discussion he hoped it would be taken seriously by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, his Parliamentary Secretary and by the Government.  He put it down for the purpose of finding out the shortcomings in the farm modernisation scheme as applying to Irish farming at present but so far this seems to have fallen on deaf ears because the Parliamentary Secretary in his contribution only waffled his way through and did not seem to think that this was something serious.  I can tell him that the shortcomings of the farm modernisation scheme have not been felt yet and assure him that unless the Government become aware or are made aware of these shortcomings <Col N="1393" /> and are willing to rectify them the scheme will become a very live political issue.  That might suit us on this side of the House but it would not suit Irish agriculture, especially farmers who will be forced off the land. Therefore, we would like to see the motion treated as it deserves to be treated and we hope it will have the desired effect and make the Government aware of the need for change.</P>
      <P>The basic principle of the farm modernisation scheme is good in that it encourages farmers to develop on a planned basis but its operation is not suitable in Irish conditions.  It has now been in operation for some time but its effects have not yet been seriously felt.  The Government must be aware of the need for change and now is the time to make the change in the interests of agriculture.  What I am saying is borne out by the fact that 79 per cent is the national average of farmers in the other category and the figure in the west of Ireland must be very much higher.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that Deputy Gibbons' figure was not correct but he did not say what he thought the figure was. I believe that Deputy Gibbons' figure would appear to be correct in respect of Connacht seeing that 79 per cent is the national average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to interrupt but does the Deputy assert that 95 per cent of the farmers in Connacht are debarred from the benefits of the farm modernisation scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that 79 per cent is the national average of those in the other category and therefore it appears to me that Deputy Gibbons' figure must be correct.  The Parliamentary Secretary contradicted that figure but did not give the correct figure.  The 79 per cent in the other category have very little chance of coming into the category of development or commercial farming and do not know what is in store for them beyond 1977.  This is a very serious matter and I hope that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in his contribution will clear up that point because farmers in the other category <Col N="1394" /> are becoming very worried at present. Perhaps through a discussion like this they will realise how serious their position is.  That is the first essential. Then they must use every means open to them to bring home to the Government the seriousness of the situation.</P>
      <P>If the modernisation scheme suited Irish conditions I would expect at least two-thirds of the Irish farming community would qualify.  In saying twothirds I accept that in any such scheme there will be those who are too old to qualify and some who are bad managers and so on.  But as the scheme operates many good young farmers, through no fault of their own, are not qualified either as commercial or development farmers.  This must be remedied.  We must come to their aid. I appeal to the Government to realise that this must be done quickly.  These farmers need the most aid but they are getting the least under the present system.  One of the first things to consider in helping small farmers to develop, especially uneconomic holders, is the need for additional land.  They must have additional land.  Therefore it is important to ensure that the land which becomes available is not bought for the purpose of speculation by people not already in farming, by people who will not put it to proper use and to ensure that farmers who already have more than sufficient land are not allowed to buy land at the expense of farmers who require additions. We have the legislation under which this can be done by not approving such purchases of land.  That is the first step to take in helping the uneconomic holder to develop and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons spoke of the difficulty regarding the threshold income of £2,080.  I would like every farmer to reach that minimum figure; it is only right that we should give every encouragement that would tend to build up the farmer's income to that level.  In order to achieve this farmers require a great deal of help and we should give them all the help and advice necessary. At present no effort is being made to do this; they are just classed as being in the other category for which the national average is the very high figure <Col N="1395" /> of 79 per cent.  It is a frightening figure. They know they are not getting what they should get; they are getting lower grants than those in the other classes. They do not know what the future holds for them beyond 1977.  I have never heard their position beyond that stage clarified sufficiently.  At present people are encouraged into dairying, beet and sheep but there is no encouragement for those in the category I mentioned to develop as tillage farmers. This must also be considered.</P>
    <P>From a national point of view the amount of animal feedstuff we import should be reduced considerably and this could be done if farmers were encouraged to grow more.  The farmer who wishes to expand his dairy herd will qualify for a grant of 10 per cent if he purchases the additional cows or heifers from outside but I cannot understand why a farmer, if he rears these animals himself, does not qualify for any grant.  That is by far the best method of increasing his herd because it does not involve the risk of disease that buying from outside does.</P>
    <P>There is also an incentive in relation to beef and sheep but nothing for tillage.  This should be looked at immediately.  There has been a drastic falling-off in the acreage of land under potatoes, a fact which is well known to the housewife who has to pay such a high price for potatoes. Much market gardening is done in Ballinacourty in County Waterford and those involved need incentive and encouragement.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the farm modernisation scheme and its operation in County Waterford.  The scheme is being operated in a detailed manner by the local advisory service. Officials involved in that service spend all their time in the administration of that scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be better spent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The instructors have moved away from the work they were involved in because it takes, on average two-and-a-half days to process an application under this scheme. The instructors have become officebound <Col N="1396" /> and have no time to give advice on the land.  I cannot understand why the Minister has said that their time could not be better spent because they should be in the field rather than in an office.  I hope that when the backlog in my county is dealt with the instructors will be able to move from the office out to farmers to give them advice in relation to their holdings.  Their work in the advisory field has been at a standstill because of the farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>And 40 per cent of Waterford farmers are development farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should find some other means of processing applications rather than involving instructors.  He should find some other way of doing the work of the Government in this scheme and permit the advisers to carry out the duties they were appointed to carry out.  In Waterford we had 873 applications and of this number 38 per cent are in the development category as against the national average of 18 per cent. We have 9 per cent in the commercial category as against the national average of 3 per cent while in the &ldquo;other category&rdquo; we have 53 per cent as against the national average of 79 per cent.  The reason for this is that in Waterford, which is a dairying county, the size of the farms is above the national average.</P>
      <P>Of the 341 farms surveyed by the advisory service in the &ldquo;other category&rdquo;, if the threshold income was reduced by £400 an additional 252 farmers would get in.  A further 92 farmers could be brought in by changing their system of farming while 68 would get in if high borrowing could have been avoided.  A further 25 would qualify if they got extra land. That survey shows the difficulties farmers in that area are in.  While I would like to see the threshold figure of £2,080 being reached by every farmer&mdash;I believe we should work towards this goal&mdash;it is obvious, because that figure is so high, that we are keeping out a number of farmers from the development class.  This should be rectified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1397" /> With regard to those who would qualify if they changed their system of farming, I should like to state that it is in this regard the advisers could play a major role if they were not engaged in the farm modernisation scheme.  The borrowing which the 68 farmers I have referred to engaged in was on the advice of the agricultural instructors with a view to the development and expansion of their farms.  Farmers are now finding that because they borrowed heavily they are being penalised and put into a category where there is little chance of them becoming development farmers. That is a severe penalty on those farmers.  Extra land must be made available to farmers who are anxious to expand but this can only be made available from the pool of land we have.  If we are to hold such a pool of land for those in need there must be a stop put to speculators who are buying land at such a price that the ordinary farmer has no chance of competing.  There should also be a check put on farmers who have more than enough land to give them a good income.  These people must be stopped in their efforts to gobble up all the land that becomes available in a locality.  We all have seen this happening. Under present legislation we have the power to stop this happening by not sanctioning sales to people in the category I mentioned.  This is something that needs to be attended to quickly.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given should indicate to the Minister and the Government the shortcomings in the farm modernisation scheme as at present administered.  There are many shortcomings.  However, I do not have the time to deal with them now but I will have an opportunity to discuss them at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the retiring farmer who at 55 years will receive 10 per cent less by way of grants. This is a severe penalty on such a man because 55 years is too young for a farmer to retire when one considers that 65 is the retiring age for other classes.</P>

Where it does not do so but follows on a death, what happens? This provision seems to cover a very limited number of cases, but is there a provision that covers the more ordinary cases where there is just a death and an arrangement arising out of it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that amendment would seem to have suggested there is a difference in meaning between &ldquo;charged&rdquo; and &ldquo;levied&rdquo;.

      <P>Like many words, they can have different meanings in <Col N="1402" /> different contexts.  In certain contexts they may have a limited meaning, but in order to confer the right on the Revenue Commissioners to enforce payment, I consider it necessary to use the three verbs in this section.  The other changes were made because of the valuation date and we were saying the tax would be levied and payable but we did not want any unfair situation, and that is why we said it should be chargeable on a certain date and that the time of payment would arise when an assessment had been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will dispute that this section is the kernel of the Bill because it imposes a tax to be called a capital acquisitions tax.  At this stage that cannot be divorced from section 10 which imposes a tax to be called an inheritance tax.  This is the first section that imposes a capital acquisitions tax and we must keep in mind that this tax is essentially conceived as a gift tax which is, broadly speaking, a tax on gifts or voluntary transactions <i>inter vivos</i>, while the inheritance tax in section 10 is a tax on devolution.  Here the Minister is making a substantial change in the law for which he can make a strong case.  Before the passing of this Bill, the position was that you had death duties and because of the ease with which such a tax could be avoided it was necessary to provide in the legislation that all gifts&mdash;I am using the word broadly &mdash;within a period before the death were brought into account on the devolution and that the net effect on death was that the estate of the deceased embraced the free gifts which he made in his lifetime and within the statutory period before death.  I trust the Minister will correct me if he considers that preliminary state of the prior situation to be not correct.  The Minister is recognising the prior death problem and also avoiding by this mechanism the problem of having dates.  He is providing separately for the taxation of gifts, subject to the exemptions and exceptions in the Bill.</P>

    <P>I trust it is not irrelevant on the section to remark that the other part of <Col N="1403" /> the death duty substitution takes place in section 10 where the property that devolves on death is taxed, again subject to the exemption.  This brings us to the question of the necessity for the section.  As we have seen in the previous section, ingenuity can come into play on the border line between death and life.  Consequently, there must be a consideration of both types of taxation. For the purpose of clarification I wish merely to know whether the gift tax to be charged under this section is to be taken in conjunction with the inheritance tax provided for in section 10.  The Minister, logically, is doing all he can to keep them as separate as possible but there must be a certain amount of overlapping.</P>
    <P>The regulations and the method of charging are provided for in other sections but it is right to draw attention to the fact that this section is, together with section 10, one of the essential charging sections in the whole Bill.</P>
    <P>The question raised by Deputy Colley in relation to date brings in technical complications of various kinds which we will probably be confronted with throughout the Bill.  However, it would be wrong to delay on this question now.  From the point of view of homogeneity in our discussions later I should be glad to know whether the Minister would accept generally the premises on which I have based my approach to the Bill.</P>

      <P>The philosophy behind the Bill was explained in the White Paper of March 28th, 1974. This was a philosophy which we considered to be just.  It imposes a tax which will not apply within families except in cases of gifts to individuals exceeding £150,000 in value.  The intention for which the Government sought and obtained a mandate was to exempt transfers of property within families.  This has been <Col N="1404" /> achieved largely but not <i>in toto</i>.  I would not consider it appropriate nor right socially to have total exemption because such a situation would lead merely to the concentration of increasing amounts of property in very privileged hands.  Where the tax will operate it will be at a level less than what was the impact of death duties but it takes account of the fact that large accumulations of capital will be taxed during life and not only at times of transfer of property on death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to detain the House on this point but it might be appropriate for me to reiterate what I said earlier in drawing the attention of the House to the fact that on this side of the House we did not oppose the Second Reading of this Bill.  We are in favour of the principle involved.</P>
      <P>What this Bill does is to impose a gift tax and, at the same time, effectively to impose death duties substantially modified as against what were in operation.  Fianna Fáil, in Government, were planning a modification of the death duty code but we knew, too, that the introduction of a gift tax was essential.  As Minister for Finance I had preparations under way for the introduction of such a tax. There are aspects of this Bill with which we do not agree.  During the debate we shall be pointing out areas in which we think there can be improvement but we are not opposed to the Bill.  On the contrary, we consider it to be essential especially in the context of what in effect are substantial reliefs in regard to death duties.  I cannot see any distinction between inheritance tax and death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section is a charging one.  The taxes provided for in this Bill and in particular in this section are important. They should have come before the other capital taxation measures because they were far more relevant both to the Exchequer and to the economic circumstances of the country.  However, I shall not go back over all that again except to say that in this Bill we are dealing with the real <Col N="1405" /> capital taxation measures which have relevance to the situation today and, in particular, to the economic situation and the requirements of the Exchequer. As far as we are concerned this particular section is quite acceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to become involved in a long argument but it is very difficult for the Minister to make that statement with absolute confidence that he is correct in what he is saying.  I say that, first, because the proposed tax will be operating at a very low level in quite a number of cases and, secondly, it is impossible, if the Minister is talking about what is being done in relation to death duties, to confine oneself to what is in this Bill.  One has to have regard to what is in other Bills, which are now Acts, in order to assess what is substituted for the suspension of the law on death duties which is, as the Minister knows, what is happening. Suspension of the law is not repeal.  I doubt if it is possible for anybody, including the Revenue Commissioners, to assess accurately the total effect of the three Bills operating together in the light of the repeal of death duty legislation. I doubt if anybody can do that but, even if it could be done, it is certainly not accurate and not at all relevant to talk about the effect of this Bill alone.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, to delete subsection (6) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) (a)  Where, before the 28th day of February, 1974, a contract or agreement was entered into, under or as a consequence of which a person acquired the right, otherwise than for full consideration in money or <Col N="1406" /> money's worth, to have a benefit transferred to him, or to another in his right or on his behalf, and an act or acts is or are done, on or after that date, in pursuance of, or in performance or satisfaction, whether in whole or in part, of such contract or agreement, then the gift or inheritance, as the case may be, taken by or in right or on behalf of that person, shall be deemed to have been taken, not when the right was acquired as aforesaid, but either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  when the benefit was transferred to him or to another in his right or on his behalf; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  when he or another in his right or on his behalf became beneficially entitled in possession to the benefit,</P>
    <P>whichever is the later.</P>
    <P>(b)  In this subsection, a reference to a contract or agreement does not include a reference to a contract or agreement which is a complete grant, transfer, assignment or conveyance.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It proved necessary to add paragraph (b) to remove doubts as to the liability on payments made under a contract entered into before the Act comes into operation.  The matter contained in paragraph (a) of the amendment is the same as the section as originally introduced. It has been repeated in the amendment solely for renumbering purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather wondering about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph (b) is an addition.  If, for instance, a contract entered into before 28th February, 1974, was a complete grant of the life interest in itself it was still possible to argue under the section as originally introduced that payment made after 28th February, 1974, on foot of income due to the life tenant must be taxed. The amendment seeks to ensure that such a payment would not be taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has confirmed what I thought was so, namely, that the amendment is exactly the same as what is being replaced except that paragraph (b) is being <Col N="1407" /> added and this is being done solely for numbering purposes, presumably in order to insert paragraph (a) after (6) and then add paragraph (b).  It seems a rather cumbersome way but it achieves what the Minister wants so we will not quarrel with that part of it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given an illustration. Where the actual transfer of the property had been completed prior to 28th February, 1974, a payment subsequent to that date in respect of the transaction would be or could be subject to tax but for the addition of paragraph (b), if I interpret the Minister correctly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, what is the reasoning behind it?  Why should such a transaction, entered into before there was any indication of gift tax, be liable to gift tax now?  Is that not a form of retrospection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not anymore than an increase in income tax is retrospective simply because it applies to salary scales fixed prior to the imposition of the tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a fallacy in that in the sense that a transaction entered into prior to 28th February, 1974, might well not have been entered into if it had been known it would be subject to gift tax.  There was no way in which the parties could know it would be subject to gift tax and the fact the transaction was not completed on that date does not seem to me on the face of it to justify <Col N="1408" /> the application of gift tax to it.  Putting it another way, I suggest to the Minister the correct approach would be to apply gift tax to any transaction for which the contract was entered into after 28th February, 1974, but any case in which a contract was entered into prior to that date, whenever completed, ought not to be subject to gift tax.  Any other approach, if not introducing retrospection, is certainly going very close to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is. There are plenty of arrangements made in the light of existing tax rates significantly altered subsequently because tax rates change.  There may be a tendency to assume taxes will not change but there is no right to assume that.  If that were the position, the Legislature would be frustrated in its efforts to amend the law or, improve the law and collect revenue.</P>
      <P>If a shopkeeper anticipates the budget by purchasing commodities he believes may be subject to tax and they are not subject to tax, is he at a loss because he made a wrong anticipation? That kind of thing is not infrequently indulged in.  Section 5 provides that where a gift is made on or after 28th February, 1974, pursuant to a binding contract made before that date it will be taxed as if made when completed and not on the time of the contract.  In the ordinary way entering into a binding contract is a gift but it is necessary to make an exception in the type of case dealt with in sections 5 and 6 to counteract the temptation of drawing a deed of gift after 28th February, 1974, and stating it was in pursuance of a contract made before 28th February, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rather suspected that this was what was behind this provision. I am glad the Minister has said it, so that we can talk the one language about what is involved.  Is the Minister afraid either that people will produce contracts falsely dated or that they will allege verbal contracts made earlier?  I would have thought that in the latter case they would not get much of a hearing from the Revenue Commissioners.  The former case is a problem with which the Revenue Commissioners are faced all the time.  I do not think it is soluble. In my view, it is not sufficient to justify the imposition of gift tax on a transaction entered into <i>bona fide</i> prior to 28th February, 1974, when the parties could not have anticipated the Minister's announcement in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, tax rates change from time to time.  Very often they apply to arrangements made prior to the imposition of the tax.  Income tax is a perfect example.  A person enters into a contract of employment and is to be paid £X per year.  The rate of tax could rise by 5, 10 or 20 per cent. Is it to be said that it may not apply to such employment contracts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talked about the shopkeeper buying in goods in anticipation of a change in taxation rates.  That is the reverse of this situation where people enter into a contract in good faith, not anticipating any change in the rates.  If a shopkeeper anticipates a change in rates and finds there is not a change and he is left holding the baby, that is too bad.  I certainly will not bleed for him. Where people enter into a contract of this kind in good faith on the basis of what the law is at the time, I suggest it is wrong and is retrospectively imposing taxation to apply gift tax to that transaction, which is what is being done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the general principle involved should be that gift tax should be imposed on any such transaction which was not entered into <Col N="1410" /> prior to 28th February, 1974, but that it should not be applied where the transaction was genuinely entered into prior to that date.  There could be many reasons why it was not completed. There could be many cases in which transactions entered into after the transaction in question were completed prior to 28th February, 1974, and no gift tax was imposed just because of the particular circumstances in a particular case holding up the completion of the transaction until after 28th February, 1974.  This does not justify the imposition of gift tax. In reality what we are talking about here is a fear on the part of the Minister that there may be allegations of contracts having been entered into prior to 28th February, 1974, when, in fact, they were not.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners are not without weapons in dealing with a situation like that.  For instance, if people produced a contract dated prior to that date which was unstamped the Revenue Commissioners could express very grave doubts and reluctance, whatever the reasons given for the non-stamping. There are certain other weapons open to them too.  In order to try to prevent any abuse the Minister should not impose what is in effect retrospective gift tax, the only justification really being the possibility that somebody might fiddle the date of a contract in order to get the benefit of this provision.  The Minister should be slow to risk the imposition of any retrospective tax.  The possibility of people producing a contract wrongly back-dated is not such as to justify the imposition of this retrospective taxation, which is what is being done here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to what Deputy Colley has said, I wonder would the Minister consider substituting &ldquo;binding and enforceable&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;complete&rdquo;.  As Deputy Colley said, the Revenue Commissioners are not without their resources. I do not know whether my suggestion would meet Deputy Colley's point fully but at least it would cover the case of a contract which was not perfected.  Take the <Col N="1411" /> case where you have a preliminary contract which would be an enforceable contract subject only to certain defects on requisition or something like that.  You would have an enforceable contract but it might not be completed by the ultimate conveyance. In that case it would be binding and enforceable.</P>
      <P>I would not make this suggestion to the Minister were it not for the fact that I think&mdash;I am accepting what Deputy Colley said; I have not checked it&mdash;the contract would need to be stamped.  As I say, the Revenue Commissioners have means of satisfying themselves as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the transaction.  In certain ways you could fake a complete contract just as you could fake the initial contract. I do not expect the Minister to give me an answer off the cuff to my suggestion. The word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; seems to me to imply that everything must be wrapped up with the final conveyance and with absolute finality.  I wonder whether a binding and enforceable contract is not what the Minister really has in mind.  Perhaps he could satisfy himself that there could be no evasion in that.</P>
      <P>The only argument I can see against the point I am making is the one the Minister made&mdash;and Deputy Colley has answered him to some extent&mdash;namely, that it might be easy to fake the earlier contract and it would not be so easy to fake the final contract.  On analysis, I wonder does that argument have the force it appears to have at first blush.  In any event I make that suggestion to the Minister.</P>

      <P>Some years ago death duties were increased from a ceiling of 40 per cent to 55 per cent.  I do not think anybody at that stage argued that gifts or inheritances that occurred after the change should pay tax at the lower rather than the higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Poor opposition, although Deputy Colley was there at the time.  It is exactly the same point. <Col N="1412" /> The point Deputy Colley is making is that people entered into certain arrangements not anticipating and not knowing what the gift tax would be and that, therefore, they should not have to pay the tax at all.  What I am saying is that if people made bequests when the top rate of death duty was 40 per cent&mdash;if there is validity in Deputy Colley's argument&mdash;such bequests when they became effective should not have carried the higher rate of 40 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the death would have occurred after the imposition of the new rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The bequest would have been made.  Supposing a person was unconscious on the day on which the Financial Resolution was passed here and died the following day, he would have paid at the new rate and would not have had an opportunity of making a change to conform to the change in the law.  If it was the other way about, and relief was being given, nobody would suggest for one moment that relief should not be given because the relief was not known to the person at the time of making the gift.  If it was going to move in one direction it would be logical that the argument would require that it be moved in the other as well.</P>
      <P>There are many ways in which a case could be made that binding contracts existed before the appropriate date.  For instance, the estate duty field disclosed from time to time cases where verbal promises were made on marriage which were not binding until they were put into the deed.  They would have been binding enough. They would have been enforceable under the Statute of Frauds if they were recited in a later deed.  If we had not this provision here, we might have a situation arising in which there could be recitals of agreements prior to 28th February, 1974, which would then get the exemption that Deputies opposite seem to suggest they should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are doing no more here than applying the usual rules relating to taxation.  If benefits accrue after the <Col N="1413" /> appropriate date, then they should bear the tax rate at the time the benefit accrues or when they enter into possession.  That is the appropriate tax.  If we do not do that, certainly we will provide plenty of temptations to engage in practices which would be wholly undesirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised a very neat point on the Statute of Frauds which a lawyer would appreciate. It can be simply added to by what I suggested&mdash;binding and enforceable and in writing.  This is the very reason why I said I did not expect the Minister&mdash;even though he was sympathetically inclined to the point&mdash;to accept the suggestion I made off the cuff because I can see that the executing contract would need to be reduced to certain forms to have sufficient evidence.  Take the simple case where there was an intention to convey, shall we say land.  Just for perfection of the title, the normal contract was written and executed. Then, merely to see that the title, conveyance and everything was in order, the rest of the procedures were adhered to&mdash;requisitions and so on. Finally, having investigated the title and made everything watertight from the legal point of view, there would be a final conveyance.  In that case the original contract would not be sufficient to escape under this section. I fail to see that it is really in any different position from the completed transaction.  It is really the word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; I am arguing with the Minister.  I am taking that absolutely separately from the Minister's point. Deputy Colley made two points.  I am on the second point he made with regard to retrospection.  In so far as there is that element of retrospection and what that word &ldquo;complete&rdquo; means, a little thought would enable the Minister to capture the type of thing about which we are talking.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I want to raise on the section.  First of all, might I refer the Minister to subsection (2), paragraph (b).

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To page 9, subsection (2), paragraph (b) beginning &ldquo;if the benefit is an annuity or other periodic payment...&rdquo;.  The effect of that paragraph is to provide a method by which annuities or other periodic payments not charged or secured by any property may be valued or measured for the purpose of assessing the tax by reference to the yield from the security of the Government which was issued last before the date in question for subscription in the State and is redeemable not less than ten years after the date of issue.  Where it says: &ldquo;The security of the Government which was issued last before that date...&rdquo; does that refer to the last National Loan which was redeemable not less than ten years after the date of issue, or could it refer to the last <i>tranche</i> of an older loan?  As the Minister knows, this is done from time to time; portion of an older loan is issued from time to time.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of section 6 (1) (c), the sum referred to in subsection (2) (b) shall be deemed not to be situate in the State at the date of the gift.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to deal with this, which defines for the purpose of section 6 (1) (c) what happens to the sum in question, I must refer to section 6 because the subsection refers to it.  Section 6 (1) seems to me to provide in (a) where the disponer is domiciled in the State or the law of the disposition is the law of the State then the whole of the gift is taxable.  Section 6 (1) (b) provides that if the disponer is domiciled in the State at the date of the gift or, in the case of a gift taken after death, was domiciled at the time of death, or where the proper law of the discretionary trust is the law of the State then the whole of the gift is taxable. Section 6 (1) (c) refers to: &ldquo;in any other case, so much of the property of which the gift consists as is situate in the State at the date of the gift.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am assuming that in interpreting section 5 (3) what we are being told is that the notional sum referred to in subsection (2) (b) is deemed to be situate outside the State only in any other case.  In other words, if it came within (a) or (b), if it were a gift where the disponer is domiciled in the State or the proper law of the disposition is that of the State, or if it were within the terms related to a discretionary trust, then it is deemed to be within the State.  It is only if those two cases are out that the notional sum is deemed to be situate outside the State.  Am I interpreting that correctly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a help but it does not solve the problem completely. However, the problem really arises on section 6 and I will leave it until I <Col N="1417" /> come to that.  At least it has disposed of that portion of it.</P>
      <P>May I refer the Minister now to section 5 (4)?  Will he explain what is involved there and explain the approach involved in subsection (4)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is axiomatic that a gift is the receipt of a benefit for which there is no consideration.  If full value is paid there is no gift.  Subsection (4) provides that if the donee is a relative of the disponer and gives the disponer a life interest in return for the gift, the life interest will not be a consideration for the purpose of deciding whether the transaction was a gift.  Of course, an allowance will be given under section 18 for the life interest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a relative, what is the effect of not treating the life interest as a consideration for the grant of the benefit?  I understood the Minister to say that under a later section credit would be given in respect of the life interest in assessing the value of the benefit for the purpose of tax.  If that is so, what is the effect of this subsection in providing that the life interest shall not be treated for the purpose of the section as consideration for the grant of the benefit or any part of it?  Does that mean that one has to show there was another consideration beside the life interest or else it is treated as a gift even though the life interest has a <Col N="1418" /> value?  Is that the effect of the subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understood the Deputy correctly, yes.  In other words, it will be a gift and it will not lose that status merely because a life interest is given to the donor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be at crosspurposes here.  I should like to be clear on what is being provided.  If we had an example it might help to clarify the matter and the Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  For instance, suppose A gives a house to his son, B, and the latter gives a life interest in the house to A, as I understand this subsection it means that in such a case the granting of the life interest to A is ignored and unless it can be shown that B gave a consideration other than the life interest it will be treated as a gift and taxed accordingly.  I also understand from what the Minister said earlier that if that happens in assessing the property for the purpose of tax credit would be given for the value of the life interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that approach may not be the correct one. If the value of the property is £30,000 and the value of the life interest is £10,000, in the absence of any other consideration would it not be more correct to say that the value of the property should be taxed on a figure of £20,000?  It appears the subsection is saying if there is a life interest created that is to be ignored for the purpose of assessing whether there is a liability for this tax, which is not quite the same as saying it is to be taken into account and valued accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 will be the section that will allow the life interest to be taken into account.  What happens if a property is given subject to a life interest is that the whole property is not given, as it were.  A part of it is withheld, that part which is occupied or used for the life interest, for the gift, in fact, is the net.  Just because a life interest is given you do not say that is a consideration and, <Col N="1419" /> therefore it is not a gift and it is not liable to tax.  There is an element of gift and it is the difference between the full value and the life interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I am at.  Is that not the correct approach, to say the value of the gift if given absolutely would be so much, but the value of the life interest which is retained is so much, therefore the net value of the gift is the difference? That would seem to me to be a straightforward approach to it, but what this subsection appears to be saying is, the fact that there is a life interest is not to be treated as if there were consideration.  It does not say part consideration or anything else. In other words, do you really need this subsection at all?  Why not just assess it on the basis of the value of the gift, value of the life interest retained, and whatever the net difference is?  It seems there is a certain unnecessary complication being introduced by this subsection, and even if you did not have the subsection at all the situation would be adequately covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is not in itself imposing a charge.  It is simply describing what the gift is, or it is simply providing that if the life interest exists that that would not be regarded as a consideration.  Other sections have dealt with the actual charge, but the two taken together produce the net position which both Deputy Colley and I seem to want.</P>

      <P>This is one of the complexities of this kind of legislation, and I approach this with a feeling of sympathy for the Minister and his advisers in dealing with it.  Deputy Colley started by making the point about a relative.  Would I be right in seeing it this way, that, if there are relatives involved&mdash;father and son say &mdash;then what the Minister is saying is that a gift between the relatives will be treated as a gift without reference to the life interest and that afterwards section 18 will operate to bring some relief?  Am I right in thinking that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case of a relative.  Deputy Colley threw out the intriguing point which I do not think he followed up, what happens in the case of a non-relative? The Minister disposed of the improbability. What is a relative?  Would a mistress be a relative for instance? This is not altogether an improbable case.  If, for instance, A were to give a gift of the property to B, the relationship being as I postulated, you are not involved with a relative.  The very fact that you say that the life interest is not to be a consideration in the case of the relative suggests that it is a consideration in all other cases.  My question is, therefore, in the case of the gift to the lady would the life interest be a consideration in part?  It would not be a consideration in whole.</P>
      <P>I have been trying to think of a plausible case, not, perhaps, in this country but certainly not very far away from us.  Again, there may be another section like section 18 that covers the point I am making, but the Minister says, this is a descriptive and, perhaps, an unnecessary subsection; if it was not necessary and it does make a distinction between a relative and a non-relative, the consequences of that need examination.  I am not very sure of my ground, I must admit, in regard to the case I have stated.  There may be some other section analogous to section 18 that would give the Minister the answer to the case I have given.  Nevertheless, that kind of thing can occur.</P>

      <P>You could have collusion between people who are close to one another.  I accept there can also be collusion between strangers, but it is less likely to occur.

      <P>If the interest was such that the beneficiary does not get the whole income from property, only that slice of the property which produces the income he gets is taken into account.  Subsection 5 describes how the slice is to be calculated. Whatever fraction of the income the beneficiary gets, the same fraction of the capital is the slice.  Thus if a disponer grants property to a absolutely, subject to and charged an annuity of £X to B for life, B is taxed on the slice of the property which produced £X per annum and A is taxed on the balance of the property. In taxing B allowance is made for the fact that he gets less than an absolute interest.  When B dies A is taxed on the slice under section 28.</P>

      <P>If the appropriate part referred to in this subsection were, for example, one-fifth, the subsection appears to state towards the end of it that the gift shall be deemed to consist of one-fifth part of each and every item of property comprised in the entire property.  As the Minister said, in this case we are dealing with where the gift is charged on or entitled to be charged on only part of the property.  If that is so, why is there this provision to the effect that the gift shall be deemed to consist of the appropriate part, whatever proportion it is, of each and every item of property comprised in the entire property?

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In pages 10 and 11, to delete subsection (3) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection (1), no part of the property of which a <Col N="1423" /> gift consists shall be a taxable gift where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the gift is taken prior to the 1st day of April, 1975; and</P>
    <P>(b) the disponer in relation to the gift dies prior to that date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Section 6, subsection (3), and the proviso to section 9 of the Bill, as initiated, were inserted so that property which under the old law bore estate duty as a gift made within five years before the death of a person dying before 1st April, 1975, would not also be charged to or aggregated for capital acquisitions tax.  The provisions, as originally inserted in the Bill, have turned out to be inadequate. For instance, if a man made a settlement in 1971 under which a person took a gift out of income in 1974, both taxes would be payable if the man died before 1st April, 1975.  There was never any such intention.  The provision has been rewritten, therefore, and that is why we are introducing these amendments.</P>
    <P>The basis of the amendment to section 6 is that where the disponer died while death duties were still in force, so that any disposition he made in his lifetime would have been at risk for the five-year gift <i>inter vivos</i> period or the earlier three-year period, which applied before the 1965 Finance Act, there appears to be a good case for saying that gifts taken before the cut-off date for death duties should be ignored.  They either pay estate duty or escape such payment because the death duty system did not provide for tax on them.  In the case of a donor who dies on or after the 1st April, 1975, the death duty risk was gone and the gift will be a taxable gift.  Are we taking amendment No. 15 with this amendment?</P>

      <P>At first glance I must say the amendment looks better than the draft of the Bill but I am not quite clear, and I would like to be, exactly what is being achieved here. The provision in the Bill, reference to <Col N="1424" /> the 28th February, 1974, is being deleted and the reference to the Estate Duty Acts is being deleted.  I assume that the reason for the deletion of the reference to the estate duty legislation is that this would apply automatically in the case of a death occurring before the 1st April, 1975.  I am not quite sure that the Minister has told us exactly what the effect of this amendment is as compared with what would have been the situation under the Bill as originally drafted.  If one looks at the provision in the Bill there is a reference to where the disponer died after 28th February, 1974, and before the 1st April, 1975, and there is an exclusion then of a gift taken during that period, or part of it, if it were liable to death duty.  Is the Minister now providing that whether such a gift was liable to death duty or not it will not now be liable to either gift or inheritance tax?  Is that the effect of this amendment?</P>

      <P>I am not objecting to that.  I am trying to be quite clear as to why that should be done.  As I understood what the Minister said, he is trying to avoid a double liability, that is, a liability both to death duty and to inheritance tax.  But the remedy for avoiding liability for double taxation seems to be to exempt it from taxation altogether.  Is this the only way this problem can be solved, or should such gifts, if they would have been liable under the death duty code, now be exempt? That seems to be the effect of the amendment.</P>

      <P>Proper law in relation to a disposition means the law of the territory whose laws govern the construction of the instrument and the rights and obligations arising out of the disposition.  The term originates in the law of contract where the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; indicates the law which the parties must be taken to have intended to apply or to have selected to govern the contract.  The proper law of a will is normally the law of the testator's domicile but a foreign law may apply to foreign immovables while unsold even though they are subject to the trusts of a will of a testator domiciled in this country. For those who want to pursue the matter further the reference can be found in: <i>Philipson-Stow v. I.R.C.,</i> 1961, A.C. 727.  The law of the country of the situation of the property or the <i>lex situs</i> applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This is true but I think the important thing for the purpose of this section is that the subsection may have to act retrospectively in this sense that it is quite possible that the Revenue problem that could arise here could finally only be decided subsequent to a case involving a judicial decision not in a Revenue case and that that would rule in the section.  You could have a case where something in the nature of a contract is involved and where it would be necessary to have the court decide on that contract <i>per se</i> as to what law governed it and only then would the Revenue authorities be in a position to apply the subsection or paragraph in question.</P>
      <P>Although he may not have intended it, the Minister is covering&mdash;quite rightly&mdash;such an eventuality.  He is not only covering <i>prima facie</i> cases but cases which are already determined and where it can be said unequivocally or agreed for Revenue purposes that it is this law that governs the position. The Revenue might have to wait in certain circumstances until that question were judicially decided in proceedings that had nothing to do with Revenue.  Possibly this is an indirect way of appeal that might be invoked. Does the Minister understand?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I am sure there is an obvious reason for this but I have not seen it yet and, perhaps, the Minister will tell me.  Subsection (2) of section 6 provides that for the purposes of subsection (1) (c) a right to the proceeds of sale of property shall be deemed to be situate in the State and so on.  Subsection (3) of section 5 provides for this notional sum, which we referred to earlier being deemed not to be situate in the State.  What is the reason for the difference in approach in these two?  I know in each case it is just a question of their being deemed to be either situate in or situate outside the State and that can be altered depending on the circumstances, but why the difference in approach?</P>

      <P>The structure of the Bill means that sections 5 and 6 have to be read together.  The word &ldquo;gift&rdquo; is not explicitly defined, but in subsection (1) of section 5 &ldquo;he <Col N="1429" /> shall be deemed to take a gift&rdquo; is an implicit definition of a gift.  That stands qualified and expanded by the following subsections in section 5.  In section 6 &ldquo;taxable gift&rdquo; is defined. The word &ldquo;taxable&rdquo; is descriptive of the person and the transaction charged rather than the substance of the gift.  The two sections have to be construed as descriptive of the gift until we come to the other sections. Does the Minister wish to make any comment about the two sections taken as a whole?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously one has to measure what benefit the parties receive so that their respective tax liabilities may be determined.  Therefore, where a gift is taken in common by two or more persons, unless the gift otherwise says, it is to be assumed that they take them in equal shares, that being the fairest way of dividing the gift and the liability.  In some cases this could operate to relieve liability to tax and in other cases liability could arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between a tenancy in common and a joint tenancy is essentially the right survivorship.  If a gift is given jointly to two people, the one who survives gets the whole gift.  If it is a tenancy in common it is severable&mdash;I do not want to go into technicalities of when it is not&mdash;and it is equitable to tax <Col N="1430" /> each of them because in a sense the property is being divided into two moieties.  The two individual halves can be separated.</P>
      <P>The Minister says it would be more equitable to tax each part straightaway but what happens when the succession falls in?  Each half of the gift has already been taxed, but when succession falls in does it mean that it is deemed to be another gift?  Leaving out exemptions, if two brothers inherit property jointly, or receive a gift jointly, then there is a tax notionally. If they were not brothers there would be tax paid on the whole gift by each of them.  When the succession of the other part has fallen in, there will be a further tax payable, say, in the nature of an inheritance tax on the moiety.  Is that what the Minister intends?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I agree.  I purposely excepted that, but if they do not, there is the automatic inheritance. As long as it is not severed, there is the contingent right of reversion.

      <P>With brief reference to the Schedules, can I pose this question: suppose a disponer has twin sons and he donates&mdash;a somewhat similar situation would arise on a succession&mdash;the property to them jointly.  There are certain exceptions on this joint tenancy.  On the death of one, the survivor takes the whole but becomes taxable as a brother now.  He is in a much less advantageous position.  Is that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that would defeat the benefits that a parent should have in the giving?  It seems hard that the case of two brothers, or a brother and a sister, where there is a joint tenancy and where the gift is given to them, would be exempt and when the survivorship happens of the one gift as a joint tenancy, a higher rate of tax will apply afterwards.  The Minister can see no such anomalies occur if the gift is made in common: then the gift would be in that generation and the matter would be between brother and sister or brother and brother afterwards.  It would be the natural thing in matters like this and that is why I emphasised the case of twins.</P>

      <Col N="1432" /> SECTION 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection 1 (b), line 21, to delete &ldquo;the disposition was made&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;the date of the disposition was&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This change is made to secure the benefit of the definition in section 2 of &ldquo;date of the disposition&rdquo;, in case paragraph (b) gave rise to doubt as to whether the disposition was made before or on or after 1st April, 1975. Elsewhere in the Bill, for example, sections 3 (1) (c) and 22 (b) (ii), the formula used is &ldquo;where the date of the disposition is on or after 1st April, 1975&rdquo;.  This formula enables one to avail of the definition of &ldquo;date of the disposition&rdquo; in section 2 (1) and removes any doubt about when the disposition was made.</P>
      <P>The disposition may comprise a number of acts, including a binding promise, a formal transfer to trustees, payments by the trustees, an assent to vesting in a beneficiary, a beneficiary taking by default on the act of disclaimer by another, associated operations or reciprocal arrangements, and so forth.  Having identified the true disponer, it may be necessary to identify the final act by which he provided, or is deemed to have provided, or bound himself to provide, the property.</P>
      <P>What is taxable as a gift or inheritance taken under sections 5 and 11 is the act of becoming beneficially entitled in possession to a benefit without paying for it.  Thus, if under a settlement of 1970, a life tenant becomes beneficially entitled in possession immediately, he is deemed then to have taken a gift.  He has now a vested interest in possession in the trust funds.  The later &ldquo;disposition&rdquo; by the trustee, which is by the definition of &ldquo;disponer&rdquo;, a disposition by the settlor, when the trustee pays over income to the life tenant, gives rise to a benefit to the life tenant for which the latter pays full consideration by giving up his vested right to receive that income and no separate gift arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> In the case of a binding covenant, say, in 1968, to pay £500 per annum, the payment in, say, 1975 of the £500 is one of the various acts in the disponer's disposition, but the date of the disposition would be 1968&mdash;the date of the act by which the disponer bound himself to provide the property&mdash;and the date of the gift would be the same, the donee then having become beneficially entitled in possession to the benefit, being the yearly income covenanted to him&mdash;a &ldquo;limited interest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In view of the wide definition of &ldquo;disposition&rdquo;, the actual payment, say in 1975, is also a disposition, but it would be the view of the commissioners that the taking of that payment, like the taking of income by the life tenant mentioned above would be for full consideration in money or money's worth: the beneficiary could have sued on the original promise by releasing the disponer <i>pro tanto</i> from his promise, for example.  &ldquo;You pay me this year's payment and I release you from your promise to pay it,&rdquo; and he gives full consideration.</P>

One point I am concerned with is the reference in subsection (2) to dispositions connected in the manner described in subsection (1).

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section deals with the position where several gifts are made by successive donors to provide tax avoidance by gift-splitting. The gift is treated as having been made by the person who provided the property to the person who ultimately benefits.  Relief is being provided in genuine cases.  For example, A gives property to B, who gives it to C.  This type of dealing would normally be for the purpose of tax avoidance because a person would not usually make a gift to a person who is himself making gifts to others, though it can happen and allowance is made for this possibility in subsection (2).</P>
      <P>One possible form this could take would be where A, B and C would be people of great property.  A owns £300,000, gives half of it to his wife B, and the other half to his son C. B then gives her £150,000, derived from A, to C.  Without section 8 it could be claimed that there are two gifts here each of which is of £150,000 and no tax would be payable under the scale of rates in Table I in the Second Schedule.  Section 8 looks at the reality which is that A has given £300,000 to C, and the section imposes tax accordingly.  The section does not apply where the gifts are not made within three years of one another, nor does it apply when it can be shown that the first gift was not made with a view to making the second gift possible.  The references to three years after the first gift and to recoupment are included because in the second example I have given B could first borrow £150,000 and give it to C and A could afterwards pay off B's loan and give a second £150,000 to C.</P>
      <P>In the second example given, if A dies within two years after giving £150,000 to B and £150,000 to C, C's taking of £300,000 will be an inheritance instead of a gift.  I trust that these illustrations of ingenious activities will be of assistance.</P>

      <P>All I can say is that the Revenue Commissioners have my sympathy.  I am aware of the type of ingenuity they have to defeat. However, I believe there are still some honest people so for the moment <Col N="1435" /> I shall deal with the question from a straightforward point of view.</P>
      <P>I am not happy regarding the effect of subsection (2) in disconnecting the gifts.  This subsection reads:</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply in the case of any disposition (in this subsection referred to as the first-mentioned disposition) in so far as no other disposition, which was connected in the manner described in subsection (1) with such first-mentioned disposition was made with a view to enabling or facilitating the making of the first-mentioned disposition or the recoupment in any manner of the cost thereof.</P>
      <P>That does not seem to overcome a difficulty that I see here.  I see also the Minister's difficulty, but a serious anomaly could arise from the use of the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; before &ldquo;gift&rdquo; without identifying the subsequent gifts with the first one.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a second donee taking a gift, what in effect is meant is that if a father gives a gift to his son and the son gives a gift to somebody else&mdash;these are totally unrelated transactions&mdash;the second gift can be traced back to the gift of the father.  Both parties may be <i>sui juris</i>.  Is this not going too far? There could be the case of a son who by his own efforts has acquired capital before he receives the first gift, but on the wording of this section if he were to give that independent property to a third party that second gift could be traced back to the original gift from the father.  Although there is merit in the Minister wanting to block a loophole, he has written in something here that is too wide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation I am talking of can only be justified on the assumption that the second gift was made possible by the first gift, but this might be very far from the truth. How many cases are there, for instance, where a father living to 60 years or more has a son of, say, 40, who during 20 years or so has <Col N="1436" /> ploughed his own furrow?  In law the son is <i>sui juris</i>.  He, in turn may give that property to his son.  If within the period specified the father makes a gift to his son's son, the transactions are interlinked according to this section. Is it not going too far to imply that everything will be in perpetual succession and that individual accumulation or creation of wealth is virtually ruled out?  I can see the difficulty of identification but the Minister, very appropriately, shows the sum of money.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) provides for the circumstances the Deputy describes.  We do not wish to tax unconnected gifts.  By virtue of subsection (2) they would not be taxed if they were unconnected, but such cases will be few and far between. The Revenue Commissioners will raise a query in the event of identifying gifts between related persons, but it will be open to a person within the terms of this subsection to disprove the assumption that there were connections.  The kind of people we are dealing with here are not people of small means or of incapacity to call on the aid of skilled people. We are not imposing any undue burden on people who are in the fortunate circumstances of being within the liability to tax because the liability arises when something is obtained for nothing and this something will be in the £150,000 plus range in order to be liable to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In this respect I wish the Minister would forgo his habit of appealing to a point such as he has just made.  We understand the force of that <i>delenda est</i> of the Minister. The difficulty here is in relation to the words &ldquo;which was connected in the manner described in subsection (1)&rdquo;.  The manner described in subsection (1) is unequivocal and leaves no discretion in so far as no other disposition, which was connected in the manner described in subsection (1) with such first-mentioned disposition was made with a view to enabling or facilitating the making of the first-mentioned disposition or the recoupment in any manner of the cost thereof. <Col N="1437" /> Here I think the Minister is in difficulty.  I sympathise with the Minister and I will go even further than the Minister did.  This is a case where the Revenue Commissioners should have discretion.  It is the type of case that can only be decided, as the Minister said, by a just discretion.  I have on previous Bills pleaded this point. What I fear here is that we are removing discretion from the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Minister insists on keeping subsection (1), I would far prefer to see subsection (2) couched in very wide terms of discretion to the Revenue Commissioners to decide whether (a) the transactions were <i>bona fide</i> and (b) whether they were connected or could be fairly considered to be connected in the case the Minister is seeking to cover.  As things stand, even as subsection (2) is drafted, I feel the situation I have outlined can occur and, instead of having discretion, the Revenue Commissioners will have their hands tied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty in this is like that of Deputy de Valera though I think mine goes further.  I said earlier that it seems to me subsection (2) refers to dispositions connected in the manner described in subsection (1), but I cannot see the connection described in subsection (1).  That subsection refers to a disposition made by a disponer within a certain time and the donee makes a disposition under which a second donee takes a gift and he may, perhaps, make another disposition under which a third donee takes a gift, and so on.  There is no connection so described in that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the connection: A gives to B, B to C, C to D and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is all very tenuous.  It is not illustrated in the example the Minister gave.  Deputy de Valera says it is money which is, of course, very hard to identify.  The Minister's example gave the same figures passing on as if it were the same gift being handed on.  But that is not what the subsection says.  It <Col N="1438" /> seems to me to say that if A gives a gift to B, who is, we will say, a son of his and B happens to give a gift to C who, in the example given by Deputy de Valera earlier, is the son's mistress and she in turn happens to give a gift&mdash;these can be quite different gifts varying in size&mdash;to her neighbour's daughter, all of these, according to subsection (1), connect when really there is no connection at all.  I do not think describing all these in subsection (2) as connected in the manner described in subsection (1) really meets the case at all.  I know what the Minister's difficulty is but I do not think he is solving it in subsection (1) because it is so wide and so imprecise that I imagine it will probably turn out to be unenforceable. It can, of course, have quite serious consequences, too, because by deeming certain gifts given by somebody, who did not, in fact, give them, that could have a substantial effect on the rate of tax or on the level of tax.  I think, therefore, it is important it should be clearly spelled out as to what exactly is being done in this subsection.  I do not think the present wording is workable because it is so wide.  This is an example of the kind of difficulty arising&mdash;only one of the difficulties; there are many others&mdash; because the Minister has not adopted the approach we recommended on Second Stage, namely, that in the case of gifts the liability for tax should be assessed on the basis of the gifts received by one donee, irrespective of the source from which he receives them, and all gifts should be accumulated and the rate of tax increased as they accumulate.  That would get over all these difficulties here.  It would not matter what connections or disconnections there were because one would be taxing the person on the gifts he receives, which is really what this is all about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  You could allow for relief in the case of father and son or father and daughter and you would be at least applying the tax to the person.  The more he <Col N="1439" /> received from whatever source the more he would be paying.  Under the arrangement here a person could be paying a substantial amount of tax on a much smaller gift than his next door neighbour might be paying on a much larger gift.  The point at issue here is this supposed connection in transactions in which there is no connection at all or the only connection being that one person made a gift to another.  It is certainly conceivable that you could have a person deemed under this subsection to have received a gift from somebody else whom he did not know and had never heard of.  That is very possible.  The Minister will, I think, accept that because of the way the subsection is worded.  I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the wording and the general approach to this.  I am quite certain the subsection is not workable because it is so wide.</P>
      <P>There are some other matters that arise to which the Minister referred when he was explaining the section. He referred to gifts taking place within a period of three years.  The section says within a period commencing three years before and ending three years after and so it seems to me to be for all practical purposes a period of six years.  Subsequently the section goes on to refer to a second donee making a disposition within the same period.  Is the same period there referring to the six years or to the three years after the first gift was made?  It is not clear to me.  I think it is referring to the six-year period, but that is not absolutely clear.  I wonder if the Minister could throw any light on what the position would have been in the kind of case envisaged here under the death duty system.</P>

We could take this mythical group of A, B, C, D and E. E might never have heard of A.

Effectively that is what the section is trying to do.  I do not think the section is doing it and I <Col N="1442" /> strongly urge the Minister to re-examine the wording in the light of the objective, which is not contested on this side of the House, to see if it cannot be more effectively achieved by a different approach in the wording.</P>

The difficulty is that, under the Bill as drafted, the donor is very important for determining the liability of the donee.  My suggestion is that the donor should be irrelevant except for the purpose of giving an additional allowance if it is within a certain degree of consanguinity.  The real test should be that one donee receives gifts from any source.  They are accumulated and taxed according as he gets more and more.</P>

      <P>The proviso in section <Col N="1444" /> 9, lines 40 to 47, is related to the estate duty provisions.  It was inserted so that property which bore estate duty under the old law as a gift made within five years before the death of a person, dying before the 1st April, 1975, would not be charged to or aggregated for the purposes of capital acquisitions tax.  Our further study convinced us that the original draft was not adequate.  For instance, if a man made a settlement in 1971 under which a person took a gift out of income in 1974, both taxes would be payable if the man died before the 1st April, 1975.  Therefore, the provision has been rewritten and, accordingly, these amendments introduced. This is a case of relief.  The proviso in section 9 is no longer necessary since the gifts covered by that proviso are no longer taxable gifts because of the amendment we have already made to section 6.</P>

      <P>I should like to know the reason behind the provision here for aggregation or taking into account any gift made after the 28th February, 1969, and prior to the 28th February, 1974, not for the purpose of making it liable to tax but, effectively, by taking it into account one can alter the rate of tax being charged.  On the face of it, the five-year period would appear to be related to the death duty provision of a gift made more than five years before death not being deemed to be liable to death duty in respect of the estate of the deceased.  But I should like confirmation that that is the reason why the five-year period is chosen.  Also, I am not convinced at present that the effect of aggregating gifts arising between February, 1969, and February, 1974, is not, in practice, producing retrospection since gifts made during that period can substantially affect the liability to tax arising under this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are including in the tax base gifts taken by a donee <Col N="1445" /> in the five years prior to the 28th February, 1974.  These gifts will not themselves be liable to tax, as Deputy Colley acknowledges, but they are to be taken into account in order to determine the rate of tax payable on gifts taken on or after the 28th February, 1974, and inheritances after the 1st April, 1975.  However, gifts which are deemed by the Acts relating to estate duty to pass on the disponer's death will not be aggregated where the disponer dies on or after the 28th February, 1969, and before the 1st April, 1975.</P>
      <P>The section deals with gifts not inheritances taken on or after the 28th February, 1969 and before the 28th February, 1974.  These gifts will have to be disclosed and valued as if they were liable to tax but they will not bear tax themselves.  They will be taken into account in arriving at the rate of tax payable on gifts and inheritances which are liable to tax. Thus, if a donee gets a gift of £20,000 in March, 1973 and another gift of £30,000 in May, 1975 no tax would be charged on the £20,000 but tax would be charged on the £30,000.  If the person was a brother, the tax would be £4,445.  If the £20,000 was not aggregated for the purpose of measuring the tax, the tax on the £30,000 would be £2,085.  If the disponer died before the 1st April, 1975 and the gift was within the charge to estate duty, it would not be aggregated for the purpose of capital acquisitions tax.</P>
      <P>The purpose of including the earlier gifts for fixing the rate of tax is to protect the tax base.  If we did not do so, very little tax would be paid for some time to come.  Also, if we did not have this provision it would be treating taxpayers differently. Those who were lucky enough to get gifts before a fixed date would not have them brought into account in determining what would be their tax in the future, whereas people who had not anticipated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, the event would be paying a higher rate of tax on gifts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no retrospection at all here.  One is simply looking at the reality of what people have received from donors.  If we had no cut-off point we would have to go back to the date of birth of every living person and maybe further still &mdash;because people might have received gifts before they were born&mdash;but that would be administratively difficult, to say the least, and would be an undue interference.  It is proper that we should go back for some period to try to get a larger measure of equity in the system than we would have if we did not look at what has been happening over the past five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this perspective on it.  As far as the principle, the public and all accepted codes of taxation and parliamentary morality are concerned, whatever the speculation about capital taxation the document regarding capital taxation was produced on and dated 28th February, 1974.  That is the base date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as inheritance is concerned I can see there is a hiatus of five years in which a group might escape so far as a death is concerned.  In the case of a death after the operative date one would go back five years from the <Col N="1447" /> death if the five years went anterior to 28th February, 1974.  I can understand that argument and probably would subscribe to it but what the Minister appears to be doing is to be assuming a death and he has no right to do that.</P>
    <P>There was no gift tax in force prior to the coming into effect of this legislation. If there was no gift tax in force before 28th February, 1974, I do not see why a gift tax should be contemplated in law except in so far as it applies in the extension of the death duty code.  I wonder if I am making myself clear to the Minister?</P>
    <P>I accept in the case of the death duty code that if there was a death where a benefit could accrue then by all means we could go anterior to 28th February but it seems the Minister is assuming a death here and I do not think that it is legitimate.  Apart from that point I do not quite follow the Minister's argument about a base and the distinction between aggregating for the rate of taxation and the gift being taxable.  I should like clarification on this.</P>
    <P>On the more general grounds, I put it to the Minister that there was no such thing known to our law as a gift tax anterior to 28th February, 1974.  There should not be such a provision unless we introduce what is positively retrospective legislation of the most objectionable type.  On that ground I am suspicious of the section.  I freely concede I may not have completely understood it because I do not follow the Minister's argument and I will have to study it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the figures I gave showed exactly the consequences and I illustrated it with the case of a donee receiving a gift of £20,000 in March, 1973, and another gift of £30,000 in May, 1975.  No tax is charged on the £20,000 but the tax on the £30,000 would be at a rate higher than it would otherwise be because we are aggregating the two gifts.</P>

      <P>When changes occur in tax law there is something to be said for phasing them in.  This is a phasing-in process.  It involves an element of concession as far as the past is concerned.  No tax has been levied on the past gift but the rate for the current gift is slightly higher than it would be if it were an unconnected gift of £30,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
