      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of December, 1975, for grants-in-aid of an tÚda-rás um Ard-Oideachas, certain Higher Education Institutions and Services and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to enable the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, which has recently been established and which held its first meeting on 19th June, to begin its work by providing it with office accommodation, staff and essential facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I am not asking the House to provide more than a token sum of £10 in this respect.  The total sum which may be necessary in addition to the token Estimate will be found within the provision which has already been made in Vote 33 for Higher Education. All the subheads in this vote are, however, grants-in-aid, and it is necessary to have the agreement of the House before money can be made available under a new grant-in-aid subhead.  What is now proposed is that a subhead, B.3&mdash;National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin&mdash; Current Expenditure&mdash;be opened in this Vote with a provision of £50,000, and that a subhead B.1&mdash;National Institute for Higher Education.  Lim-erick&mdash;Current Expenditure&mdash;be reduced by a corresponding sum taking account of the token provision.</P>
    <P>The National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, and the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, will, as I have said on other occasions in discussing the Government's decision of 13th December, 1974, be the crowning institutions in what is known as the integrated sector of higher education.  The governing bodies of the two institutions have been established and have held their first meetings.  Each has elected a chairman and nominated ten of its members to serve on the reconstituted National Council for Educational Awards.  I met both governing bodies together on the occasion of their first meeting and I have recently, as part of the continuing consultation and exchange of views, which I have been having with higher education interests, had a meeting with a deputation from the governing body of NIHE, Dublin, whose chairman and members are most anxious to begin their work.</P>
    <P>In my address to the new governing bodies on 19th June, I stressed the central role which the institutes are to play in higher education.  That role, as envisaged by the Government is such that the governing bodies must work in close liaison with each other and with other education institutions within the system.  Indeed, this was one of the reasons why I thought it <Col N="574" /> desirable that it be arranged that the two bodies should meet together at the very beginning of their work.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the need for close liaison between the two NIHEs and between the NIHEs and other educational institutions.  In that connection I have in mind especially the regional technical colleges.  I emphasise this need for close liaison &mdash;and this involves careful planning and co-ordination of activities, not simply polite exchange of views and expression of good will&mdash;so that the students may derive the maximum benefit possible from the system which we are providing.</P>
    <P>It is not that we are pursuing rationalisation for the sake of rationalisation. We are, of course, committed to endeavouring to ensure that we obtain the best return educationally, and without any dilution of quality in that education, from the considerable resources which we must expend on the provision of higher education.  The students of the regional technical colleges, for example, will, as I said in my address to the governing bodies of the NIHEs, and I quote:</P>
    <P>... expect and rightly demand that programmes will be so planned and structured that the possibility of transfer at appropriate levels between regional technical colleges and between regional technical colleges and NIHEs, will be a reality and a smooth process once a student has attained the appropriate standard at a particular level and has the motivation and capacity to move to a higher level.</P>
    <P>To this end the governing bodies of the NIHEs must ensure that where students of a regional technical college have to transfer from their home college to pursue courses at a higher level in a NIHE, the necessary places, programmes of study and facilities will be available to them. The regional technical colleges have been given a strong representation on the NIHE governing bodies and in turn, these governing bodies, by whom two-thirds of the members of the reconstituted NCEA have already <Col N="575" /> been nominated from among their members, have included among their nominees six principals of regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>We have no desire to see developed a rigid separation of institutions with consequential duplication of courses. One of the basic purposes of the Government's plan is to make possible in the interest of students mobility and transfer between all educational institutions.  The whole purpose of this plan would be defeated if the NIHE, Dublin, one of the central institutions in the sector and the NIHE, Limerick, were to develop independently of each other and without regard to the needs of the regional technical colleges.  I feel sure that with the regional technical colleges strongly represented on the governing bodies of the NIHEs and in the reconstituted NCEA we will see the end of fragmentation and unco-ordinated effort.</P>
    <P>The change to a situation where institutions will be inter-related and their activities co-ordinated, while retaining that measure of freedom and flexibility which will enable each institution to make its full and vital contribution to our overall educational provision, without sacrificing its own individual identity or being deprived of the opportunity to make its own unique contribution to that provision, is not being left to chance.  The NCEA will be reconstituted to, and I quote the words used in the Government's decision:</P>
    <P>plan and co-ordinate courses and to validate and award non-degree third-level qualifications in the NIHEs, Dublin and Limerick, and in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>This planning and co-ordinating function is calculated to ensure that no institution within the integrated sector of higher education, be it large or small, will be tempted to chart its own course of development independently of other institutions.</P>
    <P>The NIHE Limerick has been successfully established.  The chairman and members of the newly established governing body of the NIHE, Dublin, <Col N="576" /> are most anxious and eager to undertake the challenging task of making the NIHE Dublin a reality.  This Supplementary Estimate is being introduced to enable them to undertake that task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  The Minister said it is necessary to get the governing body of the NIHE in Dublin under way.  My welcome is qualified by the method of financing the governing body, however.  I regret that the finances are to be provided by transferring some of the money allotted under subheads B1 and B2 of the Estimate: it is a matter of switching money from Limerick to Dublin and I very much regret that the Minister could not have seen his way to provide new and extra money for the governing body of the NIHE, Dublin. It is a question of robbing Peter in Limerick to pay Paul in Dublin and it seems to argue that Limerick had been getting too much money.  I should like to ask the Minister, and I will give way to him now if he can answer me immediately, were the NIHE governing body in Limerick consulted about this transfer, and, if so, did they agree to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Deputy's approach to the method of financing, I would prefer to wait and reply to the whole debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>One aspect of it which is important is that it may give the idea that moneys voted for institutions outside Dublin are not quite so sacrosanct as money voted for Dublin.  This would be an unfortunate idea to get around.  Dublin people who were involved in third level non-university education had been complaining that the expenditure on the regional technical colleges had impoverished the Dublin colleges.  This looks very much as if the Minister is making a raid on Limerick to provide Dublin with some money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke about co-ordination of activities and close liaison, and this kind of bear's hug, this close liaison between Dublin and Limerick might not be the kind of thing Limerick would appreciate if it means taking money out of their pockets <Col N="577" /> there.  The Minister referred in general terms to Government proposals on third level education in Dublin and whether the House would welcome this £50,000 Supplementary Estimate if it were quite sure what kind of institution this governing body will be governing.  In the proposals/decisions of 16th December last, the relevant paragraph referring to the Dublin NIHE stated:</P>
    <P>The National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin, can be a recognised college of either of the Dublin universities with the capacity to evolve into a constituent college of one or other of the Dublin universities and become an autonomous degree-awarding institution.</P>
    <P>Will the governing body for which this money is being provided be the governing body of a recognised college of the University of Dublin or of the new university which will replace UCD or will it in fact be the governing body of an autonomous degree-awarding institution?  Already, the University of Dublin has agreed to confer degrees, and an arrangement has been made to this effect, on graduates of certain departments in the Bolton Street and Kevin Street colleges which will form the basis of the new institute with the College of Commerce, Rathmines, and the domestic science school.</P>
    <P>It is as well to reiterate what the Fianna Fáil policy with regard to the third level institution was.  It was clearly and specifically stated that the NCEA, which took a slight hammering and has now been reconstituted, was to be as far as Fianna Fáil were concerned the certificate-, diploma-and degree-awarding council and that in this there was a comprehensiveness which did not exist in the sphere of the degree-awarding body that has been established in Britain for this purpose.  We thought that there was a greater comprehensive element in this than in the decisions that the Minister and the Government made.  We thought that it would be a logical kind of thing and we thought what the Minister has referred to this morning, the close link with the regional <Col N="578" /> technical colleges, would be easier in that kind of context, in the context of the award of certificate, diploma and degree being confined to the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how introducing the university element into it makes it more comprehensive or more satisfactory. I cannot see how the university degree makes an honest woman out of the Institute of Higher Education by awarding degrees to certain students while the National Council for Educational Awards will be awarding diplomas and certificates to other students.  There is disharmony in that kind of arrangement.  I thought it as well to state unequivocally that the Fianna Fáil Party were more than anxious that this arrangement whereby the NCEA would deal with the third level non-degree in all its phases was the better one.  It is one that has been admired by people outside the country. The idea behind it was praised by people involved in similar fields outside the country.</P>
    <P>The argument was made that this would make this link with the universities more socially acceptable, and so on.  There was a lot of talk about this which did not make much sense to me because, as is well known to anybody who knows about the work of the institution which will form the base of the new National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin, their achievement has been their own award.  They have succeeded in achieving for themselves a prestige that will not be added to by any link with the university.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that there should be a strict dichotomy between the two types of education.  I am not admitting, as I have said already, that the conferring of degrees on certain students of these institutes by the universities makes for greater prestige or improves the situation in any way.  I am a little disappointed that there was no clarification in what the Minister said about this whole business.  In the kind of arrangement which has been the policy of this side of the House there can be a greater link between the RTCs and the National Institutes; there can be better vertical mobility right to degree level and there will be no interference <Col N="579" /> whatsoever in horizontal or lateral mobility within the RTCs.</P>
    <P>The Minister's gesture to vocational education third level is welcome, as I said, with the qualifications I have made: the regret that Limerick must be robbed to pay Dublin; the regret that there is still an insistence that there are to be two awarding councils, the university and a National Council for Educational Awards dealing with the same institutions; a regret that somehow or other this policy has been pushed over on the Minister whom I know to be a sensible man and who, I know, as everybody else knows, does not agree with that policy at all.  This gesture to vocational education, however&mdash;I am saying this in all seriousness&mdash;will not allay the fears of the committees throughout the country with regard to vocational education relative to the regional technical colleges, relative to the National Institute for Higher Education but, above all, relative to their own staffing at present.</P>
    <P>There is a state of alarm in vocational education committees at present with regard to staffing.  I have evidence of a shortfall of ten in a staff in my own constituency.  I have evidence with regard to a shortfall in Mayo and Kerry.  There are other county committees of vocational education in the same plight.  This will affect the people who are to be the future students of this national institute for which this money is being provided.  I am in near despair on this matter.</P>
    <P>Vocational education and the RTCs, as mentioned by the Minister, and the National Institute for Higher Education were getting under way but I am afraid the Minister's policies at the moment are damaging vocational education to an extent which is only becoming apparent from speeches made by chief education officers throughout the country over the last few weeks.  I had great hope that the progress which had been initiated would be maintained but I am now seriously afraid that the lean time is upon the committees.  It has always been conceded that the vocational education committees, who do <Col N="580" /> the spade work, the ground work, the first level work for the national institutes, has not been fully appreciated. It looks to me as if this situation is being reached again.  The Minister will hear a great deal about this between now and the beginning of September.</P>
    <P>As far as vocational education is concerned, this Supplementary Estimate is welcome.  The £50,000 to get the governing body under way is welcome. I had hoped that the Minister would take the opportunity of bringing in a proper Estimate, not one just to get over the accounting difficulty under Vote 33, but an Estimate which would include enough money to pay the bare minimum of staff for vocational educational committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concluding now. this £50,000 Supplementary Estimate might indicate a wakening up to the serious deficiencies in vocational education in the country.  As far as I can see, the progress has been important.  We are in a serious position. It is a case of Ichabod, Ichabod as far as vocational education is concerned. I warned the Minister that people will come down on him like a ton of bricks in the very near future if a proper Supplementary Estimate is not brought in here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is largely a token Estimate and I think we can accept it fairly rapidly.  I have a number of reservations, one of which was enunciated by Deputy J. Lynch.  He speaks rather quietly and as far as I could hear he was also dissatisfied with the manner in which this was introduced.  I know it is on the Order Paper and I am not questioning the right of the Government to order the sequence of business in the House.  The first information I had of this being taken this morning was when I was strolling along Merrion Square and I met the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who informed me that this was coming up at 10.30 this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> This is not the best way to treat serious educational matters.  I have not had time time to adequately prepare to contribute to this discussion.  If this is open Government, I shudder to think what closed Government would be like.  I also share the difficulty of Deputy Wilson that it is rather hard to talk about a Token Estimate for £10 without raising broader issues of principle.  At this point the Chair will correctly rule me out of order as he did with Deputy Wilson but it is really difficult to stand up in the House and talk about £10.  Having said that, I hasten to add, that I do not intend to indulge in my familiar pastime of bashing the Minister for Education.  In this instance I am happy to say that I believe he is correct and I welcome the general trend of his policies and the general trend of his attitudes towards the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>I believe Deputy Wilson's fears about the fate of Limerick are unjustified.  I believe the Minister is fully concerned with the future of the Limerick institution and is simply seeking to rationalise the work of the Limerick and Dublin institutions. I agree with him in his reference to unnecessary duplication of courses. This must be avoided.  We have to face the fact that the State cannot afford endless duplication of courses and I think the Minister is perfectly correct here.  Unlike Deputy Wilson, I welcome the liaison that has been built up between the universities and the technical college, for example, the degree awarding liaison between my own college, Trinity College, Dublin, and Bolton Street Technical College.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson spoke about mobility. I should like to see this developed to a point where the technical colleges are given equal status with the universities. The Minister is faced here with a large number of entrenched vested interests who often represent themselves as expressing the highest educational principles and the most democratic educational principles where, in fact, they are really expressing selfishness, a refusal to accept change and a determination to retain their status, salary <Col N="582" /> and conditions.  This is usually put forward under such phrases as &ldquo;academic autonomy&rdquo; and Newman's &ldquo;Idea of a University&rdquo;.  What they really boil down to is: &ldquo;I want the rate of the job with a minimum degree of expenditure of effort on my part.&rdquo; I see the Minister is smiling. I feel he agrees with me.</P>
    <P>In relation to mobility, when I went to Trinity College 20 years ago the 2,500 students were taught more or less badly about everything, as they were in other institutions.  You had the concept of what was called in Latin the <i>cisterna communis res</i>, that everybody knew everybody else and everybody in Dublin was looking down his nose at the poor relations in the technical colleges. For better or worse this incapsulated, insulated university society has broken down.  On the whole, it is for the better.  We are faced with two alternatives, one of which is to develop our universities on an enormous Berkeley style level of complexity, which I do not believe is suitable for this country, or else, to accept the kind of mobility which Deputy Wilson spoke about and the lack of duplication of courses about which the Minister spoke.</P>
    <P>As a fellow of an ancient university, oddly enough, my primary sympathies go to the regional technical colleges. They have been for many years the poor relation of the tertiary, educational world and the conditions under which students and teachers are compelled to work in them are appalling. The Minister is moving in the right direction.  I also believe the fears expressed by Deputy Wilson are justified as far as the regional technical colleges are concerned.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of entrenched interests. I do not share Deputy Wilson's commitment to the vocational education committees.  I know this is a very dangerous thing to say and is calculated to bring political scorn on one's head but the involvement of the county council organisation in tertiary education has often seemed to me, to put it as tactfully as I can, to be other than altruistic.  It is better, possibly, if specialists are involved in these fields. <Col N="583" /> I do not know what democracy in that sense has to do with tertiary education.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson that instead of introducing this rather hurried token Estimate I would like to have seen the Minister producing a major Supplementary Estimate containing a higher degree of investment in the whole area of regional technical colleges.  If the Minister has a defect, it is in his incapacity to extract money from his colleagues in the Cabinet.  I wish he were more successful in this and I believe he wishes it himself.  If he were, we might find more adventurous policies put forward.  With due respect to Deputy Wilson, the fact is that the bucket is pretty well empty at the moment and it is not really realistic to expect the Minister to bring forward the kind of progressive policies which I honestly think&mdash;I have changed my mind about this, having had lengthy discussions with him in private&mdash;he wishes to introduce if he were permitted to do so.</P>
    <P>There are one or two things which worry me.  I share Deputy Wilson's concern about the concept of non-degree awarding institutions.  It seems to me to maintain a duality in education which I do not quite understand. As I understood it&mdash;I may have been incorrect in my years as secretary of the Irish Federation of University Teachers&mdash;the original intention of the Higher Education Authority was that the National Council for Education Awards were awarded for qualifications which were comparable to university degree qualifications.  It seems to me that this principle has been departed from which I understand has been done against the wishes of the Higher Education Authority.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us if this is the case. While I accept the Minister's idea of the association of the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick and that the liaison between the universities and certain students in these institutes is a valuable one, where other students are concerned, a duality is maintained which will cause them still to <Col N="584" /> feel second class educational citizens. This, in my view, is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said that the governing bodies must work in close liaison with each other and with other educational institutions within the system.  It is very important that the universities should be shaken out of their apathy and made to realise that they are not the elder brothers of the regional technical colleges.  To that extent, I agree also with the Minister.  I agree also when he says that they are not pursuing rationalisation for rationalisation's sake.  It is patently obvious that a country of three million people cannot afford endless duplication of courses between universities and technical colleges.  If people are not prepared to accept the logic of that argument, I can only put that down to their own innate selfishness rather than to the arguments about academic autonomy and the human's concept of the university which so freely fall from the lips of university professors.</P>
    <P>I accept this proposal.  I am pleased with it and consider the Minister's attitude to the regional technical colleges is correct.  He spoke of consultation but also referred to the Government's decision.  As a member of the National Coalition, I remain confused as to how it is possible to maintain consultation in the context of a stated decision.  In my opinion, the decision with regard to degree awarding is perhaps unfortunate.  In other aspects, I welcome this token measure.  While, like Deputy Wilson, I feel the Minister should ideally have introduced a scheme more broad and more expensive, I recognise that at present he is not in a position to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Wilson's welcome for this Estimate. Like Deputy Wilson I too have reservations. In my view, provincialism should have no place in education.  I sympathise with the Limerick NIHE that money was taken from them to give to Dublin.  Because of financial restrictions one must make allowances for such a thing happening, but it is a pity it has to happen in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="585" /> The Dublin Vocational Educational Committee are very concerned about the setting up of the NIHE.  The Minister has already had one resignation in protest from a college council because of the way matters are progressing. Do the members of the Dublin Vocational Educational Committee feel that their position is being weakened by the founding of the NIHE?  Many of the men and women who served on that committee over the years did a wonderful job.  It is a pity, at a time when more emphasis should be put on vocational education, that the Minister has not been more forthcoming on the future of third level and second level education in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he does not pursue rationalisation for rationalisation's sake.  Trinity College in a recent statement said that they would confer degrees on certain students from certain colleges.  Does the Minister believe that the major merger between UCD and TCD will ever come about?  If not, should we drop the whole idea or will he give us some indication when we will see some tangible steps being taken towards this merger?  This has been spoken about for so long that people are inclined to forget about it.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the setting up of the NIHE in Dublin is a help and I support this allocation, the situation in this city at this moment is so confused that the Minister might take time off from bringing in further innovations to examine the educational system here and see where it overlaps&mdash;as happens in the two universities&mdash;and spell out what he intends doing in the near future.</P>
    <P>While I agree with many of the stands being taken by the Minister, I consider that he is allowing himself to be bogged down by vested interests in many of the institutions.  So long as this continues, we will not make any progress towards a better system of education which will benefit every person in the State who has the ability and the ambition to avail of the educational facilities being provided.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Thornley said, the talk of £10 for education may not inspire one to the greatest flights of oratory, <Col N="586" /> but it is the principle we are adopting here this morning.  As I said earlier, I deplore the fact that the money was taken from Limerick to the benefit of Dublin.  I realise that because of financial difficulties at present the Government must juggle with finance, but the last field in which economies should be made is education.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous need for well trained personnel in every sphere of our economic life.  We are too poor to afford a comprehensive system of education.  It is on these grounds that I welcome this Estimate.</P>
    <P>We were given one-and-a-half hours this morning to discuss this Estimate but got such short notice that we did not have very much time to prepare for the discussion here today.  As I said, I welcome this Estimate because it is a further step&mdash;a faltering and tiny step&mdash;towards broadening education. At a future date I hope to have an opportunity of speaking more fully on it.  I suggest that the Minister examine very carefully the position of the vocational education committees all over the country, but particularly in Dublin, where, with the NIHE, Dublin, and the possible merger of the two universities, the vocational education committees as we knew them might be forced out of existence.  This would be a great tragedy.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should like to join with Deputy Thornley and Deputy Moore in expressing irritation at the way in which important business can suddenly come before the House without adequate notice to Deputies.  Like Deputy Thornley, I did not know this Estimate was on until I walked into the Chamber.  This sort of thing makes debate difficult.  That is my first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point is with regard to the Estimate itself.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I am, I suppose, sensitive to the fact that the Department of Education have not been, shall I say, the most systematic in their approach to Estimates in the past.  I am very glad now to see we are having regular procedures. <Col N="587" /> This Estimate is nothing more, I should imagine, than a token Estimate to put the accounting in order.  This is something on which I want to compliment the Minister. This simply means that, if there is to be any further expenditure, it will come from savings somewhere else out of moneys available within the general Vote.  Basically there is not a great deal more than that to this Estimate. There is a grant to the NIHE of £50,000 and a saving on subhead B.1 of £49,990.  So much for preliminaries.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate makes provision for two things.  It provides a sum of £50,000 under the heading &ldquo;B.3&mdash;National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin&mdash;Current Expenditure.&rdquo;  Unfortunately I have not got the Book of Estimates with me to find out what exactly subhead B.1 is.  I find it hard to see what the savings will be.  I know there will be an accounting adjustment but all I can say at this stage is that, not having had notice a proper analysis of this Estimate from a financial point of view is simply not possible.</P>
    <P>I shall content myself therefore with referring to the purpose of the Supplementary Estimate which is to provide for certain higher institutions and services, the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies and the Institute of Higher Education, which is the principal beneficiary.  Though it is only a Supplementary Estimate it raises the whole question of the purposes of this particular institute and of the higher educational institutions and services referred to. To refer to their purposes is, therefore, relevant.  Having regard to the limited time and that this is merely a Supplementary Estimate, and basically an accounting matter, I think I should be limited and brief but it is necessary nowadays as a Deputy, so to speak, to assert my claim to discussion.</P>
    <P>Here we are basically up against the question as to what higher education is and the purposes of these institutions.  Everybody is talking about rationalisation but one has to be careful when one talks about rationalisation <Col N="588" /> that forced integration of incompatibles may not cause more confusion than order, and rationalisation, therefore, does not become an illusion. With that general thought I should now like to address a few short remarks to the Minister knowing that the Minister is a man of academic distinction and experience who, possibly instinctively, has a feeling for what is basically involved in education and can discern the spirit and the realities as against the technicalities.  He can see the wood without being obsessed with the trees. Knowing this of him, <i>audemus dicere</i>&mdash;I presume to say&mdash;I hope I can convey in as short a time as possible a few thoughts for consideration because that is all I can hope to do today.</P>
    <P>The question is&mdash;I hope the Minister will understand the form in which I put it to him&mdash;what is higher education? What is its purpose?  At the lower levels education is necessarily the bringing of the child and the adolescent towards integration in the community.  At the third level we have to ask ourselves the question what is education.  Here we have to face the fact that education has two meanings &mdash;<i>educere</i>&mdash;to lead the individual to higher knowledge and higher skills, to higher professional status, if you like. It is a very modern need because of the complexities of life's need whether it be in law, technology, medicine or anything else.  Here one is projected on from the lower level, bringing the individual to full maturity to take his place in society in the role he is to play in the community.  In these modern days we are all, as I mentioned in another context, socialists of necessity in the sense that we are all socially interdependent.  The paleolithical age is, so to speak, well gone and we have now this concept of education which is a drawing out&mdash;I used the Latin word &ldquo;educere&rdquo; to express the idea. That is, of course, a very valid purpose and some may argue the primary purpose of education.  Education is training.</P>
    <P>There is, however, another aspect to education.  It is certainly tied up with the first.  It is creative.  It is a development of the mentality of the individual.  I am referring to the concept of learning, knowledge and <Col N="589" /> learning, and the development of the breadth of human knowledge and learning.  This concept, this aim and object of higher education, is being lost sight of a little bit now where the emphasis is on training.  It was possibly disproportionate in the immediate past but things change.  There is the concept of education in the more or less accepted sense of leading on, of training and there is the concept of education as the development of knowledge.  It is very important to distinguish between the two.  If one makes that distinction and relates it to the rationalisation I was talking about one must consider the position of certain professional bodies, higher centres of training and institutes for the conducting of higher training in the narrower sense of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; and the concept of bodies and institutes for learning such as the universities were in the recent and not so recent past.</P>
    <P>Straight away one comes up against something which I think is bedevilling us a little.  It may even be developed into a certain form of snobbery. When education becomes a cult like any other cult it can become a phoney thing and with this preoccupation with the word &ldquo;degree,&rdquo; this idea that everything has to be labelled with a university degree, are we not unconsciously falling into a certain form of snobbery?  The idea of degrees all round as a measure of higher education has two very undesirable consequences.  It is a phoney thing, it is a form of snobbery and, as well as that, it has the definite logical result so ably expressed by Gilbert in <i>The Gondoliers</i> in that famous song &ldquo;There lived a King,&rdquo; when everyone is somebody then no one is anybody. If we go on talking about degrees, in the end BA can mean &ldquo;B. Anything&rdquo; and B need not mean bachelor of anything either.</P>
    <P>Let us be rational.  By all means have qualifications but do not get a fix on a label that looks like a university degree or is forced into a university degree.  There were and are very honourable degrees in the trades.  The degree of apprentice, of journeyman, the degree of master mason, master <Col N="590" /> builder or master carpenter.  They are degrees which are every bit as important to the community, every bit as honourable and a damn sight more practical than many of the Bs that are being produced or advocated in our age.  I am afraid there is a little bit of cultural snobbery kicking around here.  By all means have qualifications but must they all have the same label just because in the past a university degree had a certain aura?</P>
    <P>Institutes may be of two types because one must look at higher education from two points of view. There will be institutes working from the professional, proficiency or practical point of view.  I will call them degrees, professional or proficiency degrees.  I have no objection to the word degree but let us not try to knock it into the form I criticised earlier.  We need institutes at nearly all levels from the professional or proficiency point of view.  We have them already.  The King's Inns, for instance, for the lawyers award the degree of Barrister-at-Law.  Nobody has ever thought of that in terms of being an academic degree.  The solicitors have their own organisation and the very word &ldquo;solicitor&rdquo; is a degree.  A primary teacher who is probably the most important man in the whole educational system comes from a training college and the title &ldquo;qualified primary teacher&rdquo; is, to my mind, a more important and honourable degree than many of the things we have as appendages coming out of some of the disciplines of our university colleges.  The Royal College of Surgeons is a professional college and awards its own degrees.  They are fellowships of that college.  For the profession of physics or chemistry nowadays there is the university aspect and there is the professional aspect and one becomes a fellow of one or other of the recognised professional institutes.  A person may have a university degree in law but he must qualify as a barrister to practice as such.  One may have a university degree in medicine but before one is recognised as a medical practitioner one must be registered.  There is an important point here.  There is a need for these professional institutes.  The <Col N="591" /> professions are as honourable and the qualifications are as important.  They should carry the same kudos.  In practice, they are of more immediate importance to the individual and the community.  Will the Minister please interrupt me if he wants to get in?</P>

      <P>I want to emphasise the role of non-university third level education, to use Deputy Wilson's phrase.  It is an important concept and an important function.  In the immediate time interval in which we are living it has an important function in higher education.  I am not decrying it in any way.  I am suggesting that rationalisation means facing reality and cutting out the cod and the snobbery and a recognition, above all things, that a man's dignity and status and importance in the community are not to be measured by a scale of imagined levels of learning but by his profession and his skills and status in that profession from the point of view of humanity as a whole and of the community.  Whether a man is a carpenter, or a farmer, or a primary teacher, a secondary teacher or a university teacher, or an officer in an administrative department or anywhere else, the important thing is that in those spheres we have the maximum skill, efficiency and knowledge pertaining to that professional or technical status.  That is not to be measured by the right to put on a gown of a certain colour at certain ceremonies.  That is the more practically important aspect of education in the immediate time interval in which we are living.  I have characterised it by the Latin word from which the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say a brief word about university education.  Here we have something different, academic degrees.  Perhaps I go back to the Newman concept.  Perhaps I am a little biased that way myself.  Here we are thinking in terms of knowledge, learning, the broadening of the <Col N="592" /> horizons of knowledge, the exercise of the creative faculties of the human intellect and imagination, the probing, the inquiry at a certain remoteness from the compulsions of practical, everyday life.  I am afraid what has happened in our universities is that that function has been relegated to what I might call the honours schools. The universities have attempted to supply what more properly belongs to the other categories which, if this concept of working out these institutes is properly organised, can contribute to solving the problem.</P>
    <P>The universities have acquired accretions and gone into the training on the professional side overmuch to my mind.  There is the human respect aspect of people seeking to have a university degree and feeling inferior if they have not got B. something after their names.  The tendency has been for universities to have their ordinary degrees as professional adjuncts and to confine to their honours schools the function of learning.  I just mention the thought.  The important thing is that academic degrees and the functions of academic institutes, the function of education under the heading &ldquo;learning&rdquo; as against the heading &ldquo;training&rdquo; have to be regarded carefully.  In the longer term it adds to human knowledge and builds for the future.  It is serviced to a large extent by people with almost a monastic mentality.  They are not monastes by any means but they have a certain remoteness and a certain absorption with things of the mind. The fruit is reaped later and applied by those in the first category I have talked about.</P>
    <P>Certain institutions of higher education are mentioned here.  I am not quite sure what the function of the NIHE is or whether it is to embrace both.  If it is, it will have to keep very clearly in mind the distinction I have made.  The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies is also covered by this Estimate.  It is definitely in the second category concerned with the advancement of learning.  Incidentally, such institutes have developed because the universities were failing in their main function because they were <Col N="593" /> clogged up.  The higher institutes were really university functions which were hived off because they were getting clogged up by the accretions of the practicalities in the truly academic range.  The Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies exemplifies the type of institute that is the antithesis of the professional institutions like the Bar, the King's Inns and the others I mentioned.  It is devoted purely to knowledge, science and Celtic studies. It has made a great contribution.  The people who were in this institute as senior professors have brought lustre to this country, their names have been well known in the field of learning, nationally and internationally.  In the long term it is that type of institute which matters and there is a place for it.  It cannot be steamrolled into an integrated so-called rationalisation without doing violence to both sides.</P>
    <P>The School of Celtic Studies and the School of Cosmic Physics have had their very distinguished records and personalities.  I cannot talk with any particular knowledge of these. With regard to the School of Theoretical Physics I should like to recall the names of Schroedinger and Heitler in particular whose names are known wherever chemistry and physics are spoken of all over the world and will be for all time.  We have our own Professor Synge who is equally internationally known for his contribution.  Happily he is still with us.  I should also like to refer to a man who, though not a native of this country, although a citizen afterwards, did so much to keep Dublin's name alive in the literature of certain branches of theoretical physics, relativity in particular and mechanics, during his time, the late Professor Lanczes.  This country owes to Cornelius Lanczes&mdash;and I do not in any way detract from what is owed to the others I have mentioned and more&mdash; a debt for his books and writings which are so well known and the international notice he gained for this country.  These things should be acknowledged and recognised.</P>
    <P>We also have our own people.  It would be invidious to mention people of the present time but there are <Col N="594" /> young people there, Irishmen trained in that institute&mdash;I have one person in mind&mdash;who are brilliant, competent and internationally known, the logical intellectual children of the earlier generation in this institute who will carry on and produce further flowering in this regard.</P>
    <P>I could go on much longer but let me end by asking the Minister, knowing that he also has the qualifications and breadth of vision personally to appreciate the thoughts we have tried to express in the short time available, to give thought to rationalisation particularly and to recommend to his staff the necessity for distinguishing when you get to the third level between the function of learning which is the function of institutes like the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies on the one hand and the training function of higher education in the professional or technical sense. I hope I have given offence to nobody, if I made what appeared to be scathing references to anything.  I would not wish to do so.  I merely wished to bring out my point, as one sometimes does in debate.  There is a problem here in education; our resources are limited but I believe we have a Minister who, if given half a chance and the resources, could make a very significant contribution to the future of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Dáil and the Opposition for agreeing at short notice to take this Supplementary Estimate. The sequence of events which led to my request to the Opposition was as follows: having set up the governing body of the National Institute of Higher Education in Dublin some weeks ago, I received a deputation within the last few days from the chairman and two other members of that body who expressed a desire to get ahead with the planning and initiation of the projects which will occupy the governing body and asked me if I could have a Supplementary Estimate introduced.  The amount of £50,000 was thought to be a suitable amount, given that we have now effectively <Col N="595" /> only a few months to run in this financial year.</P>
      <P>I should have been delighted if it had been possible to consider the provision of new money for these purposes but, first, there is the overall difficulty of providing additional finance of this kind and, secondly, we are dealing with only a few months to the end of the financial year.  We need to make a start with this institute in Dublin.  In these circumstances it seemed reasonable to utilise the savings which will be made available within the Vote.  The position in that regard is that substantial provision was made for the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick in the current year to provide for greatly increased staff which, in the event, it has been judged would not be warranted in present circumstances in higher education generally. There is no question of robbing Limerick.  The provision made there in the 1974 Estimate would have amounted to £480,000 in a full year&mdash; that particular year was a short year. The total in the 1975 Estimate was £952,000 and there can be no question but that this relatively small sum can be produced by a transfer from the subhead to the new subhead which is being opened.</P>
      <P>As regards the question asked by Deputy Wilson in regard to consultation with Limerick, I think it is fair to draw the attention of the House to the difficulty of doing this.  I take it the Deputy was not suggesting that I should consult regarding these financial matters with NIHE Limerick and its governing body before consulting this House.  I would be failing in my duty to the Dáil if I were to go to any other person before coming here to get permission to do what we ask to do.  I am sure Deputies opposite will agree on reflection that it is my duty to emphasise the role of this House in regard to all these financial matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies said they would welcome a further opportunity to deal with educational matters.  I hope that will arise later in the year.  Further Supplementary Estimates will be necessary to deal with the effects of increased remuneration on the <Col N="596" /> original provision in these Votes.  The urgency of this particular Estimate is to enable a start to be made with the NIHE in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson spoke of what he alleged to be a cutback in the numbers of teachers allotted to vocational education committees and said that there would be a lean time ahead.  We shall have an opportunity of discussing that at a later stage.  He then went on to speak about the effects this cutback might be expected to have on the entrants to the NIHEs.  I understood him to mean that it is the product of vocational education schools, technical schools throughout the country that would be attending these national institutes of higher education.  I do not want to put words into his mouth but, if this was the intention of his remarks, it would be reprehensible because it is to be envisaged that those who go to the NIHEs will, in fact, come from all second level schools, be they community schools, comprehensive schools, voluntary secondary schools and schools under the jurisdiction of vocational education committees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>And the RTCs.  Perhaps the Deputy will have another opportunity of expressing a view as to whether what he said today represents his considered views on the matter.</P>
      <P>May I say also that there is not much fruit in suggesting, either in this House or elsewhere, that I am pursuing loyally a certain policy which has been foisted on me. Cabinet responsibility is well known in this country.  If Cabinets make decisions they are carried out and it does not bring us any benefit to speculate, incorrectly as it happens, as to whether one agrees or disagrees with decisions originally taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked me whether the NIHE would be a recognised college of a Dublin university.  This is the stated decision of the Government. To this end one is making efforts, in consultation with the various bodies, to bring this about.  It is not possible for any Minister to say <Col N="597" /> whether, in fact, it would be possible to achieve this.  Therefore, it is not possible at this point to reply to the Deputy's query as to whether it will evolve into a constituent college&mdash; which is a natural follow on to a recognised college&mdash;or whether it will become an autonomous institution awarding its own degrees.</P>
    <P>As for Deputy Wilson's point about close liaison being impossible under Fianna Fáil's policy in relation to the NCEA, I would disagree with this.  It was possible but I think the matter has been made more probable by the Government's decision in reference to the NCEA and its role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the VECs, that, in addition to the functions already mentioned and, indeed, given by a previous Administration, the Government have now decided that the RTCs will be funded through the VECs and by the Department of Education in consultation with the NCEA.  Far from downgrading this body&mdash;as I have said on numerous occasions since the Government's decisions were announced&mdash;they will be given much wider and very important functions and, if the eagerness to serve on this body, which has been evident in the two governing bodies already instituted is any indication, then there is a very strong and healthy future ahead of the NCEA.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about the Dublin situation.  Like him, I share an admiration for the work being done by the Dublin City Vocational Education Committee.  It is no secret that the vocational education committee advanced very strongly reasons why they should continue to have a governing role in relation to the NIHE.  But the Government had made their decision that this was to be a national body, a body, as I said in my opening address, open to all the RTCs in the country and, indeed, to many other institutions.  Apart from the one resignation from the college council the Deputy mentioned, most of the other members of the vocational education committee have accepted the Government's decision and are loyally working within its terms.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister to say that, if he <Col N="598" /> desires additional time to complete his remarks, agreement in that regard will be readily forthcoming to the extent, say, of upwards of ten minutes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer to Deputy Moore's remarks in this regard. I do not think it gets us very far in relation to these matters to have people resigning from college councils or, indeed, from the vocational education committee itself.  I think it would be better if one were to adjust to the fact that the Government have made the decision.  I agree with his point that the last place we should effect economies is in the field of education.  This was a matter referred to by Deputy Thornley who spoke about my apparent inability to extract funds from my colleagues. Again, it does not get us very far to speculate on whether one has such an ability.  The point is this.  A number of Government Ministers have publicly expressed the view that, in the first few years of this Administration, in social policy, there would be an emphasis on raising the level of social welfare benefits necessitated by certain economic factors and that at a later stage there would be the allocation of increased moneys to education.  These are Government decisions which will be taken by the whole Government.  It does not get anybody very far to speculate as to an individual Minister's ability to extract funds, as it is called, from colleagues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains for the Government.  Deputy Collins will appreciate from the trend of my remarks <Col N="599" /> that any personal statement in this regard would be inappropriate.</P>
      <P>Let me say also on a personal note that I welcome Deputy Thornley's decision to desist from what he himself described as &ldquo;Minister bashing&rdquo;.  I think this is becoming the situation generally throughout the community because it is realised that this is no longer a fruitful exercise and what we are now going to concentrate on is policy.  I was very glad to hear Deputy de Valera attempt to deal with the broad principles of policy in a manner which would do justice to a larger debate on this subject.  If I refrain from replying to his points, it is not through disrespect but through a feeling that I would want to consider my reply and, perhaps, on another occasion, on another Estimate, deal more firmly with this ground.  The Deputy will realise that what Ministers say in this regard would need to be very carefully considered, given the various interests to which Deputy Thornley referred when he drew attention to the fact that I smiled when he said something about people who enunciated the highest principle but really who were looking for the highest rate for the job at the least expenditure of effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this field of education on has to tread very carefully.  I should like simply to say to Deputies generally that there is quite a lot of movement in the higher education field since the Government took their decision on 13th December last.  For example, it has been possible now for a university in Dublin to recognise certain courses in our higher technological college in the Dublin area.  I have had consultations with other universities which have expressed a desire to co-operate with the Government's stated intention in regard to other institutes, for example, in the Limerick area.  It is generally accepted that what was thought relatively impossible six months ago has now become possible.  This, I would ask the Dáil to accept, is because firm decisions were made in regard to the broad principles of policy, as I explained on another occasion.  As to the actual implementation of some of the consequential matters, there is <Col N="600" /> continuing consultation with the various bodies involved.</P>
    <P>One can look forward over the next 12 months or so to a further elaboration by me of Government thinking on these matters so that when we come to publish a more comprehensive paper in regard to the matters there will be, as a result of our methods of procedure, a very high degree of consensus for the pre-legislative proposals which will be elaborated in a White Paper.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Members of the House for the way in which they have received this Supplementary Estimate and to say that it was not entirely within my powers to dictate the timing of it.  I was trying to facilitate members of the governing body of the NIHE in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to reiterate that there is no question here of robbing Limerick; in fact, quite the opposite is the case.  Limerick is pretty well provided for by the increase to £952,000 in the current Estimates.  I should like to thank the House for the co-operation I have received.  I look forward to the continuation of this high standard of debate in regard to education in general, and higher education in particular at some future date between now and Christmas.</P>
    <P>I should also like to thank the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee who referred to the way in which we are carrying out the procedures of the House.  As I have said on another occasion, any irregularities which may have occurred previously are in the past.</P>

    <Title>Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1975: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1975, made on the 23rd day of July, 1975 by the Minister for Justice with the sanction of the Minister for the Public Service under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the House to approve the Garda Síochána Pensions Order, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána pensions orders govern the award of pensions and gratuities to members of the Garda Síochána on retirement and to the widows, children and dependants <Col N="602" /> of deceased members of the force. However, the order before the House deals only with the allowances payable for children and provides for a relatively minor amendment in the conditions governing the payment of such allowances.</P>
    <P>Under the existing pensions orders allowances are payable in respect of children of deceased members up to the age of 18, if they are receiving full-time education.  The order now before the House raises this upper age from 18 to 21 years.  As far as such children are concerned, the order will bring the Garda scheme into line with an improvement which was granted in the Department of Social Welfare Contributory Pensions Scheme, under the terms of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1969.  The improvement in the social welfare code came into operation on 1st August, 1969, but the existence of this improvement did not come to the notice of my Department, or the force or, I must assume, the persons directly concerned until the end of 1973 when a claim was received to have the improvement applied to the Garda Síochána.  The improvement was subsequently approved in principle but statutory effect was not given to the change because other amendments in the Garda pensions scheme were being considered and it was hoped to incorporate them in one amending order.  Because of difficulties, which are largely of a technical nature, these other changes have not yet been finalised and in the circumstances, in order to avoid any further delay in applying the approved conditions for payment of children's allowances, I have agreed at the request of the Garda Pensioners' Association to proceed with this amendment, leaving the other matters to be attended to later.</P>
    <P>I commend the order for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party gives approval to the order requested by the Minister.  I note that this order specifically deals with the allowances payable for children together with a minor amendment in the conditions governing the payment of such allowances.  This being so, naturally, <Col N="603" /> the debate must be limited.  At present full time educational benefits under the existing order finished at 18 years of age and I welcome the extension of this age limit to 21 years.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that as far as such children are concerned the new order brings the Garda scheme into line with the situation as it is since the Department of Social Welfare contributory pensions scheme was improved in 1969.  It is difficult to understand why it has taken six years, or thereabouts, to bring the Garda scheme into line with the Social Welfare contributory pensions scheme.  The Minister's admission that the existence of this improvement in the social welfare code did not come to the notice of his Department, the force, or the people concerned until the end of 1973 is a serious admission.  I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessor for this breakdown in communications between the Departments of Social Welfare and Justice, but it has taken six years to make good for the children involved.</P>
      <P>This example of a complete breakdown between two important Departments of State must be guarded against at all times.  It is not good enough that this should happen ever again.  I know the Minister will take every step possible to prevent such a situation developing again.  The anomaly discovered at the end of 1973 should have been corrected then.  If it were corrected then, it would have been welcomed by those involved.  I give the Minister our support in this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his welcome for the order.  I share his concern that there is an absence of mechanisms which enables one Department to draw attention to another Department which might have people concerned.  Obviously, in this instance there was not such a mechanism whereby the Department of Social Welfare drew the attention of my Department and the Garda to changes which would be relevant to them.  That mechanism will have to be restored.  I should like to make it clear that the increased allowances which are being paid now are retrospective to 1969.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation and Transport (No. 2) Bill, 1975: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Col N="604" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to close a loophole in the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, which has been revealed by a recent case.  Under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, an authorisation is required from the Minister for Transport and Power to operate an air service.  Air service is defined in the Act as a &ldquo;flight carrying passengers, cargo or mail for reward&rdquo;.  In 1966 the then Minister made an order under the Act which grants a general authorisation mainly for flights which are the subject of international agreements such as scheduled flights governed by bilateral agreements.  Other air services including most charter or non-scheduled flights require my specific authorisation.  In considering applications for authorisations from foreign carriers for charter flights, whether passenger or cargo, my Department have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to Aer Lingus and Aer Turas, a cargo carrier.</P>
      <P>Recently a US owned and registered aircraft carried cattle from Shannon to the Continent on behalf of a farmer, without an authorisation.  It was claimed that the aircraft was leased to the owner of the cattle and that consequently the flights, not being carriage for reward, did not fall within the definition of air service under the Act.  The lease in question, the validity of which has been challenged by me, provided for the hire of the aircraft for one month at a cost of $10 plus other, unspecified, valuable considerations.  The matter is the subject of High Court proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case, however, reveals a loophole in the provisions of the 1965 Act relating to the operation of air services.  Anyone who has goods or people to transport on own account by air could do so without an authorisation by entering into an arrangement to lease an aircraft for a very <Col N="605" /> short period or even for one flight.  A group of persons or firms could combine to lease an aircraft between them and use it freely for the carriage of goods owned by each of them individually. Such an arrangement could apply to incoming as well as outgoing flights.  There are many foreign non-scheduled air carriers and leasing companies who would be only too anxious to enter into such arrangements and by price cutting to undermine the services provided by the Irish carriers and by reliable and reputable foreign carriers.</P>
    <P>Such a device, if extensively used, would frustrate the objectives of the relevant provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965.  Apart from the protection of the Irish carriers, the application and administration of the provisions of the Act make for orderly development of civil aviation, an objective enshrined in the Chicago Convention of 1944 subscribed to by most countries of the world engaged in civil aviation.</P>
    <P>The effect of the proposed amendment would be to bring all flights where passengers, cargo or mail are carried within the scope of the authorisation provisions of the Act.  This is necessary in order not only to cater for the case of leasing but also the possible cases of temporary and doubtful &ldquo;sales&rdquo; of aircraft effected for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of the Act.  The proposed new control encompasses certain classes of flights hitherto not subject to authorisation and which are freely allowed. These include emergency flights, pleasure flights, flights by small aircraft. I propose to authorise such classes of flights by way of including them under the general authorisation effected by the Air Services Authorisation Order, 1966 and so removing from them the requirement of obtaining individual authorisations.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to emphasise that it is not to be taken as an attempt by the legislature to over-rule the Judiciary.  The Bill is merely for the purpose of plugging a loophole in the <Col N="606" /> statutory controls which the case in question has revealed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this Bill and support it fully.  As the Minister has said, this loophole was recently highlighted by an individual who came to fly out a load of calves from Shannon with a Part 91 Certificate from America which should not be recognised here, and it was never intended to recognise it.  Our national airlines, Aer Lingus and Aer Turas are very much involved in this Bill, because if this loophole was not plugged it could have detrimental effects on their viability.</P>
      <P>It is only right that these air pirates with these Part 91 Certificates should be excluded at this stage, because it could lead to an escalation of this type of carrier work from Ireland.  I understand there are many of this type of aircraft in junk yards and elsewhere in the United States which could be bought very reasonably and, if this Act was not amended, we would probably find ourselves having these people flying to some part of Europe and on their way back dropping down to Shannon and picking up not only calves but exports from the factories in Shannon at a very reduced rate to the exclusion of Aer Lingus and Aer Turas whose aircraft, I understand, are recognised in all western European countries as maintaining international standards.</P>
      <P>Fortunately the recent Supplementary Estimate of the Minister for Transport and Power gave us an opportunity to highlight this incident, because it happened shortly before that period.  The court injunction which the Minister has mentioned permitted the individual concerned to get away with it by claiming he was leasing the aircraft.  By the omission of two words from the original Act all this has been excluded.  All we ask is that people who come in here and operate a service, whether passenger or carrier, be required to maintain the same high standards for aircraft and personnel that we ourselves with Aer Lingus, Aer Turas and any other people licensed by us here are required to maintain.  We fully support this amendment of the Act.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Barrett said, this provision was very necessary. In fact, all the amendment does is remove from the provisions of the Act the words &ldquo;for reward&rdquo;.  Up to this any carriage for reward needed an authorisation from me but this excluded cases, as in this instance, where the plane was leased or, as I mentioned in my opening speech, bought at a very cheap rate.  As Deputy Barrett said, a lot of these planes are available throughout the world and can be bought very cheaply, thus endangering the viability of our national airline and Aer Turas, the cargo carriers in this country.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Barrett and the House have facilitated me by allowing me to bring in this amendment and put it through the House in a very short time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>As we on this side said on Second Stage, we look forward to Bord na Móna carrying out development on a planned scale with particular emphasis on the working lives of their projected 6,000 to 8,000 employees.  As well as cutting and saving turf, we should like to be assured that An Foras Talúntais will continue their experimental work on cutaway bogs.  This should be very carefully looked into because of the success which we understand has been achieved with regard to the growing of vegetables and other plants.  Up to recent years cutaway bogs were deemed to be utterly worthless from this point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we continue to cut and save turf there will be far more cutaway <Col N="608" /> bogs.  From the experiments that have taken place I understand that turf should not be cut down to the mud or the stone, that at least two sods should be left and that this makes for more successful growing of vegetables and other plants.  I understand as well that there is a very ready market in English cities for the other plants that can be grown on cutaway bogs. As we need more and more turf to meet the gap in our energy requirements, more and more cutaway bog will become available, and I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices with Bord na Móna to see that at least two sods are left at the bottom of these bogs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a large acreage of virgin bog yet untouched, and it becomes more and more important to utilise these in view of the present price of oil and of the Government's difficulty in getting supplies of oil.  We saw what happened last year when trouble developed in the Middle East and when oil became much dearer.  It is important that we provide against such a development recurring, and the way to achieve this is to utilise virgin bogs to the full.  To do this it will become necessary to provide access roads into these bogs.  Neither the Department of Local Government nor the Board of Works appears to think that the provision of such access is their responsibility, so I avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to look into it. I am thinking particularly of an underdeveloped bog near Woodford which in a few years will be able to absorb those who will be unemployed when Tynagh Mines are exhausted. The bog near Woodford would give the alternative employment needed in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to the smaller bogs in some counties which do not lend themselves to development by big, modern machinery.  For instance, in my constituency last year lighter type machinery had to be brought all the way from Kerry at great expense to local people.  I suggest to the Minister that Bord na Móna should equip <Col N="609" /> themselves with lighter machinery so that these bogs, of great value to local people, can be developed properly.  When I was a young lad in Roscommon people did not mind working from early morning to late at night to provide themselves with fuel from the bogs, but those days have gone, and where bogs are small heavy machinery is useless.  It would not cost very much to provide sufficient small machinery to go into these less extensive bogs, which can provide a surprising amount of fuel for the homes of our people.  Because of the high cost of fuel and the increasing cost of transport, turf production is very valuable, and I would impress upon the Minister the need to provide smaller machinery for use on the smaller bogs.</P>
      <P>I must congratulate Bord na Móna on the wonderful job they are doing and on the amount of employment they are providing.  Every day one sees trucks fully loaded with turf, and that is something that we must feel proud of.  Turf is a great national asset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Bord na Móna on the great work being done, not alone in opening up bogs but in providing a network of viable communities.  In addition, Bord na Móna are making a large contribution to the generation of power.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister proposes to expand the activity of Bord na Móna. However, I must express disappointment that the Minister and Bord na Móna do not seem to think it is feasible to have any expansion carried out at Bellacorick.  My information is that the station lends itself to expansion and that it would be possible to have many more people employed there if the necessary preliminary work were carried out.  The area could be described as consisting entirely of bog. There is no excuse for not including it in the Minister's development programme. This is an area where the Regional Fund could be used to expand development, thus providing further employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the problems in the west is that in many cases the industries <Col N="610" /> established there are industries which employ females.  It is not very easy to get an industry to come there which would provide male employment. Here you would have an opportunity of providing male employment, thus helping to maintain a social balance. If the young men are not around, the women, even if they have jobs, will not remain.  It is necessary in any planning that is done to have regard to the social balance.</P>
    <P>The experiments carried out by Min-Fhéir Teoranta have proved that it is possible to take grass from bogs.  This also would provide a means of employment in the area.  Experiments have been caried out in Glenamoy by An Foras Talúntais.  The information obtained as a result of these experiments could be used, as has been suggested by other speakers, in the development of cutaway bog.</P>
    <P>We were told in the past that trees would not grow on cutaway bog, that afforestation was not feasible in such areas.  Now there seems to be a change of attitude, and a good deal of afforestation has been carried out in these areas.  The experts could be proved wrong again in relation to the amount of bog available in this area. I would suggest that the question of the development of the Bellacorick area should be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I must express disappointment at the attitude of Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Local Government in that at a time when it is vitally important that our own resources should be used to the fullest possible extent, they have not combined with the Department of Transport and Power in making funds available so that individuals could make the greatest possible use of bogs.  It is regrettable that local improvement schemes are not adequate and that Roinn na Gaeltachta have made very little funds available for bog development. There should be greater co-operation on the part of these Departments with the Department of Transport and Power in order to ensure the maximum use of turf.  We have gone away from the situation where the turf stack was replaced by an oil tank. Oil supplies are now so expensive that <Col N="611" /> people have reverted to the use of turf.  This will help the economy and will help the balance of payments position. Even at this late stage the Minister might get his colleagues in Roinn na Gaeltachta and the Department of Local Government to reconsider this matter in the hope that when plans are being prepared for next year a great deal more money will be made available for the development of bog roads in order to help turf production at local level.  I realise that Bord na Móna are concerned with the larger development, that is, to keep generating stations working.  There should be a concentrated effort to ensure maximum use of our own resources.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Bord na Móna again.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the question of providing for expansion at Bellacorick.  In the Bangor area Bord na Móna have an expanse of bog which at one time was used for ordinary cutting and where a good deal of seasonal employment was made available.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this situation also with a view to having the bogs there reopened.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take up the point about Bellacorick which was made by Deputy Gallagher.  A number of Deputies from the area have come to me and I have asked Bord na Móna to look at the situation.  On two occasions in the last 12 months they have looked at it and they have said that at the moment it would not be economic to develop the bogs in the area.  I must be guided by them.  They are the experts in this matter.  Of course, ironically, the reason why this Bill is before us and what makes it possible for this expansion in Bord na Móna activities is because the price of oil is so high.  For many years we enjoyed the benefits here of very cheap oil with the result that the cost of generating electricity from imported oil was very much cheaper than the cost of generating it from peat or turf.  Since the price of oil quadrupled in the last 18 months the price of generating electricity from turf is now cheaper and allows Bord na <Col N="612" /> Móna to expand their activities to provide more peat for the generation of electricity.  The prime use to which the extra bog area will be put is the generation of electricity.</P>
      <P>An acreage of 130,000 acres was developed by Bord na Móna up until recently.  This Bill allows them to develop a further 40,000 acres.  There has been some confusion in the House and outside about this.  It is not to cut the existing bog acreage to a deeper depth that the turf development programme is envisaged but to expand the amount of bog used.  The point raised by Deputy Barrett about cutting bogs to a level which will allow further development afterwards is very much in the forefront of the minds of Bord na Móna.  They are very conscious of (a) the work that will be available for their existing work force after the bogs are finished with and, (b), whatever other use the cut-away bogs can be put to when they are finished, from the point of view of turf production.</P>
      <P>An Foras Talúntais will continue their developments.  Some of the bogs are ready now and have been developed by Bord na Móna in conjunction with An Foras Talúntais for, as Deputy Barrett mentioned, the growing of little shrubs, on which Bord na Móna have built up a very profitable export trade.  This could be extended. There are also experiments on the growing of grass and rearing cattle on part of the cutaway bogs.  The snag at the moment is that it is not possible to do this on large tracts of bogs.  The bogs which are ready for such experimentation are generally sited inside huge tracts of bogland being cut.  Therefore, access to them and their division and allocation to other people would not be possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed the matter very recently with Bord na Móna.  They tell me that the experiments, the discussions and the debate on the future use of bogs can go ahead up to another ten years before firm decisions are arrived at and before it is necessary to come to any further decision about their use.  I hope, during the ten years the discussions are to go on, that I will be keeping an eye on the matter.  I will <Col N="613" /> certainly watch very carefully the work that is being done, because there are a number of possibilities.  There is the point of view of whether the whole thing should be taken over by the Department of Lands or the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, when the bogs are ready for use, and divided up among farmers. There is also the possibility of whether Bord na Móna should change their emphasis by some future Minister introducing another amendment to the Act, allowing other things to be done besides the development of bogs which would continue to give employment to their work force.  An imminent decision is not necessary for up to another ten years.</P>
    <P>I was interested in the point raised by Deputy Gallagher that at one time they were told that trees could not be grown on bogs but that now this has changed.  A point we all have to bear in mind is that yesterday's laws do not apply today, that we must keep on looking at things and revising our assessment of what is possible or what is even desirable.  Perhaps in five years' time, because of improved technology in the meantime, something which does not seem possible now may be possible then.  We must keep an open mind and, when the times comes, make the decision, see that sufficient research is done into the matter in the meantime to make sure that the decision then made is the right one.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned&mdash;I think it was Deputy McLaughlin&mdash;smaller types of machinery in bogs.  The machinery used by the co-operatives at the moment is hired out by the sugar company, not by Bord na Móna.  I am not sure if the machinery used is the minimum size to make it economical to supply.  I will bring the point made to the attention of the sugar company and ask them if anything further can be done in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Minister's Department or Bord na Móna given any serious consideration to the question of leasing bogland from farmers rather than the present system of buying it at 1944 prices?  We should have <Col N="614" /> by now a clear policy statement on this.  An Foras Talúntais and Bord na Móna have clearly shown that cutaway bogland can be reclaimed, and the returns from the experimental plots at Lullymore, in relation to beet and vegetables, clearly show that there is a very high level of production.  In the national interest we must think of putting back the 5,000 or 6,000 acres of cutaway bogland into production.</P>
      <P>I do not believe we should opt for a system of State farming because the mentality here is not suited to it.  The only real example of this type of development we have had over the last 50 years is in Russia where, if we are to take the harvest into account, it clearly shows that that system of State farming has failed.  I hope that Bord na Móna, with the help of the Minister, will define a clear policy statement on what will be the outcome of this land.  It is quite obvious that the cutaway bogs which Bord na Móna are acquiring, either by agreement or compulsory acquisition over the last few years for sums of between £3 to £40 per acre, are worth up to £400 and more an acre once they are reclaimed. I am in favour of Bord na Móna leasing the land for a definite or indefinite number of years from farmers.  They could easily afford to pay the very same price for the leasing period as they are at present paying in compensation. We would not then have the problem of deciding what will be done with the land when the board no longer have any use for it.</P>
      <P>I compliment Bord na Móna and An Foras Talúntais for the excellent work they have done in this regard. The experiments made show that we have in the reclaimed land a byproduct which was not visualised when the board was set up.  I want to compliment the administration and the management of Bord na Móna for the excellent progress they have made in the development of so many bogs, especially in my constituency of Leix-Offaly, and for the very worthwhile employment they are giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe Bord na Móna mind who takes on work, but I understand that quite a number of people <Col N="615" /> who are on vacation from full-time employment take on temporary work with the board.  I know this is a good physical activity, but, with over 100,000 people unemployed, people in full-time employment should not be given such holiday employment. I am not talking about the many students who get a wonderful opportunity during the summer months of working for Bord na Móna.  They derive financial benefit from this but it is also a very good physical exercise for them.  It gives them a great opportunity of working on the bogs, instead of working abroad.  This is a benefit to their development.  Nevertheless there are a number of people who, while on holidays from full-time jobs do summer work which could provide employment for others who need it more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To what extent have the experiments in cutaway bogs been carried out?  What acreage was involved? These experiments have been an acknowledged success and an export market is developing, particularly in small shrubs, plants and vegetables to some degree.  Unlike Deputy McDonald, in my opinion the board are the people best equipped to carry out this development in the immediate future. They will provide more employment for people with a farming background. To what extent are they planning to develop this?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the development of the bogs would be somewhat restricted because of the surrounding areas yet to be cut.  In the thousands of acres in the midland areas which are already cut away, I can visualise the growing of vegetables and plants being intensified.  That would give a great deal of employment because a high ratio of employees would be needed.  Maybe in the future land could be leased to private individuals for development, but to get the maximum benefit from the bogs, particularly at the present time when there is a need to create jobs, the board should go full steam ahead with this development.</P>

      <Col N="616" /> I do not think it is envisaged that the sugar company should provide the machines for bog development. In my constituency a co-operative was formed and they acquired one or two small turf-cutting machines but the sugar company was not involved. More assistance by way of grants for the purchase of these machines could be given to these groups.  In the co-operative I mentioned, a great deal of turf has been cut and stacked near the power station at Milltown Malbay. Many of these co-operatives are being set up in counties, mainly the western counties, and they should be encouraged by means of grants for the purchase of machines for the development of privately owned bogs.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the discussions on energy at EEC level? How much has bog or turf been discussed? I read some EEC reports lately and noticed that coal was discussed at great length and coke to some extent.  I did not notice any mention of turf.  I presume we are the only country of the Nine producing turf.  It would be interesting to know what discussions, if any, have taken place within the EEC on this subject.  This would enable us to find out if we can benefit further from our membership.  Even though other members would not be involved, it would be in the interests of the Community to help us produce cheaper energy.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us on this?</P>

      <P>This is very important but seems to be sidestepped all the time, both by the Department of Local Government and the Department of Transport and Power.  The grants available under the local improvements scheme are not adequate. Particularly in the area I represent, there are large tracts of virgin bog available for cutting by local farmers. There is no problem getting a machine to cut these bogs.  Often a <Col N="617" /> machine can gain access to these bogs where a person could not wheel an empty wheelbarrow.  It is wonderful to see where these machines can go.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the people cannot use these bogs to the fullest extent because they cannot bring in their tractors, or even a donkey and cart, to take out the turf.  As a result, they have to leave the turf there.  This year they succeeded in getting a considerable amount of turf cut because the summer was so dry, and they were able to wheel out the turf.  In my view, the Department of Transport and Power should assume responsibility for this job and ensure that access roads are made available.</P>
      <P>Drainage is also very important.  In the last two years I have seen bogs developed which were cut by machines but unless they are drained the people will continue to cut the top off them leaving the best turf after them.  The responsible Department will have to carry out a major drainage scheme in those bogs and ensure that the surplus water is taken away.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned cutaway bogs.  A report on my area was issued some years ago which showed that if the amount of bogs were cut, it would yield a pool of 75,000 acres of land. This would be a great contribution in an area where the people depend solely on the land for their livelihood. This very important matter should be looked into.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister or Bord na Móna any method where they take an option on a bog in a particular area?  My reason for asking this is because at the moment in an area not too far from the development at Ballincorrig there seems to be a tendency for speculators to buy large tracts of bog.  This may be a problem for the Department of Lands as well as the Department of Transport and Power.  As far as these people are concerned this is an investment and they have no intention of carrying out any development.  They are buying bogs cheaply.  They offer a farmer £1,000 and he considers he is doing very well in disposing of his bog.  The buyer is not a farmer.  He is a speculator. <Col N="618" /> He is buying the bog as an investment, sitting on it in the hope that its value will increase and he will gain a nice dividend when he disposes of it.</P>
      <P>Is there any question of water and air pollution as a result of work carried out on bogs?  I think Deputy Callanan and some other Member referred to this.  In carrying out experiments do Bord na Móna ensure against pollution of both water and air?</P>

      <P>One of the most important developments in regard to Bord na Móna is decentralisation of their headquarters.  The headquarters should be sited in the midlands, in Laois or Offaly, where the bulk of the products they handle are situated.  Such decentralisation would lead to greater convenience and to economy, to say nothing of better management.  The Minister may think I am being parochial. I am not.  This is a move that should be made instead of having personnel and employees travelling up to Dublin for the purposes of discussions. All the briquette factories are sited in Laois-Offaly, Shannonbridge, Portar-lington, Rhode, Ferbane and so on. Decentralisation would result in better economy.  It would be more practical. I understand yet another briquette factory is planned for somewhere in the south.  The headquarters of Bord na Móna should be sited in either Tullamore or Portlaoise.  The Minister should discuss this with the board with a view to an early decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tribute must be paid to those responsible for moss peat development. Export sales reached a figure of £2,798,763 showing an increase of 23 <Col N="619" /> per cent over the previous year.  There was a 10 per cent increase in 1973-74. This is a very important export.  There are markets in Britain, in the Channel Islands and elsewhere.  I hope we see continued expansion in this field.  There is a tremendous potential.</P>
    <P>I wonder have we been investing enough capital in Bord na Móna in recent years.  From the point of view of national security it is vitally essential that Bord na Móna should expand. I think this is the eighth year now in which no provision has been made for capital investment.  If turf development is to continue the board must be given sufficient capital to develop.  I doubt if this Bill would be before us today were it not for the oil crisis some years ago. There is no doubt that the ESB has become too heavily dependent on oil, and the generation of electricity from turf is most important.  It is heartening to know that an extra 40,000 acres of bog will be developed.  In regard to turf development&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will conclude in a few moments.  In regard to the price of bogland it was mentioned in this House on Thursday last that a sum of £1 was known to be paid by Bord na Móna for an acre of bogland.  I can vouch for that.  When a bog has been developed a very important question arises.  All of us in this House will have to reach a decision in the not too distant future as to what is to happen to bogland when it has been cut away.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDonald spoke about Bord na Móna leasing bogs rather than buying them.  Bord na Móna say it would be wholly impracticable to do this and that the simplest way to carry on the operation is to acquire the fee simple of the bog and thereby have full control of the total bog area.</P>
      <P>As regards access roads the scheme administered by the Department of Local Government calls for the co-operation of the local authorities.  The latter undertake the repair of roads and receive grants from the Department of Local Government.  This is more practical than, as was originally done, the Department of Transport and Power making their own grants available for the repairing of roads. The only way the Department of Transport and Power are involved is in four specific instances in four specific counties of roads leading to power stations, that is, in Kerry, in Donegal, in Clare and in Galway. There are four small power stations there and my Department make a grant available for the repair of these roads through the local authorities. They are not concerned with the ordinary development of other roads within country council areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett spoke about the attitude towards peat in the EEC.  At our request the Commission have agreed to include turf in their energy strategy proposals for the period ahead on an equal footing with coal. If any facilities are being given to coal or if any grants are made available for the development of coal we will be pushing to see that the same grants and facilities are accorded to <Col N="621" /> turf.  It has an equal standing in the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright spoke about the removal of the headquarters of Bord na Móna from Dublin.  This has been looked at a few times, but the number of staff employed by Bord na Móna in Dublin, relative to their total operation, is very small and, of course, they will have to maintain a presence in Dublin because they have to do various things here in liaison with various Departments&mdash;my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Public Service and so on.  Therefore they would be maintaining staff here anyway and it is thought that the most practical thing to do is to retain this very small headquarters staff here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also asked what progress had been made in regard to cutaway bogs and what the position now is.  In the last year a further 240 acres of grassland have been developed bringing the total developed area to approximately 700 acres.  Deputy Enright spoke of it, and many other Deputies are conscious of what Bord na Móna have been doing in this regard.  The 700 acres, taken in the context of 140,000 which they are developing, is a very small amount of development.  I do not think Deputy Enright was present when I said that no final decision has been taken yet and I am advised by Bord na Móna that it will be a number of years before the necessity for a final decision will arise.  In the meantime the discussion, argument and debate should go on as to what is the best use to be made of these cutaway bogs.</P>
    <P>The 700 acres are spread over Cluain Sosta, Loilgheach Mór, Doire Dhraighneach and Abhainn Rinne.  A new feed lot with a capacity of 200 cattle was constructed at Doire Draighneach, County Offaly, and extensions to the cattle feed lot at Cluain Sosta, County Offaly, and the sheep feed lot at Abhainn Rinne, County Mayo, were completed.  From the feed lot at Cluain Sosta 240 beef cattle were produced for slaughter giving a satisfactory performance from both grazing and silage feeding <Col N="622" /> operations.  The sheep flock at Abhainn Rinne, County Mayo, was extended to 750 breeding ewes supported by 200 acres of cutaway pasture. Seventy calves were produced by the 80 cow breeding herd at Loilgheach Mór and a second breeding herd of 120 cows was established at Doire Draighneach.</P>

      <P>It is vital that any money that is being made available to Bord na Móna should come from within the sterling area because of the difference that will keep recurring as the pound drops and this having to be made good.

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if there is any precedent other than the Galway Corporation decision in 1974 (details supplied) for refusal of consent to the sale of a purchased local authority house on the ground that the purchaser was not a member of the working classes requiring the house for his or her own occupation; and, if so, if he will give details of any precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="625" />
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the procedures to be adopted in deciding whether an intending purchaser of a local authority house, which was constructed under the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, requires the house for his own occupation; and if he considers that the consent to such sale should be withheld on the ground that the purchaser is adequately housed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>Under the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919 my consent is required to the terms of leases made by local authorities, and unless an amendment to the terms of the original lease is proposed I have no further function in the matter.  I am therefore unaware of any precedent such as that referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The question of the procedures to be adopted in deciding whether or not to consent to an application for resale is a matter for the local authority in whose estate the dwelling is situated, and in reaching their decision the authority are bound by the terms of the lease.</P>
      <P>In the particular case to which the Deputy has referred the terms of the lease specify that the local authority's consent can only be given where resale of the house is made to a person for his or her own occupation.  As the local authority had consented three years ago to the sale of another dwelling in their estate to the intending purchaser, they decided following consideration with their legal advisers that having regard to the terms of the lease, they could not consent to this sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister state how the local authority should determine whether a person requires the house for his or her own occupation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the local authority decides that if a person is living in one house he does not require a second one, as he cannot live in both at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="626" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the interpretation, then, that a person should not be the owner of two houses?  The Minister will realise that the person might require the house that he intended to purchase for his own occupation but because he is the owner of another house the sale is being withheld; it is not because he intends living or not in the house that he would like to purchase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authority houses are erected for the housing of certain people, and if somebody is allowed to purchase one local authority house, apparently, it is considered not correct to allow him to purchase a second local authority house.  Otherwise, he might possibly build up a string of local authority houses which could be used for purposes other than those for which they were erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if that is the real interpretation of the section and if that is the way it is being applied; that what is really intended is that a person should not be the owner of more than one house because the technicality of whether or not he requires it for his own occupation, as the Minister appreciates, could be argued for a long time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the County Manager has informed members of Galway County Council that no new works can be undertaken by the council in 1975 due to the inadequate capital allocation for major water supply and sewerage schemes; and if he will increase the allocation already made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that contract documents are being prepared by Galway County Council for water supply and sewerage schemes estimated at a cost of £930,800; and if, in view of this, he will increase the capital allocation for these works from £122,000, as £105,000 of this amount had already been expended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he has received a request for an increased capital allocation for sanitary services works from Galway County Council; and, if so, when a decision will be made on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that the provision of capital for a sanitary services scheme is considered only when such a scheme has been fully approved and is ready to commence and a loan has been sanctioned.  This is not the case in any of the schemes making up to total of £930,800 referred to.</P>
      <P>The capital allocation for 1975 notified to Galway County Council on 16th May relates to expenditure on schemes which had been fully approved and for which loans had been sanctioned at the date of allocation.</P>
      <P>I have received a request from Galway County Council for an additional allocation.  The matter is under consideration, but the question of making such an allocation has to take into account the total resources available from time to time and the competing needs of all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if in determining the capital allocation to Galway County Council the Department took into consideration the fact that sanction had issued for loans for the Galway city eastern environs water scheme and the Clifden water scheme and whether these two schemes were included as being loan-sanctioned at the time the allocation was made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>All matters relating to this were taken into consideration including the matters to which the Deputy has referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>These two loans were taken as having been sanctioned at that time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the officials have expressed the view to Galway county councillors that the form which they are required to complete before the financial year starts in submitting schemes for loan sanction does not provide for schemes that can be sanctioned, say, between 1st January and the date on which the circular issued?  In this case the circular was sent out by the Department on 16th May and received by Galway County Council on 20th May.  That would not have been included in the application because it had not been sanctioned at the time that Galway County Council made the application.  That was before January 1st, but these loans were sanctioned subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputies have any special comments to make they should make them either to the Department of Local Government or to the council and report to the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I confirm that the Minister is saying that the two loans I have mentioned were in fact taken as being sanctioned when the capital allocation was being made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take it that I said that all matters affecting water schemes in Galway were taken into account when this decision was made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make funds available to allow Dublin County Council to proceed with the following schemes which have had to be deferred because of the reduction made by his Department in the estimate prepared by the County Council engineers: North Dublin water supply infill scheme, cottage sewerage programme, Blanchards-town water supply&mdash;stage 2, Baskin cottages sewerage, Garristown sewerage, Ballyboughal sewerage, Swords treatment works and Donabate sewerage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already provided some £3,031,000 towards the financing of the Dublin County Council's water <Col N="629" /> and sewerage programmes in the current year.  Of this amount £2,776,000 was related to expenditure out of loans which had been sanctioned at the date the allocations were notified, £31,000 related to expenditure on the county council's small schemes programme, and £224,000 related to expenditure on a number of new schemes which were urgently needed to service new housing development. The City and County Manager has consulted my Department regarding the possibility of financing further schemes in the current year and the matter is under examination.  It should not be forgotten, however, that sanitary services capital allocations to Dublin County Council have been very substantially increased since 1972-73 and that there must be a limit to the number of schemes which can be undertaken contemporaneously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, as expected, told us what money he had given.  I listed in the question the schemes which the county manager has advised us have to be deferred for the coming year and I should like to know if the Minister has any comment to make on that list of schemes, some of which are very urgent and some of which are half way completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody, even if he were a fool, would imagine that it is possible to complete all the schemes that need to be done here in one year.  It was never intended that that should be so and it is not possible to do it.  In case Deputy Burke has forgotten I should like to remind him that in the year 1972-73 Dublin County Council received for major schemes £1,596,720; in 1973-74, £2,442,010: in 1974, £2,278,300 and in 1975, £3 million and £31,000 for small schemes.  Dublin County Council are doing pretty well.  There is not an endless amount of money and they are getting a fair share of what is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never suggested that there was an endless amount of money.  I listed some <Col N="630" /> schemes that had gone to contract stage but for which the contract had to be deferred and I listed schemes where pipes had been laid but could not be completed because the necessary money was not being provided.  I should like to ask the Minister to reconsider these schemes urgently.  The question has been put to him by the county manager and the matter is being fought at council level.  About two months ago the Minister told me I was talking through my hat over the same question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said Deputy Burke was talking through his hat when he said that Dublin County Council had not enough money for housing when, in fact, they got £12½ million this year. With regard to the question of the water and sewerage schemes Deputy Burke must be aware that a number of schemes were started by Dublin County Council without going through the usual preliminary arrangements. The Deputy cannot blame the Department for not having the money available for some of the schemes which were started without the normal sanction. If the money can be made available Dublin County Council will get extra money but, as it stands they have got a fairly sizeable amount, a big improvement on previous years and I am afraid at present I cannot promise them more money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will make more money available from the SDA loans fund to Kilkenny County Council as the council, due to lack of finance, cannot at present make money available for the purchase of previously occupied houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The revised capital allocation for the payment of loans for both new and previously occupied houses and for supplementary grants in the current year which was notified to Kilkenny County Council on 16th July is £870,000.  I have not received any indication from the council that this amount has been fully expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, having the position in each local authority area kept under continuous review so that any <Col N="637" /> capital surplus to requirements can be reallocated to areas where a need for extra money is anticipated.  If such a need arises in Kilkenny County Council at a later stage, I will give sympathetic consideration to an application for an increased allocation in the light of the capital situation obtaining at that time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to assure the Minister that a great many applicants for supplementary grants are awaiting payment.  They have been given to understand by Kilkenny County Council that there are no funds to meet them at present.  Is it the Minister's intention to make money available for this purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I made funds amounting to £870,000 available on 16th July.  I am not aware that there is any shortage of money for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that Kilkenny County Council, and the people of Kilkenny, are availing of every effort to house themselves and that there is such a big demand.  In 1972-73 all they got was £290,076.  I have increased that, in a little over two years to £870,000.  This shows a big upsurge and I am delighted to hear it.  If I can be of any assistance in giving more money to them I will be glad to do so.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will approve the sewerage contract documents for Tullamore Urban Council in respect of New Road, Church Road and Clonminch Road, Tullamore, <Col N="638" /> County Offaly, which were sent to his Department eight months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the documents have been eight months in his Department is there any hope of getting approval in the current financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to answer that question.  If I was I would give the Deputy the answer straight off the reel.  However, I can tell the Deputy that in 1972-73 all his county got was £28,000 for Tullamore UDC capital allocation.  In 1973-74 it was nil and in 1974 £35,900.  This year they have already got £225,000.  I understand that is not enough but I am trying to point out that it is a tremendously greater amount than was given in the previous years.  The Deputy can be assured that if the money is available I will be glad to give it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has done such research on this matter can he inform me when the scheme will commence? The Minister gave us to understand in the course of a number of statements that there would be no hold up on any schemes at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say there would be no hold up on sewerage or water schemes.  During the year I said I could only make available money from the amount that is available for these schemes.  Tullamore has already received £225,000 this year as against £28,000 in 1972-73 and nothing at all in 1973-74.  They are not doing so <Col N="639" /> badly but I would be glad to help them if I could.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that under the United States of America Road Traffic Act, blind pedestrians who are using a guide dog or carrying a white cane have the right-of-way; and if he will introduce a similar measure here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I always welcome and sympathetically consider suggestions which might assist handicapped people to cope with traffic problems.  I am not convinced on the information available to me, however, that the introduction of a statutory control such as that suggested by the Deputy would be merited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister is prepared to investigate the possibility here.  Is he aware that according to statistics there are about 6,000 to 7,000 persons who are totally blind and who are aided by canes, and that lives are at daily risk when they are crossing roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree, but it would be wrong to give a false impression to persons who are blind that simply because they had a white stick in their hand or a guide dog with them they were perfectly safe in crossing a road at any time, and this impression might be gained by giving this sort of statutory authority.  It has been tested in some places and has not proved very successful.  In fact, accidents have occurred which otherwise <Col N="649" /> would not have occurred as a result of the persons being under the impression that they had rights which were no use to them because the people who were driving were not aware that they were blind.  Many sighted people walk with a stick in their hand or with a dog leading them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, in fact, in a number of countries, including some of the States, as the Deputy says, but even if it were possible or desirable there is no such regulation which could be made legally under the Road Traffic Act to cater for such a situation. Even if it were possible to do it I would have gave doubts that it would help blind people.  It might do more harm than good.  The matter is being considered by An Foras at present, but as of now I am not too happy about the suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Wyse is very anxious to see this done, I should tell him that we have consulted a number of people dealing with the blind.  Some from the National Council for the Blind stated that their people were instructed to wait for assistance crossing all streets and roads; some from the National League for the Blind stated that it would not be feasible in busy streets; it might be on country roads; there would have to be two regulations.  St. Mary's School and Home for the Blind said that the measure would undermine the self-reliance which <Col N="650" /> teaching was designed to instil.  We have not found anyone dealing with the blind who feels that this would be of further assistance to the blind.  I am sorry, but this is the information which we have got.  Therefore, Deputy Wyse can see why I am not anxious to suggest making such a change. However, the matter is still being considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not now essential to proceed with the formal designation, under section 4 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, of the secondary teacher and Garda services to enable pension rights to be transferred between these services. This arises from acceptance of a report by a Joint Offical Side/Staff Side Working Party on superannuation which recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that all service in the public service should be aggregated for pension purposes and that the provisions of the 1963 Act should be liberalised.  Accordingly, gardaí who took up secondary teaching appointments and who, to protect their Garda pension rights, remain on special leave without pay from that service, may now join the secondary teachers' superannuation scheme.  The Minister for Education has been informed accordingly and subject to his agreement and to the payment by them of the appropriate contributions, their service from the commencement of teaching service, together with their actual pensionable Garda service, will reckon for superannuation.</P>

But it is not necessary in self-evident cases for the purpose of revising a valuation to gain access to the premises.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1975 budget for the European Communities provides that the regional fund may commit <Col N="659" /> £8.08 million to projects put forward by this country.  The provision for actual payments to us from the fund has, however, been fixed at £4.04 million.</P>
      <P>As this is the first year of the fund's operations, it has taken some time to complete the necessary preliminary arrangements for the launching of the Fund.  It is only now, following the first meeting of the fund management committee at the beginning of this month, that the Commission is in a position to receive and process applications for fund assistance from member states.  Because of this, it is not possible at this stage to indicate the extent to which project approvals will have been authorised by the Commission under our commitment and payment allocations by the end of the current financial year.  This is unlikely to be clarified until early in October when the Commission is to report to the Council of Ministers on the position as it then appears in regard to the receipt and processing of applications from member states.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>That is the purpose for which they are being used, and I would point out to the Deputy that Commissioner Thomson expressed the wish that other countries would do as Ireland has done and use the money as Ireland proposes to use it.

The company now intends to rationalise operations at the works in an effort to reduce these losses.  I understand that this will mean that some 19 jobs may be affected but, in the short term, about half of the above workers will be given employment in the sugar and food factories at Mallow until January, 1976.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will ensure that officials at customs posts are aware of the correct rate of duty on goods from Northern Ireland in view of a recent incident in which an importer (name supplied) of plastic baling twine was informed at Dundalk customs post that the rate of VAT was 19.5 per cent whereas a letter from Dublin Castle indicated the correct rate as 6.75 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the Revenue Commissioners make every effort to keep their staff at customs posts fully informed about correct rates of customs duty and value-added tax.  However, occasional disputes as to the rate applicable are inevitable owing to the complexity of the customs tariff and the VAT code. In such cases an importer may opt to clear goods on deposit pending determination of the proper amount chargeable. This option was refused in the case quoted by the Deputy, and the goods had been returned to Northern Ireland at the request of the importer before the date of the letter referred to.</P>

      <P>I move the acceptance of recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 14</P>
      <P>1.  In page 15, line 28, that &ldquo;, or such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing allow,&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;years&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendation suggests that the period of time within which a family settlement should qualify under section 14 (6) should be extended from two years to three years.  That was the recommendation of Senators Ryan and Years.  It is accepted that in certain circumstances such as, for instance, geographical separation, it may not be possible to get the various interested parties to come together and that the limitation of two years would prevent deserving cases from benefiting from <Col N="693" /> the provision in subsection (6) of section 14.  Indeed, it might happen that the limitation of three years might have a similar effect.  In practice, arrangements may take a number of years to complete especially where there are large families and some of them are living abroad.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, agreed that the period of time should be extended.  In some cases a period of three years might not be adequate to provide for this possibility and to give a degree of flexibility it would be better to give the Revenue Commissioners some discretion rather than confine the period to any particular period of years.  It will normally be expected that the two year period will apply but the interested parties may inform the commissioners of any difficulties which they encounter and on the basis of the facts the commissioners will allow a suitable extension of time.  I trust the House will find the recommendation acceptable.</P>

      <P>This recommendation seems reasonable to me having regard to the circumstances that can arise.  It is conceivable that in some circumstances the period required would be longer than two years and even, as the Minister said, in some cases longer than three years.  I feel, therefore, to allow the Revenue Commissioners discretion to extend the time by notice in writing is probably the only practical way to deal with the problem.  I support this recommendation.</P>

      <P Just="Center">SCHEDULE 4</P>
      <P>2.  In page 74, paragraph 11 (1) (d), that &ldquo;other than shares quoted on a stock exchange&rdquo; be inserted after &ldquo;clause (a), (b) or (c)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> The operation of paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 is confined to particular items.  These include</P>
    <P>shares in a company deriving their value or the greater part of their value directly or indirectly from assets specified in clause (a), (b) or (c).</P>
    <P>This wording is similar to the wording in subsection (8) (a) of section 4 which relates to the charge on non-residents, except that the words &ldquo;other than shares quoted on a stock exchange&rdquo; which appeared in the latter subsection are not in subparagraph 1 (d) of paragraph 11 of Schedule 4, page 74.  When paragraph 11 was being drafted it was felt that to ask the purchaser of shares from a non-resident vendor to establish whether the shares were quoted or not might give him some slight difficulty and there was concern to make the purchasers task as easy as possible.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate in the Seanad on this point it was urged that it is more than likely that purchasers or, in any event, their advisers will know if stocks are quoted and the extent to which a person may be saved time and trouble may well be out-weighed by some degree of inconvenience to the vendor.  In addition, the difference in wording between subsection (8) (a) and subparagraph 1 (b) of paragraph 11 of Schedule 4 may cause some confusion.  In the circumstances it is considered that the wording of the two provisions should correspond.  To acheve this, I recommended in the Seanad in deference to representations made, that the words &ldquo;other than shares quoted on a stock exchange&rdquo; should be incorporated into subparagraph (1) (d) of paragraph 11 of Schedule 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some doubts about this recommendation because it does not seem to me that the Minister has adverted to the primary point which is involved.  Under this paragraph in general there is a provision that in the case of a sale of certain property effectively by non-residents there will be a certain procedure followed to ensure that such non-resident does not, in effect, abscond without paying capital gains tax.  I do <Col N="695" /> not think the Minister's remarks adverted to the possibility of such a person leaving the jurisdiction without paying capital gains tax where the property being sold consisted of shares quoted on a stock exchange.  It may be that in practice the Minister thinks such an eventuality unlikely.  If he thinks it unlikely he ought to have spelt out to us why he thinks that is so.</P>
      <P>I have no particular objection to the recommendation except that I would like to be satisfied that there is a good reason for exempting from the provisions applying under this paragraph to various other items such as:</P>
      <P>(a)  land in the State;</P>
      <P>(b)  minerals in the State or any rights, interests or other assets in relation to mining or minerals...</P>
      <P>(c)  exploration or exploitation rights in a designated area;</P>
      <P>(d)  goodwill of a trade carried on in the State.</P>
      <P>All of those items are being subjected to the procedure laid down in this paragraph.  The effect of this recommendation is to exempt from that procedure shares quoted on a stock exchange.  As I have said I am not opposed to that concept but I do think that before we accept it the Minister ought to explain to the House why he thinks it is not necessary to apply the whole concept of paragraph (11) to shares quoted on a stock exchange.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Minister that the heading of this paragraph&mdash;Disposal of Certain Assets by non-Residents&mdash;was appropriate originally but it is not now appropriate since the paragraph applies on its face to all persons, resident or non-resident.  It may be too late to do anything about it but the heading is misleading.  However, the matter before us is recommendation No. 2 from the Seanad to which, as I have said, I am not opposed but I think it requires further explanation from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's consideration is very touching.  The Minister said, when speaking on this amendment, that the suggestion made by me that he was introducing the wealth tax a year earlier than indicated in the White Paper was nonsense. I regret that the Minister said that because we had a lengthy discussion <Col N="698" /> on this very point on an earlier amendment.  At that time the Minister for Lands was deputising for the Minister for Finance in regard to wealth tax.  I understand why this has to happen although I suggest it is one of the consequences of bringing the wealth tax in a year earlier than was originally indicated.  Because of this, what I may call boxing and coxing between the two Ministers, we spent considerable time in dealing with this point.  The Minister for Finance did not have the opportunity of hearing this discussion.  I doubt if having heard the discussion he would say with quite such confidence that this suggestion was nonsense.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over all of the ground again, but in view of what the Minister said I think it is necessary to briefly draw his attention to page 45 of the White Paper on capital taxation issued by the Minister for Finance on the 28th February, 1974. In paragraph 93 on page 45 it states:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April.</P>
      <P>On page 60 of the White Paper under the heading &ldquo;Annual Wealth Tax&rdquo; it says:</P>
      <P>The date of commencement will be 6th April, 1975.</P>
      <P>That sentence occurs in a paragraph at the end of the White Paper which is headed Introduction of New Taxes. It deals with the various taxes proposed&mdash;capital gains tax, gift tax, inheritance tax and wealth tax, indicating when each of them would commence.  The significant thing is that the date in each case, other than the wealth tax, is a date before the tax year 1975-76.  After the sentence which I have read out: Annual Wealth Tax: The date of commencement will be 6 April, 1975, there occurs the following:</P>
      <P>The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the wealth tax were to operate as indicated in the Bill on the 5th of <Col N="699" /> April, 1975, that sentence would read:</P>
    <P>The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1974-75.</P>
    <P>But that is not what is says.  It says 1975-76 and it says the commencement will be the 6th of April, 1975, having indicated earlier that the likely valuation date would be the 5th of April.  I suggest that there can be no other reasonable reading of what is stated in the White Paper but that it was intended that the first valuation date under the wealth tax legislation would be 5th April, 1976.  To say, as the Minister did, that he was pressed to introduce the wealth tax legislation does not, of course, contradict this at all: people were anxious to see the final terms of the Wealth Tax Bill so that they would know where they stood.  The passing of the Bill with the first valuation date being 5th April, 1976, as indicated in the White Paper would have been the right course. People would have known where they stood; everybody concerned including the Revenue Commissioners would have known the precise form of the legislation and there would have been a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the operation of the wealth tax. In addition, this House and its staff and its Members would have been spared a number of unnecessarily long sittings and the imposition of a guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister decided for whatever reason that, contrary to what he had stated in the White Paper, he would introduce the wealth tax, as I said, a year earlier than indicated in the White Paper.  That being so, the reason for this amendment and the following one, No. 11, which I think we are discussing with it, becomes clear because what it seeks to do is to give an opportunity to individuals who would be affected to rearrange their affairs in accordance with the new legislation.  Failure to do that is not alone in breach of what was indicated in the White Paper but it is, in effect, a penal provision applying to persons whose property was comprised either in a discretionary trust or in a private, <Col N="700" /> non-trading company.  The changeover in the manner in which their property may be held can involve them in legal costs in some cases, in stamp duty and in some cases liability to capital gains tax and gift tax.  All of this I would suggest is something that is occurring because, for whatever reason, the Minister and his colleagues decided to introduce the wealth tax a year earlier than they indicated in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I shall not speculate on the reasons for that decision, but the fact is that anybody reading the provisions of the White Paper as I have outlined them could not come to any other conclusion than the one that the wealth tax first valuation date would be 5th April, 1976.  That is not what is in the Bill; it says 5th April, 1975.  Therefore, the case for this amendment becomes all the stronger.</P>
    <P>I have not any great confidence from what the Minister has said that he is even contemplating acceptance of this amendment.  That is his prerogative. But I think it is important that it should be demonstrated that the Minister is not doing this blindly, unaware of the consequences; that the consequences have been drawn to his attention in this House and that he is still persisting in refusing to make a provision of the kind suggested in this amendment.  It is also important that it should be spelled out in this House, as it has been, precisely what was stated by the Minister in the White Paper and the extent to which he is departing from that in relation to the commencement date for the wealth tax with all the consequences that are flowing from that decision, consequences affecting this House and affecting many people outside this House too.</P>
    <P>We have done that in relation to this amendment and so far as we in the Opposition are concerned that is all we can do, but the consequences are consequences not of acts or omissions of the Opposition but of a conscious decision made by the Minister and his colleagues knowing precisely what the consequences would be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 26 and 27, but in section 6, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  This section shall not apply to a private non-trading company where all the property, wheresoever situate, to which the company is beneficially entitled in possession consists of stock or shares in a body or bodies corporate other than a body corporate which is a private non-trading company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There were some amendments made to this section designed to ensure that the treatment provided in the Bill for private non-trading companies would not be applied where the private non-trading company was controlled by a trading company.  I think that amendment was properly made having regard to commercial circumstances and the way business is operated here.  However, there may be a further loophole of that kind that needs to be covered.  That is why I put down this amendment.  To illustrate what I have in mind, if one assumes, say, that there are five trading companies owned and operated in effect by the one group of people it is a very common practice, particularly with public companies&mdash;but it also applies to private companies&mdash;to have a holding company for the purpose of convenience of administration and presentation of accounts.  In that holding company would be vested all the shares in the various trading companies.  The holding company is, of course, a non-trading company.  In the case that we are dealing with here it is a private non-trading company.  This is certainly common and in many cases it is good business practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that we ought in this Bill to do anything which would unnecessarily interfere with good business practice.  It seems to me that if the Bill is left as it is it could well be that there might be double taxation involved once in the case of the trading company's shares, in the example I have outlined, and then in the case of the holding company and all its assets being taxed as a unit, or at the <Col N="702" /> very least, that the shareholders in the trading company may lose the benefits of thresholds, or indeed one might have both results.  But whatever way it works out, it seems to me that the amendment which was made earlier by the Minister designed to take a private non-trading company out of the relevant section where it was controlled by a trading company requires the converse which is proposed in this amendment that is, where a private non-trading company has assets which consist wholly of stocks or shares in a trading company, then that the same approach should be made and that the private non-trading company should be taken out of the relevant section and should be dealt with in the same way as a trading company is dealt with.  I hope the Minister will agree that this amendment is necessary or be able to demonstrate that it is not necessary because the effect of the provisions of the Bill will be that a private, non-trading company in circumstances similar to those outlined will not be subjected to the treatment laid down in the Bill in general for private, non-trading companies.</P>
    <P>However, as the Bill stands, I cannot see that it provides accordingly.  If the Minister can demonstrate to the contrary I will be quite satisfied with that, but, if not, I hope he will find it possible to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 6 makes a private non-trading company liable as a taxable entity with the result that the property of the company is chargeable to wealth tax.  The assets of the company are liable to tax, and if these assets are eligible for certain exemptions and reliefs they get the benefit of those exemptions and reliefs.  The Deputy's amendment proposes that the section should not apply to a private non-trading company, all of whose assets consist of stocks and shares in companies other than private, non-trading companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 7, subsection (1) (e) shares of a private, non-trading company which have borne tax are exempt from wealth tax.  The practical effect of Deputy Colley's amendment therefore would be that any private non-trading company whose <Col N="703" /> assets consist exclusively of stocks and shares would not be liable as a taxable entity irrespective of whether the shares were Irish or foreign.  I regret that the amendment is not acceptable for the following reasons.  First of all, for the effective administration of the tax it has been found necessary to make private non-trading companies and discretionary trusts liable as entities. Secondly, granted the necessity for this approach&mdash;and I think it cannot seriously be disputed&mdash;there are no grounds for the global exemption of property, such as stocks and shares alone from the tax while in the hands of a private non-trading company. Shares which are held by such companies in other private non-trading companies are exempted to avoid an element of double taxation since the latter are themselves liable to tax.

      <P>If I understand the Deputy's amendment correctly he is dealing with companies where all the property is held in stocks and shares.

      <P>I think if the principle is to be accepted it would have to be extended to meet cases where a large proportion is held in such shares.  If it were to be extended it would give rise to difficult problems as to apportionment.  Acceptance of the amendment would involve the valuation of shares in a private non-trading company.  It would thus revive all those tax mitigation problems and administrative difficulties that we have sought to avoid by making the <Col N="704" /> private non-trading company a taxable entity.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister sits down could I ask him in the case I have outlined, say, foreign trading companies, in which all the shares are held in a holding company, how would the tax be applied to such an operation?  Would it be applied to the shareholders in the trading company or would it be applied to the private, non-trading company as an entity. And then all the shares would be vested in the non-trading company, the holding company?  So there would not be shareholders to tax in that sense.</P>

      <P>I can understand that, but it seems to me that that would lead to the dissolution of these non-trading companies.  If the benefit of the threshold was not available what is the point of this?  I cannot see where evasion can come in in creating non-trading companies for the purpose of acquiring other companies.  It seems that the principle should be followed through and that the actual owners of the shares in a non-trading company are the people who should be directly taxable on their holdings rather than the company.  I cannot see the reason why the Minister is making this distinction between the shareholders in a trading company who would be directly liable for the shares they would hold provided that trading company did not belong to a non-trading company.  I cannot see why, in the other circumstances, if a non-trading company holds all of the shares in a trading company, or even a part, the ownership of those shares should not be taxable and allowed whatever threshold is involved in their own case whether they are married or single. Perhaps, the Minister has some secret of evasion that I am not aware of.</P>

The Minister thinks there would be a certain amount of evasion here.  I have no time for people who use non-trading companies to avoid income tax.  In the past these companies were formed specifically for tax avoidance of various descriptions but there are also genuine non-trading companies that should not be put into the same category.  We know that top professional people through the years have given advice to companies as regards the tax avoidance system where these non-trading companies were concerned, but there are genuine non-trading companies holding assets on behalf of trading companies that should be taken into consideration here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment covers the private non-trading company which itself is controlled by a trading company.  What this is seeking to do is to exempt the private non-trading company whose assets consist solely of a trading company or a number of trading companies.  It is the obverse of what is in the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>I must confess I am mystified at the Minister's rejection of this amendment. He has made it clear that the Bill does not cover the case I am trying to cover.  Therefore, what is at issue is, should we make this amendment or should we not?  I am mystified because I do not think the Minister has indicated any real fear that this could be exploited by way of avoidance.  In fact, I can see no way that it could be. It is so drafted, as the Minister pointed out, as to apply only where all of the assets of the private non-trading company consist of stock or shares in a trading company.  It is specifically worded that way so as to prevent any avoidance and to cover genuine cases which exist, and of which the Minister must be aware of, a group of trading companies which, for the purpose of convenience of administration and accounts, have all the shares vested in a holding company.  This, as the Minister knows, is a common arrangement. There are good business reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that it is wrong that this Bill ought to change those structures which exist for good business reasons.  This Bill ought not to bring about a change in such a structure unless there is a good reason for it and I do not think there is any good reason.  The Minister has made it clear in his amendment, which is now contained in subsection (5) of section <Col N="709" /> 6, that his intention is that where there is a private non-trading company which itself is controlled by a trading company then the restrictions of section 6 do not apply to it.  If that is so, and if there is a good reason for that, and there is, why is there not an equally good reason for applying the same treatment where a holding company controls trading companies and nothing else, but it is purely a device for the convenience of administration and accounts in respect of trading companies?</P>
    <P>The Minister has made it clear in the amendment to which I have referred to, and generally in the Bill, that in his view the assets of trading companies should be taxed in the hands of the shareholders and if the shareholders are liable then they get the benefit of the thresholds.  We are dealing here with a situation in which effectively what is involved is the assets of a trading company.  Where the non-trading company comes in is solely as a holding company for administrative convenience but in substance we are dealing with the assets of trading companies.  The amendment is seeking to apply in those cases the same treatment as the Minister proposes to apply in the ordinary case of trading companies or in the case, as I have indicated in subsection (5), even where there is a private non-trading company, the Minister has provided in subsection (5) that where that is controlled by a trading company then the trading company procedure, if I may call it that, is applied.</P>
    <P>There is no reason that I can see why the same thing should not be done in the case I am talking about. Perhaps I did not make the case clear and the Minister did not understand precisely what I was seeking to do in this amendment because I can see no reason why it should not be done.  I can see no possibility of avoidance and I can see considerable difficulty arising for genuine trading operations unless this amendment is made.  No good reason other than, possibly, a misunderstanding on the part of the Minister as to what is involved here. I urge the Minister to consider again what is involved in this amendment <Col N="710" /> and whether there is any possibility whatever of avoidance, having regard to the wording of the amendment, whether there is any good reason why the same treatment should not be applied to a private non-trading company which itself is controlled by a trading company as would be applied to a trading company which is controlled by a private non-trading company. Are we not dealing with the same thing?  Why should there be any difference in approach?</P>
    <P>I am mystified and I suspect it may be due to a misunderstanding that the Minister is taking the line he is.  I am urging him, even within the exigencies of the rules of debate on Report Stage, to indicate that he has given some further consideration to the points I am putting forward because I am convinced there is a misunderstanding here in regard to what is involved.  I am equally convinced that non-acceptance of the amendment will lead to considerable difficulty for genuine businesses, properly and efficiently conducted, and there is no good reason why such difficulties should be created. There are no good reasons either as regards dangers of avoidance or as regards the principles which the Minister is seeking to apply in the Bill. The amendment is merely applying the same principles as the Minister is applying in virtually the same circumstances. In one case, and the Minister has put this in himself, where the private non-trading company is controlled by a trading company he takes a particular line.  I am suggesting he should take the same line where the trading company is controlled by a private non-trading company, with the built-in provisions against avoidance because it applies only where all of the assets consist, in effect, of stocks or shares in a trading company or more than one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion is that if we have moved in one direction we should move in the opposite direction here.  A trading company may hold a private non-trading company but all those assets will be reflected in the share value of the principal trading company eventually and, obviously, in the shares of the individual shareholders.  In the case of a private holding company owning a trading company the shareholders of that holding company are themselves private individuals.  If they want to get the advantages of the private thresholds which are available, they can easily dissolve the company.  It is not necessary for the purpose of good business to have a company owning shares.  It is not essential.  I know some of these operations existed in the past, but <Col N="712" /> there are many what I might call artificial legal institutions under existing law which will have little relevance under the new law but this does not mean that the present ones have any particular virtue or that there are the same reasons for maintaining them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have had under consideration yesterday's report of the adjudicating committee of the Employer-Labour Conference.  The Government note that it appears to the committee that the Government, as employer, were in breach of clause 10 of the national agreement which deals with the findings of the Labour Court and public service arbitration boards by declaring that in the period pending discussions in the councils they would not approve of any further special improvements apart from certain pipeline cases.  They note also that the committee had not received any complaint of failure to implement the findings.</P>
      <P>In regard to the complaint about the application of the Government's decision at conciliation level, the Government note that the adjudication committee have not found that the withholding of offers in the period up to the discussions in the Employer-Labour Conference was in breach of the national agreement.  The Government had suggested on 26th June that there should be early discussions in the Employer-Labour Conference on adjustments to the national agreement which would include a suspension of further special improvements. It is the Government's earnest wish that these discussions should begin at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's position as regards special pay increases, that is, those payments <Col N="715" /> made to certain groups of workers in addition to the standard increases of the national agreement, has already been publicly explained. The Government are concerned to protect jobs, to wind down inflation, to see that the burdens now called for in the public interest, are shared as equitably as possible.  The Government's actions in respect of special pay increases are a crucial part of the anti-inflation package announced in the financial statement of 26th June.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, I would suggest, a sad occasion when we find the Government of the day, whichever Government, are found to be in breach of the National Pay Agreement.  The implications of such a finding I would suggest are quite serious for the future of national pay agreements in general.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House have clearly established that the steps which the Government are now taking to reduce the consumer price index should have been taken a considerable time ago, and we urged them to do so.  In particular, they should have been taken in the January budget.  However, given the fact that they were not then taken and that the Government announced the steps only in June, it seems quite clear that the correct course for the Government at that time was to have negotiated the precise terms that they sought to have incorported in an amendment of the national agreement so that there would have been no doubt in anybody's mind as to what was involved either on the part of the Government or on the part of the Employer-Labour Conference in the new terms or adjusted terms to be negotiated in the national pay agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We said at the time of the June budget that the whole concept of the budget was based on a gamble.  That gamble appears to have gone wrong. It is not in anybody's interest that it should go wrong.  Indeed, given the situation as it is now, we on this side of the House have indicated our belief that the national interest requires a renegotiation of the national agreement, that this is vitally important to the future of this country.  We have <Col N="716" /> indicated our support for the Government's efforts in that direction in the terms indicated by the Leader of this party when speaking on the budget.</P>
    <P>It is, however, becoming increasingly difficult for the Opposition to give the support which a responsible Opposition will give in a matter of such vital national importance when we are faced with such inept handling of the whole problem involved: inept in the sense that the negotiations did not take place when they should have, inept in the sense that the Minister for Finance announced various measures to reduce the consumer price index and then threatened to withdraw them if certain things were not done, and inept in the sense of his announcement on the crucial part of the Government's package&mdash;the matter which has now been found to be in breach of the national pay agreement. On 26th June, in the course of the budget statement as reported in the Dáil Official Report at columns 1950 and 1951 the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>It would, in the Government's view, heighten social tensions and cause serious inequity if particular groups were to get special extra increases at a time when workers generally are being asked to accept restraint.  Furthermore, as we know, some firms have already indicated that they may not be able to pay even the standard increases of the 1975 agreement.</P>
    <P>The plain facts are that, in our present circumstances, any group can secure special increases only at the expense of others and that those most secure in their jobs are in the best position to press sectional claims.  The Government consider it crucial as part of the fight to slow inflation and protect jobs, that any modification of the standard increases of the 1975 National Agreement should be accompanied by an embargo on special increases.  This will, no doubt, be covered in the forthcoming Employer-Labour Conference discussions and it is the Government's earnest hope that, in the national interest, the parties will be <Col N="717" /> able to reach quick agreement on this provision.</P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to announce an embargo on special increases, that announcement being the subject of the submission to and adjudication by the adjudication committee of the Employer-Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the ineptitude with which the Government have handled this whole matter has made an already very difficult situation much worse, and that the ineptitude of which many of us on this side of the House are aware in regard to many other problems is quite clear to the general public in regard to this matter because everybody can see for himself or herself how the Government failed to secure what they considered, according to the Minister for Finance, to be crucial before making the announcements that they made and how, in the course of the announcements made, the Minister breached the national agreement. I want to suggest that the statement which we have just heard to-day is an equal example of the ineptitude with which this Government are approaching all of our economic problems. I say that because it seems to me &mdash;I am putting it as mildly as I can&mdash; to be less than encouraging to have the Minister for Finance make a statement as he did now which does not indicate clearly one way or the other what lines the Government are taking.</P>
    <P>The Minister did me the courtesy of giving me a copy of the statement beforehand and I read it a number of times.  I must confess that I am not at all clear as to what the Minister was intending to convey.  I think, on analysing two paragraphs in it, that what the Minister is saying is that no matter what the adjudication committee of the Employer-Labour Conference says, the Government regard it as essential to carry on with the line they took on budget day and to continue the embargo on special increases. I think that that is what the Minister is saying but it is not at all clear.  It may be that the Minister wants to be in a position to argue that he is not saying that and that he is saying the other thing, depending <Col N="718" /> on what is going to happen.  It may be that the Government in their consideration of this situation were unable themselves to reach agreement and therefore that this is meant to be a kind of a holding statement. Whatever the reason for it I want to suggest that the time has passed when we can afford this kind of blurring of the edges.  This is a time for leadership. This is a time for the Government to make up their minds as to where they are going and where they want the people to go behind them, not for the Minister to be coming in here and reading out a statement which the Government say is crucial and leaving people in the position that they do not know what line the Government are taking.  In my view it would be far better if the Government made no statement than one that says nothing.</P>
    <P>Either the Government should have said here: &ldquo;We accept the finding of the adjudication committee and we will abide by it.  We hope that negotiations will produce a situation where what we want will be done but in the meantime we are going to accept the arrangements in the national wage agreement.&rdquo;  Or they should have said: &ldquo;The country cannot afford to accept this and therefore we are going to do so and so.&rdquo;  The Government did not say either.  I would suggest that that statement is worse than useless and is, as I said earlier, a further indication of the ineptitude with which the Government are handling or mishandling the very serious problems that are involved in this area.</P>
    <P>It is sad that the Government should be indicated for a breach of the national wage agreement but it is far worse that we should now find ourselves in the position where the Government having breached the agreement, not having achieved what they set out to achieve, are in grave danger of losing the benefits which could accrue to all our people if the whole programme that the Minister announced on budget day were implemented and finding themselves in this position that they are not able to give the country a clear lead which, above all else, is what is <Col N="719" /> needed.  We have not got that from the Minister.  It may be difficult for him or his colleagues ever to catch up on that again.  In so far as it may be possible could I urge the Minister and his colleagues who are here as fast as possible&mdash;by that I mean tonight or tomorrow at the latest&mdash;to come out with a clear-cut indication as to what line the Government are taking and what line they want the people to take on this?  That is what the country needs now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 26 and 27, but in section 6, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(7)  This section shall not apply to a private non-trading company nor to a private non-trading company which has control of another private non-trading company (in this subsection referred to as the first private non-trading company) and, for the purposes of this subsection, where a second private <Col N="720" /> non-trading company has control of the first private non-trading company and is, itself, controlled by a third private non-trading company the third private non-trading company shall be deemed to have control of the first private non-trading company, and so on provided that the shares in that private non-trading company or the shares in the private non-trading company deemed to have control of that private non-trading company are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  held solely by a child or children of a marriage either with his or their parent or parents or without his or their parents or</P>
    <P>(b)  are shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners to be held for the exclusive benefit of:</P>
    <P>(i)  one or both parties to a marriage, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  one or more named individuals, for the reason that such individual, or all such individuals, is or are, because of age incapacity or improvidence, incapable of managing his or their affairs or for any other analogous reason which, in the opinion of the Commissioners is sufficient to justify the benefits conferred by this subsection&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to import into the provisions for the imposition of wealth tax on private non-trading companies the reliefs which are already provided in the case of discretionary trusts.  We may accept the fact that because those reliefs are provided it is accepted that they are genuine cases requiring relief.  Some of the reliefs were already provided in the Bill when it was first published. Others were added in as a result of amendments from this side of the House but it can be taken from the fact that they were accepted by the Minister and are incorporated in the Bill as it now stands that the Minister accepts that the cases involved are genuine cases in which relief should be given.</P>
    <P>The effect of allowing the relief is that thresholds as provided in a later <Col N="721" /> section of the Bill would be applied in these genuine cases.  As I have said, the purpose of this amendment is to try to import those reliefs into private non-trading companies as they exist in the Bill in the case of discretionary trusts.  To illustrate the kind of problem that is involved I would like to quote from a letter which I received from a solicitor whom I do not know personally in connection with a client for whom he was acting, the client being a professional man, not a solicitor.  This is what he says:</P>
    <P>This man is married with eight children and in the normal event would have exemption up to a figure of £120,000.  To provide for his wife and children my client purchased three properties including his surgery and each of the properties is owned by a non-trading private company. The ordinary shares of all three non-trading private companies are held by one holding non-trading private company and the ordinary shares of that controlling holding company are held by the minor children of my client.  The property is worth somewhere about £70,000 to £80,000 and covers all my client's wealth other than the capital in his practice, his office equipment, motor car, <i>et cetera,</i> possibly worth another £10,000 to £15,000.  He also owns his dwelling-house and contents which, of course, are exempt.</P>
    <P>You will see from the above that if all my client's property was in his own name he would have no responsibility whatever for wealth tax but because his chief wealth of about £70,000 is held in the various connected private non-trading companies he is going to be caught for about £700 a year wealth tax. This is the thanks he is getting as a professional man working hard trying to educate and provide for his large family.  As I see it, his only legal remedy is to sell back his property to himself from each of the companies but in that event the proceeds of the sale of the property goes to the holding company.  The ordinary shares of that holding company are owned by his minor children.  This would mean that <Col N="722" /> they would become entitled to same absolutely.  He is most reluctant to deal with the matter in this way and, of course, there would be substantial stamp duty and costs involved.</P>
    <P>On reading the Bill special provisions appear to be made to provide for such a provision arising in connection with discretionary trusts where the wealth of the trust is assessed on the settlor if the wife and children are the only objects of trust.  In my client's case his children are the only beneficiaries under the private non-trading companies and it seems grossly unjust that a discretionary trust should be exempt while a private non-trading company in exactly the same position is not.</P>
    <P>This amendment, Sir, is fairly lengthy but I tried to draft it to incorporate in the same precise language as far as possible as the reliefs which are provided in an earlier section in relation to discretionary trusts.  I am not aware of any reason in principle why the same reliefs should not apply in the case of the private non-trading company, nor am I aware at the moment, although the Minister may throw some light on this, of whether the granting of these reliefs in the terms set out in the amendment would provide any loophole for avoidance.  I do not think they would.  Certainly I am not aware of any such.  If, in fact, no such loophole is provided there cannot be any objection in principle to the importation of these reliefs in the case of the private non-trading company.  I would therefore urge the Minister to accept this amendment which I think is right in principle and I hope in practice and which would cover the kind of case that I have quoted and many others too which the Minister accepted in relation to discretionary trusts constituted genuine cases deserving of the relief provided by nature of the thresholds available to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to equate the position of private non-trading companies with that of discretionary trusts as regards <Col N="723" /> the special cases where it was considered that hardship might arise. Such cases are: trusts where the sole objects are the parents and or children of a marriage where a minor child was a living object; trusts for named individuals including parties to a marriage who for various reasons are incapable of managing their own affairs.  In practice the trustees of discretionary trusts in such circumstances have a discretion as to the application or non-application of the capital or income of the trusts for these objects.  It is almost impossible to visualise the situation where a company would be set up or would be in existence solely for such purposes.</P>
      <P>The situation where all the shares of such a company would be owned or held on behalf of such persons or where the dividend policy of the company would be dictated by their circumstances would be most unusual. If a company were controlled by such persons the shares would be vested in them or in nominees or trustees for them.  There would not be a situation analogous to a discretionary trust.</P>
      <P>In the case of such a private non-trading company it would in most cases be open to the parties to rearrange their affairs to take advantage of the exemptions and reliefs in the Bill.  It must be assumed that none of the shareholders mentioned in the amendment would be in the wealth tax bracket.  There is nothing to prevent the liquidation of such a company and the vesting of the assets in such shareholders or in trustees on their behalf thus enabling them to get the benefit of the relieving sections of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons why it was necessary to bring in the special provisions in subsections (2) and (3) of section 5 relating to discretionary trusts was that it might not be possible in certain circumstances to wind up such a trust.  There should be no difficulty in winding up a private non-trading company especially where it would be in the interests of all the shareholders to do so.  The analogy with the special arrangements made in <Col N="724" /> relation to a discretionary trust is not valid.  For these reasons I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The example put forward by Deputy Colley is a perfect example of what was under discussion on the previous two amendments. Here you have a situation where the Minister is saying, all you have to do is to wind up the company.  This can cause considerable complication.  Take the case of a person who has gone to the trouble of creating what amounts to a discretionary trust for the benefit of his children.  It does seem to me to be quite unfair that if the law up to date permitted the establishment of a company or companies of the kind described in amendment No. 13 put forward by Deputy Colley, that the person who has taken advantage of the law, not for any purpose of evasion but simply in order to create a happier situation for himself in relation to his responsibilities to his children, should now be put into a position where he must dissolve this company and, as Deputy Colley indicated, may find himself in a situation where the property in effect would not be his but would go to his children immediately.  There would be considerable cost in stamp duty and so on involved.  It does seem to me that the Minister should be able to make provision through something like the amendment put forward by Deputy Colley so as to avoid this situation for an individual who has done nothing wrong, certainly in the case put forward by Deputy Colley.  It is similar to the argument being put from this side of the House 15 or 20 minutes ago where we queried why, if ownership of the property was easily ascertainable, the wealth tax liability should not apply directly to the ownership in the same way as it would to the ownership of shares in a trading company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment, as Deputy Colley said, is rather a long one covering a special case and whilst it may be difficult for the Minister to consider an amendment of this kind at this stage, I do think that the Minister may be reluctant to consider amendments at this stage from the Opposition, there <Col N="725" /> is a case here of a degree of hardship which is not fair to an individual who has not done any wrong, who has simply used the existing machinery to create what amounted to a discretionary trust but because it comes under the heading of a non-trading company he will now be liable for a tax under this Bill because he is not being allowed the threshold to which he would be entitled if the property were vested either in himself or in himself and his children through an ordinary trading company.  The Minister should consider the reasonable objectives behind Deputy Colley's amendment in the interests of fair play to an ordinary individual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is quite obvious that deeming all private non-trading companies to come within the umbrella of the wealth tax as envisaged by the Minister does not stand up when Deputy Colley's letter is considered.  It is quite obvious that people have used private non-trading companies for various genuine purposes.  It is wrong that this category should be victimised.  This is not the first occasion that this has been done.  The Minister defended his action by saying it was used as a tax avoidance measure.  It is unfair to victimise an innocent person when we are legislating here.  To bring the entire private, non-trading companies under one umbrella and victimise a particular person or group of people who have used it legitimately, is not right.</P>
      <P>There are people who will find themselves in difficult situations when this Bill goes through this House. Some private, non-trading companies will have to be wound up.  This will present inconvenience and expense to these people who can ill-afford to employ the legal profession to draw up new agreements.  We should not be seen to be legislating so that innocent people find themselves in such situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not defending private non-trading companies that use it for tax avoidance.  I am defending the case mentioned by Deputy Colley, a genuine case, that will be caught by this section.  There are thousands throughout the country who will have to reassess <Col N="726" /> their whole situation to see where they stand.  They will have to consult their legal advisers to try to get themselves out of this situation which, 12 months ago, they had been told was best for them.  Their solicitor might have advised them, for example, to hold capital for their children in private non-trading companies. Now they will have to go to the same procedure again of unwinding this private, non-trading company and probably forming a discretionary trust.  I believe this should not be done.</P>
    <P>It should be within the competence of the Minister for Finance when drafting this legislation to see that these problems will arise.  The Minister should see the sincerity behind Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister could not say that a genuine person who has set up this company for his family's benefit and was advised to do this by his legal advisers was doing so for tax avoidance purposes.  By virtue of the fact that private, non-trading companies are being brought under one umbrella, irrespective of the reason the company was formed, he will be liable for tax. If the company was formed for the purpose of tax avoidance then the Minister is quite right in taxing that man without threshold.  But the genuine, private, non-trading company set up for family reasons should not be penalised in this way.  By taxing the private non-trading company, the families we are discussing would not be entitled to a threshold.  This is not good legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider Deputy Colley's amendment because some private, non-trading companies are genuinely established. The Minister should deal sympathetically with cases like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have established the principle that there are genuine cases to which relief should be given in relation to discretionary trusts.  As pointed out by Deputy Brugha, private non-trading companies were set up lawfully, as were discretionary trusts.  There is no inherent advantage, morally or otherwise, in a discretionary trust over a private non-trading company.  There cannot be any dispute <Col N="727" /> about the principle involved in this amendment.  If the Minister was able to accept these provisions in relation to discretionary trusts, he can have no objection in principle to acceptance of them in relation to private non-trading companies, which, as I said, were set up lawfully. Whether they were discretionary trusts or private non-trading companies, if many of them were vehicles for tax avoidance, the Minister has recognised that many others deserve special treatment.  He has given that special treatment in relation to discretionary trusts.</P>
      <P>As far as I could follow what the Minister said, he did not indicate that there was a loophole involved in the acceptance of this.  He talked about the possibility of the liquidation of these companies for the purpose of tax avoidance.  It does not seem that that produces avoidance for anybody, of itself.  The wording of the amendment is quite tight and deals with the provisions relating to discretionary trusts.  The Minister said that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to visualise a private, non-trading company of the kind covered in the amendment. I quoted to him from the letter I read, precisely one example of the kind of case that would be covered by the amendment.  No doubt there are many more.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting that these cases are very widespread.  The Minister is right in suggesting that there would be a limited number.  From one point of view, that is all more reason why the Minister should not have difficulty in accepting the amendment because it does not mean any major breach in what he has envisaged.  Whether there are many such cases or only one, the case rests on the justice of the matter which clearly demands that a provision of this kind be inserted in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accepted the justice of the matter in relation to discretionary trusts.  Why should it not be accepted in relation to private non-trading companies?  It is unfortunate that cases of the kind I referred to in the letter from which I quoted will be subjected <Col N="728" /> to wealth tax where if the assets involved were held individually or under a discretionary trust, they would not be subjected to wealth tax.  I do not think it is a sufficient answer to say that such people can easily wind up the private non-trading companies concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from the expense that may arise for people in such a transaction&mdash; an expense which is not confined merely to the legal expenses involved, but the possibility of being subjected both to gift tax and capital gains tax &mdash;in the case I quoted, it produces the undesirable situation from the point of view of the man involved that the bulk of his wealth would then be beneficially in the possession of his minor children.  All of us can understand that he would not reasonably want that to occur at this time.  Therefore, it is no answer to say that it is easy enough to wind up these private non-trading companies and then you get over the difficulty.  You do not get over the difficulty if you do that.  The way to get over the difficulty is to accept this amendment.  The Minister, unfortunately, has indicated that he is not prepared to accept the amendment, from which we must assume either that he does not recognise the difficulties&mdash;although they have been spelled out&mdash; or, if he does recognise them, that he is not prepared to do anything to deal with them, although he was prepared to do so in relation to discretionary trusts.</P>
    <P>The logic and principle involved in that attitude, if any, escape me.  The logic and principle involved, clearly require acceptance of the amendment. If the Minister is not prepared to accept it, there is little more we on this side of the House can do.  We have, however, drawn the attention of the Minister to the difficulties, the anomalies and the inequities that will arise because he is not prepared to extend, in genuine cases of private non-trading companies, the relief which he is prepared to give in the case of discretionary trusts.  It is unfortunate that this should be so.  It seems to be an attitude which is not based on principle or logic.  We, on this side, have done our best to draw the Minister's <Col N="729" /> attention to what is involved.  If he does not accept the position, or is not prepared to do anything about it, people will know where the responsibility <Col N="730" /> for that position then arising rests.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) the right to receive any benefit or any annuity or periodic payment which, when added to any such right, if any, under any of the schemes, provisions or arrangements referred to in any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (e), other than subparagraph (iii), would yield an entitlement equivalent to the superannuation entitlement of a Civil Servant having a similar income and contribution record.</P>
      <P>(h) the property of any scheme or arrangement assuring or supporting the right to receive any benefit, annuity or periodic payment referred to in paragraph (g)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These two amendments are designed to deal with the situation we discussed at some length on Committee Stage, the situation in which, in our view, there is effectively discrimination under this Bill against the self-employed person or the person employed in the private sector in relation to superannuation provisions.  The Minister for Lands, who was dealing with this matter on the Committee Stage, deputising for the Minister for Finance, said there was no discrimination and that all such pension schemes, whether they related to the public service or the private sector, were being exempt.  That is not accurate because, in the first place, non-statutory pension schemes are only exempt, as far as I can see, to the extent that they qualify for income tax relief.  In order to qualify for income tax relief they have to conform to the regulations laid down by the Revenue Commissioners.  Those regulations include an upper limit of £1,500 a year contribution and also a prohibition on any provision in the pension scheme for adjustment for inflation above 5 per cent.  There are, of course, other conditions.  I am just mentioning these two as an example. Apart from that, in the case of a self-employed man in many cases his provision for retirement is either the goodwill of his business or practice, if he is a professional man, or in the case of an owner of a small factory the sale of his factory and its assets is his provision on which he is depending to provide for his retirement. As was indicated by Deputy Brugha in discussion on this matter on the Committee Stage, such a person may not be in a position at all to make any contributions or certainly to make the contributions up to the extent of £1,500 a year which are permitted under the Revenue Commissioners' regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said, when we were discussing this matter on the Committee Stage, that I was not suggesting for one moment that it was easy to find a solution to this problem, because it is not.  I did, however, suggest that given the will to find a solution to it, it would not be impossible for the Minister to produce provisions which, while they might not precisely equate the position of somebody in the public sector with that of somebody in the private sector, could roughly do so and certainly could go a long way to removing the anomaly which now exists under the Bill.  However, no such effort was made by the Minister in the drafting of the Bill nor in any amendments he has introduced.  Therefore I was obliged to make an effort to do <Col N="733" /> so.  I do not want to suggest for one moment that this amendment and the subsequent amendment which we are discussing with it are perfect.  In fact, I can probably see some difficulties involved that may not even be obvious to the Minister.  Certainly I had considerable difficulty in drafting them and I am aware of difficulties that arise.  Nevertheless, I think that these two amendments, taken together, show the general lines on which it would be possible to achieve reasonable parity between the treatment of those in the public sector and those in the private sector in regard to pension arrangements.</P>
    <P>I think there was some suggestion from the Government side when we were discussing this matter on the Committee Stage that really there was no great problem here and no great concern about this.  I am aware of the fact that the Minister and the Taoiseach received what I might describe as strong representations on this matter because I received copies of some of them, not all of them I believe, but some of them, and they were certainly couched in strong language.  There should not be any doubt at all but that the point we are dealing with here represents a serious problem about which some people are very much concerned. I say that because not alone do I think that in principle an effort ought to be made in this Bill as far as possible to achieve equity between the public and the private sector but also because some people individually are incensed at what they regard, in my view rightly, as discrimination in this Bill between the public and the private sector.  This amendment and the following one represent an attempt to tackle that serious problem.  I repeat that I do not regard it as the last word in tackling it, that I am aware of difficulties that arise from the manner in which these amendments are drafted of some areas of uncertainty, but I do not really think it is a function of a Member of this House to try to do the Parliamentary Draftsman's job to the extent of producing a perfectly worded amendment.  I do say, however, that the two amendments together represent not only an attempt to tackle this problem <Col N="734" /> but also indicate the way in which it can be tackled.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 which is designed to cover the case where a person in the private sector we will say &mdash;when I say private sector this can extend to perhaps some semi-State bodies and certainly to some bodies which are in receipt of Government subvention but are not part of the civil service or, of course, in what is commonly called the private sector&mdash; takes out his own insurance or enters into a scheme to provide a pension for himself aimed to give him something similar to what would be available to somebody in the civil service at approximately the same level as himself. It is designed to cover the case where he does this in addition to a pension scheme which he already has and which comes under the section as drafted and is exempted from wealth tax because it qualifies as one which rates income tax relief.  It also is designed to cover the case where he has no such pension scheme but enters into an arrangement which would not come within the terms of the section but is designed to give him approximately the same superannuation rights as a comparable person in the civil service would have.</P>
    <P>I have indicated in the past in discussion on this just how serious the discrepancy can be.  To put the matter in perspective, first of all, one of the representations made to the Minister and to the Taoiseach put the matter this way: the Bill provides that a self-employed or non-pensionable married man is entitled to have up to £100,000 before he reaches the tax threshold level of 1 per cent.  The same Bill appears to provide that a married man with pension or superannuation rights is entitled to a threshold level of £100,000 plus the capitalised value of his pension.  That statement could, I think, be qualified in regard to one or two aspects, but basically it represents the position as it is under the Bill.  This problem of course is extremely serious for people, say, who are in their 50s or 60s.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the self-employed, the person who has no existing pension scheme, this is the major <Col N="735" /> difficulty and it is sought to be covered in amendment No. 15.  His is the most stark case involved here because no relief is provided in his case.  He is self-employed and he puts his savings which, of course, have been subjected to income tax, into stocks, shares or property of various kinds in order to produce a pension for his retirement. In his position, he is not alone paying income tax on the profits or income he accumulates but, having put this money into stocks or shares or property, in order to provide for his retirement he is, if he is over the limit, subject to wealth tax on that accumulation whereas a person in the civil service may have accumulated money of various kinds and different kinds of property but if he is below the limit of £100,000 he can, in addition, have a pension with a very substantial capitalised value and not be liable to wealth tax.  That is the starkest contrast and starkest case which can be made here. That is not to say that the case is less real or valuable where somebody has an existing pension scheme but because it cannot compare with that available in the civil service he, in an effort to supplement it, is being subjected to wealth tax in a way that somebody entitled to a pension under the civil service scheme is not.</P>
    <P>I indicated some figures in this regard and it is worth bearing them in mind because many people tend to forget what is happening with inflation at the moment and how in a very short time people who think they will never be liable for wealth tax can find themselves liable for it.  I indicated, on the basis of figures which I obtained from a qualified actuary, that if we take the secretary of a Department at present in receipt of a salary in the region of £11,000 per annum and if we assume he is aged 55 and, therefore, has another ten years to run in his office and assume an average rate of inflation of 15 per cent per annum for the next ten years, on his retirement he would have a salary of approximately £44,500 per annum, assuming that civil service salaries kept reasonable pace with inflation as they have done in recent years.  It is important to realise that having that salary of £44,500 per <Col N="736" /> annum would not mean that such a man was in any way better off than he is today.  There would be no improvement in his standard of living with that salary.  On that basis, on his retirement in ten years' time, he would be entitled to a pension of £22,250 per annum apart from a lump sum of 1½ times his retiring salary.</P>
    <P>On his retirement that pension would have a capital value of £321,000 and built into it is a guarantee that it will keep pace with inflation.  That is something that you cannot buy today commercially no matter how much wealth you have.  That capitalised sum is calculated on the assumption that it could be invested to produce a yield equal to the rate of inflation of 15 per cent per annum.  If, in fact, it could not be so invested so that it would produce, say, a maximum yield of 13 per cent per annum, leaving a 2 per cent shortfall, the capital sum required would be £370,000, and so on, depending on the yield that can be got on this capital sum.  These figures are based on an actuarial calculation by a qualified actuary based on the life expectancy of a person in normal health at the age of 65 at his retirement.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again that there is no way in which a private individual whether self-employed, say, as a professional man or the owner of a business, can make provision of that kind for himself.  No matter how much money he has he just cannot make that kind of provision.  Furthermore, the capital sum that I have mentioned and the assumptions on which it is based as regards yield assume that the capital sum involved would earn a gross rate of interest. Again, in the case of the private individual that is impossible because he is taxed on the yield from the investment, taxed to income tax that is. The maximum sum which is allowable for income tax contributions to superannuation schemes for somebody in the private sector is £1,500 per annum.  That sum, which is the maximum and which might be invested by a self-employed person if he has a very high income, could not produce anything like the level of <Col N="737" /> pension available, say, to the secretary of a Department on the lines I outlined.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is a built-in advantage under the existing scheme of superannuation for those in the Civil Service.  I want to make clear, as I did on the last occasion, that far from disapproving of that, I wholly approve of the provisions made for retirement in the Civil Service.  I had something to do with part of the present arrangements and I would like to see everybody in the country enabled to benefit under that kind of pension or superannuation scheme.  I do not want any misunderstanding of this sort.  I have no wish to take from the benefits available to members of the Civil Service in regard to superannuation. The scheme they have is a good one, is one that is necessary particularly at times of high inflation as at the present.  That is not what I want to do.  What I want to do is to try to ensure, as far as possible, that those who are not able to benefit from such a superannuation scheme will get equivalent consideration under the Wealth Tax Bill in regard to the capitalised value of either pensions which they effect or the capital which they accumulate in order to provide for their retirement.</P>
    <P>There are very many people who think they are people of little or no property, when in fact they have an entitlement to a capital sum under a pension scheme, such as operates in the civil service, which makes them far wealthier than many people in the private sector whom they would regard as being much wealthier than they are.  Too many of us are inclined to forget the value of such a provision.  Another thing which I said before but which I would like to repeat is that when I refer to provisions in pension schemes which help to keep pace with inflation I am not referring solely to the civil service although perhaps their's is the most commonly known scheme.  I am also referring to pension schemes which operate in relation to Members of this House and of the Seanad and to former members of the Government. Again I do not want any misunderstanding <Col N="738" /> as to my attitude in this regard.  I am not suggesting for a moment that such schemes should not exist.  What I am suggesting is that under the wealth tax legislation those who have not got the benefit of such schemes should as far as possible be treated equally.  Therefore I have produced amendment No. 14 and the following amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 is designed to cover a case where there is a self-employed man with no provision for a pension scheme who wants to use, say, the value of his business when he retires by selling it, or the goodwill of his practice if he is a professional man, as the source from which he will obtain his pension on his retirement and it is endeavouring to equate the two.  I have already pointed out that such a person in order to accumulate capital in terms of money or property is subjected to income tax in doing so.  Under the terms of the Bill he will be subjected to wealth tax also if he accumulates such money or property as would yield a comparable or anything like a comparable pension as would be available to him in the public service.</P>
    <P>It is also worth noting that a self-employed person with a business, or a professional man relying on the goodwill of his practice, would be liable to wealth tax as long as he holds on to the property or the goodwill or whatever it is, but on the sale of it, in order to produce a pension, it could well be subject to capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that there is every case for this amendment and the following amendment, which we are discussing with it, every case for accepting the principle that as far as it can be done we ought to try to give equal consideration to those who have the benefit of what, in outline terms I am calling the civil service scheme of superannuation and to those who have not got it.  These two amendments are designed to tackle that problem and to suggest a way in which it could be done.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I am not suggesting that either of the amendments covers all the possible difficulties <Col N="739" /> that arise.  I am aware of some of them myself which would arise from this but it is an attempt to tackle the problem and it is illustrating the way in which it could be done. I want to urge very strongly on the Minister that he should, if he cannot accept the amendment itself, accept the principle that is involved in it which I regard as very important and ensure that the Bill is amended to cover this principle.  Any practical difficulties which would arise for the Minister in the sense of procedure in this House I can assure him can be overcome and he will get the fullest co-operation from this side of the House if that is the only problem with which he is faced dealing with this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not attributing these motivations to Deputy Colley but I am satisfied, from the most vitriolic correspondence I have received on any aspect of the capital taxation legislation, that my charge is well founded. Some of the correspondence was most offensive, most insulting to public servants and most abusive of them.  It contained allegations that they were deliberately drafting capital taxation legislation to give them benefits which would not be available to anybody else.  Therefore, I must suspect the motives of people who have campaigned in this particular way.</P>
      <P>No doubt Deputies opposite and others have seen spurious, vicious letters in the public newspapers of a similar kind alleging that the public officials of this country lacked integrity and were disposed to legislate to give themselves protection which is not given to others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we get an amendment we must, of course, look to the merits of the amendment and not look to the motivation of the people who may have argued in favour of such amendments. <Col N="740" /> I propose to consider very carefully these amendments on their merits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am not accusing the Deputy of these things but I think there is ample evidence available outside the House to justify what I have said.  Perhaps it is that people felt strongly and allowed themselves to be carried away and to make allegations which I know Deputy Colley would consider to be unworthy because he, like many other Members of this House, knows the tremendous integrity and unselfishness of our public servants who would not attempt to draft legislation to their own advantage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the arguments which have been advanced have been of a nature that I have described.  These amendments are not dealing with superannuation benefits. What is involved in both amendments is the deduction of underlying property whether actual or imputed in respect of a benefit, or annuity which does not exist.</P>
      <P>Superannuation benefits in common with analogous benefits provided by private individuals for themselves are among many forms of property which are exempted by section 7 of the Bill which also excludes or exempts private dwelling houses and their contents, livestock, bloodstock, growing timber, artistic gardens and objects, certain securities and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one determines precisely what is involved in exempting superannuation benefits, one fundamental principle which underlines the whole subject of the Bill must be borne in mind.  It is present rights and not future rights which are taxable, present rights, enjoyment of property, as opposed to having future rights to property only <Col N="741" /> are to be liable to tax.  Property to which a person is entitled in possession is the only property which is liable to tax.  The principle is made clear in the first section of the Bill which deals with definitions.  The result is that future interests in property do not come within the scope of the wealth tax.  The tax is not concerned with future life interests, with reversions or remainders generally. Therefore, the right to enjoy a superannuation benefit in the future is not within the scope of the tax any more than the right to receive any other annuity or any other benefit in the future or any future life interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Reversions are included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not generally.  It is necessary to spell this out, to make clear what the exemption in section 7 of superannuation schemes is all about.  It exempts the present right of enjoyment of these schemes, for that is all the Bill makes liable.  There would be no point in exempting property that is not made liable to the tax.  The exemption, therefore, can narrow down the individuals to whom section 7 applies.  In the same way it narrows down the individuals to whom Deputy Colley's amendments apply.  They are persons over retiring age, normally 60 or 65, or persons who would be retired for reasons such as ill-health and who are in the wealth tax bracket.  It does not apply to anybody who is not in the wealth tax bracket.  It applies to those who are in the wealth tax bracket and who have, in addition to all the exempted property, £70,000 if single or £100,000 if married.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That would include most civil servants on retirement if you did not have this section, if you capitalised the value of the pension &mdash;would it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. The next point to consider is what is involved in the exemption taxwise, what the value for tax of the benefit or annuity would be.  Subsection (3) of the Bill provides the method of valuing all annuities which are not <Col N="742" /> charged on specific property and this valuation would apply to pensions payable under a superannuation scheme.  The value is arrived at by taking the current yield on the 11 per cent National Loan, 1993-1998 which was the then most recently issued Government security within the meaning of the Bill on 5th April, 1975.  At that date the loan stood at 80 so that the current yield for the purpose of subsection (3) was 14 per cent.  The value for tax, therefore, of the pension of £5,500 which Deputy Colley quoted on Committee Stage of the discussion of this matter would be around £40,000.  This figure indicates that if the pensioner to whom he refers or, for that matter any other person with a similar annuity, were to be liable to wealth tax he would have to own in addition net taxable assets over £60,000, assets other than his dwelling house and contents and any other exempted property.  On Committee Stage Deputy Colley applied a yardstick to that pension which, with respect, has no application to the Bill.  As I understand his approach, he took the pension of £5,500 and estimated what it would be worth in ten years' time including an average inflation rate of 15 per cent per annum.  He arrived at a pension of £22,000 per annum which he then valued at over £300,000.  Although many exceptions could be raised to the methodology, there is no need for me to go into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are concerned with here is a Bill which states clearly what its intentions are, and with dealing with the provisions which are in this Bill and not with anything else.  The case Deputy Colley builds up falls on two grounds.  First, what we are dealing with is the present value of a pension enjoyed by a pensioner.  We are not dealing with its value ten years or more from now.  Secondly, his method of valuation under the Bill is incorrect. If I am right in my understanding of the Committee Stage of the debate in regard to the valuation of property, the Opposition's case is that all property was overvalued under the Bill, including limited interests and annuities.  Yet, for the purpose of making his case <Col N="743" /> Deputy Colley increases a valuation of a pension under the Bill, of £40,000, up to over £300,000, which is not a bad increase.</P>
    <P>I have gone to some length to explain what is involved in exempting all superannuation schemes.  Much of this was already gone into in great detail by my colleague, the Minister for Lands, on Committee Stage.  I think there is now no room for any doubt about the matter.  Bearing in mind that we are talking only about pensioners in actual receipt of pensions in these amendments, I would like to make some points.  As I understand the proposal, the object would be to treat all wealth taxpayers in the pensioner age group as if they had been in the civil service all their lives and made all the contributions and fulfilled all the obligations necessary to qualify for a civil service pension.  As they are proposed the amendments appear to be cumulative.  They also leave many questions open.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need for me to go into these points.  I will just confine myself to the general proposition as I understand it.  On that proposition several points arise.  First, it is, perhaps, significant that there is no provision similar to that suggested to be found elsewhere as far as can be ascertained and writers on the subject have not advanced the idea.  A book on wealth tax which runs to over 350 pages, published after this Bill was introduced and entitled <i>An Annual Wealth Tax</i> by Sandford, Willis and Ironside, has this to say about superannuation benefits:</P>
    <P>The conclusion is that pensions and pension rights should be exempt as the British Green Paper proposes whether they arise under the national scheme, a statutory scheme or an approved private scheme.  Similar exemption should be given in respect of the retirement annuities provided for themselves by self-employed persons and non-pensionable employees where the conditions for income tax relief are satisfied.</P>
    <P>This is precisely what we are doing in the Bill.  In one way or another all exemptions bring about some element <Col N="744" /> of discrimination.  An exemption means that you discriminate in favour of the person to whom the exemption is granted, and, perhaps, giving the exemption to one causes some sense of disappointment in another.  It is human inclination to be dissatisfied as portrayed by Our Lord's parable of the labourer in the vineyard where people were content with what they were receiving until they saw that others were getting the same for doing less.  A town dweller might think he should get a further exemption&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should tell the Minister that statement is based on a misinterpretation of the parable.  The key phrase is: &ldquo;Is thine eye evil because I am generous?&rdquo; and not as the Minister and I learned it: &ldquo;Is thine eye evil because I am just?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may take either interpretation or both interpretations.  Town dwellers may have a grievance that they do not enjoy exemptions similar to those enjoyed by rural dwellers.  The tillage farmer may be annoyed that he does not receive an exemption that is given to a livestock farmer.  Perhaps the people with the greatest grievance are the many thousands who will never reach the threshold at all.  Therefore they are people for whom the exemptions are academic.</P>
      <P>The amendments seem to find their justification in the fact that an individual in receipt of superannuation benefit is granted exemption from wealth tax in respect of such benefits. It is contended that as a result of this exemption very few such persons&mdash;and they are very few who would be in the wealth tax area&mdash; would be in a privileged position <i>vis-á-vis</i> those who enjoyed no such benefit. The amendments seek to provide exemption in respect of property which the wealth taxpayers in question do not possess.  In that respect it is wholly illogical.  If this principle has validity it would have to be applied to all other exemptions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For reasons best known to himself a person might not have purchased a house, livestock or bloodstock but instead <Col N="745" /> chose to utilise his assets with better effect in his view.  That is common practice in other countries. Another person might not choose the full-time involvement, the way of life or the discipline of an employment of which the possible ultimate enjoyment of a superannuation benefit is part of the contract of service.  This benefit is taken into account in many facets of such employment, including the salary scales and conditions generally.  This decision might have been made for a variety of reasons such as the expectation of inheriting wealth, the present ownership of wealth, the intention of acquiring wealth otherwise.  For whatever reasons the taxpayer finds himself in the wealth tax bracket why should he get an exemption for property which he has not got and of which he would not be possessed unless he had pursued an entirely different way of life?  It would be just as logical to give a pensioner a productive asset allowance for property which he did not possess.</P>
    <P>If the amendments were accepted they would present enormous administrative problems, added to the obvious necessity to ascertatin and evaluate capital would be the problem of ascertaining income of every person and every individual whose wealth would be aggregated with his.  Over what period of time would the income be dealt with?  As a corollary, should a person who has an annuity or benefits in excess of the civil service norm have his exemption reduced?  Entitlement to a superannuation benefit earned over a period of 40 years which is not assignable and which ceases at the latest on the death of the widow is in no way comparable with possession of a sum of money which is actuarially equal to that benefit.  The possession of capital which is readily disposable and may be transmitted <i>inter vivos</i> or on death is obviously superior to the possession of income which ceases.  Some method would have to be found to take these varying factors into account.  It must be clear that the amendments are not acceptable.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister for Lands pointed out that there was <Col N="746" /> one sure way of removing the discrimination which they claimed that the exemption of superannuation benefits created.  This could be done by deleting the exemption for all superannuation schemes without exception. They were told that if an amendment in this form was put forward it would be considered.  But it was clear what would be involved in such a proposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, of course, be quite contrary to all that has been advocated.  We are not trying to take anything away from those who have it.  We are trying to give equal treatment to all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that very few pensioners would be affected by making superannuation benefits liable to the tax.  Most of the campaign in relation to superannuation benefits has been of an envious and bitter kind which suggested that civil servants at large were people of such substantial wealth that they would get an advantage by the exemption of superannuation benefits which would not be available to others.  As Deputy Colley admitted, he has not followed up that suggestion.  That speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the suggestion was from the Minister's side, not from this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We offered it to the Opposition for consideration.  They obviously saw that it would be wrong. I applaud them for that.  We considered it to be wrong too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Totally out of consonance with what we are advocating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one point on which we are in agreement.  There is another option open to the Opposition if they want to take it up.  We would not agree with it, but if they wanted to argue it, they could do so.  It is that all future interests would be liable to wealth tax.  I do not think the suggestion would find much support especially if Deputy Colley's method of valuation were to be applied to such interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We make no apology for exempting <Col N="747" /> pensions in the hands of pensioners, either aged or in ill-health and irrespective of whether or not the pensions are privately arranged or are available in the public service.  We are not alone in this approach.  Every country in Europe which operates a wealth tax operates a system similar to the one we are proposing.  The British Green Paper on Wealth Tax proposes to do likewise although it is apparently intended to charge all property there, whether present or future interests.  Nonetheless, the British, in common with practice elsewhere, propose that superannuation benefits will not be liable to wealth tax.  However, when we grant an exemption here, it is interpreted, and in many cases, maliciously in effect as creating a charge on those taxpayers who cannot avail of the exemption.  This is a very odd line of thinking and it is creating a charge on those taxpayers who cannot avail of the exemption.  It is a very odd line of thinking and if followed through could mean that no exemptions whatsoever should be granted. Then there would be no sense of grievance on the part of people who could not enjoy the exemption.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the Opposition in these amendments, and on many other occasions in these debates, regard an exemption on one taxpayer as a charge upon another.  It is a strange approach to taxation and I suggest it is an invalid one.  On this account I am unable to accept the amendments offered.  The reasons I have given are very compelling.  I hope that the nastiness and the bitterness some people have voiced about the Irish public service will now cease.  I trust they will examine the merits of the exemption for superannuation benefits without assuming that the legislators are, as so many people have suggested, mere putty in the hands of their advisers. Nobody makes laws for the people of Ireland other than Parliament. It is not the parliamentary draftsman, or the officials in Departments; it is Parliament and Parliament has been fully seized in this matter. <Col N="748" /> It has been explained at great length on Committee and Report Stages of this Bill.  It has been also explained in public debates and in correspondence. Having regard to the good reasons which exist for exempting superannuation benefits, and that the rest of the world has found these reasons to be legitimate too, I suggest the time has come to bring this debate to an end and to accept the fairness of exemption of superannuation benefits without imputing unworthy motives to those who accept the validity of those arguments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase to £27½ million in the capital of the company is a very substantial one.  The reason given for this increase is the proposal of NET to establish a factory which is already under way at Marino Point in Cork to manufacture ammonia and urea from natural gas which will be obtained in the Kinsale Head find.  It has been suggested to me that part at least of the reason for the large increase in the share capital may not just be for the purpose of establishing the factory at Marino Point but also to give Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta scope to take over an existing fertiliser firm which is in difficulties at the moment and which, in fact, to all practical purposes has closed down, for the time being at least, and has laid off a large number of workers.  The firm in question has, as is well known, run into serious financial difficulties due to a variety of reasons, some being similar to the ones which caused Nítrigin Éireann to have such a bad year last year.  In the case of the private firm in question it was due to a number of other reasons also which might not necessarily be applicable to Nítrigin Éir-eann.</P>
      <P>It is thought by some people that the private firm in question may well have difficulty in reopening and if so the proper approach of the Minister should be that Nítrigin Éireann should be instructed to take over the factories in Dublin and Cork of the private firm in question.  It is thought that the considerably increased share capital proposed in section 2 for Nítrigin Éireann could at least in part be used for that purpose.  I should like to ask the Minister if, in fact, any discussions have taken place or any consideration been given to the possibility of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta taking over the firm in question in order to try to preserve the jobs of the 1,000 or so people who at the moment are seriously affected by the temporary closure of that firm</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the sensitivity of the area of discussion which we have entered. I know he would wish to say nothing, certainly I would wish to say nothing, that would add to existing difficulties. But I can tell the House that very detailed investigations have been carried out in this matter of some duration and considerable depth.  I can also say that, while I would not preempt the freedom of decision as it were for all time of a responsible management the moneys mentioned in this section, and in the subsequent section, are not intended to be used in part for a purchase the Deputy referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I should like to ask the Minister that if these moneys are not intended, which, of course, I accept, nonetheless are discussions on the lines I have indicated going on or is consideration being given in his Department or by the board of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta to the position that arises in the other firm and the possibility of permanent redundancy for many of the workers in the other firm if the difficulties which the other firm, and the group of which it is a member, cannot be overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hesitate to offer opinions or predictions about the difficulties to which the Deputy refers but I can assure him that this is a matter of very considerable concern in my Department, that it has been very thoroughly investigated.  The management of NET have been involved in this consideration.  I am not trying to be evasive but it is, as the Deputy knows, a delicate situation and a situation in which it is not possible to predict the outcome.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be helpful for me to say any more.  If the Deputy wishes, I would be happy to discuss the matter with him, but I do not think it would be helpful to do it in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, and the Minister's attitude in regard to it is reasonable.  We have established that the Minister and NET are actively concerned with the problem that arises <Col N="751" /> in relation to the other fertiliser firm, Presumably, they will do whatever is necessary to try to preserve the firm and the employment of those concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to make some reference to the proposal of NET to construct this new factory at Marino Point, Cork, and I presume this is the most appropriate section on which to do it.  I and other Deputies had a number of inquiries on the last day but, due to the operation of the guillotine, the Minister was unable to reply to them, or at least, he had only a few minutes in which to do so but did not avail of. I do not want to put all these inquiries again as it would be a waste of time, but, perhaps, the Minister has a note of some of them and he might avail of this opportunity on this section, which is the most general one, to reply. A number of the points were made, particularly in relation to the price at which An Bord Gáis would sell the natural gas to NET; the question of Portuguese imports; the question of whether or not the alleged dumping of imported fertiliser is being investigated by the Dumping Commission; the question of the effect on agriculture of the constant drop in usage of fertiliser; and what the projections for future uses of fertiliser now are in the light of the high prices that are being charged for Irish fertilisers.</P>
      <P>I should like if the Minister would deal with the question of the construction of the pipeline to the Marino Point factory and the various matters that arise in relation to that.  I raised the question also of the comparatively bad value which this country will get from the usage of a fairly high proportion of natural gas for the generation of electricity and whether there is any possibility that either Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta or any other company might establish a similar factory to the Marino Point one in order that a more beneficial utilisation of the natural gas might be carried out and also whether or not the Minister has any plans for what hopefully will take place, namely, the discovery of other gas deposits of at least equal value to the Kinsale Head find which Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta will be using in part now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="752" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, indeed, detailed notes on the points Deputy O'Malley raises, not that I was able to anticipate him but because the points were made on Second Reading and to which I did not have time to reply.  I assure the House that the lack of time was no will of mine.  I am happy to reply to them now and I should like to put them on the record of the House.  The points were taken seriatim from speeches made by Deputies on Second Reading.</P>
      <P>As a matter of record, Deputy O'Malley said the price of Irish manufactured fertilisers has increased by approximately 250 per cent on average in the last two years.  It is important to make distinctions here because the decline in usage is a very serious thing and it is necessary for us to be precise about these things.  What he said was true for phosphatic fertilisers, and, indeed, the figure might be a bit on the low side, although the price of phosphates has been coming down a bit. The particular product we are talking about in relation to Marino Point is calcium ammonium nitrate and there the increase has been 83 per cent.  I am not suggesting that is not very serious but it is approximately one-third of 250 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it is a matter of record that the sales of compound fertilisers, that is, fertilisers containing nitrogen, phosphate and potash, have declined by 40 per cent in the past year or so. I deplore, together with Deputies who did so on Second Reading, this as being very serious.  But, in fact, the sales of calcium ammonium nitrate increased by 10 to 15 per cent in that period.  It is not possible to make firm predictions about future consumption for the reason that there is such a close relationship between the level of consumption and the margin of profitability of agricultural enterprises. When farmers are poorer, when the gap between what they have to pay for what they buy in and the return on that investment diminishes, they are inclined to slow up in their investment.  It is predicted&mdash;the different commercial firms have their experts&mdash;that a growth rate of between 2 to 3 per cent will be resumed after the beginning of 1976 <Col N="753" /> and will continue thereafter.  It is expected that there will be a growth resuming in the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>Price is a matter of commercial value and it is not the practice to make public prices such as the Marathon sale price but we can say that if, in fact, Marino Point were in production now, calcium ammonium nitrate from NET would be cheaper than it is.  Notwithstanding remarks made about the cost of the gas and the careless and imprecise comparisons which have been made between onshore and offshore&mdash;remember that for offshore one has to have the pipeline in the water and it is dearer to do this&mdash;from sources which I entirely trust, I believe the deal that has been done is a very good one.  I want to put that formally on the record of the House.  The comparisons between, for example, the price coming out on land in the United States or on land in the Middle East or the Persian Gulf with what comes from underneath the sea are not fair comparisons; they are profoundly misleading.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the import of fertilisers which has been exercising many people's minds recently. As Deputy O'Malley recognised in his Second Stage speech, there are two sides to this because, of course, one wishes that Irish consumers, namely, the farmers, would have fertilisers at a reasonable and competitive price.  On the other hand, one wishes to guarantee the future of the Irish industry and it is a delicate balance.  This has been referred to An Coimisiún Dumpála who are carrying out an investigation, which is not completed.  The commission have recommended to me the imposition of a provisional anti-dumping duty of £8 per ton on imports from Portugal. I have made an order, which will become operative at midnight tomorrow, from the beginning of 31st July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this on urea or calcium ammonium nitrate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On calcium ammonium nitrate, CAN, because that is the stuff that is in fact coming in from Portugal.  I would emphasise two <Col N="754" /> things, that this is provisional and that the investigation is continuing.  There is a provision for relief from the duty if the importer can establish that the goods have not been dumped or that the margin of dumping is less than £8.  It is provisional.  It has been recommended by An Coimisiún Dumpála to me and I have accepted that recommendation and put it into force. This, I may say, is the first announcement of it.  I thought it appropriate to do it in the House if possible and I had the good fortune of this Committee Stage on which to announce it.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Gas Board designing and constructing the pipeline, I should inform the House that that board are an agency of the Department of Transport and Power and not of my Department.  It is a matter for the Gas Board to give the details of the design and construction.  I am not trying to be evasive: it is not a matter of my Departmental responsibility.  In so far as possible, that information will be given to the House if inquiries are made in the appropriate quarter.</P>
      <P>The interesting question which I want to spend some time on is that of whether one uses this fine raw material&mdash;it is not just that, it is natural gas, it is very good and clean natural gas&mdash;purely as a basis for a chemical industry or whether one uses some of it to generate electricity. There are two conflicting considerations. One is that it is a lovely raw material and it is nice to get the maximum added value by doing something like some sort of synthesis to make urea, calcium ammonium nitrate or whatever is the starting point, for many things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if we think back to October, 1973, we have the circumstance that we are exceptionally dependent on imported energy.  We cannot develop our hydro resources any more.  We cannot develop peat very much more.  We do not have the coal reserves let us say of the Germans or the British.  It is therefore very desirable that we use some of what we find to secure, not from the efficiency point of view, because what Deputy O'Malley said about efficiency <Col N="755" /> is right, but from the security and strategic point of view, the use of some of what we find, or some of our first find, to guarantee electrical production, that we should add it in the hopefully unlikely event of there being an embargo on oil.  Then, at least on the basis of hydro-power, peat and our own gas which we have, we can keep a substantial part of our electrical production going.  That seems to me to be prudent.</P>
    <P>On the one hand, you have an argument of efficiency and on the other hand you have an argument of security.  I think the correct balance is to give some of it for electricity generation and some of it for making chemicals.  That argument would not apply with further finds.  With further finds I think the argument is very strongly in favour of using it for a capital synthesis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the percentages of the two usages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want this to be considered an exact answer because I cannot give a hard answer, but my understanding is that the usages are approximately equal between electricity generation and the synthesis of calcium ammonium nitrate of that order of magnitude.  I am sorry I cannot be more precise.</P>
      <P>Let me turn to planning in regard to future discoveries.  The general planning, what I might call the planning carried out by staff who are currently in the employment of people like the Industrial Development Authority, is indeed going on. Detailed planning, as Deputies will know&mdash;feasibility studies&mdash;can cost £50,000, or £100,000 for a certain sort of chemical development.  We think it inappropriate to put that sort of money into hypothetical or speculative development plans when we do not know what the resource is.  We think it appropriate instead to be carrying on studies of a more general kind with a much lower cost than that, and these are going on in regard to the optimum kind of use between different possible syntheses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> I should say in this context that this is an area of investment that absolutely eats money.  The quantity of investment is immense and the labour content is very low indeed.  I do not suggest that the decisions in this area are easy ones.  I am informed that the ratio of NET use as to ESB use is 52 to 73, a little bit more to the ESB&mdash; out of 125 cubic million feet per day, 52 to NET, 73 to the ESB.  I have tried to answer the points made by Deputy O'Malley on a previous occasion.  If I have forgotten any point I will try to answer it now.</P>

      <P>Firstly, it is not proposed to have a nitric acid plant in Cork.  Secondly, a pipeline, I understand, is not economic but there will be the transfer of ammonia to the Arklow plant.  All of the planning of NET is to increase the security and to guarantee the future of Arklow by reciprocal relationship with Marino Point.  If you can guarantee from internally the supply of ammonia, that position is much more suitable than the one that is obtaining currently.  I want to put on the record of the House that there is no intention to undermine or to downgrade the future of the Arklow plant, which is secure and the security of which is increased by the development at Marino Point.  They are not seen, in <Col N="757" /> the planning or in the execution, as conflicting enterprises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned at one stage an external EEC tariff being imposed on products or supplies coming from countries outside the Common Market, such as Portugal.  Has that been considered at all?  Is it feasible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an Irish and an EEC common customs tariff on calcium ammonium nitrate and on other superphosphates, CCFs, urea and so on.  The position is that under Article 39 of the Accession Treaty there will be alignment of the common purchasing tariffs, and the process is as follows.  We took a first step on 1st January, 1974, of a 40 per cent alignment; 1st January, 1975, already down another 20 per cent.  That is a 60 per cent alignment up to now. On 1st January next year there will be another 20 per cent alignment and then a final 20 per cent, making 100 per cent alignment.  This is total alignment between our and the other Community countries' tariffs by 1st January, 1977.</P>
      <P>In the case of urea, that means an increase in our rate.  In the case of other nitrogenous matters, including calcium, ammonium and nitrogen, it means an increase.  With CCFs, of which there are two rates, a Commonwealth rate and a general rate, it means a diminution.  With superphosphate it means a diminution except in the case of Canada and Northern Ireland where it means an increase.  I can give the Deputy the details of that.  It is, perhaps, not suitable for saying across the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his swift action in introducing an £8 levy on imported fertiliser. Last week on this Bill we pointed out the seriousness of this problem to the Minister, who was well aware of it.  I am glad to see he has acted so swiftly, even before the commission had completed their findings, in endeavouring to close this loophole which will obviously be an embargo on the importation of fertilisers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" /> I should like to ask the Minister about the £22 million.  It is mainly for the building of the plant in Cork, but after being in existence for 12 years there are obviously major renewals required, particularly in the Arklow factory in the production of some of the acids and the other ingredients required for the production of fertilisers at Arklow.  Last year there was an explosion there.  Thankfully, nobody was hurt and there was no loss of life.  The accident took place on a Sunday when there were very few people there.  It was felt locally that a number of the plants would now be reaching the end of their useful life and there would be separate requirements of renewal there as a result of the very active use of that plant, particularly over the last few years.  We have seen the figures for production.  The factory was intended to produce something like 300,000 tons.  Now it is almost double that. I should like to know if part of this extra capitalisation will be used for the extension of the present factory at the site in Arklow as well as the main bulk of it going to the Cork plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would couple my reply to that to something I might have referred to earlier.  Firstly, let me make it clear that the moneys in this Bill are not intended for Arklow. The financing of the continuing updating of Arklow will be and is being achieved from cash flow.  Of course, one can say that it is a firm which is a single enterprise and has two plants. Its financing is looked at globally and what eases the situation in regard to one plant eases the situation totally. I said the last day that all borrowings would be repaid by 1982.  The discount in cash flow and other projections for the future indicate that the whole enterprise will be a significantly profitable one.  The other point I wanted to refer to which, in fact, Deputy O'Malley raised the last day was a matter of the borrowing.  He said:</P>
      <P>From what I can read in the balance sheet I do not think the company has any resources other than it got from finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> He continued:</P>
    <P>I wonder whether this borrowing is made abroad or whether it is to be raised domestically.</P>
    <P>The answer to that is related to what Deputy Kavanagh said.  The point is that when one is putting in chemical plant this is a large purchase which comes from a particular supplying country.  It is a very expensive bit of plant.  In regard to these things, which are at relatively cheap rates of interest, firstly the European Investment Bank money is available. Secondly, there is the British Export Credit Plan in relation to British plant.  We have a similar thing for NET.  The initials are the NCM, but the NCM is the Netherlands equivalent of the export guarantees, and the French equivalent is called COFAST which is a company to help foreign exports of French chemical and other capital goods at attractive interest rates.  There is what one might call a soft borrowing power of a considerable kind because of the nature of the investments.</P>
    <P>I would sum up by saying that, while none of the money in the Bill is intended specifically for Arklow, it is well recognised that chemical plants must keep up to date with technology and productivity.  The commitment to keeping Arklow a highly productive and modern plant is a firm one.  It will be possible to finance that from cash flow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister replied earlier to some of the points I had made, he declined to state the price of the gas being sold by the Gas Board to NET on the grounds that it was a commercial matter, and so on.  I do not want to follow that point, but it is debatable whether there should be non-disclosure of important national contracts such as that.  This is the first contract signed by a user of natural gas in this country.  While I am not asking the price as between Marathon and the Gas Board, I did ask the price as between the Gas Board and NET and whether the Gas Board take any profit on the transaction.  I suppose they have to have something to cover their <Col N="760" /> overheads but whether the profit is of any significance is a matter of national public importance.</P>
      <P>Having said he could not disclose the price being paid by NET for the gas, the Minister went on to say that the ammonia and urea which would be produced by NET from natural gas at Marino Point would be cheaper than what is being produced at the moment in Arklow.  The Minister's phrase, &ldquo;would be cheaper&rdquo;, suggests it might be as little as 5 per cent cheaper.  I thought it might be 50 or 75 per cent cheaper because of the extremely valuable material being got at a comparatively low price and a much greater ease of manufacture from natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say at first that I have a great deal of sympathy with that point of view.  This is a very important contract and the maximum possible disclosure is desirable.  The Deputy accepts that the Marathon-Gas Board step is one where commercial considerations preclude giving details.  On the Gas Board-NET step&mdash;I do not have the figures now and, indeed, the Gas Board is the responsibility of the Minister for Transport and Power, not mine&mdash; but I will certainly urge him, and I will myself look into the matter, that we should say as much as we can within the normal limits of commercial protection because it is in the public interest to have disclosure to the maximum possible consistent with proper commercial practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of how much cheaper, I hesitate to quantify because this is a very large plant and it will be some years before it is on its feet, and we have a product.  It is very difficult to predict what will happen to international prices in that time.  So, to make the comparison between what we could borrow internationally when we cannot predict the price of the international product is difficult. When the Deputy asks do I think 5 per cent to 10 per cent cheaper or 50 per cent to 75 per cent cheaper, 75 per cent cheaper is enormous; 5 per cent cheaper is not nearly enough.  I believe it will be very substantially <Col N="761" /> cheaper, more than 5 per cent and indeed more than 10 per cent, but I would find great difficulty in quantifying something that is three years away.  It is difficult to predict the evolution of prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates the importance of a significant reduction in price from the agricultural point of view and therefore from the general Irish national point of view, because with the drop in usage last year the agricultural effects of very dear fertiliser which we have at the moment will be very serious for the country as a whole.  I would like to refer to the chairman's statement in NET's accounts for the 18 months ended 31st December, 1974.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Turning to the national field the six-month period July to December, 1974 showed a serious decline in fertiliser sales, phosphorus and potassium each falling by 35 per cent to 40 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 1973. It should be stressed that a continuation of this trend through 1975, as is likely, will bring fertiliser consumption back eight years to the levels used in 1967.  If such a situation should persist for longer than one year the indications are indeed very serious for Irish agriculture and consequently for the whole economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He goes on to develop that point at length.  Because of what has happened and what is happening in relation to the usage of fertiliser here it is vitally important that there would be a substantial decrease in price as a result of this.  For these reasons it is very hard to gauge the matter unless we know the price which NET are going to pay for the gas and what the other likely costs will be.  In relation to that it would seem that since nitric acid or some other component must be added to the ammonia which will be manufactured at Marino Point and since it is not supposed to have a nitric acid plant at Marino Point, presumably all or nearly all of the ammonia will have to be transported to Arkow.  Is it proposed to transport <Col N="762" /> that by rail or road or by ship?  I understand that the transport of ammonia is not easy.  It has to be kept in liquid form at very low temperature and it gives rise to various problems. The form of transport would be important.  The most satisfactory form of transport would be by ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be by sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the most satisfactory from various points of view, not least the question of danger, if transported by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a mechanism for stabilising the future of the Arklow plant to have that indigenous source of ammonia available.  I come back to the point that the matter of price to the Irish farmers is extremely important and, as I said earlier, it is anticipated that in the area of the production of NET growth will resume in 1976 and their estimate is of 2 per cent or 3 per cent per annum growth thereafter.  The great worry is that by the end of this year NET will be importing approximately 120,000 tons of ammonia per annum to supplement the Arklow production of ammonia and that there is a difficulty about secure supplies of ammonia.  Ammonia is not freely available as an international commodity.  While marginal tonnages can be secured on international markets from various sources, long-term contracts that are secure are difficult to come by at this time. There is the question of security of supply as well as price which is very important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make a final point?  It is proposed, as the Minister has told us, to transport the ammonia from Marino Point to Arklow by ship.  Whether NET take over Gouldings or not, will NET make some of that ammonia that will be manufactured in Marino Point from natural gas available to the Goulding factories in Cork or Dublin and possibly to Albatross in New Ross also?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there will be surplus ammonia and that it will be commercially available. <Col N="763" /> As to which of the other Irish users decide to use it, there will be commercial considerations for them but it will be so available.  Ammonia will be available either to Gouldings or to Albatross if they wish to purchase it.</P>

      <P>I just want to be clear on the question of shareholding. The Minister has already answered this question but I want to clarify it a little further.  Is the Minister for Finance at the moment the only shareholder apart from his nominee, and will he remain the only shareholder?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When NET hopefully, as they project, will have cleared their capital liabilities and so on by 1982, will the Minister get a full commercial dividend at that stage from NET or will the profits which hopefully may exist after 1982 then be ploughed back into the industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>My own belief is that the greatest dividend to Ireland would be the growth in size and in strength and indeed some diversification. Of course, there is already the recovery of what was a surplus of waste gypsum in Arklow, which is a welcome development.  This is something which we ought to be flexible about.  In the long-run it is desirable that the State should operate by hard commercial criteria, by the rules of the market place.  While it is very desirable that we develop and grow and have the potential in fertilisers and possibly in some other areas that NET has developed, or is developing or may develop, there will be a change in the articles of association to permit a dividend because at a certain time we would have a level of growth where the State would wish to get a financial return as well as a return in technology and in employment. <Col N="764" /> That I think is some distance away.  The growth and development of the heavy chemical end is the priority rather than a repayment to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if this diversification will include an expansion into sea transport, including the purchase of a ship to transfer the ammonia from Arklow since he has conceded that this will be the cheapest mode of transport? Although it may not be under the aegis of the Minister's Department, does he accept that the facilities in Arklow port and indeed in Wicklow port will be sufficient for the safe unloading of the ammonia?  There is at present very extensive port improvements being done in Arklow but is the Minister satisfied that the supplies will be regular enough because of the work being done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I cannot, in fact, give the Deputy a firm answer.  I do not know the details of the plans of the company in that regard and, indeed, in general I favour a good deal of managerial and commercial independence for such undertakings. I would make a general observation in regard to cargoes like ammonia, that it is necessary for our economic growth that we move cargoes like this around the country and for the future development of ports they must be prepared to handle things like that and that with the knowledge that now exists if the proper precautions are taken both in advance in the planning and in the continuous scrutiny and invigilation in regard to the safety rules that this is something that is done all over the world very safely day after day and that if ports refuse to handle things like that what they are doing is simply cutting off their own future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section sets out the share capital which the Minister <Col N="765" /> for Finance can take up and which it is proposed that he would subscribe for in order partially to finance the Marino Point development in County Cork but if as appears to be possible NET were to take over an existing fertiliser firm, would the Minister come back to the House with further legislation in relation to that?  Would legislation be necessary either from the point of view of increasing the share capital or to empower NET to take over an existing firm which has been trading as a private company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting a bit into the realm of hypothesis.  I do not think one can answer in the abstract without knowing the details the question as to whether or not either coming back to the Dáil for legislation or a further expansion of share capital would be necessary.  I would simply say that I have no <i>a priori</i> position in this.  If it were necessary I would certainly do so.  I do not rule it out. But I think of course that if one wants to act briskly often mechanisms short of legislation can be found to do so though I am not in fact offering any judgment about the likelihood of it happening.  I believe that the flexibility of companies is such that it could be encompassed without legislation if it were necessary but I do not rule out legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If I could recap, with your permission, just for a moment.  I wonder in the Minister's provisional levy of £8 a ton if he had considered or if he has entered into negotiations with another Department with a view to this figure being substantial enough to allow some form of subsidy to be given on fertilisers.  Was that angle of it considered when the Minister came up with this figure of £8 per ton?  Did he allow a margin there for a subsidy which would be necessary I would say in the interim a couple of years before this plant at Cork came into operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of fertiliser subsidy is not a matter for my Department but I can offer the Deputy some arithmetic, which is to say, that CAN consumption in Ireland is of the order, I think&mdash;this is out of the <Col N="766" /> top of my head&mdash;of 300,000 tons a year.  The sort of importation we have been talking about in this context is of the order of 8,000 tons a year.  The 300,000 is only CAN.  Of course there are other sorts of fertilisers used.  So that no amount of duty or levy or anything else on a tonnage as small as we are now concerned with makes any relevant difference to the subsidising of other sorts of fertilisers.  It simply is of a scale of magnitude which would make no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it to the Minister that while we accept his responsibility for the maintenance of employment in the fertiliser factories, the imposition of the levy on imported CAN that he has mentioned must necessarily mean dearer fertilisers for the agricultural industry?  This in turn will make farming even less profitable than it is at present.  In view of this case that seems to me to be unanswerable in so far as it goes and in so far as it relates to the overall quantity of imported calcium ammonium nitrate that we do get in and that does become subject to levy, it reinforces the argument that Deputy Murphy has made for the Government to consider the subsidisation of nitrogenous fertilisers, especially of the nitrate kind. It might be somewhat different to extend the subsidy to all nitrogenous fertilisers like urea.  From my own experience of handling urea it is rather tricky material to handle.  It is not as easy to make a case for the subsidy on urea as it is on nitrate.  Nitrate in the form of ammonium nitrate is a basic material for animal protein which in turn is a raw material of our main export.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I accept that the question of subsidy for fertilisers is a matter for another Minister, at the same time it is a matter for the Government as a whole.  If the action of the Minister in the control of imported calcium ammonium nitrate produces dearer fertilisers for the agricultural industry it must impose an obligation on him as a member of the Government to tell the farming community in what way they will be compensated for the <Col N="767" /> inescapable rise in fertiliser cost that will arise.</P>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Minister&mdash;I was attempting to do so, when we were discussing the Second Stage and I think I could appropriately do it, Sir, on this section and I think it is vital to the interests of the fertiliser factory workers both in Arklow and in New Ross&mdash;whether it is proposed at any stage to develop a nitric acid plant in Cork, because in the first place it would seem to be a logical development of an ammonia plant but if it does take place and if the liquid ammonia is not transported, presumably by sea, to New Ross or Arklow it will mean that the calcium ammonium plants in New Ross and Arklow may well become redundant if you do set up a nitric acid plant in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I dealt with the latter question of the Deputy but I am pleased with the opportunity to talk about the price of fertilisers because Deputy Gibbons referred to an inescapable rise in the fertiliser price as a result of this action.  Let us recap to say that approximate consumption of CAN is 300,000 tons a year, that the amount that this will refer to, that has not already come in, of this shipment from Portugal, we think is in the order of 2,000 tons still to come. That is 0.66 per cent, I think, of our total consumption.  A change in the price of that will make very little difference&mdash;I would go so far as to say no measureable difference&mdash;to the price Irish farmers will pay for CAN. One has to strike a balance.  Deputy Murphy and other Deputies are concerned with helping the fertiliser industry and with the health of the workers in that industry.  We have to be concerned with protecting it.  If we let it be smashed, the Irish farmer will have to pay more in the long run because the reason for smashing it is to get control of the market.  We have <Col N="768" /> to protect it on the one hand and yet protect it with the absolute minimum protection that puts up the prices for farmers not at all, or by no measurable amount.</P>
      <P>I suggested an increase of £8 a ton. and said there was an arrangement for less, where dumping could be shown to be less, and an exemption where no dumping took place in regard to Portugal.  It only relates to Portugal and is for half a year.  I suggest that that scale of intervention will not make a measurable difference to the price Irish farmers pay for CAN.  I recognise the importance of that input and how essential it is to have competitive nitrogenous fertilisers for the health of our agricultural industry.</P>

      <P>I was shocked when I got the amendments and looked at section 7 to discover that the Minister did not propose to make any provisions to meet the case put forward by this side of the House on the Committee Stage.  I can only presume that the Minister is not capable of taking an objective look at the case put by Deputy Colley.  I am sure the Minister has had an opportunity to read our remarks made on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the replies given by the Minister for Lands when dealing with this section on the Committee Stage was that the Opposition had not put down any amendment.  I asked the Minister if people would be able to <Col N="770" /> make provision for their own retirement and, although the record did not say so, the Minister nodded.  I presumed there was something in the Minister's mind in connection with this but I assume now that he misheard the question.  I submit that this amounts to a clear discrimination against self-employed persons who may be in a position and need to make provision for their retirement.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the implications behind the reluctance to concede fair play to a self-employed person, which is allowed in the case of employees or even executives of firms who have made provision, through payments over a period of years for superannuation and which is also properly made in the case of all the areas of public service and the Oireachtas itself.  To fail to make provision in this area is to discriminate against the solid, hard-working earner in an enterprise economy, that is the individual who sets up a small factory or runs a farm for his lifetime.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat all the arguments I made on Committee Stage but I will give a summary of what I said then. Deputy Colley put a very substantial case in regard to the provisions which should be available by way of special exemption but he did not specify what this should be.  On the Committee Stage the Minister for Lands said that any individual who sells a farm or business could buy gilt-edged securities and provide himself with a substantial retirement benefit, still falling within the area of the threshold.</P>
    <P>The envies and jealousies the Minister has been referring to do not concern us.  I am concerned about two aspects of the attitude being displayed by the Minister.  One relates to ordinary fair play and social justice and the other to the vital importance, on this side of the Iron Curtain, of the individual who puts his efforts and energies as a self-employed individual in either the development of farmland or the establishment and creation of industry.</P>
    <P>The position, as it stands under this Bill, is that many individuals are not fortunate enough during their working life to be able to provide the very substantial <Col N="771" /> superannuation contributions which many large industrial firms provide for executives and workers. Because of the risks involved, and because capital is vital, they cannot extract from a farm, business or industry the necessary superannuation contributions to provide for their retirement.  If and when they are able to make such an investment, unless they surrender entirely the capital they built up, it will be included under this Bill for assessable tax.</P>
    <P>They are also up against another major disability which Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or people in the public service, Garda, the Army and so on, and even the social welfare pensioner, are not up against, that is, the self-employed cannot make any significant provision against the inflationary effects on their investment.  The Minister for Lands described them as gilt-edged securities which are now available at £80 for £100, showing approximately 13 or 14 per cent.  Even if they succeed in providing a substantial return, taking a generous look at the inflationary situation, and allowing for a 15 per cent depreciation per annum, within five years their return will be reduced to half.  The pension rate of a Member of the Oireachtas or anyone engaged in the public service will be made up by the taxpayer year by year.</P>
    <P>We are discussing here a category of the community who are the real creators of employment and wealth, upon whom the public service&mdash; health, education, Army, Garda, civil service and so on&mdash;depend.  I can only conclude from the Minister's remarks that he does not understand the situation.  Not alone does he not understand the basic justice involved here, but the necessity for any Administration to encourage the enterprising and energetic, in the interests of the economy.  How any Government can, in effect, discriminate against the people who are the real earners&mdash;farmers, small businesses or established factories&mdash;defeats me.  I can only conclude that the Minister has closed his ears to any case, valid or otherwise, because it is put by the Opposition or, perhaps, <Col N="772" /> because he got a few anonymous letters.  The position seems to be that, so far as the person who is an employed worker and can retire on social welfare pension now at the age of 67 is concerned, he is in a far better position, while the energetic individual who creates wealth, in so far as this Bill is concerned, must extend his working life up to the age of 75 years or until he drops dead.  It seems to me that the social approach here is that of people who want only wage earners.</P>
    <P>If the State is not to take over all property, the question the Minister should ask himself is where is productive creativity and employment to come from if the approach of the Government is to discriminate against the real creators of wealth.  The right principle in relation to this individual&mdash;I agree with Deputy Colley it is difficult to arrive at any assessment of how the State could provide for his natural right to the requirements of this Bill&mdash;would be to allow a person aged 55 or 60 or 65 who retires from work on his or her own means, who has been self-employed and cannot look forward to the benefits of superannuation, an exemption to an amount of £X for the purposes of retirement and that amount should be scaled upwards with the rise in inflation over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in speaking on this amendment, referred to the present rise and the future rise.  That kind of talk is, to a considerable extent, academic.  We covered a good deal of this area over the past five or six weeks and if he does not encourage energy, enterprise, risk, development which leads to an expansion of the economy, then he is not going to see wealth created and, in any community in which wealth is not created by the people who live in it, the inevitable result is a decline in economic development, a decline in employment and a reduction in the standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is another amendment put forward by Deputy Colley to try to bring some semblance of equality <Col N="773" /> into this Bill.  We tried on the Committee Stage to remedy the anomalies. We put forward amendments to try to get equality for every man and woman.  The Minister rejected them all.  We tried in the last amendment in regard to the private trading company to improve the substance of the Bill.  Again, the Minister rejected it. In amendments put forward on the Capital Gains Tax Bill the Minister at least saw the wisdom of our suggestions and some of our amendments are now incorporated in the legislation on capital gains.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not seen our point of view in regard to the Wealth Tax Bill.  All the amendments we put forward are, in the opinion of the Minister, completely futile and serve no useful purpose.  This Bill lends itself to bad legislation, and practical amendments can come from this side as well as from the Government side. All the wisdom is certainly not on one side of the House.  Deputy Colley brought forward this amendment to try to bring some semblance of equality into the Bill in regard to pension rights for those in the private sector.  I want to make it clear that, in so far as those in the public sector are concerned, they are quite entitled to the pensions they have built up over the years and this is put forward as an example of what we want in the private sector.</P>
      <P>We must examine the situation where a businessman is concerned, be he big or small.  If he is small, he is seriously victimised.  Naturally, if he is in a very high bracket, say over £40,000, he can avail of the maximum concessions obtainable in regard to contributions to a pension fund and, as recognised by the Revenue Commissioners, up to a figure of £1,500 per annum.  He can avail of that concession from a very early stage in his life and secure for himself pension rights and at the age of retirement of 65 years he will have his pension rights plus his capital asset, which will be subject to wealth tax only if it is over the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the situation of the businessman, starting on a small scale. We want to encourage him to expand. <Col N="774" /> He is not in a position to avail of pension rights to the extent of, say, £1,500 a year.  He would not be in a position to withdraw that amount of capital from his business, because if he did, it is quite obvious that the particular type of business in which he is engaged would never expand.  He goes along developing his business, ploughing back the profits.  By doing so he is benefiting the economy, creating more employment and paying his income tax and surtax.  We should encourage him to continue in that way, even to the date of his retirement.  He should be encouraged to expand his business in the interests of the economy.  What can happen, and if he has any sense, it should happen, is that he should as far as possible provide himself with some means of superannuation or pension fund, especially if he is near the threshold of £100,000. If he takes the opposite view and ploughs back into his business the money he could possibly invest in a superannuation fund and his business reaches a value of £140,000, he is in the situation where, when he is capitalising that sum, not alone is he subject to wealth tax during the time he holds it, but he will be liable for capital gains tax when he disposes of it&mdash; that is, if he takes the line of not investing in a pension fund.  I would prefer that he would take that line because that would be more beneficial for the country.  It would be contributing to the economy.  It would be creating more employment and, at the same time, he would be paying his income tax and probably his wealth tax.</P>
    <P>One can, however, take a different view.  If he has reached that level he should, if at all possible, try to get from the bank, or take out of his business, money to create a pension or superannuation scheme for himself, as approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  By taking that line his business will naturally have to suffer.  That kind of money is not in the business to be taken out for that purpose.  Looking at it from that point of view, the Minister is unwise in not making provision for this particular type of person.  Surely, the <Col N="775" /> man who was in a position from early on in life to take out a scheme such as this, when he had a property of £100,000, is entitled to his pension of £3,000 or £4,000 a year, whatever the case may be.  By virtue of the fact that he was in such a financial position at the time to undertake this kind of scheme, is it fair that the other man who was not in a position to create this type of fund for himself should not be entitled to the same concessions?  I believe he should be. These are the kind of people we should encourage, the bedrock of our economic expansion.  We must create the right climate for people, be they in agriculture, in industry or in the professions.  They all play a very important role in our society.  But this section does not lend itself to encouraging that type of person.  To me it is ludicrous and I cannot understand the logic of it.  One person can have an income from a pension fund. I am not now talking about the public sector.  You can have this too in the private sector.  If you have sufficient funds and assets to acquire it for yourself, you can build up an annuity for yourself and that will be exempt from wealth tax, but another person, who has genuinely re-invested all his finances and funds, will be penalised.  I know they are all entitled to the same thresholds with regard to wealth tax but it is the income that counts, one's income when one reaches 55 or 65 years of age.  It is unwise for the Minister to differentiate as between these two sectors of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's amendment provides that concessions will be given which will equate with pensions in the public sector.  That is the only reason why the public sector is used in this particular amendment.  I believe that this is a wise yardstick to use.  If we overlook this particular sector we will find, as time goes on, especially in time of economic crisis, the price we will have to pay.  If there is one section of the community that contributes a great deal in time of recession to bring the country's economy back into viability it is the <Col N="776" /> private sector.  Those in this sector are an independent people.  They were never dependent on benefits of any description.  Very seldom did they get free hospitalisation.  I do not think they ever asked for any great contribution from the State.  The Minister has an opportunity in this Bill of doing something positive for them now.  What Deputy Colley is looking for is only common sense, treating everybody equally.  There is nothing wrong with that.  We have sought right through the Bill to get this incorporated in other sections but the Minister has refused our appeal.  We are asking him now to give those in the private sector the same considerations as is accorded to those enjoying pensions in various other sections of the community.  If this equality is not given there is bound to be a certain discontent.  You can call it discrimination, if you wish.  It is discrimination. We have had enough discrimination in the Bill without adding this.</P>
    <P>In another section in this Bill we have nationals subject to wealth tax while foreigners are exempt.  That is a bad enough distinction between foreigners and nationals but in this section we are actually trying to polarise, to divide our community as between different occupations in life&mdash; those enjoying pensions in other sectors against those in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The Minister is unwise not to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.  It would certainly be a step in the right direction. It would be recognising the difficulties the private sector encounter in making provision for retirement.  There is no provision for a man, with four or five children, running a business or small factory.  Nobody is concerned about him in his retirement.  If he retires and is unfortunate enough to have to close down his factory or if he goes bankrupt there is no pension scheme.  There will be no provision for him, his wife and his family.  There are no provisions catering for that section of the community, unless a man has the finance available to undertake a scheme that will give him certain pension rights which are approved by the Revenue Commissioners.  But he may not be in a position to do that.  Other people are sheltered from the time they <Col N="777" /> enter a profession, let them be 18 or 20 years of age, until the time they retire on pension.  I approve of that policy.  Unfortunately, successive Governments have never made provision for the protection of people in the private sector.  Let them fall into ill health and not be in a position to carry on their business, they have to do the best they can with what remains of their assets after going bankrupt, or being forced to sell.  This amendment of Deputy Colley's is a gesture in the right direction.  We are showing we recognise their difficulties.  It will not cost the Revenue Commissioners an enormous amount of money.  The Minister could perhaps devise a closer and more tightly-knit amendment himself but it is a recognition that this section of the community that they have problems as regards their retirement and making provision for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an opportunity now of recognising it.  He knows perfectly well the difficulties the private sector are encountering at present.  This is a Bill which is supposed to distribute wealth, which of course it does not, but at least if we are trying to distribute it, everybody should be treated equally under the Bill.  We should not discriminate against one particular section. The Minister mentioned that it would create administrative problems. If you want to have perfection in any scheme you draw up of course there will be problems, and Ministers and Departments are there to iron out these difficulties.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look closely at this.  It deserves serious consideration and it would give recognition to people in the private sector who also have problems as regards making provision for their retirement.  That is exactly what Deputy Colley's amendment contains&mdash;provision to make a certain allowance that would be in line where those in the public sector are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage we argued this point strongly.  It was the Minister's colleague who was sitting opposite at the time.  Referring back to the Official Report I would point out that the example I took on that occasion was, on purpose, selected <Col N="778" /> from the area of public companies.  I do not mean semi-State companies but public companies in the sense of the Companies Act.  There were authorised pension schemes approved of by the Revenue Commissioners under the relevant Act.  I took that as the norm.  The case I based on that was that if you were making a provision for all the exemptions that are covered particularly in paragraph (e), you must realise there is one omission.  In making these exemptions the Minister is perfectly right in the attitude he has taken there so far but there was one omission.  It was this. In certain cases there would be provision for an annuity.  If a provision was not put in this section, the annuity which would really be a pension, would not get this relief.  I was quite prepared to leave it at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioner to test <i>bona fides.</i> I would remind the Minister when he brought in the amendment from the Seanad today that the phrase &ldquo;or such longer period as the Revenue Commissioners may by notice in writing allow&rdquo; appeared in it.  I would be prepared to abide by the judgment of the Revenue Commissioners here.  The essential point was this.  This section does not cover the case of a doctor, professional man, self-employed business man of a type that was fairly common, a man who has a business house of his own whether in the licensed trade or drapery trade even in these days of agglomerated business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They will, but while they are with us I would suggest there should be equality of treatment. The formula which I tried to suggest on that occasion and which Deputy Colley is proposing here is that in so far as you had a <i>bona fide</i> provision for a pension that the annuity by way of pension should be treated at the pensionable stage as these other pensions are treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a long discussion in regard to capitalisation and capitalisation values.  I think it is on the record.  I had not time to read the record since. <Col N="779" /> I think the Minister deputising for the Minister and his advisers got the point.  I would like to refer to that argument again and like the Minister to consider it as repeated.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether happy with the wording of this amendment: Deputy Colley will not mind my saying so.  I do not like the narrowing of it by the words &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo;.  I know Deputy Colley put them there in order to be definite and get the spirit of it.  I was not here at the time, unfortunately, but I think he has pointed out that this was meant to be a framework which we could discuss at the last minute hoping the Minister would accept the spirit of this amendment. These words seem to connote a certain equality in level of payment which is not quite the same thing as equality in provision and equality in rights against taxation.  For that reason I am worried about defining a particular class.  On the other hand, &ldquo;public service&rdquo; might be too broad. I would like the taxation relief to be equal for all no matter in what sector and in its application the specifics will determine precise levels of payment and will depend on relative scales of remuneration and so on.  I would like to make a distinction between parity in payment and parity in benefit with parity in treatment in regard to taxation.  It is a difficult point to put over in this way, but I mean as to equality and parity before the law in regard to the incidence of taxation.</P>
    <P>It could be suggested that instead of using the word &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; in the amendment the word &ldquo;public sector&rdquo; or &ldquo;public service&rdquo; should be used.  I would certainly like to think about that.</P>
    <P>We have to consider the importance of parity in provision and equality before the law, because if you allow disparity to cause large diversions then ultimately there would have to be a closing of gaps with embarrassment and difficulty to the parties concerned.  On the Committee Stage I took one example of this.  It so happens that today we are discussing this amendment when we have <Col N="780" /> reason to understand that the lead will come in the public sector.  We have reason to understand, as indeed the Government understand&mdash;perhaps too late&mdash;that that lead can easily set the pattern and it is very hard to avoid equality with the public sector for all when such matters arise.  Such thoughts make one urge the Minister to consider the principle of this amendment though I am demurring from its actual wording and particularly from its specification here.</P>
    <P>If the economy survives at all pension schemes will be more and more part of the scene.  Industrial pension schemes will be more part of the scene in industry at large.  Parity in those schemes will ultimately be demanded whether within the industry itself or within the community.  Demands will be made for parity before the law and parity in treatment and more and more will the impact of the mass of the people concerned be on those who are in the more favourable position, whether in the public service or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very vocal on this question of levelling wealth, of equality, and of socialisation of the community.  The Minister should reflect that this is happening whether he advocated it or not.  His own experience, even of this day, may give him cause for reflection, but there is one thing that is certain, that this levelling process is going on and it would be well to have regard to it and that the greatest contribution to stability that the Minister can make at the moment is to provide in legal terms for this equality and parity of what I may call opportunity rather than regard it as a question of pay levels or anything like that.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned industrial pension schemes.  These can very easily be&mdash; and indeed in the case of public companies are&mdash;under the schemes here approved under the relevant Acts of Parliament.  Limits and levels and how much provision can be allowed for inflation in all these things are decided upon and there is discretion given under those Acts. All I will say is that these levels should also be applied with judicial impartiality <Col N="781" /> and that no group or element should be favoured more than another.</P>
    <P>That brings me to Deputy Fitzpatrick's arguments.  With regard to the industrial workers the mass influence will correct itself and there is a trend now whereby it is clear that the Minister and his Government are relatively unimportant and therefore I do not need to plead the case of those who have the power.  I would plead the case of equality if it were necessary. With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's arguments, I would like to say that there is an unfortunate confusion in the use of the word &ldquo;public&rdquo;.  We know quite clearly what we mean and probably this is why Deputy Colley used the words &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; to which I have demurred.  What was meant to be conveyed there is the State service proper in its restricted and traditional sense.  The public sector in the ordinary connotation of the word has expanded in our time, particularly the Department of Local Government to fringe bodies.  It is taken to include such arms of the public service as the Garda Síochána and the teachers and so on, who would not be within the class described as civil servants but who are nevertheless public servants and are in the public sector.</P>
    <P>This area has been further expanded through the development of the semi-State body which is really a State activity, because they are very largely devices for public activity and public utility.  The Electricity Supply Board was one of the earliest.  There are many others and CIE is now in that category.  According to the context these bodies might or might not be implied in the phrase &ldquo;public sector&rdquo;.  If it is taken that the public sector embraces the civil service, the Garda Síochána, the Army, teachers and semi-State bodies then I should say, let there be parity there in provisions. Again, I am insisting on parity in provision where taxation is concerned: I am not advocating necessarily parity of levels or anything like that.  Everybody has his own job and there is the appropriate levelling of them.  I merely want to find out the importance of parity and procedure or, if you like, the avoidance of particular <Col N="782" /> privilege anywhere.  Then there is this word &ldquo;public&rdquo; used in the Companies Act to mean a public company.  Here we have the confusion. If one refers to a public company one is often thought to be referring to a semi-State body. Under the Companies Act a public company is a definite corporate entity with a number of shareholders and subject to provisions under company law.  Many of them are still of great economic importance; we are not yet a completely socialised State in the conventional sense of the term and we have some important public companies which are private enterprise.</P>
    <P>It is important, when one is talking about private enterprise, to realise that public companies of this nature are private enterprise.  They are often more beneficial to the community than the other.  If anyone wants to have experience let them cross the water and look at the history of British Steel or any of these things and judge the merits of private enterprise or otherwise.  But they are public enterprises, public companies and they are the major part of private enterprise. They have a large employment and creative employment content.</P>
    <P>If we consider we have already granted parity in the public sector in the first sense in which I described it then, if the schemes are suitably framed and administered, there is no reason why that considerable part of the private sector should not be treated the same.  That is generally provided for in this section.  All it requires is that the schemes devised for that part of the private sector, the public company which will have its schemes, should be on the parity that should exist internally within the public sector, defined in the sense of the public service, including the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>If that analysis is right, if the principle of parity, of opportunity, procedure and parity before the law in regard to these schemes, and judicial impartiality in the administration of these schemes, is right, then so far the section is right, and to be commended. However, one finds highlighted the <Col N="783" /> element which Deputy Fitzpatrick emphasised.  Who are they anyway? What is not provided?  The Minister has provided for the public service in general, for all those who are, so to speak, paid directly or indirectly by the State, and for the public element in private enterprise&mdash;the public company, the normal public company of size and with employment content as provided for in the Companies Act and our own latest Act of 1963.  But in startling contrast one finds that not only does the Minister not provide for an element of the community but by not providing for them they are, so to speak, in a penalised, or to be more modern, a seriously disadvantageous position.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the individual businessman.  He may be a private trading company, or the owner of a licensed premises&mdash;as Deputy Brugha said, they are getting fewer and far between because the bigger element is taking over&mdash;it could also be a family firm.</P>
    <P>I made the argument on Committee Stage about retiral and I do not want to repeat all that again, but it can definitely be a professional man, a doctor, an accountant or a lawyer.  It may not be a large proportion of the population but for their numbers they are giving good service to the community and only too willing during their lives to support themselves and not be a burden on their descendents or the State.  Are not these people at a disadvantage if we do not provide for them?  A professional man who saves a sum of money to provide himself with an annuity for the time he retires or when he can no longer practice, or a businessman who has built up his own business and has either passed it on to his family or has sold it when he can no longer work, at that stage can realise the capital and has the sum of money there for it.  Whether that is covered or not elsewhere I am leaving aside for the moment because some such provision should be in this section.</P>
    <P>Is it not a little hard that some provision, some recognition of that <Col N="784" /> group, who would not be as wealthy as many in the other group at that stage, might perhaps have smaller annuities, might be in more modest circumstances, is not included?  Is it not a serious omission on our part not to provide something in this section to cater for such cases?  This is the general case I make to the Minister demurring at the actual wording of the amendment, but then after all Opposition amendments very often have to be of this nature.  It takes the Minister's resources, and the professional advice, to perfect an idea.  The Minister has listened and has amended his BIlls, after listening to discourse of this nature here and, notwithstanding the strains and the difficulties of the moment, I am sure he would still wish to take the same attitude now.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the philosophy of envy one way or the other and that is a terrible thing no matter how it is applied and it must, therefore, be eradicated.  We must not be shy to support the victims of that philosophy or of a campaign of that nature wherever they lie, in the public sector or anywhere else.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that in the public sector many people in onerous positions by comparison with what will be found in private enterprise, in what I call the public sector of private enterprise, were poorly remunerated for their labours.  The dangers are becoming more obvious every day.  Where disparities develop problems are bound to arise.  Where problems arise nowadays they are apt to spread and local solutions are apt to be applied generally and if they are not applicable generally something has to give somewhere.  All that so far as taxation is concerned can be avoided by a little trouble to get scrupulous fairness in approach.  On that general ground I support Deputy Fitzpatrick's plea. May I point out to the Minister that what we are seeking is not to modify what is here which is excellent; it is to add that little bit that will provide for that one area which to a large extent is excepted, and try to get this uniformity of approach that would make everybody feel that taxation <Col N="785" /> law was, like Caesar's wife, absolutely above reproach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister when speaking on this amendment used some rather intemperate language in relation to representations made to him from outside this House on this matter.  When I was proposing the amendment I said I was aware of some of the representations made to the Minister, and to the Taoiseach.  I said some of them were in fairly strong language.  It could be said that the Minister's language was equally strong.  While it is interesting to note the Minister's reaction to those representations it was particularly interesting to note his reference to such representations being motivated by envy, amongst other things.  It was interesting in the context of the Bill and the methods used by the Minister to try to sell the whole idea of this Bill.  It seemed that the Minister was getting a small taste of the same methods being used against what he was proposing, and he did not like it. I would agree with him; I do not think much of the politics of envy either whichever way they are used.</P>
      <P>However, the reality of this amendment and the merits of it are another matter.  I was aware, more so than anybody else, of certain snags arising out of the drafting of these amendments. I know a number of the difficulties that are not covered.  I do not consider it to be my duty to usurp the functions of the Parliamentary Draftsman but rather to indicate in the amendments the basis on which this difficult problem could be approached.  I was not happy about the use of the phrase &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; in the amendment but, as Deputy de Valera surmised, there was a reason for that use.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Draftsman would have a better way of putting this but I was not anxious to use the phrase &ldquo;public servant&rdquo; because there have been disagreements on what is precisely meant by &ldquo;public service&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will recall that when he was introducing a Bill to establish the Department of the Public Service he referred to the difficulties <Col N="786" /> which arise in this regard.  He may recall that in the Devlin Review Group's Report reference was made to this and, for the purposes of that report, the public service was assumed to cover the civil service, the semi-State bodies and the local authorities. That is the only reason I used the word &ldquo;civil servant&rdquo; in this amendment.</P>
    <P>The substance of the amendment is to try to ensure that as far as possible the same treatment is afforded for the purpose of this Bill to a person who is employed in and entitled to the benefit of the pension scheme that applies in the civil service and in the Houses of the Oireachtas to those who are not so entitled as regards pension rights.  The Minister said that the Bill exempts the right to receive a pension or an annuity, but it exempts the property of a superannuation scheme or fund so that there is more involved than merely the exemption of the right to receive.  The Minister talked about &ldquo;the present value&rdquo; of say, a pension or an annuity.  That is true as far as it goes but we should remember that it applies to the present value, not merely the present value on retirement.  Under these public service schemes there is an entitlement which exists for many civil servants now, even though they may not be retiring for ten years and that entitlement has a present value, a capital value.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the valid point that there is a difference between a person being entitled to a pension which has a capitalised value of £X,000 on the one hand and a person who actually has £X,000 on the other.  I agree there is a difference in value, but would the Minister accept also that there is a difference between a person who has a right to receive a pension, the present value of which is £X,000, and a person who has nothing?  I do not know how the difference can be measured between the £X,000 and a pension right which is worth in present value £X,000 but if there is a formula by which the difference can be measured I would have no objection whatever to the application of the formula to a taxpayer who had <Col N="787" /> wealth worth £X,000 and if one applied the formula to it to reduce that value for the purpose of exemption under this section, I would have no objection at all to that if such a formula is available and can be devised.  But to pretend that a self-employed person who has no superannuation rights at all can with justice have whatever capital he owns subjected to wealth tax, while somebody who has pension rights which have at present value in capitalised terms the same worth as the capital of the self-employed person should be exempt, and to suggest that this is equal treatment, is I would suggest, merely to engage in semantics.</P>
    <P>The Minister may make all the distinctions he wishes, the academic distinctions he was trying to make when he was dealing with this amendment between the entitlement of a person under the civil service pension scheme&mdash;I am using that as a shorthand&mdash;on the one hand, and the person in the private sector who has his business or capital or whatever, on the other, does not alter the fact that for the man who is retiring without benefit of the civil service pension scheme there is an enormous difference. To tell him that he is being treated equally under this Bill is something that you will not convince him of, and rightly in my opinion, because there is a difference in approach and there is a difference in treatment involved in this.</P>
    <P>As I said when proposing the amendment, there is a stark difference between the self-employed man who has no pension scheme and who is dependent on selling his business or the goodwill of his practice, or whatever, when he retires to provide for his own retirement, and the person entitled under the civil service pension scheme on the other.  That is the stark contrast: clearly there is not equality of treatment.</P>
    <P>But I should like to make it clear that there are far more people concerned with this than simply the self-employed who have no provision for their own retirement.  Everybody who <Col N="788" /> is not entitled to a pension on the lines of the civil service scheme is involved. That includes people employed in semi-State bodies, people in the private sector, all of whom may have pension schemes which are in effect exempt under this section, but none of whom has pension schemes which will give comparable benefits to the civil service scheme.  Therefore, to the extent that there is a difference in the capitalised value, they are not being treated in the same way as the civil service and they are not being allowed to accumulate a sufficient amount of capital to equalise their position with that of a comparable person under the civil service scheme without being subject to wealth tax.  That is what this amendment is all about.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest, nor have I suggested, that this is a matter easy of solution.  The Minister touched on one of the difficulties involved, of which I am conscious, in measuring the income of people, say, who are self-employed, but presumably one would operate on the basis of their income tax returns.  Some people might suggest that they were not accurate.  That would be too bad for them in my view, but it is a measure that is available to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The real point at issue here is that if the will is there to try to achieve reasonable equality, an effort can be made on the lines of this amendment, but the Minister unfortunately has made it clear the will is not there as far as he is concerned.  He either has convinced himself or has allowed himself to be convinced that there is no problem here and that there is no difference in the method of treatment being dealt out under section 7.  I want to tell him firstly that there is a problem here and many people are conscious of it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is an enormous disparity in treatment under this section. It simply is not good enough to say we are exempting all approved pension schemes, whether in the public or private sector.  That is simply glossing over the realities of what is involved.  If a man is retiring today it makes an enormous difference to him whether he is to receive a pension of <Col N="789" /> £X a year or half £X a year.  If he is to receive only half £X a year and that is not to be allowed to accumulate sufficiently to make up the other half £X without being subjected to wealth tax while certain people are allowed to have £X a year pension without being subjected to wealth tax, how can you convince him that he is being treated equally with other people?  There is no way you can do it because he is not being treated equally.</P>
    <P>That being so, the Minister in refusing to accept this amendment or even the principle of this amendment is guilty in my view of engaging in unfair treatment of people who, as was pointed out earlier, particularly by Deputy Brugha, are people who are vitally important to the economy of this country on which most people, a relatively small category, are depending for their living and occupations. <Col N="790" /> To refuse to give such people equal treatment is in my view both inequitable and very misguided in the long-term interests of all of us.  Yet that is what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>As we had to say in regard to other amendments, if the Minister is doing so he is doing it fully conscious of the consequences.  If he was not conscious of them before he is now because we have drawn his attention to these consequences.  We have gone so far as to indicate in these amendments the way in which the problem might be tackled, but the Minister either is not interested or does not think it is worthwhile.  We think it is worthwhile and very important and the failure of the Minister to do this is a consequence accruing on his head and not on ours.  We have done our best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 56, before &ldquo;gardens&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;houses or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister introduced an amendment to exempt from liability for wealth tax certain gardens, subject to various conditions, rightly in my view. This amendment seeks to apply the same exemption, subject to the same conditions, to certain houses.  I mentioned in the discussion on the Committee Stage as a possible example Castletown House.  I do not like mentioning specific places.  I do not know the situation there, whether it is the principal residence of the owner.  I rather think not.  I am mentioning this as an example of the kind of place I have in mind.  There are some such cases around the country, not very many, where the property concerned has a high capital value with little or no income value.  It seems to me that we ought, subject to the conditions which are laid down by the Minister in regard to certain special gardens, apply the same exemption to houses of this kind which have a particular interest historic, artistic or otherwise as defined in the section.</P>
      <P>It was suggested from the Minister's side of the House on the Committee Stage that we could see how this operated and then, if necessary, the Bill could be amended.  I want to suggest to the Minister that that is the wrong approach because by the time it is discovered that the amendment should be made some of these places may well be demolished and nothing can be done then.  I would suggest that the correct approach is to accept this amendment and then if it is found subsequently that it is not necessary or that it is open to any form of abuse, although I cannot see how it could be, then to amend the legislation by deleting this.  To operate on the other basis is leaving the matter to chance and with the impact of wealth tax on properties of the kind I am mentioning which have little or no income almost certainly it will lead to demolition of houses of particular interest which should be retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> There cannot be any real significance as far as the Minister is concerned from the point of view of revenue in accepting this amendment. It would be very unenlightened of this House to pass this legislation without a provision of this kind.  I would therefore strongly urge the Minister to accept the Amendment with the possibility always open that if it turns out in due course to be unnecessary or to need modification that can be done.  Not to do it now may mean it will be too late if any change is made in due course.</P>

      <P>When a similar amendment was being discussed on Committee Stage the Minister for Lands standing in for the Minister for Finance said that it was not really that important because if houses of this kind were there they could not be of very much value and therefore would not rate in the assessment of a person who owns such a house.  That may be true up to a point; it depends on the method of valuation.  The principle which the Minister has included running through this section 7, in regard to pictures, prints, books, manuscripts and so on, things of a national, scientific, historic or artistic interest and gardens situate in the State which appear to be of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest must also apply in the case of houses of a similar kind.  As Deputy Colley has already said, the amount would not be very great.  At least it is marginally worthwhile retaining such houses rather than that the owner would feel that it was being added in against his estate for wealth tax and therefore would dispose of it.  The basic idea behind the amendment is desirable and ought to be considered by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Committee Stage I exempted gardens which were of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, provided reasonable facilities for viewing were available to the public.  As has happened with virtually every step of capital taxation legislation, every time I have given an inch people have demanded a mile.  Were it not for the fact that <Col N="794" /> I am of a generous disposition.  I might long since have resisted even moving an inch because of the advantage people took when I moved at all.</P>
      <P>Let us face some of the practical problems that would arise if we were to accept the amendment.  Who would determine what is a house of historic interest?  Would it be historic merely because somebody was born there or somebody lived there?  We have had near riots in this city in recent times because houses were about to be pulled down which had no historic association other than that some people lived there for a while. Are such houses to be exempt even if they are used for business offices? I can think of some such within 500 yards of where we are meeting tonight.  Or, would you provide that if they were used for business purposes and were of an historic value that would exclude the right?  Or, supposing you had a house which was of historic interest because somebody was born there&mdash;I can think of a number of such houses in this city with plaques on the outside commemorating the fact that writers of plays or books or artists have been born there, quite clearly there would be a serious administrative problem if the amendment were to be accepted.</P>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Colley who says give a generous exemption and hope for the best that it is not abused and then come in and tighten it if it is, I would prefer to have the Bill providing reasonable exemptions which can be effectively managed and administered and if particular difficulties come to light then to legislate, if need be, retrospectively, to provide the relief.  In most cases if a house is habitable it will be occupied.  If it is not occupied it may well be that the owners of it are abroad and have decided not to live in it.  That is their decision.  If they lose exemption as a consequence of that it might be an encouragement to them to return to live here in order to get the exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that there are many houses which would be of the type <Col N="795" /> described by Deputy Colley.  The strange thing is that none that I know of has been brought to our notice in the course of the representations that have been made.  Prior to the publication of the Bill and following the publication of the White Paper there were quite a number of representations made about houses and gardens and other places like that being provided with exemptions where they were reasonably accessible to the public.  I cannot recollect that we received any representations since the publication of the Bill, which leads me to believe that people must be reasonably happy that the provisions of the Bill cover the genuine cases.</P>
    <P>The best thing to do is to pass the Bill as it stands.  It would be inadvisable at this early stage to make any further amendment in it.  We will watch the situation and in the light of experience and full knowledge of the realities of the situation rather than the suppositions, we can consider whether or not amendments of the law are required in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all let me say, to the best of my recollection, on the Second Reading of this Bill I urged the Minister to provide this exemption in respect of both houses and gardens of historic interest.  The Minister brought in an amendment to cover gardens, not houses.  Then we have this extraordinary approach by the Minister in which he says &ldquo;I am generous and then people are pushing me.  When they get an inch they want a mile.&rdquo;  I do not know if the Minister realises just how much he is revealing when he says this.  Of course, the Minister's approach to this ought to be, &ldquo;Is this worthwhile? Is it a good thing or is it not?&rdquo; It has nothing to do with the Minister's generosity or lack of generosity.  It is a question of what is right or what is wrong in his judgment and in our judgment.  I find it a little disturbing, to say the least, to hear a Minister talk in these terms. <Col N="796" /> The present Minister for Finance is not the first Minister to talk in these terms, nor is he indeed the first Minister for Finance to do so, but he ought to cop himself on.  No matter which of his predecessors spoke in that way before it is a wrong approach to the position of the Minister for Finance. It is an introduction of a personal approach when it should be, as far as the Minister can do it, an objective approach.  The fact is that the Minister said in effect that it was not possible to distinguish what would be an historic house and what was not.  Did somebody live there, was somebody born there and so on.  How is he going to distinguish a garden of historic interest, which is precisely what he is providing in the Bill?  Does it depend on whether Master McGrath is buried there or what?  What is the use in telling us about these difficulties when the Minister already has them in the Bill and contemplates them?</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that a house which is a principal residence is already exempt and of the remaining houses very few could qualify for the conditions which are laid down, those conditions being &ldquo;which on a claim being made to the Commissioners appear to them to be of national scientific, historic or artistic interest and in respect of which reasonable facilities for viewing are allowed to members of the public or to recognised bodies or to associations of persons.&rdquo; Given that you can exclude all houses in the country which are principal private residences, and given that you can exclude in addition all other houses which do not comply with those terms which are in the discretion of the Commissioners substantially, you are left with a very small number of houses involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To talk about an office block possibly qualifying under this seems to me to be ridiculous.  The Minister must know it is ridiculous to suggest that.  The real point at issue here is that if there is one such house as is envisaged here and if it is not exempted and as a result of the failure to exempt it it is demolished, the Minister can himself go down in history&mdash;he may go down in history <Col N="797" /> for other reasons&mdash;as a vandal because there is good reason why this exemption could not be given and monitored to use a favourite phrase of one of the Minister's colleagues.  If it is necessary, in due course, to amend the provision, this can be done. What use is there in the Minister coming along subsequently and saying that it had been demonstrated to him by reason of the demolition of A, B and C that it is necessary to have this provision, and, therefore, they will amend it? That is no good.  The Minister cannot seriously contend that there is any realistic danger of avoidance or evasion under a provision of this kind which is, as I say, in the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners and which is being applied in the case of gardens.  My sole concern in this matter is to try to ensure that the operation of the wealth tax will not, amongst the other items of damage it does, cause the demolition of the few houses in this country which are not the principal residence of anybody, and which are of national historical, scientific or artistic interest and which are available to reasonable viewing by members of the public or groups of members of the public.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister would have no difficulty in accepting a proposal of this kind.  It is very disappointing that he finds himself unable to accept it.  That being so, I can only say we have done our best, and if any of these buildings are demolished let the Minister remember who was the vandal responsible for what happened.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 12, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following: <Col N="798" />&ldquo;(m) productive property situate in the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to exclude from the operation of wealth tax productive properties situate in the State. It goes very close to the kernel of what most of this debate has been about.  I do not propose to repeat all the arguments which have been advanced in the past in relation to the taxation of productive assets.  I propose to give the Minister what, in effect, will be a final opportunity to avoid the worst effects on our economy of the wealth tax as proposed by him.</P>
    <P>Our economy at the time the Minister took over as Minister for Finance was, relative to today, absolutely booming. Even if the economy were in that position today, in my view it would be ridiculous to apply a wealth tax to productive assets.  I say that because relative to our competitors, and in particular to our EEC partners, we are substantially an underdeveloped economy.  Anything the Minister wants to say about the manner in which wealth tax is applied in other countries has to be borne in mind.  It is of some significance that some of the richest countries in the EEC have no wealth tax.  Even if they all had a wealth tax, it would still not justify the imposition of a wealth tax on productive assets in our situation.  When one looks at the situation in which we are today, it absolutely escapes me how anybody can attempt to justify the imposition of a wealth tax on productive assets given the unemployment situation, the inflationary situation, the contraction in our economy and the paramount need to get people back into jobs and to get our economy growing.  Given that paramount need &mdash;and I do not think anybody would dispute that that is our paramount need&mdash;how can one justify the application of a wealth tax to productive assets?  To the extent that it operates, be the yield large or small, it will be an additional charge whether on agriculture, industry, distribution or whatever productive sector of the economy one looks at.  Where will that money come from?  Is it not clear that the great bulk of it will come from increased prices?  Is that not what always <Col N="799" /> happens with the imposition of additional overheads, whether in the form of tax, interest or any other form?  It goes on to the cost of living.</P>
    <P>If it is to go on to the cost of living in relation to what might be termed as luxury or semi-luxury goods, one might live with it.  Leaving aside the problem with which the Minister is extremely familiar of the impact in that regard on the consumer price index&mdash;I am ignoring that aspect of it at the moment; I am simply talking about the impact of this on prices of what are in effect basic and essential commodities&mdash;there is no use saying that this will not happen, because that is precisely what is going to happen. This is where the money will come from.  Is that sensible?  Is that something which will in any way help us to get our economy moving and get people into employment?  Is it not obvious that the very best that could be hoped for would be that it would be neutral?  In fact, it will not be neutral, it will be quite negative in its approach and in its effect.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Government have, belatedly perhaps, recognised the need to do something to get people back to work.  They have recognised that, in concrete terms, by introducing a measure to provide an employment premium of £12 a week in respect of each person taken into a job, in effect off the dole.  I said, when that was announced, that while there might be some difficulties of administration it was an imaginative measure.  What kind of imagination is needed to encompass the giving of an employment premium with one hand and the taking back with the other of an additional tax on the very people to whom we are giving the employment premium?  Certainly, the Minister may be imaginative and, maybe his imagination can encompass this, but mine cannot.  It does not make any sense.  I feel that it is so self-evident that wealth tax should not be imposed on productive assets, that it hardly needs to be argued.  But apparently with the Minister it does need to be argued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The Minister for Finance said that if we exempted productive assets what would be left?  I told him at the time that I did not know what percentage of potential assets which might be subjected to wealth tax would be involved in productive assets, but I guess a very high percentage.  The higher the percentage involved the stronger the case for saying that we should not apply wealth tax to productive assets.  If we are left then with a very small base for the wealth tax, that is a problem the Minister should consider&mdash;whether it is justifiable to apply a wealth tax to such a small base.  Of one thing I am absolutely certain, and that is that it makes no sense in our circumstances to apply a wealth tax to productive assets.</P>
    <P>On productive assets, on the willingness of people to use their assets productively, depends the hope of this country.  On that depends the hope not alone of getting a number of the 101,000 on the unemployment register at the moment back to work, but on preventing the numbers on the regiter going through the 130,000 or more mark.  On the use of productive assets and the willingness of people to use their assets productively, depends our hope of getting our economy moving again, of getting growth in our economy, of enabling us to pay our way, to advance in the social, educational and other fields not, to quote the Taoiseach, with the goodwill of the creditors and living on borrowed time, but on our own efforts on wealth produced here by people willing to invest their assets productively. That is what we are depending on.  In my view, nobody in his sane senses could suggest that the application of wealth tax on productive assets, particularly in our present circumstances, can do anything but cause further damage to an economy which is already reeling.</P>
    <P>When one considers that not alone does this Bill propose to apply wealth tax to productive assets, but it proposes at the same time in certain circumstances to exempt from wealth tax investment by foreigners but to apply wealth tax to assets productively invested by Irish people, one <Col N="801" /> finds it unbelievable that the Minister would seriously put such a proposal before this House and get Deputies to come in and vote for it.  There are two reasons why he is getting Deputies to vote for it, one, most of them do not know what the Minister is doing, and the other is that the Whip is being applied very strongly.  But even with the Whip being applied very strongly, I do not believe that every Deputy on the Fine Gael and Labour benches, if he knew what the Minister was doing, would support this.  To make any such proposal and to support it in the division lobby can only mean that people do not care what happens to our economy, no matter how bad it gets.  They are still anxious to plough on with this irrelevant, to say the least of it, but in my view very damaging proposal of the application of wealth tax to productive assets.  If this Bill goes through in its present form, not alone will damage be applied at a most crucial moment in our history when our economy can least afford it, but we will find factories, hotels, supermarkets, and other businesses will be taken over by foreigners, who will not have to pay wealth tax, as against Irish people who do.</P>
    <P>As I said, this amendment is designed to offer the Minister a last chance to step back from the abyss into which he is trying to rush headlong, bringing the country with him. If he were rushing along on his own, it would be his own business.  I would be sorry for his own sake to see him do it, but it would be his business. But he is not just going on his own; he is bringing the rest of us with him.</P>

      <P>The damage that has already been done to our economy by this Minister and his colleagues is such that it should make even the present Minister for Finance pause for a moment to think what he is doing and see if it makes any sense. It is no good talking, as the Minister possibly will and as he has done before, about death duties.  The Minister is imposing here an annual tax. <Col N="802" /> Death duties were a tax arising on a once for all situation.  It was possible in most cases to cope with it, with difficulty sometimes, but to cope with it, without putting a farm or a business out altogether.  When I was Minister for Finance I was advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they had no evidence of any farm or business at that time having to be disposed of because of the incidence of death duties.  It was true that some places were disposed of and death duties were paid out of them but that was because of the incidence of other deaths and other circumstances in conjunction with death duties.  I am saying that because the Minister may be tempted to tell us that death duties were payable in respect of productive assets.  If they were, they were on a once for all basis and could be handled in quite a different way from an annual tax, which the wealth tax is.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is quite unfair and misleading to suggest that one can compare simply death duties with wealth tax on productive assets.  The Minister is well aware that he is bringing in, and has brought in, other legislation which can affect these assets too, capital gains tax and inheritance tax.  All these are at one point or another in their passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If one wants to make any comparison, one has to compare the whole lot.  Even in regard to those other taxes, capital gains, gift and inheritance, they also are once-for-all taxes arising on one situation.  They are not an annual tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the economic impact of an annual tax, there is a psychological impact involved which the Minister should not underestimate.  To apply that tax in all circumstances to productive assets is something that no Minister for Finance should be guilty of and, in particular, no Minister for Finance whose primary concern should be how to get this economy moving again and how to get people back to work.  How can the Minister reconcile that duty with what he is doing here, imposing wealth tax, in conjunction with the other taxes, on productive assets?  I <Col N="803" /> cannot understand how the Minister can justify this.  I want to make it quite clear that we have no doubt at all about the enormous potential damage involved in all this and the purpose of this amendment is to give the Minister one last chance of pulling back from this abyss into which he is rushing headlong and dragging the rest of us with him.</P>

      <P>Hold your whist.  The Opposition realise that the Government are doing the right thing by giving special treatment to productive assets.  Deputy Colley spoke about our approach to wealth tax.  We are the only country in the world to show imagination on this front.  I used the words &ldquo;productive assets&rdquo; as far back as the 15th May, 1974, and people seized on to the idea.  Let us look at the track record of Fianna Fáil and see what they did with productive assets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they exempt them from corporations profits tax?  No, they did not.  Did they exempt productive assets from death duties?  No.  They never thought of giving any special treatment to productive assets until this imaginative and enlightened Government drew attention to the desirability of giving more favourable treatment to people with productive assets.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley suggests that the effect of this will discourage people from putting their money into productive assets.  I find that difficult to understand.  If a lower rate of tax is charged on productive assets than on non-productive assets, surely the encouragement is to transfer the assets from the non-productive into the productive so as to enjoy a lesser rate of tax.  Of course, if you want to pretend that productive assets are being penalised, then you suggest the reverse. Those who gave no exemption from corporation profits tax, no exemption from income tax and no exemption from death duties on productive assets are hardly in a position to chastise this Government which is giving more favourable treatment tax-wise, to productive assets than assets which are in any other form.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Opposition when in Government to show any imagination in respect of productive assets is a measure of their insincerity in the amendment they now propose.  Very generous provision is made in varying degrees in section 10 for all forms of productive property.  The relief goes so far as to extend to shares in trading companies, a fact which has been praised by at least one foreign commentator, The <i>New Law Journal</i> of July 3rd, 1975, page 650 states&mdash;and I commend this to the capitalist Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Capitalists can thus take heart that the Irish Government has equated the ownership of shares with the direct provision of employment.</P>
      <P>There is an objective, impartial, dispassionate international commentator, a man not strained by the efforts to gain a miserable passing political advantage in Ireland.  It is an international recognition that, quite contrary to what the Fianna Fáil Party here are suggesting, the Government of Ireland respect, not merely by their view but by the concessions which they give, the great contribution which capitalism has to make in the direct provision of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill breaks entirely new ground both at home and abroad and it may well be that other countries may yet seek to follow our example because they will appreciate that this is an imaginative and positive contribution to the encouragement of using wealth for productive rather than non-productive purposes.  We have argued in our White Paper and on several occasions since that a wealth tax by itself will of its nature encourage people to put their assets to productive purpose. It certainly will encourage people to invest in a form which will yield an adequate income to cover not merely current income but also sufficient to pay the tax and even if we have not got an easier rate of interest for productive assets, wealth tax will have that beneficial effect.  People will shift their assets from non-income earning negative forms of assets into productive ones which, by being productive, will provide employment.  Remember, our definition of productive assets is assets which provide employment in Ireland. It is not an abstract definition unrelated to employment promotion.  It is specifically in relation to the provision of employment a very positive encouragement.  It is certainly not deserving of the derisory comments, or worse, from Deputy Colley or any of his colleagues.  We are providing positive encouragement by a lower <Col N="807" /> rate of tax on productive assets.  We are providing the encouragement to put assets into productive forms to provide employment because, by so doing, people will obtain for themselves an income greater than they would if they left the assets in some sterile non-productive form.  It is a reasonable assumption from the record of the Opposition when they were in Government and from what they have contributed to this Bill that, were it not for the fact that we have given such special treatment to productive assets, they would not have considered the issue at all.  At best, this amendment is an effort by the Fianna Fáil Party to suggest that the wealth tax system can be used in some way to promote productive use of wealth, but that is already in the Bill itself. It is a concept we preached from the beginning which Fianna Fáil were unwilling to accept.  They are still unwilling to accept it takes the form&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When you take the very generous thresholds in addition to the rates and the total exemptions for some property in the Bill, it is fair to ask, as I asked on a previous occasion but did not get a satisfactory answer from Deputy Colley, the question: if you give this total exemption what is left to be taxed?</P>

      <P>It has been a very long day for everybody and, in particular, for the staff, and I offer my apologies for keeping the staff, but this is a very important matter to the people of north County Dublin and, in particular, to the Dublin County Council.  I want now to quote the question as it appeared on the Order Paper:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will make funds available to allow Dublin County Council to proceed with the following schemes which have had to be deferred because of the reduction made by his Department in the Estimate prepared by the county council engineers: north Dublin water supply infill scheme, cottage sewerage programme, Blanchardstown water supply&mdash;stage 2, Baskin cottages sewerage, Garristown sewerage, Ballyboughal sewerage, Swords treatment works and Donabate sewerage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply and in his replies to subsequent supplementaries I asked, placed great emphasis on the money he was giving this year to Dublin County Council but, in my opinion, he did not give an adequate answer to the problems which have been raised for the county council and the people of north County Dublin by the failure to grant the moneys needed to carry on the programme of <Col N="809" /> extending sewerage and water schemes adumbrated by the county council this year.  Just how bad the situation is can be seen in the report of the 4th July prepared by the Assistant City and County Manager and circulated to all the members of the county council.  I quote:</P>
    <P>A report was submitted to the meeting of the County Council of the 9th of June on the capital allocation of £2,776,000 for major water and sewerage schemes.  The Department indicated that a further sum of £224,000 would be available to meet the cost of schemes urgently needed for housing and that the allocation for small schemes was £31,000, making a total sum available for the current year of £3,031,000.  This sum will not be sufficient to meet our commitments in the existing year and, we emphasise, commitments carried over from last year due to variations in prices arising from inflation and due to increases in costs in the completion of schemes and the necessary provision which has to be made to cover schemes essential for the housing programme.  To cover the essential requirements a minimum of £4.6 million would be needed. Even this constricted expenditure has made it necessary to discontinue certain direct labour schemes and to defer the start of a number of schemes which had already gone to tender or are ready to go to tender.</P>
    <P>The north Dublin schemes which I have listed, the north Dublin water supply infill scheme, was a direct labour scheme for the council employees, and had to be discontinued. The county council cottage sewerage programme had to be discontinued.  The Blanchardstown water supply scheme had to be discontinued. These were all direct labour schemes.  The Baskin sewerage scheme had to be discontinued.  In the case of the Garristown sewerage scheme the signing of the contract had to be deferred.  In the Ballyboughal sewerage scheme the signing of the contract had to be deferred; in the case of the Swords treatment works, the signing of the contract was deferred; <Col N="810" /> in the case of the Donabate sewerage scheme, tenders for the pump plant and treatment works plans which were with consultants and an advertisement for the tenders for the civil works had to be deferred. These matters were brought to the notice of the Department of Local Government and the position is being examined.</P>
    <P>When I read a list of schemes like that to the House the impact of it might be lost on the record but we are talking about employment, first of all, because a number of the works were direct labour schemes; we are talking about the provision of necessary amenities and facilities which have been promised over a number of years. I agree that many of these schemes should have been carried out prior to this.  When these schemes were at last put in hand the people could see some progress being made but now they have come to a standstill.  The infill scheme, which was a secondary stage of the north Dublin regional water supply scheme to bring supplies to various side roads around County Dublin in Garristown, Ballyboughal, The Naul, had commenced.  The sewerage scheme for the cottages around North County Dublin would have provided facilities for about 1,300 houses.  This was to have been a five year programme and in the first year a number of projects were to be undertaken to provide sewerage facilities for 232 houses.  Of these 232 houses, 199 were council houses built out in the country areas some years ago.</P>
    <P>The Blanchardstown water supply was to consist of a six-inch main for the new town.  Blanchardstown is expanding very rapidly and we are very happy about this.  We hope it will develop into a thriving residential area. The provision of the water main has been held up.</P>
    <P>The Baskin scheme was to provide sewerage facilities for cottages in the Baskin and Cloghran areas.  The council spent £44,000 on this job and the balance of £14,000, which was needed for the civil works which would have completed the scheme, was not provided.  The pipes are laid in the gardens but they stop there.  No progress <Col N="811" /> can be made this year because of the decision of the Department.</P>
    <P>The position is serious in Garristown and Ballyboughal.  Tenders were accepted and approved by the Department of Local Government.  That for Garristown was for £89,600 and for Ballyboughal it was £84,900.  But the county council had to tell the contractors that contracts could not be signed because the Department were unable to supply the necessary finance.</P>
    <P>The Swords treatment works scheme is in a similar situation.  Surely there must be some liaison between the section of the Department which approves schemes and the section of the Department which provides the money.  But, as I said before, in the case of the Garristown sewerage scheme the signing of the contract had to be deferred. The same applies to the Ballyboughal scheme.  The Swords treatment works scheme is absolutely essential.  Much lip service is given to the problem of pollution.  We have a major problem in the pollution of the Broadmeadow estuary.  The council were working on a scheme there but the work had to be deferred because of the cutback by the Department of Local Government.  This is just not good enough, and I am hoping that as a result of this highlighting of the situation the Minister will reconsider all of these schemes and will provide the necessary money.</P>
    <P>Another work that has been postponed is the Donabate sewerage scheme.  This would have provided sewerage facilities for the whole Donabate peninsula.  These facilities were promised to the people over many years, but further work on the scheme has had to be deferred.</P>
    <P>Work on all these schemes would give badly needed employment to many men in the area.  Additional employment would be created in the industries supplying the necessary materials.  There is a factory for supplying pipes in the Balbriggan area.  There is vast scope for additional employment.  County council workers would be directly employed. Extra benefits would accrue to the whole community and a number of people could be taken off the dole queue. <Col N="812" /> The Minister was engaging in one of his favourite ploys in his answers today when he quoted statistics of the extra money being given to Dublin County Council.  I am not querying the amounts that are being given but I want an assurance from the Minister that the schemes that have been held up will be allowed to proceed and that the people of north County Dublin will get the facilities to which they are entitled and that the Dublin County Council can honour commitments undertaken when they sought tenders from contractors.  The council found themselves in an appalling position when they were unable to proceed with all of these schemes.</P>
    <P>I could continue longer, but out of consideration for the staff I shall leave the matter there.  I consider the point has been made strongly enough.  While I fully realise how scarce money really is I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the whole situation in regard to the schemes which I mentioned in my Question today.</P>

      <P>Here again we have an example of the hypocrisy of Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Burke comes in here crying crocodile tears on this Adjournment Debate tonight for one reason only: he made public statements which would not stand up to the light of day and now, in an effort to try to whitewash them, he comes in here and tries to give the impression that he is doing everything for Dublin County Council.  Fianna Fáil have got into a nasty habit of making statements and of being unable to back them up when the time comes for action.  This is another example of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Burke talked some months ago about the question of housing in Dublin.  He found he was very wrong. There was a good deal more money than he knew anything about, yet he made that case.  Then he spoke about unavailability of money for sanitary services, about the &ldquo;cut-back&rdquo; in sanitary services.  For his information, in February of this year Dublin County Council gave an estimate to my Department of £3.064 million as their requirement for the year 1975. <Col N="813" /> We gave them £3.031 million of that. If Dublin County Council proceed to make arrangements and plans and invite tenders for schemes for which they have not sanction and have not even sought sanction they cannot expect to get the work carried out.</P>
    <P>I have said here and I repeat: of course we have not enough money for sanitary services: we require a good deal more.  I will not do what was done in the 1969-1970 period when schemes were sanctioned for Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation by one of my predecessors but no money made available.  I could sanction millions of pounds for these schemes but I believe in being honest with this House and when the money is not there to back up the sanction I am not going to give them the authority to go ahead with the schemes.  Dublin County Council down through the years got their share of the small amount of money available and in some cases, perhaps, more than their share because Dublin, between 1966-74 got £11,582,005, or £40.85 per head of population.  Cork Corporation in the same period got £16.22.  I must admit there was an exception: Galway Corporation got £66.32.  Everybody else was starved&mdash; £13.9, £14.70, £16.44, £33.89.  Dublin got £40.85 and Deputy Burke comes in here tonight and says Dublin County Council are not getting a fair share.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to keep the staff here as this is a wasteful exercise, but it is only fair that I should give some information to Deputy Burke which either he has not got or if he has, he did not use it here tonight.</P>
    <P>He made great play about the Swords sewerage treatment scheme. He was talking about Swords and he was getting headlines in the papers about the terrible sewerage and pollution problems that were caused because of the fact that the Minister and the Department of Local Government did not give money for the scheme.  For his information, this is a fully approved work for which a loan of £29,000 was made available in May, 1974 and £26,100 of this was drawn in May, 1974.  It is understood <Col N="814" /> that despite this no work has yet been undertaken.  Deputy Burke as a member of Dublin County Council might like to ask what has been done, what has happened there rather than blame somebody who has no responsibility for what has happened.</P>
    <P>If we continue to have the type of half-truths which Deputy Burke has been using here tonight, trotted out as facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy talks about the question of the small schemes.  If he knew the facts, he would know that the small schemes are supposed to be submitted a year in advance so that the arrangements will be made to finance them the following year.  It was the middle of this year before the schemes that Deputy Burke is talking about were presented by Dublin County Council.  Does he expect that I should be able to wave a wand and make £1/4 million available in July of this year for schemes which are only thought up and presented by Dublin County Council in May and June of this year?  Surely there should be a little bit of common sense exercised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin County Council have got a fair share of the money that is available. We are now giving more money than was ever given before in this country and we are still not giving nearly enough.  I hope to see very much more money made available for sanitary services.  In 1972-73 the whole country got £8.23 million; in 1975, that became £16.75 million. Dublin County Council have been getting, as I said, more than their share of it.  It is a bit unfair that people like Deputy Burke should, inside and outside this House, instead of admitting what is happening, try to give the impression that the Government <Col N="815" /> are deliberately cutting back on the amount of money being made available.  The word he used in Swords, according to the local paper, was &ldquo;cut-back&rdquo; by the Government. I want to say there is no &ldquo;cut-back&rdquo; by the Government.  We have given more than was given before.  If Dublin County Council prepare and attempt to put through schemes for which they have neither sanction nor money the responsibility does not lie on my desk.</P>
    <P>The schemes which Deputy Burke read out are the schemes which Dublin County Council themselves decided were not the most important ones and therefore they are the ones which they voluntarily decided they would not proceed with.  Dublin County Council have got almost the whole amount of money which they asked for.  Certainly, they have revised the amount upwards and if we asked them next week, they would go up again.  They went from slightly <Col N="816" /> over £3 million to over £8 million. They are now down again to something over £5½ million.  They admit to us that they made over £1 million of an over-estimate in one scheme alone. I wish Dublin County Council would do their homework and let us have the facts in time so that we will know what they want to do or what they intend to do for the year.  We will give them as much money as we can afford, but people like Deputy Burke should not make statements which just do not stand up because they are not facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget measures announced by the Minister for Finance on 26th June, 1975 included provision for subsidy for CIE to enable the reduction, with effect from 28th July, 1975, of the board's fares on Dublin city bus services, road passenger provincial services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services to the levels which obtained before 12th May, 1975. No provision was made for a reduction in mainline rail fares.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by CIE that the commuter rail services in Dublin embrace the area from Balbriggan to Greystones.  The fares in respect of these services have, therefore, been reduced to their pre-May 12th level. The mainline rail passenger fare structure applies to the rail passenger services between Dublin and Drogheda and accordingly the fares on these services will not be reduced.</P>

      <P>I have read reports of a recent incident off the Mayo coast involving fishermen whose nets were cut by a cargo vessel.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Collision Regulations (Ships and Seaplanes on the Water) Order, 1965, vessels engaged in fishing are required to display certain warning lights and signals so as to enable other vessels to take necessary avoiding action in good time. Under the same regulations vessels not engaged in fishing are required, when under way, to keep out of the way of vessels engaged in fishing.</P>
