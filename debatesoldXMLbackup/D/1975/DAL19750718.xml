      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £2,250,010 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the <Col N="2314" /> Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>This supplementary estimate has three components: £1 million for the training authority, £1¼ million for payments under the premium employment programme sufficient to launch that programme, and a token amount for salaries and wages which might be necessary under these additional activities.</P>
    <P>In the original Estimate for my Department for 1975 there was provision for £4 million for non-capital expenditure by the training authority on industrial training.  In view of the evident disimprovement in the employment situation which occurred this year the Government decided to allocate an additional £1 million to the training programme to enable us to increase the number of adult workers taken into training during 1975.  I think it was at the opening of the Dundalk training centre in October last year that I made the point that, with the probable worsening in the unemployment situation, the Government would allocate extra funds to training programmes.  This is the policy followed in other countries in a similar situation.  There is the advantage in following such a policy that one utilises a period of economic slack to invest extra funds in training manpower and improving their skills for a time when the economy can make use of them again.</P>
    <P>This means that one transforms the unemployment experience into a time of possible improvement for the individual.  At a time of enforced idleness it is right that the State should provide training schemes so that the range of skills of the individuals can be improved.  That is a positive view of utilising the unemployment period for the benefit of the individual.  Of course there are benefits accruing to the economy in the fact that the bank of skills of the labour force is improved over that period.  That briefly is the thinking behind the Government's extra expenditure in this area. That is why we provided the additional £1 million in the January <Col N="2315" /> budget for this purpose.  The total Exchequer provision of £5 million is an increase of £3 million on the amount provided for the nine-month period to 31st December, 1974.</P>
    <P>In our training programme all of this extra £1 million we added on this year to make up an investment of £5 million for direct training is spent, for the most part, in direct training in such areas as bricklaying, welding, mechanical assembly, electronics and light engineering.  We have centres throughout the country in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Shannon, Galway, Sligo and Gweedore.</P>
    <P>We have opened up centres recently in Tralee, Ballina, Athlone and Wexford.  In all these centres we are concentrating on training the newly unemployed.  That extra money in January was designed to assist the position of those who found themselves on the live registry of unemployed recently.</P>
    <P>The bulk of that expenditure on direct training qualifies for assistance from the European Social Fund.  We anticipate that there will be at least £4 million provided from that source for this aspect of our training programme over this year.  That explains the great interest and activity evidenced by my Department in the Social Fund.  It explains the frequent meetings we partake in in Brussels because based on the outturn of those meetings are solid benefits accruing to this country.  That is why we take a positive and continuing interest in the development of a social policy in Europe which meets our needs and those of other countries of the Community at our stage of development.</P>
    <P>The total amount that will be available to the training authority for training schemes in 1975 will be more than £9 million.  We expect to spend more than £6 million of that amount on direct training in the areas I mentioned. In this training policy we have a system called &ldquo;in-company training&rdquo;, and that consists of advising and visiting firms to guide their training programmes and to organise those programmes.  In addition, we have an apprentice training element <Col N="2316" /> and shortly I hope to announce a new apprenticeship scheme.  Our present system of training apprentices is archaic and needs to be updated and put on the same footing as the training programmes of our neighbouring European countries.  A report published some time ago set down various options that could be taken in the context of apprentice training.  I hope we will be able to announce firm decisions in this area shortly.</P>
    <P>We expect that 2,000 more adults will be trained in 1975 as a result of the extra funds voted for this purpose. The majority of these extra trainees will go through the network of permanent training centres.  We have also utilised in this period, because the number of trainees we are looking after far exceeds the accommodation capacity at our permanent centres, regional technical colleges and vocational colleges in the summer months as additional centres for training these people.  We have also arranged to hire spare training capacity in premises of State bodies and in private firms to enable extra trainees to be taken on.</P>
    <P>Of the additional trainees taken on under this programme this year almost 600 will be women.  This is an important point.  We are all anxious to see that women benefit from the increase in training programmes, and I am happy to report that that is the case.  Though women still do not appear to get totally fair opportunities in our training programme we are working to change that situation, partly by changing the hours of training to ensure that married women who wish to return to work may be facilitated in doing so.</P>
    <P>In our main centres we hope to give 6,000 adults adequate training in such skills as light engineering and welding. In addition we will provide the usual industrial induction courses we have been running, especially for workers from rural areas.  To ensure that they get some acquaintance with industrial practices we have been running in such areas over recent years courses which would introduce potential workers for industrial undertakings from a rural background to industrial practices.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2317" /> We are training almost twice as many people this year as last year. We visualise that by 1978 we will be catering for an annual through put equal to almost 1 per cent of the total labour force here.  we hope to be successfully training 11,500 trainees per year by 1978.  That is a minimum target.  A recent OECD report came to the conclusion that this 1 per cent appeared to be the general target aimed for by many of the European countries whose training programmes they examined.  In our circumstances that figure is a little on the conservative side, because we must recall that prior to 1967 we had no industrial training programme whatever.  There is a big backlog of unskilled labour here which these other countries with their longer tradition of a State training service do not have to contend with.  This means that our target of 1 per cent is probably not totally adequate to our needs.</P>
    <P>We should continue to increase our training capacity, to aim for the kind of figures which have been achieved for training in Sweden and Canada. I have often thought that a country's economic progress has a direct relationship with the skill of its workforce. There is a direct relationship between the money we invest in improving the skills of our workforce and the benefits that accrue to the economy.  We have been too prone to invest in physical material properties of economic expansion.  To some extent we have overlooked the necessity of a commensurate investment in the human element in that economic process.  We have ignored&mdash;up to 1967 we totally ignored it&mdash;that there is this close connection between the skills of the workforce and the possibility of any economy to produce prosperity for the people.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there are good arguments for a rapid expansion, in the present circumstances of high unemployment, of our training system.  While it might be all right in what the economist would be pleased to call a macro-economic sense, to say that it is good to train our workforce to a requisite level of skill and know that this would be a solid boon to the <Col N="2318" /> economy at a time when this economy and others would improve, it could be claimed that this is small sympathy for the man or woman who is trained but does not find a job at the end of the training period.  However, our record in placement is very high.  It might be considered that this record was in some danger of falling at this time of high unemployment.  It is fair to say that the record is not as good as it was a year or two ago&mdash;when it was more than 80 per cent&mdash;but it is something to be proud of that at this time of high unemployment we are still in a position to claim that more than 60 per cent of those trained we manage to find jobs for.  This is a high placement record and one which we will continue to aim for whatever the degree of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the placement record was not as high, but I am happy to report that it has been improving. Whether this is a small inkling of an upturn of our own economic fortunes one does not know at this stage, but it is an encouraging sign.  I emphasise that the extra money will be spent on the newly unemployed.  What we are aiming at is to retrain people coming from the declining industries, such as textiles and other traditional industries which do not have an encouraging future regardless of what time the economic upturn may come.  Our aim is to bring people from these declining industries into growth industries, to bring them into industries which have a long-term future, industries which, in the conditions of 1976, look like surviving for the remaining years of this century.  For example, we want to bring people from textiles and put them into electronics or into such skills as welding, a skill that will be highly important when the development relating to the exploitation of offshore oil and gas becomes a reality&mdash;towards the end of next year and in 1977.</P>
    <P>Recently I set up an inter-departmental committee for the purpose of ensuring that all the training needs of the labour force that will be required to exploit the off-shore oil and gas finds will be available.  It is my intention to ensure that our national training system will provide extra <Col N="2319" /> facilities in the Cork area for the training of the personnel that will be required for this development.  This committee will study the manpower and training implications of potential off-shore oil and gas finds.  We visualise a wide variety of off-shore activity.  I have asked them to consider that included in their terms of reference is the action that should be taken to ensure that Irish men and women will be recruited for the jobs that will result from the economic activity associated with these finds.  The experience of other countries suggests that if a country is not prepared for such development, that if the work force is not available, the highlyskilled operatives necessary for this industry come from outside the country.  Therefore, unless we gear ourselves in this regard, we could find that many of the new jobs would go to nationals of other countries.  It is not premature at this stage for us to make preparations for the activities that should begin in less than two years.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we discussed the premium employment programme. Deputy Fitzgerald made the point that, because of curtailment of time, we were prevented from going into details of that programme.  However, as I indicated to the Deputy, extra time had been offered to the Opposition for discussion of this Bill but I understand from the Whip that that offer was turned down.  The main elements in that scheme have been explained already.  The scheme is confined to manufacturing industry since that is the area that has been hit most during the current recession.  In this Estimate we are seeking funds to launch this programme.  I hope to be back in the Dáil early in the next session seeking extra funds for the scheme so as to ensure that the programme achieves the target I have set of bringing back 10,000 people to gainful employment.  I do not expect that I will have any difficulty in obtaining the support of Deputies in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to us last evening Deputy Fitzgerald and others <Col N="2320" /> raised various points in relation to the scheme.  I was asked why the service sector is not included.  The inclusion of this sector would involve large administrative problems but, as I have indicated, our priority was manufacturing industry.  We did not consider the service sector to be a main call for resources in the light of what we are aiming at.  The service sector would include areas which have not been affected significantly in the course of the present recession, areas such as banking and insurance.</P>
    <P>I should hope that a subsidiary effect of the programme would be that it would enable employers to maintain their work force intact in the local area.  That will be a prime requirement when economic activity quickens once more.  At that stage we may find a situation where employers in many areas might have a shortage of workers in their immediate vicinity. If the programme assists local employers in maintaining their work force intact, it will have proved of solid assistance.</P>
    <P>The premium employment programme is intended as an incentive to industry to maintain intact work forces that they might not be in a position otherwise to maintain during the remaining months of this recession. Apart from that main objective, the aim is to assist employers, to assist economic activity in local areas in overcoming any delays that might occur in the event of a work force being dispersed at this time.</P>
    <P>I was asked, too, whether it was necessary to have a four-week waiting period of unemployment in relation to the programme.  I consider it necessary to have this waiting period so as to ensure that there is this genuine category of unemployed for whom the scheme is intended.</P>
    <P>The question of flexibility of date was raised, too.  The Departmental officials with whom I have kept in close contact have been in touch with employers who claim that the date chosen eliminates some who would like to be included.  This type of difficulty is always present when one introduces any scheme.  The claim can always be made that the date chosen <Col N="2321" /> is arbitrary.  It is arbitrary, as it must be.  However, we will be making an examination of some of the industries who have made this claim.  We will consider their situation very carefully in order to allow us to decide whether we can accede to any request in respect of flexibility of date.  However, Deputies will appreciate that a date must be chosen, that the programme must come into operation on a particular date and expire on another.</P>
    <P>As well as being through the National Manpower Service we have been in contact with local employers and we will be ensuring that the benefits of this programme will be brought to the knowledge of every appropriate employer in the State.  It will require a strong selling programme and I hope we will achieve that.</P>
    <P>The last item on this Estimate this morning is for extra salaries for the additional work that may be required in servicing these additional activities. That speaks for itself and I do not wish to comment on it.  I thought it best that I should utilise some of the time on this Estimate in answering some of the questions that were raised yesterday evening.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to claim that the premium employment programme is an answer to unemployment in all its aspects as it now exists and as it affects our working population at this time of year.  That claim is not being made by us on this side of the House. We simply say of it that it could prove of solid assistance to employers anxious to retain their work force. We had the experience of other countries where similar programmes have been attempted.  A good deal of thought has gone into our own programme. We have considered that the area of aid should be confined to manufacturing industry.  The point may be made that there are other areas that its benefits could have been extended to, for instance, agriculture. Again there would be a great deal of administrative difficulty involved in extending it to agriculture.  It is a question of selection and the areas that have been worst hit by unemployment are manufacturing industries. <Col N="2322" /> The prime need now is to ensure that the work force is not dispersed over the remaining months of economic difficulty.  The employment programme should assist us in avoiding that occurrence.  I commend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is another gallop over the course of training and retraining and telling us what we are going to do when the golden days come again.  I am sure the reason the Minister did not prepare a brief this morning is that he has this story so well by heart, having told it so often in this House, that a brief was unnecessary on the question of training and retraining workers.</P>
      <P>We welcome the extra expenditure here and we certainly welcome the injection from the European Social Fund.  This is a fund that has assisted Ireland considerably and we look forward to it assisting us to an even greater extent.  For long the value of the Social Fund to this country was underestimated.  The Minister has spelt out its advantages in this particular year.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to AnCO and the facilities afforded for the training of women.  It should be our policy to encourage AnCO to provide not only for courses for the training of women but for the extension and broadening of existing courses and opening them to boys or girls, men or women who may wish to avail of such training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about the apprenticeship situation within AnCO at present.  I understand that no electrical industry can take on new apprentices this year until such time as the third and fourth year apprentices have been re-employed.  This is a serious situation, tied up of course with the overall problems in the economy.  There is nothing more dangerous than to train young apprentices for one, two or even three years and then have them come to a blank wall.  More attention must be given to the provision of opportunities. Indeed, I believe there are important connections between all the items <Col N="2323" /> mentioned on the Estimate here this morning.  I think the Minister and I differ on the basic aims of the premium employment programme, but I shall come back to that later.</P>
    <P>There are two other points I want to make in regard to AnCO.  It is significant that during this period of recession we have under the present Coalition Government, we have operating a Government agency which was set up by the Department of Labour under a Fianna Fáil Government, that has contributed a great deal in providing employment, even though some of it may be short-lived, through retraining and so on during this period.  However, the structure having been provided, it is imperative &mdash;and I fear that not enough emphasis is given to this&mdash;that outlets be created, because there is a serious danger to the standing and to the goodwill of any training body such as that if young people are trained to a certain pitch and at the end of it the outlets are not there.</P>
    <P>During the Fianna Fáil term of office a training centre was provided in the Gweedore industrial estate i nGaeltacht Dhún na nGall.  The Minister should bear in mind when he mentions new areas around the country go bhfuil Gaeltachtaí eile againn fós.  I would like to see training centres considered in such cases. I understand that the mobile training units of AnCO are working satisfactorily. It is commendable that AnCO are prepared to go out to a new industry with their mobile unit and train people on the site there.  This should be extended further, but as well as that there should be training opportunities within the Gaeltacht in factory expertise, so that people can take their place in the Gaeltacht industries that we hope will be coming in the near future, despite the doubts that could be expressed in regard to some of the firms mentioned by the Minister for the Gaeltacht in the House during the week.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned in-company training.  I am not happy about this aspect.  Every Minister should try to use the money available <Col N="2324" /> from EEC funds, whether it is by way of the Regional Fund, the Social Fund or any other scheme.  If necessary we should take steps to amend our legislation to provide moneys that are available from the EEC.  If we can help our service industries by way of funds from the EEC it is imperative that we legislate urgently to make this possible.  The companies concerned should be given every assistance towards obtaining this money.  Naturally this would help the employment situation in the service industries.  I do not share the views of the Minister with regard to the service industries and I appeal to him to consider the situation.</P>
    <P>I am not very clear regarding the Supplementary Estimate for salaries, wages and allowances and I should like to know what is involved.  Does it mean extra staff to implement the equal pay legislation which the Minister has assured us will be implemented at the end of the year?</P>
    <P>Will the Supplementary Estimate allow for the provision of extra staff to implement the provisions of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill when it becomes law? At this point I should like to know where is that Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister, as are many young people, with regard to this measure.  The Bill went through this House a considerable time ago and it is at an advanced stage in the Seanad.  We are entitled to express our disappointment that this legislation has not been passed.  We are now in the summer holiday period and the Minister knows this is a time young people can be exploited.  Perhaps the prompting I have given him will encourage him to see if it would be possible to have the Bill back in <Col N="2325" /> this House during the current session in order to have it completed.  I understand that several amendments which we put forward in this House have been accepted by the Minister in the other House, perhaps due to more influential people.</P>
      <P>Will the Supplementary Estimate allow for the provision of extra staff to deal with the Bill dealing with trade union amalgamation?  Will the Minister tell the House if there are any developments in this matter? From his discussions with the people concerned does he consider the Bill will provide a vehicle to allow for amalgamation and rationalisation?  I am sure the Minister is as disappointed as we are that we have only a short period to discuss these matters.</P>
      <P>Will extra staff be required with regard to redundancy payments?  Yesterday a frightening figure was given to this House, that 484 companies have gone out of business from March, 1973, to date.  This means that a very considerable number of people lost their jobs in that period. I know the Minister will be annoyed with me if I am critical of him. He will say that we are only scaremongering, that is the usual flak coming from Fianna Fáil.  I have a genuine and personal interest in keeping people in employment and I will always put pressure on the Minister with regard to this matter.  When he was in Opposition, at a completely different time when conditions were totally different and when the number of unemployed was approximately 36,000 less than it is now, he put pressure on the Government and the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>I was amused last night to hear a Deputy here tossing around figures of 70,000 and 100,000 unemployed and he appeared to say there was no difference. All of us would love to see no unemployment but that is an ideal that will never be achieved.  However, there is a considerable difference between 70,000 unemployed and 100,000 unemployed&mdash;there are more than 30,000 jobs lost somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Employment Premium Bill, I am glad the Minister raised it here.  I am not of the same <Col N="2326" /> opinion as the Minister with regard to the prime aim.  I thought its prime aim was to create employment, particularly as it came from the Department of Labour, and that the second aim was to assist industry.  I am disappointed that it is confined to manufacturing industry.  I accept fully that certain of those industries are in difficulties.  For 15 or 16 months I have been screaming about them.  Some of them were mentioned by the Minister last night and today but I am afraid that they will not be rescued by this Bill.  That is the reality of the situation.  On Committee Stage of that Bill I will ask the Minister again to extend its scope.  Last night I welcomed the Bill and I said it was imaginative.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to prove himself a progressive Minister, to shake off the shackles that may be tying him somewhat. There are jobs to be created and opportunities to be given to people. Reading some of the newspapers this morning one would think our unemployment problem had been solved when it was said that 10,000 jobs were being provided.  I was glad the Minister said this was only a step; if he had not said it I would have mentioned the point.  We must be determined to reduce the unemployment and it should be given top priority.  We will be forced to be critical of the Minister until the number on the live register is down to a realistic and reasonable figure.  This is one of the Minister's responsibilities. With his colleague the Minister for Industry and Commerce he has responsibility to ensure that employment opportunities are created. We differ on one point.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that the main purpose of the scheme is to aid manufacturing industry.  In my view the primary purpose should be to create employment with aid to industry a secondary although necessary purpose. It was for this reason that I suggested that the scope should be broadened.  I consider that £500 is a reasonable figure for the creation of one job.  There are opportunities in the areas that I mentioned.  The scheme is for one year.  I am afraid it will not be possible to create sufficient jobs fast enough in manufacturing industry.  As <Col N="2327" /> I indicated, the money will return to the Exchequer in the saving in social welfare payments, in the contributions to social welfare and in income tax. There will be an opportunity next week to discuss details.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has seen fit to support the idea of the four weeks qualifying period.  One must have regard to family hardship and disturbance.  In the case of a person who has been in employment all his working life the weeks immediately following disemployment are a time of high mental strain.  It is desirable that people be given an opportunity to return to work within the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government has mitigated against job creation and has contributed in a major way to job loss. I read this morning that there is a 40 per cent duty being imposed in order to stop Korean dumping of shirts and blouses.  We have been told over a long period that this could not be done.  What is being done now is not enough but it is something.  Why could it not have happened a year ago when we were first appealing for it?  The textile industry has been let run down to the extent that it will be difficult to restore it to its former level.</P>
    <P>I have already brought to the notice of the Minister individual cases where redundancy payments have not been made.  There are a number of cases awaiting payment, particularly in a Cork industry where workers have been laid off for three months.  I would ask the Minister to have payment expedited.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where the Estimate could be used.  Off-shore developments were referred to by the Minister.  Perhaps the money could be devoted to the setting up of the working party.  The working party must work in close co-operation with Transport and Power and Industry and Commerce.  Our prime concern should be to employ as many Irish people as possible in these developments. Is there a possibility that the Estimate could be used in respect of the new measures introduced by the <Col N="2328" /> Minister in regard to worker participation in State boards?  Worker participation is desirable but there should be far more research and a more constructive and progressive scheme than the measure introduced by the Minister. The Government should give a lead.  There are times when I feel the Government move slowly, afraid of offending someone&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will come back to the Minister's announcement and the inadequacy of the research carried out on it.  In the meantime I want to say that before decisions or announcements are made by the Government a kite is flown to see if the proposal is popular, and if it is not popular they retract immediately and come up with some other plan.  The Government are charged with responsibility to act in the best interests of the community.</P>
      <P>It is the easiest thing in the world to appoint employees to State boards, but the reality is that such participation is miles away from management. The boards' functions are primarily policy-making.  Of course, it is right that there should be representation at that level.</P>

      <P>I have already said that I agree with the idea of having them there.  It is not effective enough.  It is too remote.  There should be representation at management level.  That is where participation <Col N="2329" /> is more effective and means more to workers.  I welcome the idea, of course, but it is a case of putting on the roof before you put up the walls. It would be more sensible to put up the walls first.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister a question many months ago about the Truck Acts.  He mentioned that he was introducing legislation to have them updated.  Perhaps the Estimate is being devoted towards updating the Acts.  I do not know what progress has been made.  At this time when there are wage snatches, when difficulties are created for wage clerks and people handling wages, it is imperative that where the persons concerned so wish payment should be by cheque.  The Truck Acts are the remnants of the gombeen man.  In the last century when men were paid at the end of a week the gombeen man wanted to ensure that the money he handed over to his employees by way of wages would come back to him in the local shop or pub that he also owned.  For that reason these Acts should be updated as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>I would like to briefly refer to National Manpower who are providing an excellent service.  They also have a great deal of my sympathy. Would the Minister consider taking emergency steps in the short term to help the service?  One of the main problems of Deputies is the number of young people who come to us asking if we can help them get jobs.  The pressures on the staff of the National Manpower Service must be almost unbearable. Perhaps the Minister would consider setting up temporary unemployment bureaux in areas affected by closures or where there are a large number of school leavers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Employment Premium Bill will be another burden on their shoulders. Let us hope it will have results. Knowing the people working in National Manpower, I am satisfied that if they do not get results it will not be for want of effort.  Between now and the Committee Stage next Wednesday would the Minister seriously consider broadening the scope of that Bill?  I will be putting <Col N="2330" /> down some amendments but will be prepared to withdraw them if the Minister does that.  He admitted earlier the difficulty in administering this Bill from the service industry point of view.  I believe the primary purpose of the Bill is the creation of employment.  One industry which is severely hit is the hotel industry.  If we could create opportunities, whether it be in hotels, farms or anywhere else, we could get not only the 10,000 jobs the Minister speaks about but many more.  We can save a great deal of Exchequer money on social welfare. For every £12 paid probably half will come back to the Exchequer by way of social welfare stamps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This would reduce the difference in the unemployment figures since this Government took office and when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could it be that the £10 refers to the present negotiations going on between the employer/labour conference, the Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers on the national wage agreement? Is it too much to ask the Government that the Dáil be kept informed of progress?  I understand there is a vital meeting on the 31st July and, in the event of any developments, would it be too much to ask that the Dáil be recalled to discuss <Col N="2331" /> the importance of those developments? The Minister is smiling; maybe he knows that the Dáil may not be on recall before the 31st July.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not have one yet and I want to save the expense of sending it by asking him that in the event of worthwhile developments he will ensure that the Taoiseach will recall the Dáil.  We all realise the seriousness of the issues involved here.  Of course we are critical that they were not handled earlier and at a time when we could have made more progress.  I believe it is easier to negotiate than to renegotiate.</P>
      <P>If the information had been available&mdash;and surely it was available to the Department of Finance&mdash;the Minister's move should have been made earlier.  The dragging of feet and not moving in time is inclined to upset the confidence of the people, in this case the working people.  We, as a Party, represent people who are loyal, dedicated and patriotic.  If they can be handled in a sensible way and told of the national situation in time, the situation will be easier and all they will need from the Government is courage, communication and leadership. Not many moons ago I remember Ministers on television and in this House speaking of open government. I know why the Minister is smiling: he too has seen the changes that have taken place in those few short years. The £10 could be spent on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Any assistance we can give the Department will be given willingly.</P>

      <Col N="2332" /> We are a responsible Party and a constructive Opposition.  At present the country needs a constructive Opposition.  If people are disappointed that we are not moving the Government as much as we would like, that is not our fault.</P>
    <P>The Government have lost their early drive and have become tired.  Some of them have become a bit arrogant and overbearing while others have lost interest.  These things are to the detriment of our people and our economy. I appeal to the Minister, before the Committee Stage of the Employment Premium Bill to make a name for himself, shake off the shackles of his comrades and we will discuss the matter in Committee next Wednesday.  We hope it will be a wide Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate, which is intended for greater emphasis on training.  AnCO to date have been doing a tremendous job.  Any money invested in training will pay off tenfold in the future.  It also means that we will have, and be seen to have, skilled operatives available.  It is a big attraction to a foreign industrialist to come to the country and invest in it. This will create greater job opportunity, which is very desirable.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister talk about updated apprenticeship training, which is long overdue.  It has been very archaic.  It was left to the individual to use his own devices to train himself. The length of time required to train in the particular trades is far too long.  I believe it could be cut considerably. I read last week that there may be a shortage of skilled operatives because of the inflow into different trades.  The Minister should look into this area to ensure that when the recession is over we will not be found wanting in relation to skilled workers.  We should ensure that there is no cut back.  We should look into what our requirements will be over the next ten years so that we can put people into the trades in which we believe work will be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do AnCO and the IDA work together? Are we training people for industries that will come into the country?  It is important, when we are <Col N="2333" /> training people, that we train them for gainful employment.  IDA are doing a first-class job but we hope that there is communication to ensure that the right type of skills are available to meet the industries they bring into the country.  I was glad to hear that the Minister is looking into training operatives for our off-shore oil industries. This is very important.  There is not much point in bringing industry to the country if we have to import the expertise and the workers.  We should have those in the country.  Off-shore oil production will be a big industry so it is important that we are ready for it. We should have operatives available to take up the lucrative jobs.  We do not want the unskilled work only.  We want skilled work and we want to be ready for it.</P>
    <P>An induction of 60 per cent into employment from the training schedule is not as much as we would like, but when one considers the economic climate it is reasonably good.  It also means that we have a pool of trained labour ready to step into the breach when there is an upturn in the economy.  I would like to see the Industrial Training Authority looking at the vocational education set up to ensure that the right kind of development is taking place in our colleges of technology and vocational schools, that the right type of courses are available to meet the needs of the particular areas.</P>
    <P>AnCO, now that we have raised the school leaving age, which I hope will be raised further, should look into education in general because many people who do not go on to higher education should be provided with some basic training in the schools they attend so that if they go into employment at an early age they will have received some training. This would have the effect of increasing productivity.  We apparently have a low productivity rate in relation to other countries.  Any training programme engaged in should be looked at in conjuction with increasing productivity and gearing people for that goal.</P>
    <P>The employment premium is an excellent step and we hope it will <Col N="2334" /> have the desired effect.  I agree with the Minister that it should be for manufacturing industries.  We might like to see it in the service industry but it is important that we get back into the export market, that we become competitive and when the time comes that we have the requisite staff to take advantage of the upturn in the economy.  The important factor in relation to this is that we have our factories geared for increased employment and that we have the staff available.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be complimented on his approach to industrial training and the money he is spending on it.  Twice as much money is being spent this year as last year.  We are emerging late industrially and it is necessary that we have operatives trained and ready to take advantage of the inflow of industries which we all hope for and which the IDA are promising.</P>
    <P>The last point is that we are training in AnCO to meet future needs. We are not just training for the sake of jobs; we are training for the industries of the future.  I promised Deputy Moore I would not speak for more than ten minutes, but I would again ask the Minister to press for more money from the social fund of the EEC.  Deputy Fitzgerald said we may not be doing enough in this field.  Our team of Ministers in Europe is first class.  They are doing a tremendous job and the way we handled the presidency for the last six months is proof of that, if proof be needed.  If one compares like with like in the former Government, then there is no comparison.  I think Deputy Fitzgerald will agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Brien for his courtesy.  It has been truly said that it was the duty of Government <Col N="2335" /> to strive for conditions whereby all those willing and able to work are given the opportunity of working.  It is the duty of the Department of Labour to canalise all its efforts towards achieving that end. We have over 102,000 unemployed and it will take a great effort indeed to reduce these figures.</P>
      <P>I regret having to say that what is put before us this morning will not do that.  Under the EP Bill a sum of only £1¼ million will be available.  That would provide only 2,500 jobs.  There are 5,000 in training, or will be by the end of the year, and the Minister told us this morning that 60 per cent of these will be placed in employment. Accepting that as true, we find a total of 5,500 jobs.  That is dependent on there being no overlapping. Some of those in training could be going back into employment and so there would be some element of duplication.  It is a sorry picture, and the steps taken by the Government will not make any appreciable difference in the unemployment situation. The outlook is gloomy, and both Deputy Fitzgerald and I believe not enough is being done by the Government or by the Department of Labour.  Are we, I wonder, even doing enough to stop the rot getting worse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision of employment is a basic reason for the establishment of the Department of Labour.  Here, instead of giving some hope of worth-while employment, we are merely offering people a sop.  In my ignorance I must ask the Minister why he does not consider the construction industry for inclusion in the EP Bill.  It has been truly said that when the construction industry sneezes the economy gets pneumonia.  I cannot understand why the Government are not putting more and more money into the construction industry.  If a proper investment were made people would be brought back into employment.  There are over 70,000 unemployed in the construction industry and the builders' providers taken together.  We have the ridiculous situation in this democracy that, while thousands are <Col N="2336" /> waiting for homes, we have thousands unemployed., who could provide those homes.  The waiting list for housing gets longer and so too do the unemployment figures.  One does not need to be an economist to recognise that if effective action were taken by the Government to rejuvenate and reinvigorate the construction industry, either through the EP Bill or through some other measure, we would be well on the way back to prosperity in a short time.  Providing homes is one of the greatest services we can render to our people.  If the Minister thinks Government action so far is helpful where the construction industry is concerned he should read the statement issued yesterday by the heads of that industry.  There are serious doubts that the action taken by the Government will bring about any great alleviation of the situation. So far the efforts by the Government have not proved successful. The EP Bill, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, is a very conservative measure, man must be four weeks unemployed before he will qualify.</P>
    <P>We should make haste in getting people back into employment and we should concentrate on the construction industry and the service industry.  The EP Bill is a good idea but it is too narrow in its application.  It will make only a very small contribution to reducing the unemployment figures.  The Minister said there is hope in the exploration and development of oil and gas.  Of course there is, but it will be at least two years before there will be any tangible evidence of this new wealth.  In the meantime we will have over 100,000 people unemployed.  The Minister rightly insists that Irish workers will be employed in exploration and development, and we will certainly back that.  Apart from the fact that these 100,000 odd men and women are not in gainful employment and the fact that workers are paying heavily in social welfare&mdash;they do not complain of that&mdash;the prospects of reducing unemployment are no way enhanced by the Minister's statement this morning. Until we get back to regenerating the construction industry there will be no appreciable improvement.  The industry <Col N="2337" /> should be assisted back to its former high place in our economy.  It is at the moment affected by paralysis.  We know the harsh facts.  There are over 70,000 unemployed.  That does not include people who make component parts for housing, or house furnishers, or workers in any industry which supplies something for that trade.</P>
    <P>Consistently on this side of the House we have tried to help the Government by making suggestions to them.  We are not too optimistic that they will be accepted.  When we see the economy getting weaker and weaker, and a growing cynicism and scepticism amongst the workers in the various industries, and a loss of faith in the Government, we must remember that we have shown them how and why they should do certain things.  The Opposition cannot do much more than that.  They can only criticise the Government's proposals and suggest amendments which, if adopted by the Government, might make things a lot better for the 102,000 unemployed to date.  I see in the papers this morning that Mahony's of Blarney have warned that 170 jobs may go.  Every morning when we read the papers we feel depressed at reading announcements such as that.</P>
    <P>This morning I was in the Man-power Office in O'Connell Bridge House.  The staff there are doing their very best to be helpful.  One could detect on the part of the people going in there a feeling of despondency. While I was there I did not see any ray of hope in that building.  People are besieging Deputies on all sides of the House this year to try to get employment for them.  This is a refutation of the suggestion that people are hesitant in seeking jobs. This suggestion is put out by people who are trying to minimise the tremendous problems we have.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House have a duty to show up the weaknesses in the Government's proposals and to offer some suggestions as to how matters could be improved.  This morning Deputy Fitzgerald dealt thoroughly with the situation as far as time permitted him.  He made helpful <Col N="2338" /> suggestions for putting people back into employment and for preventing more people becoming unemployed. We hope to have a further opportunity of discussing this matter.  As long as men or women are unemployed, even though we may be here for a short time only, we give notice to the Government that we will be very critical of their efforts to improve the national economy.  We have a great deal of support for our attitude not least among the 102,000 people who are out of employment, those who are about to lose their employment such as the workers in Mahony's of Cork, and the workers in the fertiliser industry.</P>
    <P>It is most depressing that not one major industry is showing signs of a recovery.  Rather they are showing signs of a continuing economic illness which the Government's treatment will not cure.  If the situation does not improve I can see great social problems arising.  So far we have avoided them, but time is running out for the Government.  We warn them that there may be grave social unrest because of the fact that too many people are unemployed for too long. The Government's methods of dealing with that problem are doomed to failure.  Between now and next Wednesday the Minister should have another look at his proposals and he will see they are far from adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £9,000,000 be granted to defary the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of <Col N="2339" /> certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The main estimate for agriculture for 1975 amounting to £76,927,000 was passed on 19th June.  This supplementary estimate provides for the additional expenditure which is expected to be incurred by my Department this year in respect of the subsidies on butter and liquid milk which were proposed by the Minister for Finance in his financial statement presented to the House on 26th June.</P>
    <P>The additional money for certain capital and non-capital services of my Department which was also provided in the recent financial statement, as well as certain sums provided for agriculture in the January budget, will be covered by a further supplementary estimate which will be introduced in the ordinary way before the end of the financial year.  Of the supplementary provision of £9 million, £2.8 million is in respect of the additional cost to the Exchequer of the consumer subsidy on butter and £6.2 million in respect of the liquid milk subsidy.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister for Finance the Government have decided to increase the level of consumer subsidy being paid in respect of butter consumed on the home market so as to bring about a price reduction of 10p per lb. at retail level. This has, in fact, already been done. Prior to 1st July, the consumer subsidy on butter was £54.58 per ton ex creamery, the cost being divided equally between the National Exchequer and the EEC's Agricultural Fund (FEOGA).</P>
    <P>As from July 1st the level of subsidy was increased to £263 per ton ex creamery.  This involved an additional FEOGA contribution of £23.20 per ton and an additional Exchequer element of £185.22 per ton.  The new subsidy is equivalent to 9.30p of the creamery price per lb. and this reflects a subsidy of 10p per lb. at retail level &mdash;the retailers' gross percentage margin remaining undisturbed.  The subsidy will, as heretofore, be paid direct to creameries, monthly in arrears in <Col N="2340" /> respect of sales destined for home market consumption.</P>
    <P>The subsidy on liquid milk will be payable at the rate of 2p a pint on whole milk, whether pasteurised or unpasteurised, which is sold in bottles or other containers for liquid consumption in the State and in respect of which the price charged to the consumer is reduced by 2p a pint below the price now being charged for such milk.  My Department is at present making arrangements for administering a liquid-milk subsidy scheme on this basis.</P>
    <P>As we had not an existing subsidy system for liquid-milk, the introduction of the new subsidy for that product has of necessity to take some time. Our national statistics of milk production and use do not include fully authenticated figures of liquid milk consumption.  Such figures as we have suggest that about 90 million gallons are bought by consumers from the liquid milk trade.  That trade is carried on mainly by licensed pasteurisers, who distribute about 76 million gallons yearly.  The remaining 14 million gallons approximately are distributed by bottlers of unpasteurised milk and by sellers of loose milk in some areas.</P>
    <P>The operation of the new subsidy will involve:</P>
    <P>(1)  the making by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of an Order reducing to 6p a pint (instead of the current price of 8p a pint) the maximum retail price of bottled milk, and</P>
    <P>(2)  the setting up of arrangements to inject a corresponding subsidy of 2p a pint at the first stage of the milk distribution chain, i.e. at the stage of preparation of liquid milk with a view to its distribution for sale to consumers, and to ensure that the benefit of the subsidy is passed on to all subsequent stages, including that of purchase by consumers.</P>
    <P>In order to be eligible for subsidy it will be necessary for all milk pasteurisers and other bottlers to keep adequate records of their acquisitions and disposals of milk for liquid consumption, to produce those records for inspection by officers of my Department and to furnish periodical returns <Col N="2341" /> of transactions in liquid milk.  My Department will also have to be satisfied that the sale prices for all milk concerned have been reduced by 2p a pint.</P>
    <P>The lines on which the subsidy might be operated have been discussed in general terms with representatives of the Milk Pasteurisers' Association, and details of the scheme are now being finalised.  It is hoped that it will be possible to bring the subsidy into operation during the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>The subsidy scheme will apply to licensed pasteurisers (all of whom can be assumed to be already keeping adequate records of their transactions), and to bottlers of unpasteurised milk who can show that they also have satisfactory records.  My Department has recently published advertisements asking these latter bottlers to contact the Department so that officers of the Department can call on them as soon as possible to advise on any necessary improvements in their records.</P>
    <P>The increased consumer subsidy on butter and the new consumer subsidy on liquid milk will make a significant contribution to reducing the cost of living.  they constitute a very positive indication of the Government's commitment to taking effective measures to reduce the rate of inflation and I am confident that the House will readily agree to vote the necessary funds.</P>

There is absolute the resolve of the National Coalition Government to paper over the cracks and physically <Col N="2342" /> gag the expression of any opposition to the disastrous headlong course that Irish agriculture, as well as every other aspect of the Irish economy, is on at present.</P>

      <Col N="2343" /> In the discussion of a Supplementary Estimate the debate shall be confined to the Items constituting the same, and no discussion may be raised on the original Estimate, save in so far as it may be necessary to explain or illustrate the particular Items under discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair but it neatly confirms what I have been saying, that the Government now, or at any other time, are resolved to gag every Member and ensure there is no political criticism of their management of the agricultural situation since they took office.  Therefore, if the Chair insists we must confine ourselves to the terms of the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the purpose of this Supplementary Estimate was to dull the effects of the raging, racing inflation that has been, according to the Taoiseach, brought about by the direct activities of the Government. I do not accept that this is the real purpose of the subsidy on butter and liquid milk.  The real purpose of that is to keep the voters happy.  I expect that the money for this will be borrowed abroad and left for subsequent Fianna Fáil Governments to pay when they rescue the country from the hands of the Government. If the necessity for the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate has been induced by the wild inflation we are experiencing will it not be legitimate to refer also to the other effects of this inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his short homily made reference to the scant knowledge available in the Department regarding the quantities of supply or the number of suppliers in the liquid milk supply business.  All of these suppliers produce the milk we are subsidising. When the Minister is replying to this&mdash; it would be inaccurate to call it a debate&mdash;permission that we have been accorded to speak for a very limited time within very limited confines, and it is not certain that he will be replying, perhaps he would tell us if he or his Department have made any calculations into the cost of producing <Col N="2344" /> a gallon of milk for the liquid supply market, having regard to the fact that the prices of fertilisers have trebled since the advent of the Coalition as have all the other costs of production.  There have been huge increases in the cost of the provision of farm buildings, in the price of agricultural diesel fuel and in the price of all types of machines.  Apart from these considerations there has been the entry of a new element into the liquid milk business, an element that was devised by the Coalition.  I refer to the imposition of several new taxes which were not in existence before the Coalition came into office. These taxes will upset the whole pattern of Irish agriculture, will destroy the costing of farm succession and will saddle the inheritors of farms with burdens of debt that they will never be able to shed.</P>
    <P>If it is legitimate for the Minister to subsidise the products of these farms, it is legitimate also to inquire into the effects of inflation on the producers of these products.  The smaller producers are unlikely to survive a great deal more of the manner of assistance that is being conferred on them by the Government.  A great many of them are very heavily indebted. Only yesterday a Bill making available money to the ACC was jack-booted through the House so as to provide a higher ceiling for borrowing by farmers whereas in 1973 farmers were borrowing for the purposes of expansion, farm development and the building of new houses.  Any borrowing now is purely for survival.  This is rather in the same manner as the Government are borrowing wildly from any source they can tap.  I understand that the Minister for Finance has departed hurriedly for the Lebanon or some obscure place in the Middle-East where he may dig up some previously unheard of sheiks who may have a little spare lolly to lend to the creaking structure of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I must remind you that yesterday there was a Committee Stage of a Finance Bill&mdash;the Agricultural Credit Bill&mdash;during which everybody made Second Reading speeches. It was like the Bells of St. Mary's from the other side: everything in the garden was lovely.  However, I shall not disagree with you.  The Minister is subsidising butter.  He had to take this action because there was growing very rapidly a menacing traffic in the reimportation from the Six Counties of southern butter.  This development was upsetting the domestic butter market to such an extent that some form of subsidy had to be introduced to correct it such as that which has been in operation on the other side of the Border for a considerable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether butter production will show an increase this year compared with last year.  I suspect that this will not be so.  The Minister has been telling us that milk deliveries to creameries are up by 10 per cent this year compared with last year.  My opinion is that by the end of the milk season the overall effect will be a drop in milk production.  What is almost certain is that the profitability of the milk manufacturing industry will have dropped to a degree that the manufacturing co-operative combines such as Mitchelstown, Charleville, Avonmore and so on will have some difficulty in servicing their capital debts and there may be a possibility of their being constrained to impose a levy on the milk price paid to their suppliers, especially in view of the impending introduction of something that is known to the European Commission as financial co-responsibility. This is something on which we have not heard the Minister express an opinion yet any more than we have heard him express any new thinking on the stocktaking of the <Col N="2346" /> CAP that is being undertaken at present and which incorporates this notion of financial co-responsibility. It would be well to have this idea defined because it means reducing the price to the producer.  There is no other area of economic activity where this is acceptable or permissible.</P>
    <P>I am very much afraid that it may come into operation but the only saving factor that may prevent it is the unusually dry weather which would have led to some drop in milk production. A Cheann Comhairle, I have been told by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that if anybody from this side of the House mentions anything about the destruction of the beef cattle herds, the depletion of the pig herds or the very rapid destruction of the sheep flock, we may be out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not expect you to do anything else.  I shall have to go back to the Apocalypse to see if I can get anything else to talk about.  I should like the Minister to enlighten us as to what plans he and his Department have for the control of brucellosis and tuberculosis in the herds which will be enjoying the subsidy the Minister is introducing now.  It is necessary for us to remind ourselves that this Supplementary Estimate, introduced as it well may be under the guise of some assistance to the struggling farm industry, is nothing of the kind.  It is a subsidy to the consumers and is of no value whatever that I can see to the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister alludes to the assistance that this will give in controlling inflation in the consumer context, but I would have thought the Minister would contemplate some <Col N="2347" /> measures to assist the producers themselves in resisting the effects of the same inflation.  It is unlikely that the herd owners, the creamery milk suppliers and the liquid milk suppliers, will be able from their own resources to do anything at all about the very serious situation that exists in the matter of disease eradication at present.  It is so drastic that the fact that we are not to allude to it in this House is nothing short of criminal.  It is an absolute standing of democracy on its head.  If we have not completed the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis by 1978 we will not be able to export any of these meat or dairy products.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have looked for a derogation or for an extension of time, and that after great cogitation and wrangling and reasoning the Government were told they might have six months.  That confronts the Minister with a really mammoth problem and as yet I have not perceived any radical new approach to this enormous question of disease eradication. The cure for this will be necessarily rough.  There will have to be very strict and stern measures adopted, and at once.  If they are not, we would still have a considerable cattle herd left in spite of the activities of the National Coalition Government and we shall have nowhere to go with them.</P>
    <P>This very serious fact and all the other facts that raise such enormous questions for Irish farmers who are producers of milk, especially in the future, have been deliberately blacked out and prevented from getting access to public knowledge by the deliberate policy of this Government of preventing their being discussed either here or anywhere else.  Instead of free and open discussion on this vital national matter, we have the best public relations operation that I would say the country ever saw.  It would make George Orwell's <i>Nineteen-Eighty-Four</i> look really pathetic.  We are persuaded that at the head of this thriving and burgeoning Irish agriculture there is a fighting Minister leading it on to greater heights every day of <Col N="2348" /> the week.  It puts me in mind of a fairly famous character who used to occur in little songs and jingles that we heard when we were young.  We are living in a Freudian age; there are two main gurus, Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud, and people are always talking about syndromes.  We have a new syndrome now, the Brian O'Lynn syndrome: &ldquo;The bridge fell down and we all fell in, but there's ground at the bottom, says Brian O'Lynn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government at present are the very same.  Irish agriculture is in very serious disarray; so is the economy generally.  They know about the bonanzas: &ldquo;We will soon be around the corner&rdquo;.  It is time for the more responsible people in the Press and elsewhere to ask themselves are they really serving a worth-while cause by aiding and abetting this mean deception, because it is nothing else.  It is a deception that costs the taxpayer a great deal of money, apart from the misrepresentation of the facts, somewhat like the corralling and the stripping of the producers of small cattle last year.</P>
    <P>It is time we had an end to this nonsense, and it is over time that this House got an opportunity really to examine Irish agriculture.  I know I am debarred by some article in the Book of Rules from talking about this, but I feel that the fact that I am a farmer myself and represent farmers gives me some right that may very well soon override that Book of Rules on your desk, a Cheann Comhairle.  I want to tell the Minister that the farmers have had enough of this managed news. What we really want now is for the Minister and his colleagues to acknowledge that they are not able to govern this country, that they have made the most unholy mess of things, and depart.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Government and the Minister for bringing in this Estimate which I believe will go a long way towards improving the housewife's situation, a situation in which prices are rising rapidly every day.  It will enable her to ensure that sufficient quantities of both butter and milk will be available to her at a reasonable price.  The Government should be complimented on <Col N="2349" /> their effort to control inflation and particularly on this brilliant idea.  Holding the cost of living gives the economy a chance to get back on its feet and it allows for the creation of jobs.  This is but a beginning.  The help given by the Minister is much appreciated.</P>
      <P>The most significant factor is that the dairy industry, particularly that section dealing with butter and milk, have an opportunity of pushing their products on the home market and I hope they will grasp it.  Not enough advertising is being done.  At 6p a pint milk represents the best food value for money at the moment.  It is a most wholesome product but yet it is difficult at times to get a glass of milk in an hotel or restaurant.</P>
      <P>Butter has been the victim of a mean campaign by some medical people who refer to its potential hazards.  To me that is a lot of nonsense.  If a person took all this advice too far he would end up by starving to death.  The co-operative societies and the companies involved in the sale and production of milk and butter should use this injection of capital to further their products. Despite the severe drought experienced in the last few months milk yields will be up.</P>
      <P>The Minister should be complimented on what he has done.  He has been subjected to a lot of unfair criticism.  Those involved in agriculture have shown their confidence in the Government and in the Minister; there is now a greater number of dairy cows and bigger and more efficient milking parlours are being erected.  Apart from its effect at consumer level, the effect of the subsidy on industry will be significant.  Because of our climate and other factors we are able to produce milk and butter more competitively than any other nation in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidy will apply also to unpasteurised milk and this is to be welcomed. Perhaps in the long term we should not encourage the use of unpasteurised milk but the pasteurisation process is a fairly expensive operation and many people are producing excellent milk without using that process.  The question of unpasteurised <Col N="2350" /> milk should be studied more carefully before the critics make their statements.  All of us survived on ordinary clean milk and it did not do us any harm.  I cannot understand all the excitement about pasteurisation and I am glad that the people who are selling a good product will benefit from the scheme.  In fact, because they do not pasteurise the milk it makes them even more careful in ensuring that the product is good.</P>
    <P>Butter is an important item in our diet but it was getting very expensive. As Deputy Gibbons pointed out, there is cross-Border trafficking which must be deplored.  If we want butter for nothing, we cannot expect to employ people in our creameries and in the processing industry.  The subsidy will help to counteract the cross-Border trafficking in butter.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the measure the Minister has put forward being continued and extended.  For instance, it would be worth while to include cheese in the subsidy.  At the moment there is a swing towards this product and there is a substantial demand for Irish cheese.  The Irish dairy industry are using sophisticated processes in the manufacture of cheese.  It is an excellent food for young and old but it is not being plugged enough.  Any help given to the cheese industry should be confined to the Irish product only.  At one time the foreign cheese market controlled the home market but now it is being replaced by the Irish product.</P>
    <P>I do not share the pessimism of Deputy Gibbons regarding the dairy industry.  It is flourishing and it will continue to flourish.  In the last few years it has grown and prospered.  It suits our needs and our climate.  We have been categorised by the EEC as a nation that should produce dairy products and this is stressed by the emphasis put on dairying by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  It may be over-emphasised to the exclusion of other products, such as horticultural products in which I am interested.</P>
    <P>Dairying is going well.  This injection of £9 million is a good thing.  It should have the effect of helping the <Col N="2351" /> housewife to keep adequate supplies of butter in the home to the exclusion of imported margarine which is so popular even with some medical people.  Now that the difference in price is marginal the housewife will use butter.  Children are not confused as to which tastes better.  Butter certainly is the better and more wholesome product and therefore I am glad that we will be in a position to offer that product at a realistic price.</P>
    <P>The same applies to milk.  At 6p a pint milk is a very cheap food and it is a complete food, a fact which is not advertised sufficiently.  I hope that co-operative societies and dairies will engage in a selling campaign.  The Government can give the lead but the impetus can be lost if action is not taken down along the line.  The dairying industry should avail of this injection of £9 million to promote sales of butter and milk on the home market, apart from foreign markets.  There is an enormous home market and not nearly enough effort is put into selling. This type of injection should be used to promote sales of dairy products including cheese, yogurt and all the other items.  This is one way of ensuring that there will be no mountains of products, that there will be balanced production and that the decks would be cleared at all times.  There should be attractive presentation.  A great deal is being done to promote sales but the effort is not sufficiently intensive.  If there were as much publicity for milk and dairy products as there is for drink the nation would be a healtier one.  Advertisements showing people drinking pints of milk would do a great deal of good.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister generally on his performance as Minister in a fairly tough world situation.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to sell our products abroad. Having the energy that he has and given the co-operation that he must get from meat factories, dairies, co-operatives and farmers generally I have no doubt that the Minister will continue to do the good job that he is doing in ensuring that the Irish product gets the best price abroad.  That <Col N="2352" /> is one of his main functions as Minister in an EEC situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>My main purpose in speaking on the Estimate is to ask a question and to try to get information from the Minister in regard to the liquid milk subsidy and there are a few other matters that I want to deal with.  The last speaker referred to an injection of £9 million into the dairying industry.  I do not think anyone would accept that this is an injection of £9 million into the dairying industry. This subsidy is for the purpose of restoring the price of butter and liquid milk to the consumer.  Indirectly it will help the dairying industry and from that point of view possibly it might be regarded as an injection. From the Minister's point of view it is very expensive.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I could elaborate on the question of providing support for cheese manufacturing.  The last speaker referred to it and although it has not been referred to in the Minister's statement, it may come under the heading of liquid milk.  In County Wexford there is a substantial cheese manufacturing industry.  Anything that would popularise the use of cheese would be very welcome.  We would all like to see more cheese being used on the home market.  This would help the dairying industry to a very great extent.  That is beside the point that I rose to make but it is an important point and one which I hope the Minister will keep in mind.</P>
      <P>Everybody must welcome the subsidy of £9 million towards sales of butter and liquid milk.  All that we on this side of the House can say is that it is a pity it was not introduced earlier, possibly 12 months ago or at the time of the budget.  At that stage certainly it was recommended that subsidies of this nature should be introduced. Had that been done it would have helped to remove some of the difficulties then facing the Government and might have helped to avoid some of the major problems in the industrial sphere now facing the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The price of butter has been reduced but there is some question as to whether the price of liquid milk will <Col N="2353" /> come down by 2p a pint or not.  There seems to be a doubt about it, that applications for price increases will result in an increase in the price and offset as far as the consumer is concerned the reduction of 2p a pint that has been mentioned.</P>
    <P>It would be a good thing if we could bring the price of our butter into line with the price in the Six Counties and in Britain.  That might cost a lot of money.  It is regrettable that thousands of people should cross the Border every week for the purpose of importing butter at 10p or 12p a lb less than even the subsidised price of butter in the Twenty-six Counties. Much of that butter is manufactured here, exported to the Six Counties and imported into the Twenty-six Counties.  I do not blame the housewives for that when it can be done legally.  They are buying excellent butter at a price which is 8p or 10p per lb less than the price charged on the Irish market.  It would be very difficult to blame the Irish housewife for getting into a car or a bus and heading up to Jonesboro or elsewhere to do her shopping.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with the small suppliers of liquid milk.  In Wexford there are may be 15 or 16 suppliers of what might be regarded as small quantities of loose liquid milk.  For those suppliers this is their livelihood. They go round the local town or village daily to deliver, in cans or otherwise, possibly 30 to 50 gallons of milk.  There are two such suppliers around Enniscorthy, five or six in Gorey and a few more in the outskirts of Wexford town. Under the full control of the CMO they supply this milk.  This matter was raised recently at Wexford County Council and it was agreed that if the CMO&mdash;and he accepted this&mdash;annually tested the cows concerned and ensured that the dairies were up to standard, that there was no objection to their supplying loose milk to these towns.</P>
    <P>How will these suppliers be affected by the subsidy?  Have the Department made arrangements to ensure that they will benefit by it?  If they have to sell loose milk at 2p per pint more than the large dairies who sell bottled milk, they will go out of business, <Col N="2354" /> because naturally the customer will not stand for it.  I am sure the Minister will agree that these small suppliers could not stay in business unless they benefit from the subsidy.  When the Minister replies perhaps he will tell us how these people will fare? Will they benefit from the subsidy because, if not, they will be out of business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I promise to be very brief as quite a few pertinent points have been raised to which the Minister will want to reply.</P>
      <P>I welcome these subsidies.  This supplementary estimate is part of the Government's package to try to reduce the cost of living.  When speaking on the official budget in 1974 I called on the Minister to consider the idea of bringing in food subsidies because I considered they were essential. I am glad to see they have at last arrived.</P>
      <P>On 15th April, 1975, I asked the Taoiseach the percentage increase in the price of milk and butter in the period February, 1974, to February, 1975.  His reply was that the percentage increase between mid-February, 1974 and mid-February, 1975, in the average retail prices was butter, 47.3 per cent and milk 36.4 per cent.  These figures highlighted the burden on the average housewife. I am pleased that three months later the Government have introduced subsidisation. My only regret is that it has come so late.  This is not an injection of capital into the industry.  It is simply an effort to lower the price paid by the housewife.  Whether it will be successful remains to be seen.  I intend to ask questions to find out what the consumer price increase has been in relevant periods following this subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nine million pounds is a great deal of money which, apparently, we will not have to pay.  It is part of the deficit.  It is part of the continued policy of this Government to run up bills.  If we are lucky enough to borrow, we will have to repay the interest.  This Government know they will only be in office for a short time and it will fall on Fianna Fáil to meet <Col N="2355" /> these payments.  Fianna Fáil, as always, will rise to the occasion.</P>
    <P>We have been asking for food subsidies for a long time.  Now that they have arrived they are welcome.  Milk is essential because it provides the farmer with his useful monthly cheque.  But milk alone is not sufficient. We want quality milk.  To have quality milk we must have quality cows.  To have quality cows we must have quality grass.  To have quality grass we must have fertilisation.  We need fertilisation from NET which was set up to supply the market.  It is dreadful to see stockpiles of fertilisers in Arklow when it is needed for good milk.  The farmer cannot use the fertiliser because it is so costly.  Why did the Government not come in with a subsidy along these lines?</P>
    <P>I hope that the dumping commission will find a case against the Portuguese. I believe they were meeting this morning so perhaps the Minister will have good news for us, that this ship with approximately 3,500 tons of Portuguese CAN will not be unloaded.</P>

      <P>I tried in my opening statement to give the House clearly the reasons why those substantial subsidies are being brought in.  I believe I gave that in considerable detail.  I believe it is fair for me to say, listening to the speakers on the Opposition benches, that they spent the major portion of the time explaining to the Chair the things they were not allowed to discuss on this occasion.</P>

      <P>They did this job extremely well.  Deputy Gibbons was at some pains to convey the impression that I was trying by any and every means to avoid discussion of agricultural matters in the House.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We discuss agriculture in the House on exactly the same occasions as our predecessors in Government did, at the time of the main Estimate, Supplementary Estimates, if anybody brings in a motion and if anybody asks questions. I am always most agreeable and anxious to discuss agriculture because I feel we have done extremely well in the circumstances through which we have been passing as far as agriculture is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons went a little further and said that the Government had now a managed Press in relation to agriculture.  I believe he is very upset and annoyed that we have open Government, that we meet the Press people whenever they want to talk to <Col N="2357" /> us and that we give them the fullest possible explanations of everything we are doing and everything we propose to do.  Consequently we avoid wide speculation. The secrecy with which Government was carried on in the past was always resented by the Press and consequently got fairly adverse Press comment. Deputy Gibbons referred to my statement as something resembling an obscure passage from the Apocalypse, even though I explained it in the greatest detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who said that this was not a producer subsidy were quite right because that is not the primary aim.  The primary aim is to bring down the CPI so that we will get a response whereby workers will forego an equal amount.  In this way we will start to wind down the inflation we are all so concerned about. This is one of the very effective methods we are using to bring down the CPI.  The two items concerned in this Supplementary Estimate are calculated to bring down the CPI by 1.26 per cent.  That is a fairly effective reduction.</P>
      <P>It is also right to say that at the same time it is a considerable help to producers, because farmers, like everybody else, eat butter.  They always used butter liberally when they made it and they still continue to use a lot of it, even though they do not make it but buy it instead.  This will mean a considerable saving to farmers in common with all other consumers.  In addition, farmers will get the benefit of all the other subsidies. We are not asking them for any particular response in this regard. They have had to respond in a pretty tough way during the past year.  None of us should lose sight of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I seem to have been held responsible by Deputy Gibbons for the increase in the cost of fertilisers.  Of course he knows that I could not possibly do anything about this.  I have to point out again that we are the only country in the EEC that provides any <Col N="2358" /> subsidisation whatever for fertilisers. We heard a good deal of talk about the price of butter across the Border. and the traffic across the Border. Even if we had the same sort of money to provide consumer subsidies here as they have in the UK, we would not be allowed to do it.  We have probably gone slightly farther than we should in this and in our anxiety and concern to bring down the cost-of-living index.</P>
    <P>Britain are allowed to do it because it was something they were doing before they joined the EEC.  As we all know, the Fianna Fáil Government did not provide such subsidies and consequently debarred us from doing it by not having them there before we joined the EEC.  I would like the Deputies opposite to know that they are totally responsible for us not being able to introduce new subsidies because they had not them introduced before we joined the EEC.  I was glad that the Deputies opposite at least welcomed the subsidy on butter and milk and said not only would they be a good thing for the consumers but would also be a good thing for the producers because it would help the home market to the extent that was necessary.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain again that butter is no problem here.  We have no difficulty in selling butter.  Even if some of our Irish consumers get a cheaper product from across the Border I do not think we should be howling and complaining about it because this is legal traffic.  They are getting the advantage of the lower prices.  We are well able to sell our butter.  It is not a problem.</P>

      <P>A question was raised about loose milk.  We are anxious as far as possible to subsidise milk in the manner indicated but it would be quite impossible in view of the quantity involved in the case raised by Deputy Browne.  The information at my disposal indicates that the amount now being sold loose is insignificant.  I should like to see it included if there were a way in which that could be done but I believe there is no way of doing it.  Deputy Browne seemed to justify this on the grounds that in Wexford, his own constitutuency, the sale of milk loose had the blessing of the health authorities and the doctors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am telling the Minister is that unless he can find some way of subsidising this milk he will put 14 or 15 progressive small farmers out of business, a business that has been carried on for generations over the last 150 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the prospect of putting these people out of business, I do not think anybody will dive into that small business because it would be totally uneconomic for people from outside to seek to secure this business.  We will be anxious to ensure that, where possible, they get this subsidy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne spoke about quality and the acceptance of quality.  I agree the quality is perfectly all right. It is a question of quantity, deciding on quantity and having a reliable record.  We are pretty good at sidestepping regulations and getting subsidies to which we are not entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers are small and it should be possible for the Minister's Department to devise some scheme, either an agreed amount at the end of the year or something of <Col N="2360" /> that kind.  If you know the number of cows a man has you know the quantity of milk he can put on the market.  I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but this is a very important matter for these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

      <P>It is a matter of concern for me too.  I agree with the Deputy, if we can find a way to include them, that is what we want to do.  If the Deputy can suggest any workable arrangement I shall certainly be glad to listen to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gibbons spoke about milk production and said that, because of the cost imposed by the present Government, milk production would be down by the end of the year and he implied I had been giving more or less false impressions.  All I can say is that I got the returns this morning for the week ended 21st June and they showed that milk production was up by 10 per cent for the first six months.  I cannot tell him what the future holds and he cannot tell me what it holds: milk production may be up or down.  He quoted Brian O'Lynn and he should have gone a little further and quoted a little more because, under Fianna Fáil, Brian O'Lynn had a house, to be sure, with the sky for a roof and the ground for a floor but, under the Coalition Government, there is no such criticism because we are building houses at a rate at which they were never built before.</P>

I want him to know &mdash;I think he knows it already&mdash;that there is no argument between us in regard to this matter.  My only disappointment is that during the last 20 years, as far as tuberculosis is concerned, and the last ten years, as far as brucellosis is concerned, there was not very much greater progress and the results were not much better because it does not make it any easier for me now in the limited times available to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,109,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This supplementary Estimate results from excesses of £10,480,000 on three subheads and a shortfall of £629,000 in receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid. The sum of £9,500,000 is required <Col N="2362" /> for increased grants to CIE.  The decline of £629,000 in receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid relates mainly to receipts from airport operations. An additional sum of £230,000 is required for the acquisition of land at airports and £750,000 is required for town gas subsidy.</P>
    <P>As announced by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement on 26th June, 1975, part of the Government's special counter-inflationary measures is a reduction, with effect from 28th July, 1975, of CIE's fares on Dublin city bus services, provincial road passenger services and Dublin and Cork commuter rail services.  As I indicated in the debate on the motion on CIE's charges in the House on 13th May, 1975, the increases introduced by CIE in May, 1975, were fully justified on the basis of increases in CIE's costs. The reduction in fares which is now being made is a very exceptional measure as part of the Government's overall efforts to break the vicious inflationary spiral which is threatening the country's economy.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, therefore, that additional subvention should be provided for CIE in 1975 to meet the loss in revenue which will result from the fare reductions and also to avoid the necessity for further increases in CIE charges in the current year.  Failing this additional assistance from the Exchequer, further large increases in charges in 1975 would have been unavoidable.</P>
    <P>Basically, therefore, the need for the additional subvention of £9.5 million, for which provision is made in the supplementary estimate, arises from the fact that increases in CIE's costs in 1975 are not being matched by corresponding increases in CIE's charges. A further factor adding to CIE's difficulties in the present year is a decline in business due to the effect on rail and road freight carryings of reduced usage of fertilisers and limestone, reduced carrying of cement and lower volumes of sundries and general merchandise reflecting the general adverse economic trends.  Rail and road passenger traffic has also been affected by the decline in economic activity.  The result of this loss in business is estimated <Col N="2363" /> at some £900,000 on budgeted revenue for 1975.</P>
    <P>CIE's increased costs in 1975 are running at a rate of some £20 million over corresponding costs in 1974.  By far the greatest proportion of this is attributable to increased labour costs which account for about £17 million, including the balance of the 14th and 15th rounds and the first two phases of the 16th round.  By contrast, additional revenue in 1975 from the rates and fares increases in July, 1974, and May, 1975, will amount to only about £9 million, after taking account of the reductions in fares to be introduced on 28th July, 1975.  In these circumstances the provision of additional subvention for CIE in the current year is unavoidable if the board are to maintain their services to the public and avoid wholesale disemployment of staff.</P>
    <P>The provision of £9.5 million in the supplementary estimate will bring the total subvention provision for the year to £86.5 million and I am hopeful that the board's requirements can be kept within this limit.  This sum includes approximately £19.4 million for railway operations, £5.3 million for Dublin city bus services and £1.5 million for other road passenger services. None of the additional subvention is intended to cover activities such as CIE road freight services which are not covered by the CIE subvention structure and which must be operated on a commercial basis.</P>
    <P>In limiting the additional subvention provision to £9.5 million I am assuming that the special reliefs provided for in the recent budget will have the desired result of containing increases in labour costs and that CIE, together with the rest of industry, will benefit accordingly.  In addition, I expect CIE to pursue vigorously all practical measures to improve efficiency and to secure economies and increases in productivity.  That such measures are necessary is self-evident from the size of the subvention provision for 1975, which at £26.5 million represents an increase of almost 150 per cent on the subvention of £11 million for 1973-74 and is almost <Col N="2364" /> eight times the subvention paid for 1969-70.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for the special measures being taken in the current year to keep CIE's prices down, the magnitude of the present subvention is a grave cause for concern.  The board's costs are now escalating at such a rate that, even if the board had unrestricted power to increase prices, the size of the increases required to meet the full additional costs on the basis of present working arrangements would be commercially impracticable.  Neither does the answer lie in massive increases in the Exchequer subvention each year&mdash; the economy simply could not afford this.  It is imperative, therefore, for CIE to achieve economies and the successful implementation of productivity and cost reduction schemes. Otherwise CIE's deficits in future years will reach intolerable proportions and more drastic steps will be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>While the rapid increase in CIE deficits in recent years is a function of inflation, it is also a function of the manning structure of the undertaking. There are 20,000 people employed by CIE and, in the current year, some £65 million will be paid in wages and salaries.  While this is a substantial contribution to the economy in terms of people employed and in terms of wages earned, it is clear that unless these people can be employed effectively, then the economics of CIE's operation will continue to be unbalanced and will become progressively worse.  In a labour intensive industry such as CIE a critical factor in reducing costs is undoubtedly that of manning and maximum benefit must be taken from natural wastage at all levels with interchangeability of staff through the formulation of productivity and reorganisation schemes.  What is at issue in these proposals is the longterm security of present employees and value for money for the consumer and taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The actual allocation for land acquisition at the airports for 1975 is £500,000 which is the same estimate for the last nine months of 1974. <Col N="2365" /> £450,000 of the 1974 allocation was provided for the purpose of an anticipated award arising out of arbitration proceedings.  In the event the arbitrators award was not made until February, 1975.  It is now expected that the arbitration award in addition to other cases where agreement as to compensation with landowners has been reached, will require payment of £730,000 for this year.  Accordingly, a supplementary estimate for the extra amount is now necessary.</P>
    <P>The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement on 26th June, 1975, also provided for a subsidy to the producers of town gas to enable them to reduce the price of town gas to the consumer by an average of 12½ per cent.  As stated by the Minister for Finance, it is the Government's intention that the price of town gas should be reduced with effect from 1st July, or the earliest possible date thereafter.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Dáil has already approved a Financial Resolution removing value-added tax from town gas, electricity and all other fuels, with the exception of road fuels.  These measures form part of the overall Government package designed to wind down inflation and stimulate economic activity.</P>
    <P>As regard the proposed reduction in the price of town gas, my Department have had preliminary consultations with representatives of the gas undertakings and no difficulty is anticipated in giving effect to the reduction.  The undertaking will, of course, require to be reimbursed for the loss of revenue. I propose that this be done by providing a new subhead in the Transport and Power Vote for the payment of an appropriate subsidy.  It is estimated that expenditure on the subsidy in the current year will be of the order of £750,000 and provision for this sum is accordingly included in the supplementary estimate.</P>
    <P>In addition to the various additional expenditures which I have referred to, the supplementary Estimate also includes provision for £629,000 to cover a shortfall in appropriations-in-aid. These appropriations-in-aid relate to the various sources of income which <Col N="2366" /> accrue to the Department under various headings and which provide a partial offset against the Department's expenditure subheads.  The estimate of £3,002,560 was based on the best information available at the time but adverse factors affecting travel and tourism have led to deficits under a number of headings.  These deficits are on subhead X.3&mdash;surplus on Aer Rianta operations&mdash;which is down by an estimated £400,000 and subhead X.7&mdash;Shanwick Communication Charges&mdash;which is down by an estimated £287,000.  These deficits are offset by a surplus of £58,000 on X.4&mdash;Recoup-ment from Eurocontrol of cost of providing personnel and facilities.</P>
    <P>I recommend the supplementary estimate to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Again we are faced with the problem of CIE and the huge subsidies which have to be made available to this State body.  It is a recurring problem and we do not seem to be able to do anything about it.  The sum of £26½ million for the current year is a frightening sum to be faced with at this time.  Having already made available £70 million, we now find ourselves facing a further bill for £9½ million.</P>
      <P>The increase in their losses serves to highlight the necessity for a rethink and a complete re-examination of our national transport policy, and a clearer definition of the role CIE play and will continue to play within that policy.  Fortunately, there is general acceptance of the social service provided by CIE.  CIE's activities in this area must be directed by sources which can establish and measure the needs and decide the nature of our transport resources public or private which can be most suitably used for meeting those needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE are organised and managed to operate a transport system on road and rail.  They regulate their activities on the basis of economic demand. Circumstances placed the management in a situation in which they are required to interpret and exercise their discretion in the matter of satisfying requirements which are purely social with repercussions on community welfare and living conditions. A transport management team should not be forced into this type of situation.  That is happening.  CIE management have sufficient problems operating our transport services without being burdened with social services such as these that would be more appropriate to local or national political decision level.  There already exists a guideline for this concept with CIE's relationships with the Department of Education.  For the school transport service CIE operate as contractors <Col N="2368" /> to the Department of Education. This eliminates headaches for CIE when they are acting in this role. We should examine this role for CIE further.</P>
    <P>The municipal transport services operated by CIE in Dublin and Cork are instances where some similar type of arrangement with local authorities on regional transport could be introduced or examined carefully.  The public, through a suitably constituted national or local committee would directly influence and control the levels and types of service for which they have to pay.  A national transport board might co-ordinate the provision of a public transport service and decide the role of road and rail transport.  This is not uncommon in other countries.  At present this role is the responsibility of CIE and it forces them to rely on fares policies. This can result, as we know, in a lot of cross-subsidisation between road and rail users.  There are many examples of this throughout the system.  It also involves subsidisation between urban and rural communities and does not reflect the individual characteristics of the separate services which are being provided.</P>
    <P>If we are serious in wanting our railway system to stand on its own right its performance cannot be measured in terms of financial losses because of the varied roles it finds itself having to adopt within our community, economic and social, and the many demands that have been considered. It is necessary to identify the specific social costs of this service and of its uneconomic service areas before a financial measurement of its performance can be achieved.  A board of control should be set up to look closely into the whole service to see what can be done in every field with regard to reducing the huge bills we are forced to meet yearly and sometimes twice a year.  This board could consider the future of the company.</P>
    <P>The Minister emphasised the heavy wage bill.  Undoubtedly, it is a heavy wage bill which eats up most of the resources of CIE but we must also consider the 20,000 employees and their future.  They are an important factor <Col N="2369" /> in this.  The whole management structure of CIE needs further examination in view of recent happenings which must have resulted from some disagreement at top management level. It is not usual to see a man leaving such an attractive post at £15,000 per year without a solid reason or definite disagreement.  We will have to do a lot of re-examining if we are to succeed in avoiding these annual bills we are faced with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subsidisation of fares it appears that there is no subsidy envisaged by the Minister for fares on long journeys.  This is discriminatory against the people who travel long distances by CIE.  There seems to be grave dissatisfaction with the Dublin bus service at present.  The public are not getting the service they are entitled to and it seems that this is because drivers do not want to work overtime.  The drivers are entitled to this point of view but it has resulted in a total ban by CIE on employing people during the summer as they used.  It is a social necessity that CIE provide a proper service during the day and the Dublin people are entitled to this service.  The Minister should ensure that the public are provided with a proper service even if it means further recruitment of staff.</P>
    <P>The money provided for the air services and Aer Rianta is necessary. A serious flaw came to light recently in the legislation governing air services in and out of this country.  We all read about a High Court injunction granted to what could only be described as a pirate operator who flew in and out of Shannon Airport, without any airport clearance, carrying a load of calves.  This flaw must be worrying for Aer Lingus and private operators who provide a good service. In order not to allow this to develop further the Minister should look at the existing legislation to see if it needs to be changed.  This could develop into a serious matter for our national airline.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I should like to make a statement to the House <Col N="2370" /> about the recent meeting of heads of Government of the countries of the European Economic Communities, accompanied by their Foreign Minsters, which was held in Brussels on 16th and 17th July.  The House will know that these meetings are intended primarily to provide opportunities for heads of Government to reflect together on the problems of the Community, and on issues of foreign policy of common concern to the nine member states.  On some issues the European Council may provide an orientation for future policy&mdash;as was done at the Dublin Summit, for example, when the heads of Government reached agreement on a solution to the problem of the possible inequity of financial contributions by member states to the Community.  But primarily they are occasions for exchanges of views, leading in many cases to subsequent decisions by the appropriate agencies.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the last meeting covered an exchange of views for development prospects of the Community, following the British referendum, the economic situation, including international monetary problems, energy problems and problems related to raw materials and development of the less-developed countries of the world.</P>
      <P>It follows from the form of the meetings that there should be no formal communiqué.  At the same time, certain declarations or statements are essential to record the conclusions or trend of the discussions.  Statements issued on this occasion covered the economic and monetary situation; certain aspects of European Union; the United Nations, and Portugal.  I am arranging that these be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the concern which I expressed at the meeting of heads of Government in Paris in December, 1974, that the evolution of the Community should be accelerated. We regard the early holding of direct elections as an important step in this direction.  The decision to bring forward to 1978 the date from which such elections should be held was in our view an important development. Only by involving the people of the <Col N="2371" /> different countries of the Community in its processes and decisions can its development be ensured.  We must reduce the feeling of remoteness of the Community from the practical world and the practical concerns of men and women of our countries.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, Britain and Denmark entered reserves in the communique issued after the Paris meeting of December last, on the question of direct elections.  At this meeting these two countries joined with the rest of us in agreeing that the Council of Ministers should study the matter, taking into account the proposals made recently by Parliament and should report back at the end of the year.  At the same time the meeting decided to initiate work on proposals for a passport union and for the establishment of some basic rights for citizens of the Community in each others' countries.</P>
    <P>The most important problems to be settled immediately in relation to direct elections, apart from the membership of the different countries, concern the method of election of the members, the constituencies they will be expected to serve and questions relating to dual membership of the European Parliament and the Parliament of the country they represent. These questions involve such issues as the basic purpose of membership of the European Parliament and perhaps also, in a related way, the question of a bicameral parliament for Europe.</P>
    <P>The basic purpose of direct elections, passport union, new arrangements for meetings of the European Council and so on is to improve the institutions of the Community and maintain the momentum for its development.  It is essential that they should be approached with a sense of purpose and urgency.  The Community cannot play its proper role in the world, or indeed in the affairs of Europe, unless its institutions are accepted and work on a sufficient scale with efficiency and humanity for the achievement of the basic social and economic aims of the Communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> In relation to the external or political questions before the meeting of heads of Government, Deputies will by now be aware of the situation in Portugal, the meeting heard an evaluation of the situation in that country by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who visited the country as President of the Council of Ministers a short while ago.  The meeting decided to confirm the willingness of the Community to discuss closer economic and financial co-operation, indicating at the same time that in accordance with the Community's European policy and history to date it could only support a pluralist democracy.</P>
    <P>The meeting approved a statement on the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe setting out their evaluation of the conference. The statement is to be issued if the stage of the conference currently in progress in Geneva concludes in the immediate future.  The conclusions of the conference will be signed by the heads of Government of 35 European states at Helsinki at a third and final stage of the conference, which on present plans will be held between the 30th of this month and the 1st of August.</P>
    <P>The fourth international issue considered by the heads of Government was the position of the Community <i>vis-á-vis</i> the United Nations.  We made it clear in our statement that we regard the United Nations as the main organ of international co-operation and will set aside any obstacles to coordination of our countries' views so that the Community can act to promote conciliation and dialogue and consequently a strengthening of the United Nations.  In particular, as regards the special session of the General Assembly devoted to development and international economic co-operation, which is due to take place at the beginning of September, we stressed determination as a Community to promote a more equitable and balanced economic order.</P>
    <P>Important as were the institutional and external matters which we discussed, the main emphasis of the meeting was on the economic situation.  We devoted a considerable part of our <Col N="2373" /> time in Brussels to the discussion of energy, raw materials and development. Our interest in the matter can be gauged from the fact that in 1973 we imported some £67 million worth of oil and oil products.  In 1974 this figure had risen to about £208 million for a slightly lower volume of the same products.  In 1973 we imported some £90 million worth of what can on a certain definition be described as raw materials.  In 1974 the comparative figure was £144 million, again for a slightly lower volume.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that much of our oil and raw materials comes from developing countries.  These countries have urged that the trade in commodities should be so organised that the return to the producer is remunerative and the price to the consumer fair while long- and short-term arrangements are made to guarantee supplies.  Difficulties of which Deputies will be aware have arisen in relation to a conference between producers and consumers of these commodities.  I am glad to say that so far as the Community is concerned these difficulties were largely resolved at our meeting.</P>
    <P>The real concern of the meeting was the economic situation as it faces each country of the Community today. We had a long and full discussion of the economic problems we all face.</P>
    <P>I cannot, I am afraid, report much optimism among my colleagues.  All are agreed that the world economic crisis is much more severe than anyone had anticipated and that it is far from resolution.</P>
    <P>The measure of the deterioration in our prospects and of its sudden and unexpected character may be seen in the fact that when we met here in Dublin only four months ago the expert advice given to us was to the effect that, despite the difficulties we had faced, the Community would secure an increase of about 1½ per cent in its output during the current calendar year.  The day before yesterday, however, we were told that the prospect now is not for growth but for a decline of 3 per cent in Community output this year.</P>
    <P>The March forecast was for a level <Col N="2374" /> of unemployment of about 3.5 per cent for the Community as a whole.  Unemployment has now passed 4 per cent, or more than 4,000,000 people.  In Europe today there are more people out of work than the entire population of this country.</P>
    <P>It is on these countries of the Community and on countries like America, Japan and more recently the oil producers, that we must largely depend for revival and growth.  In 1974 our exports were equivalent to almost half our total output.  We are more dependent for our prosperity on world revival than is any country of the Community.</P>
    <P>The message is clear.  So far as economic growth is concerned we are largely at the mercy of external forces. It is what is happening in Europe and in the outside world that determines our growth rate.</P>
    <P>Let no one be surprised at this.  It is not just this small island that is facing forces beyond its control.  A grim feature of this meeting was that the heads of the Government of the states in the Community were quite clear that their countries&mdash;some with economies 30 to 40 times larger than ours&mdash;could not control their own future development either and indeed that the Community as a whole, acting together, with all the power of a wealthy economic unit of 260 million people, could not without the support of other great economic powers notably the United States and Japan, control its economic destiny.  The present recession may perhaps be in the control of the major industrialised nations, if they all act together, promptly and intelligently. It is not within the compass of anything less than such a concentration of policy by these great economic powers to set the world economy on its course again.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland have to face this reality.  There is no tap of economic growth that we can turn on.  We must not delude ourselves that such action is open to us, when it is not even open to the Community to which we belong. At the same time the task of fighting unemployment, especially in an economy such as ours, is made more difficult by the surrender to the Community, in the interest of common <Col N="2375" /> policies and common rules, of power to implement appropriate measures.  The blunt fact is that the reduced capacity of individual Governments to protect their people's jobs and living standards has not yet been counterbalanced by a growing capacity on the part of the Community to make good this deficiency. We have failed to marshal the enormous economic resources of the Community in an effective way.  I may say, however, that I took some comfort from the fact that the possibility of action as outlined by the Commission is contemplated over the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I do not say these things or take this attitude to imply that there is nothing we here in this country should or can do.  What we can do, and must do, is to face&mdash;all of us&mdash;the grim reality of economic decline and the threat of worse ahead.  We must not delude ourselves that now our economy can grow or our living standards rise.  Indeed, in the light of the situation now facing us, and Europe and the world, our aim of maintaining the living standards of our people is obviously at risk.  There can be no improvement in living standards for some while the economy as a whole is showing a decline.  There simply are not enough resources available here or elsewhere in the Community to give everyone what they enjoyed in the recent past.  Our problem is no longer how to distribute increased wealth but how to spread the reduced resources available to us, as to our neighbours, so as to minimise hardship.  In these circumstances, no group in our society can secure additional resources for itself over and above the increases in remuneration designed to keep pace with the cost of living without imposing hardship on others, either through pushing up prices further or by putting other people out of work.</P>
    <P>In seeking to minimise hardship in this grave situation we in Ireland have sought to proceed through consultations with the major groups representing the social partners in our country. I am glad to be able to tell you that this process is about to be paralleled <Col N="2376" /> at a Community level.  Yesterday morning the President of the European Council, Signor Moro, and the President of the Commission, Monsieur Ortoli, met representatives of the European trade unions.  When the President of the Council reported to us on his constructive talks with the European trade union leaders, we agreed&mdash;and I strongly supported this initiative&mdash;that a tripartite conference should be held after the summer break between the Council of Ministers of Finance and Social Affairs and the representatives of trade unions and management in the Community. Joint discussions of these problems by these councils is, of course, something which the Ministers for Finance and Labour in our own Government have been seeking to secure during the past six months of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>I went to the meeting of heads of Government convinced of the seriousness of the recession which at present faces us.  At the meeting, I heard the German Federal Chancellor, the French President and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, among others, give their view of the prospects for their countries, which together account for a substantial part of the trade of the entire world.  Their view confirmed what I and the other Ministers have been saying.  The present recession is not confined to one country. No one country alone can fight its way out of it.  But if any country, particularly a small country with a comparatively underdeveloped economy, like ours, takes the wrong measures, or if interests within it from greed or ignorance of the true position fail to make the contribution now which is necessary for the wellbeing of all, then indeed the future will be as bleak for many more as the past has been for some.</P>
    <P>That is the principal lesson that we have to draw from this European Council, from which I and my colleagues have returned to our respective countries in a mood of realism&mdash; a mood which I must share with this House, and, through it, with all the people of the country.</P>

      <P>I should like to <Col N="2377" /> thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive statement of the outcome of the Brussels meeting this week of heads of State and Government of members of the European Economic Community. His message has been a depressing one, but I would like to insist that we should not at this stage of depression lose our confidence or our faith in the ultimate viability of the Community itself or of the ideal that the Community has set before it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has outlined the practical necessity for co-operation between member countries of the European Community itself, between the Community and such countries as the United States and Japan, and indeed with the United Nations as a whole.  Without in any way absolving the Government of their responsibility in the present grave situation, I think this situation calls for an active, positive and practical patriotism on the part of all of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean all of us.  We are far too prone to attribute our difficulties, our vicissitudes, to somebody else, and far too prone to rely on somebody else, either individually or collectively, to solve the problems to be faced.  The solution is not the other fellow's problem.  Therefore, at this juncture we must all be moderate in our demands and in our expectations. Not only must we be moderate but we must all be prepared, again individually and collectively, to make sacrifices to ensure that our economy here overcomes this present recession to ensure that we can protect the jobs of our people and not only to maintain our standard of living but to improve it as far as we can.</P>
      <P>While reserving the right, as we must, as an Opposition to be critical of the Government at all times, I would like to give the Government the assurance that we in Fianna Fáil will support all reasonable measures to ensure the economic stability that I refer to, to ensure not only that we will maintain that stability but that we will increase our economic growth in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2378" /> I did not have time to study the Taoiseach's statement in any detail.  I got a copy of it just before the Taoiseach entered the House.  There are aspects of it on which I would like to comment in more detail in the future &mdash;for example, the need for an early decision on the part of the member countries to have a system of direct elections to the Community.  I think we all appreciate here that for those Members of this House and of the Seanad who are also members of the European Parliament, it is an almost impossible burden for them to bear.  I hope the day will be speeded when we can have direct elections to the European Community.</P>
    <P>However, I think the message is, difficult though the situation is, that we must maintain our interest and our confidence in the ultimate ideals of the European Economic Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to an incident at Shannon Airport which became the subject of a High Court injunction later when an individual who could only be described as an air pirate came into the airport, picked up a load of calves and vamoosed without any airport clearance and returned <Col N="2379" /> again under very questionable circumstances a few days afterwards.</P>
      <P>The reason for this seems to be that there is a flaw in our existing legislation or regulations governing operators who come in to pick up cargo and go out again.  What is required is that the equivalent licensing standards that apply to Irish aircraft and carriers should apply to foreign operators flying into any of our airports to pick up business.  This should be ensured even if new legislation is necessary. Air operators' certificates are demanded in all west European countries, including the UK.  It seems an operator can buy a plane in the United States and pick up business here without being certified or without being required to be up to the airworthy standards of our own airlines and of those in other European countries.  I understand the certificate used is known as a Par. 91 certificate and, from the court case, it appears it is accepted here.  It is essential that we take the necessary measures to prevent this because this is done by other operators who may have larger planes it will be to the detriment of the national carriers who are required to comply with the necessary standards in European countries.  This certificate is not acceptable in European countries and the proof of this is that the individual concerned is now behind bars in Italy.  I would ask the Minister to take the necessary steps to eliminate such actions because of the serious consequences it would have for our national airlines and our own operators. They are entitled to this protection.</P>
      <P>It appears Aer Lingus gave some commitment that they would provide an evening service to Shannon Airport; I think it was given to the Irish Travel Agents' Association.  Those of us who travel from Shannon to Dublin know that the morning service is good but there is no evening service.  The last plane leaves shortly after mid-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because airport authorities are involved I assumed this would be a matter for them.  I would ask the Minister to consider the possibility of routing the Dublin-Cork service via Shannon.  This may not be entirely acceptable to the Cork people but an evening service that could serve Shannon would be an asset and I think it would pay the company to undertake the service.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Gas Company are to receive £750,000.  I hope this will lead to the increased use of gas as a cheaper form of energy.  An increase in the use of gas would be of benefit to people from Dublin and Cork because it would lead to a cheaper form of energy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope it will benefit gas users and take some of them away from the ESB.  At the moment the latter appear to have the dearest form of energy.  In the Supplementary Estimate there is mention of the £58,000 recouped from Eurocontrol. We discussed this recently and we still believe we should have gone ahead with our commitments to Eurocontrol from 1st January, 1976.  This would have led to more attractive and better paid employment for our control tower operators when working for Eurocontrol.  As the Minister stated, we are working as agents for that organisation but unfortunately the air traffic control operators are not getting paid according to European standards.  They would be paid according to European standards if we were taken over by Eurocontrol as originally intended.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be short.  In his speech the Minister spoke about the value for money for the consumer and taxpayer.  In this context I will refer to the direct and indirect contributions of the unfortunate citizens of Dublin to the bus services.  Deputy Barrett inferred that perhaps with regard to subsidy they were enjoying some advantage over the people in rural Ireland.  If that is so in the matter of service, all I can say is God help the people in rural Ireland.  I have made it my business to use Dublin buses.  The frustration and annoyance, the feeling of hopelessness and vexation that pass through the mind of the intending passenger is beyond limit.</P>
      <P>I am prepared to excuse CIE to the extent they have grown out of all reasonable proportion.  They are suffering from what the economist would describe as the &ldquo;diseconomy of economies&rdquo;. That is poor consolation to the taxpayer and the intending user finds himself or herself waiting up to 20 minutes for a bus which, according to the CIE timetable should arrive at a certain time but invariably does not arrive at that time and when a bus arrives there will be two or three other buses in attendance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As one who has spent some time teaching and who was a civil servant and who has spent a fairly active life I must say that the only time I could not resist complaining about the people who manage any service were the occasions on which I complained to CIE about something that I had seen, not that had been reported to me. I have seen double-decker buses, with two or three passengers aboard passing a bus stop at which intending passengers were waiting and I have reported that matter to the gentleman in charge of the service and received a very courteous reply.  He would not deign to deny the charge that I was making but he would present an excuse and say that having examined the situation he was satisfied that the driver had not <Col N="2382" /> seen the passengers or that there was something wrong with the bus or something wrong with a passenger that required that the bus should not stop. I have had grave suspicions whether or not the reason given was the real reason.</P>
    <P>The Minister may ask what is the real reason.  I do not want it to go from this House that I am critical of the men who work on buses in CIE. I am critical of the whole institution that now and for some years past has not been giving the people who are paying so dearly, directly and indirectly, the service to which they are entitled.  Any observant person can see people standing at bus queues with neck and head strained waiting for long-expected buses.  The intending passenger waits with neck and head strained for the bus that is to take him to his employment or to some other destination or for the bus that is to take him home in the evening.  The bus does not arrive at the specified time.</P>
    <P>I know that there are difficulties, that there are human factors and human problems.  I would excuse the crews of the buses and the management of CIE if this were to happen occasionally.  I am not relying on rumour.  I have sufficient experience to be able to accept the complaints I get daily about buses being late and about buses not following the prescribed route and about buses remaining at the terminus for a much longer period than is indicated in the timetable.</P>
    <P>We have all seen convoys of double-decker buses carrying between them perhaps six passengers.  The Taoiseach spoke about the grim and grave situation there is in the country. Naturally, we are concerned about the position in other European countries. My concern is for this country and, as a politician, for the area I represent. I am concerned about getting value for money.  I realise that there are valley periods in any transport service but I cannot understand why there should be double-decker buses, in which there is huge capital investment, acting, as it were, as chauffeurdriven vehicles for one or two passengers while at other times which are important to people going to and from <Col N="2383" /> work there is a never-ending wait for the service.  Experts in CIE will say that you cannot have a perfect service which can be sustained throughout the day, that if you require vehicles to carry passengers at peak times there must be buses not fully employed the rest of the time.  It certainly is not economical.</P>
    <P>There are luxurious double-decker buses with only two or three passengers engaged in what is called an express service.  I live on the Navan Road.  A bus passes by daily which has the name &ldquo;Donegal Express&rdquo; or some other &ldquo;Express&rdquo;.  It is very rarely that I see more than four people in them.  CIE will say that they have to supply the service but I should like to know what research took place before a decision was taken to provide an express service on a route where there may be only six passengers.  At 6.30 p.m. on Fridays the buses going to this destination have full complements of passengers but more often than not the buses are more empty than full.  I compare that with other transport systems I have seen in other European countries. It cannot be sustained and cannot possibly represent value for money.</P>
    <P>It may be contended that the men must have shift work.  If our backs are to the wall and if Deputies are prepared in times of emergency to accept a change of timetable in respect of attendance in the House, I do not see why other people cannot do the same, especially having regard to the shocking position that exists and the economic decline to which the Taoiseach has referred.  There must be economies.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether or not it would be better to have decentralisation of the transport service.  Certainly, decentralisation would remove some of the anonymity that obtains with regard to CIE.  The Finglas area is an area of high population density. There could be a local bus service there so that people would know who the man in charge was and could talk to him and there could be consultation between the management and the local people as to the service which <Col N="2384" /> would best serve them.  Whether that would bring about the desired improvement, I do not know.  I do not see how it can be shown that economically the best way to serve the people in Cabra is by a bus with one destination in Cabra and the other on the far side of the city.  It is inevitable that one cannot maintain a bus schedule as long as one takes double-decker buses through the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>I do not know what considerations operate when settling these matters. The people for whom I speak would be happy if they could be guaranteed a service which would take them from the perimeter to within, say, a quarter of a mile of O'Connell Street.  As things stand, they are often in the perimeter areas waiting anything from half an hour to an hour for transport to the city.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a sum of £26 million for CIE.  I know all this money is not being spent in Dublin but the expenditure for Dublin constitutes a major element.  The Minister may say that CIE have social and other commitments and are not governed solely by what are described as economic considerations, but that does not excuse them from exercising all possible economies.  In my view they are not doing that.  If, having examined the situation, CIE insist that for the money they are getting they cannot produce a better service for the people of, say, Finglas or Glasnevin, then I, for one, say the sooner we end the present situation the better. We could establish a localised bus service for the people in those areas.</P>
    <P>On another occasion I might discuss the development of the rail service from the city out, but I realise that this is not the time to do it. Therefore, I am confining my remarks to the bus service, as it affects the people in my area.  Perhaps I receive more complaints from my area than others but I am speaking for what might be regarded as working-class areas.  I appreciate that we are all working class, but some of us think the form of work we do is superior to that done by others and do not describe the areas in which we live as working class.  I am concerned <Col N="2385" /> about the people who should enjoy that title, but who apparently are obliged to suffer from it.  The service which CIE are giving in Dublin working class areas is not what it should be.  The people there are paying dearly for it.  There is no question of charity involved.  Passengers look on it as an achievement if they succeed in getting a bus.  The service should be there for them and supplied in accordance with the timetable issued.  These timetables should be based on proper surveys which have been carried out and which will reflect the time when the needs of the people require to be satisfied.</P>
    <P>I am departing from my resolution that I would confine myself to this one point but I would like to speak about the need for economy by every person and every institution.  I would also like to refer to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta.  There is land around Dublin Airport which is not being used to its full potential.  Not alone have we land in the immediate area of the airport, but as one goes out the Boot Inn road to the left there is a large area of land.  Occasionally somebody goes in and might take silage.  I have visited other airports but have never seen anything to equal the amount of land which is lying useless around Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>When talking in terms of a £26 million subsidy to CIE, the matter to which I refer might seem insignificant, but as they say in Connemara &ldquo;Bailíonn brobh beart&rdquo;, pennies make pounds, and pounds make millions. The situation at Dublin Airport could and should be looked at.  That unproductive agricultural land, without any danger to the excellent service being provided by Aer Lingus, could be put to worthwhile advantage.</P>
    <P>When teaching we were always advised that, having made the point we should repeat it again and again.  I know the conditions obtaining in a classroom are not acceptable under Standing Orders but I would ask the Chair to bear with me while I make a final appeal to the Minister.  For the sake of the unfortunate people in Dublin, will he take a personal interest in what is happening in the service <Col N="2386" /> which is not being provided for the people who are paying so dearly for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this supplementary estimate, which is now before the House.  Like the previous speaker I would like to speak on CIE.  There are four main factors as to why the additional subvention of £9.5 million is required for CIE.  The first factor is that CIE charges are not matching their costs.  We are all well aware that the charges are not matching the costs.  If they were CIE would be at a wonderful break-even figure and at the same time manage to provide a social service.  The second factor which necessitates the House passing this money is, as the Minister said, a decline in freight carrying.  Specific mention is made of the reduced use of fertiliser.  I have seen Arklow fertiliser rail head extremely busy.  I have seen the pleasant sight of wagon loads of the commodity available for transportation to the home market and abroad.  If you will be slightly liberal with me on this point I would like to state that it is a pity that some form of subsidisation was not introduced on fertiliser.  This would have made it possible for farmers to spread fertiliser.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly shall but the Minister referred to the decline in freight carrying.  If there was an increase in freight carrying CIE losses would not have been as great as they are and perhaps a subvention of £9.5 million would not have been required.  I feel I am in order in referring to that because the Minister specifically referred to it.  If there <Col N="2387" /> was the normal use of fertiliser transport would have been required for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that a further factor adding to CIE difficulties in the present year was a decline in business due to the effect on rail and road freight of a reduced usage of fertiliser and limestone.  Am I not in order?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not develop the point in respect of the industry with which he is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that and I shall not.  Once I have clarified the position I shall not do so.  We could also refer to cement being less in demand.  I shall not make the obvious comment lest I be ruled out of order.  I know I am dealing with an intelligent audience and I need not elaborate any further.  The fourth factor is the general adverse economic trends.  Is the Minister in a position to report any progress on the CIE scheme to modernise and adapt the rolling stock?  This House allowed CIE to obtain a loan from the European Bank of between £6 and £8 million towards this.  Has there been much advancement since then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is necessary, as the Minister stated, in order that CIE may reach a break-even figure, or perhaps at some time in the future reach a stage where taxpayers will not have to dig <Col N="2388" /> very deeply into their pockets to provide support for that organisation, to implement productivity and cost reduction schemes.  A productivity scheme might be adaptation in regard to the rolling stock.</P>
    <P>How far advanced is the prospect of one-man buses for the general Dublin area?  The Minister should enter discussions with CIE so that the famous ten-journey ticket can become interchangeable for rail and road.  There was a lot of talk about it when it was introduced and it was confined to seven days but later this restriction was lifted.  Could there be a further change and have it interchangeable between rail and road? What are the prospects of a late night service to the suburbs of our cities?  Is there a social need for this?  Have CIE considered the system of a round city fare, such as is available in many European cities?  This might come hand in hand with the one-man buses. Have they considered the economics of it?  Will such a system be introduced or has it been ruled out?</P>
    <P>Bray is a town with many housing estates developed on the perimeter. There have been just demands from people in those areas for a round town service.  I know the Minister will not be able to refer specifically to one town but perhaps at a later date he might be able to let me have details of this.  Those are just ideas which come to my mind.  I know the Minister's concern that a cost production scheme be introduced.</P>
    <P>There is a subsidy of £750,000 being provided for town gas.  I welcome this.  I estimated it would be much higher.  When the Minister for Finance mentioned this idea I asked if this subsidy could possibly be extended to bottled gas.  The economics of the situation must have been worked out and the Minister and his Department must know the amount of bottled gas used so he must have costings.  What would be the cost of such a scheme?  Many people long for a subsidy on bottled gas so that they will be parallel with the somewhat more fortunate people who are linked to a town gas system.</P>
    <P>The subsidy on electricity and gas <Col N="2389" /> will be a great help to those who reside in houses which are dependent for heating and cooking on gas and electricity, houses which have no open fireplaces.  It is long overdue.  I am aware of homes within a 15-mile radius of Dublin where no lighting or heating is being used, not because of the unavailability of supply but because the economics of the household mean the householders cannot afford to use these.  These are not luxuries.  They are basic necessities.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the personnel of the ESB in Bray.  They have been most helpful.  They have come up with schemes to enable people to pay so much off arrears.  I have brought many people to their offices to negotiate for them.  Unfortunately many of these people have now lost their jobs and the reduction in the income coming into the household has meant that they were unable to continue the planned payments and arrears have again mounted up.  This subsidy will be welcomed by these people.</P>
    <P>I shall not detain the House any longer.  I know the Minister's time is limited.  The debate is scheduled to conclude at 17 minutes past three o'clock and that gives the Minister some 23 minutes.  I trust he will reply to the points made on this side of the House.  Unlike the previous speaker, I shall not recap because I am sure the points made are still fresh in the Minister's mind.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his liberal attitude towards me in a matter of fertilisers. This is a matter which impinges heavily on many of my constituents.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for their contributions. The necessity for increasing the subvention to CIE is regrettable. Because of the Government's tactics designed to reduce the CPI and get a consequential winding down in the spiral of inflation there is another element of subsidy for CIE in that. The removal of VAT from fuel, except road fuels, will also have an effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bulk of my opening speech was devoted to CIE.  As I said, <Col N="2390" /> because of inflation and the slowing down of economic activity, CIE are facing very severe problems.  It is worth bearing in mind that the subvention to CIE in 1969-1970 was only one-eight of what we are being asked to provide this year.  That was five years ago and in that five year period, the subvention necessary to keep CIE in operation has multiplied by eight.  It is a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>CIE is a very complex organisation covering virtually the whole country in some form or another, covering sparsely populated areas where there are problems because the number of people to be carried and the quantity of goods to be transported do not make for economic rates.  In Dublin congestion has made their activities uneconomic in the bus sector.  I was interested in what Deputy Barrett said.  It is a point I made myself when introducing the Supplementary Estimate last December.  I am glad he agrees with it and sees some merit in following it up.  I am referring to the effect of this bulk subvention every year on the morale of CIE, with no conditions attached, beyond saying: &ldquo;You are a millstone around the necks of the taxpayers and we wish you would dry up and go away.&rdquo;  Of course, that is not a true picture at all.</P>
    <P>A national transport system is essential.  CIE provide jobs for 20,000 people which makes it one of the biggest single employers.  It would be a mammoth task to examine into every activity and say to them that we want them to provide services, as they provide school transport services, and the State will pay them so much to provide them.  That is what is done with free travel for certain categories. The Department of Social Welfare go to CIE and tell them they are issuing so many free passes and that they will pay them for carrying these people free.  If CIE could be broken down into different locations and paid in this way that would be much healthier for me, as Minister, and for the House because people would see precisely what CIE were getting from fare paying passengers and precisely what was being paid by the State to maintain <Col N="2391" /> routes which were not economic, or to carry people the State did not want to see paying fares.  This is a mammoth task.  It can be done reasonably easily for broad categories like old age pensioners and school transport for children because the numbers are known, the distances are known, and you can identify the categories.</P>
    <P>When you come down to individual bus or train routes the costing of what the State should pay for them becomes a detailed exercise which involves long negotiations.  I should like to see the State moving in that direction in its relationship with CIE.  This would not be treated as a subvention. It would be treated as income. People would pay bus fares at a level which would have to be determined by the National Prices Commission.  If the State wishes to maintain bus fares at a certain level, as we are doing in this case by subsidising fares, the State would tell CIE they were being given money to maintain fares at a certain level for a certain period of time.  The sum total of what CIE would get from fares and from the State would be identified by the board as part of their fare structure rather than as a subvention. This would have a very good effect on the morale of CIE employees They would feel they were being paid to do a job rather than being treated, as they are at the moment by many people, as parasites on the community.  That is totally untrue.</P>
    <P>I understand Deputy Tunney's irritation and the irritation of his constituents when they stand at a bus stop and the bus does not come, or when it comes, there are two more behind it all only one-third full.  CIE operate completely in the open and every little fault they have is obvious to everyone.  The blame for these delays cannot be laid entirely at the door of the management or the personnel of CIE.  Recently the board told me that, during the petrol companies' lorry drivers' strike when cars were off the road, buses in Dublin were running ahead of time.  They had to slow them down so that if they were due to reach <Col N="2392" /> a bus stop at 7.17 p.m. they would not arrive at 7.13 p.m. or 7.14 p.m. This would disrupt the whole run.</P>
    <P>At that time the buses in Dublin city were running at a profit.  First, they could maintain their schedules. Secondly, there was a disinclination to use private transport because of a fear of not being able to get petrol.  Thirdly, that disinclination to use private transport put more people on the buses. When the buses ran efficiently and on time more people were inclined to use them.  This was a Catch 22 situation. The worse the traffic gets in Dublin the less the ability of CIE to maintain timetables.  If there were less traffic, CIE would be more efficient and more people would be inclined to use them. Because they are inefficient more people are inclined to use their own private transport, thereby making CIE lose time on routes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney raised a number of points of interest.  He talked about what could be described as U routing for buses rather than straight routing. Deputy Murphy also made a number of suggestions about how CIE could operate more efficiently.  I have taken a note of all these suggestions and I will discuss them with CIE.  Deputy Murphy was also concerned about the one man buses in Dublin.  Negotiations with the unions have been going on for a number of years but a solution to this problem seems to draw nearer and then recede into the distance.  I have no doubt it will be solved.  It should be solved in consultation with the unions rather than that CIE should attempt to impose it.  The only way it can be introduced is in co-operation with the unions because, if CIE decided to impose it on the personnel it would not be operated.</P>
    <P>The railways are a particular problem. Deputy Barrett said they should be able to stand in their own right. I do not think we will ever see that day.  The State will have to resign itself to subsidising the railways.  The runs are too short and the capital investment is too high.  There is a level of acceptability of the rate the public will pay for transportation by railway.  The number of personnel needed to operate a train is far <Col N="2393" /> greater than to operate a bus.  The buses also use facilities paid for by the ratepayers.  They use the streets and the pavements.  The buses drive on public roads maintained by the local authority.  Railways have to provide and man their own stocking points.  They have to provide and maintain their own iron roads out of revenue.  This adds considerably to the expense of operating railways.  Of the subvention we are voting today, £19½ million is going to the railways. Obviously there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked was the CIE rail plan going ahead or had it been shelved.  It has not been shelved.  It is going ahead.  This plan involves a considerable capital injection into the railway operations of CIE, for the modernisation of rolling stock, the mechanisation of handling equipment, automatic signalling, and so on, which will make the operations of the freight side of the railways much more efficient and will, we hope, attract traffic back to the railways which has been lost because of efficient competition from hauliers. Down through the years a lot of traffic has tended to go off the railways and on to the private hauliers.  If the railways can be run more efficiently we might win back that traffic.</P>
    <P>We have all seen sundries being loaded in single items into an open railway carriage.  This is very slow and involves a number of men.  The rate at which goods trains travel between two points is very much slower than passenger trains.  If we can group sundries in an area and put them in a container on a fork-lift truck, and stop the train for ten minutes and load 20 containers, obviously that is a much more economic and profitable operation than what has been happening up to now where the train has to stop for two or three hours while items are loaded on individually.</P>
    <P>Without having scientific knowledge to back it, I would be willing to say that customers would pay a premium for service.  People who want goods transported would prefer to pay a little more and get the goods <Col N="2394" /> quickly and on time rather than having to wait an extra two days for a slightly smaller price.  When CIE have this fully in operation it will make a dramatic and beneficial difference to the operation of the CIE freight section.  If it attracts the carriage of more goods off the road it will mean a saving of the roadways. If it does that it will be of benefit to the country and CIE.  Our primary concern is CIE at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett referred to the fact that there was no subsidy for long distance fares but there is a subsidy for long distance bus fares.  There is no subsidy for long distance rail fares. Except in special circumstances, I do not agree with subsidisation at all but these are special circumstances and special remedies had to be proposed. The object of introducing the subsidies on the wide range of goods was because of the effect it would have on the CPI.  Long distance rail travel is not weighted in the CPI but bus travel is.  That is the reason why the differential is there between the two.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett also referred to the recent injunction taken out against me in the High Court by the operator of a plane at Shannon.  I will not comment on that because the injunction is temporary and the matter is <i>sub judice</i> at present.  The injunction will last until 28th July when the matter will come up again.  I am willing to tell Deputy Barrett privately about the matter if he wishes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett welcomed the subsidy on gas and another Deputy made the point about the more efficient use of gas as a method of cooking.  This is true and it will boost the sales of gas.  Deputy Barrett was under the impression that only Dublin and Cork would be getting this but nine different places will get it: Waterford, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Enniscorthy, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford and Clonmel.  There are town gas companies in these areas and they will be receiving the subsidy.  The subsidy is not being extended to bottled gas because there are so many different outlets for bottled gas that we found it impossible to see them all and to <Col N="2395" /> ensure that the subsidy was being passed back to the consumer, which was the object of the whole exercise. There has been a subsidy inasmuch as VAT has been removed from bottled gas, town gas and electricity, and this will be of some benefit to those who live in areas where they cannot get town gas and are dependant on bottled gas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made a number of good points about CIE and their operation in Dublin City.  I am not sure how practical some of his points are but some of them seemed so obvious that CIE must have thought of them.  However, I will take up all the points made by Deputies Tunney and Murphy with CIE and I will make CIE's comments on them known to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the under-utilisation of land at Dublin Airport.  This is primarily a matter for Aer Rianta and I will take it up with them.  However, I can see some difficulty from the point of view of safety for the flying of aircraft.  In <Col N="2396" /> the interests of security it is a necessity not to have people at an airport misrepresenting themselves as workers for a person to whom the land is leased to grow potatoes.  These matters may influence Aer Rianta in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will take up the points about individual items with CIE.  I should like to thank the House for the great interest taken in CIE.  On any occasion I came to the House in the last twoand-a-half years I was encouraged by the enthusiasm for CIE shown by Deputies.  I can understand the frustration of Deputies at having to vote fairly regularly considerable sums of money for CIE but I am always encouraged by the understanding they all showed for the real problems CIE have.  I am also encouraged by the appreciation of Members of the necessary, significant and worthwhile part CIE play in our economy.</P>
    <P>Vote put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.15 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 22nd July, 1975.</P>
