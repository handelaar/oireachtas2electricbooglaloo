      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £737,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st December, 1975 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of certain services administered by that Office, including a Grant-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take the Supplementary Estimates on the Votes for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate on the Foreign Affairs Vote is required mainly to meet additional expenditure arising on subhead A, Salaries, and on subhead B, Travel and Incidental Expenses. <Col N="356" /> There is a further small sum required to cater for the repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens abroad but this is offset to a large extent by a corresponding increase in receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid due to the repayment of repatriation and maintenance advances.</P>
    <P>In the Vote for International Co-operation the original provision under subhead A for the 1975 mandatory contributions to international organisations proved inadequate, based as it was at the time of preparation of these Estimates on best available information rather than upon the actual assessments levied by these organisations. It is also necessary to provide a small additional sum under subhead B as a contribution to one of the United Nations voluntary agencies to meet a pledge made in dollars for which the sterling provision is now inadequate. Provision is made also in the Supplementary Estimate for some additional funds for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, Subhead C, and for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, subhead F.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the subheads of the two Votes for which additional funds are required.</P>
    <P>There is one recurring element which has had a serious effect upon both Votes in the current year and for which no advance provision was possible.  This is the continued fall in the value of our pound against non-sterling currencies.  A considerable portion of the expenditure of my Department&mdash;perhaps two-thirds&mdash;is spent abroad in a wide range of currencies which have appreciated in value against sterling during the course of the year.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide additional funds now simply to maintain activities at the level already budgeted for by the Dáil.  While devaluation has been a major factor, there have been others of a general kind such as increased costs of services abroad and an increase in activities which were unforeseen at the time the original estimates were made.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required for salaries under subhead A of the Vote for Foreign Affairs, £310,000, includes <Col N="357" /> the amount of £140,000 to cater for Civil Service pay increases awarded under the national wage agreement and not provided for in the original Estimate.  The remaining £170,000 is, for the most part, required to compensate for the effects of devaluation and for pay increases to local staff abroad.</P>
    <P>The additional sum required under subhead B, £440,000, to meet travel, communications and other expenses involved in running missions abroad was partially occasioned by devaluation and increases in transport and communication costs.  There was, however, a further element involved which increased substantially the level of expenditure required under this subhead.  The level of activity demanded of my Department during the current year has been considerably heavier than was anticipated.  A number of developments have contributed significantly to this.  One was that the work&mdash;and travel&mdash;connected with the Irish Presidency of the European Community Council of Ministers was much greater even than had been expected.  Moreover, there has been an increase in the frequency of meetings in the context of European Political Co-operation deriving from the decisions of the Paris Summit in December, 1974, one example of which is that meetings at Heads of Government level now take place three times a year&mdash;the next one being held in Rome next week. This more than compensated for reduced travel costs during the six months when EPC activity was concentrated in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The oil crisis has also produced much international activity and has given rise to many meetings in the wider field of energy and raw materials.  These events affect deeply the European Community in general and have required us, for example, to participate actively in meetings concerned with the preparations for the Producer-Consumer Conference on Energy and Raw Materials.  The extent of meetings for this purpose and also meetings connected with the developing Euro-Arab dialogue was not foreseen or provided for in the <Col N="358" /> initial travel and related expenses provisions of the Estimate.  Another development during the year was the need to maintain a delegation to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which continued to meet in Geneva until July, some five months longer than anticipated.  It will be recalled that because of the Irish Presidency of the European Community during the first half of the year the responsibility of chairing co-ordination meetings in the context of such conferences as the CSCE meant that my Department were obliged to maintain a level of presence at such meetings adequate to perform this task.  In other circumstances it might have been possible to envisage a reduction in the level of our attendance but this could not be done this year without abdicating responsibilities as a full participant in the co-ordinating processes of European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>In the Vote for International Co-operation the following are the details of the increased provisions needed.</P>
    <P>In the case of subhead A where provision is made for contributions towards the running expenses of international organisations of which Ireland is a member, we have little option but to pay the amounts levied as these contributions are mandatory. The assessments on us are made in the currencies of the area in which the headquarters of the international organisations concerned are located. Devaluation has, therefore, had a major effect upon the subhead.</P>
    <P>There has been also a significant development in regard to our contribution to the United Nations the extent of which was unforeseen at the time the Estimates were prepared.  We must now provide in our contribution to the United Nations in 1975 for Ireland's share of the expenses of maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East. The amount of this assessment is approximately £75,000 for the period ended 31st October, 1975 and has only recently been communicated to us.  I need not stress the essential nature of contributing to the United Nations <Col N="359" /> effort to ensure that the tenuous peace established in this area is maintained and extended in the interests not only of the countries of that region but of all countries and particularly the countries of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, also mention that the increase in our contribution to the Council of Europe has been affected by the requirement that we provide an additional £10,000 approximately in the current year for a new headquarters building in Strasbourg. When it is opened next year this new building will provide facilities for the meetings of the Council of Europe and of the European Parliament when it sits in Strasbourg.  These new facilities together with the office accommodation to be provided in the new building should contribute to the efficient running of both the Council of Europe and of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>In subhead C of this Vote an additional sum of £15,000 is being provided for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  APSO has demonstrated since its formation less than two years ago that it has the ability and capacity to contribute in a most important way to assisting the countries of the Third World.  This has been due in no small measure to the generous and wholehearted support which it has received from the voluntary agencies associated with it and from the contribution of personal service made by many private citizens with skills and professions which are essential to the development of many developing regions.  The additional provision requested will enable APSO to maintain the planned level of its activity during 1975 which otherwise because of increased costs and the effects of devaluation would have to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the extended meetings of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe which occasioned increases in the travel and communication subhead of the Vote for Foreign Affairs.  There is in this connection a consequential <Col N="360" /> increased provision to be met in subhead F of the Vote for International Co-operation of £15,000 which together with the initial provision of £5,000 represents Ireland's contribution towards the expenses of the extended conference.</P>
    <P>In seeking approval for the foregoing additional expenditures under the two Votes, I have explored every possibility of reducing expenditure without reducing the effectiveness of our representation abroad which is, by any standard, a modest one.  A number of steps have been taken in my Department during this year which have the effect of keeping Departmental expenditure tightly controlled. Nevertheless, it has not been possible to reduce expenditure without also reducing the effectiveness of our representation abroad.  I am convinced that we will need to maintain this effective representation and, indeed, to develop it in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>On the International Co-operation Vote there have been some savings which have partially&mdash;but only partially&mdash;offset the additional expenditure incurred for the reasons stated above.  These savings arise from the fact that the sum provided for disaster relief was not fully required during the year in question, and also because the bilateral aid project has developed slightly more slowly than had been originally foreseen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that this Supplementary Estimate has to be passed urgently and, therefore, I am very glad to agree to have it passed as quickly as possible.  However, I should make some comments on the background to this urgency and also on the reason for introducing a Supplementary Estimate of this nature at this time.  The Minister outlined the continuing expansion of our activities in Foreign Affairs and seems to attribute the need for this Supplementary Estimate to a very considerable extent to the increasing costs arising from our Presidency of the European Community, to the extension of a conference on security in Helsinki and also the meetings of the <Col N="361" /> Council of Ministers of the Community.</P>
      <P>It is also fair to say that a very considerable amount in relation to salaries and expenses within his own Department should have been anticipated by the Minister and his Department. I would like to refer to some aspects of this which I believe are an indictment of the book-keeping which the Minister has implemented in his Department.  If this were to extend itself throughout all the Departments of State, it is not surprising that the Government find themselves in such a critical position at the moment.  I will refer to some clear examples of this which should have been anticipated because it is not today nor yesterday that devaluation became a problem for sterling and for us as a consequence. Neither is it today nor yesterday that air travel and increasing air fares have become the pattern in international communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to one instance of what I feel can only be an appalling miscalculation of the Estimates for the expenses of this Department. Under the subhead which relates to travelling and incidental expenses the original Estimate for this year was £660,000.  Today we will pass a Supplementary Estimate for £440,000, that is an increase of two thirds on the original Estimate passed by this House.  This is miscalculation on the part of the Minister in originally presenting the Estimates to the Department of Finance on which the business of his Department was to operate. It is not enough to say in relation to that that the activities of the Minister and his Department due to the Presidency of the Council of the European Community to a very considerable extent explains this problem because we knew well in advance that we would assume this responsibility. Calculations should have been made in the original Estimate to take account of the responsibilities which accrued to us as President of the European Community and also take account of the various conferences to which the Minister referred and which were then under way.  I refer particularly to the Energy Conference, <Col N="362" /> the Helsinki Conference and any others the Minister referred to.</P>
    <P>Account should have been taken of those conferences when the Estimates were being prepared.  The Minister said in relation to the increased expenditure for travelling and incidental expenses that £150,000 is due to devaluation. The devaluation was already well under way when the original Estimate was introduced.  The Minister's responsibility and that of his Department, and consequently the responsibility of the Government, is to make their calculations on the basis of the knowledge they have of current international monetary trends and also to present their bills and Estimates in the light of the extent to which those trends will continue.  The trends that were there when this Estimate was introduced have continued at the same pace.  They may have increased somewhat against the pound but not to the point that explains this additional demand we have today.</P>
    <P>There must be a very bad lack of communication between the Minister's office and that of his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power.  I am indebted to the Minister for the information, which he has not referred to in his opening address, that up to £40,000 of the amount in the subhead for travelling and incidental expenses is due to increased air fares.  I should like to know what the total cost of air fares will be in relation to his Department's activities.  The negotiations in respect of applications for increased air fares were well under way when this Estimate was originally introduced.  Had the Minister had consultations with the Minister for Transport and Power and been informed of the IATA negotiations in this area he would have known, and could have taken into account, that he could expect air fares to increase to the extent that we are now being asked to sanction.</P>
    <P>It is possible that the Government may be having a rethink.  In the great flourish before the last election the then Opposition, Fine Gael, looked at what they considered to be a vulnerable Fianna Fáil position and presented to the public the purchase of a jet on behalf of the Government as a flashy <Col N="363" /> gesture.  The jet was to be purchased for travel to and from the European Community.  Unfortunately, the public responded to that bait; they thought the politicians intended making life comfortable for themselves at their expense. It is understandable that the public responded in that way but the then Opposition committed themselves to repealing that decision on taking office.  I do not think they did much book-keeping before coming to the decision not to purchase the jet.</P>
    <P>We had the inevitable public response to what seemed to be a responsible and disciplined decision on the part of the Coalition Government but I wonder now that they have done their book-keeping and that we are being asked to sanction this Supplementary Estimate for this Department &mdash;we should remember that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance are also involved in extensive travel throughout Europe&mdash;if the Government would indicate if the decision not to purchase the jet was justified. Would the Government care to compare the cost of running such a jet against the increased cost we are being asked to sanction in this Supplementary Estimate as we will be asked in every other area of the Government?</P>
    <P>It is another indication of the price the nation pays for hastily conceived commitments which were not based on any calculation but on an impression of what public reaction would be to that commitment.  In the meantime we have paid the price.  We have not just paid the price in terms of money but the Minister is the personification of the fact that we paid the price in terms of energy and in terms of dignity. It must be said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been projecting a great impression of Ireland's concern&mdash;and I accept that as a genuine projection&mdash;in the course of his Presidency of the European Community. His activity, energy and zeal have done a lot to win respect for us internationally and have won respect for the European Community.  In <Col N="364" /> terms of zeal, activity and concern the Minister has been effective and has brought a certain amount of pride and status to us.</P>
    <P>At the same time, one also must look for the positive results of all this activity, zeal and public concern.  I am afraid the practical results in any of a number of cases do not measure up to the public impression of the activity that has been created.  In relation to travel and travelling expenses, I believe it should not happen that a Minister of this Government, attending a conference or a Council of the European Community, should have to rely on transport of a commercial organisation by way of facility.  Is that the way we conduct our business internationally? If we have to show ourselves to the European Community as a nation that cannot guarantee and ensure that through our own arrangements, by plane or otherwise, we can attend, as they attend, at these conferences it is a poor reflection on us, particularly when, as the Minister will recall on his visit to Italy, we had to accept the offer of a private individual engaged in private enterprise here.  I am not always too hung up on status but this nation cannot tolerate a position of that nature; the nation cannot tolerate a position whereby we, in a casual way, accept such an offer.  It may be suggested that it was a measure of humility or practical approach but we are the only nation who hitch a lift to any of these meetings in the private aircraft of commercial entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>This must not be done because the Government, above all else, must appear to be at all times totally independent in the discharge of their duties and obligations of any direct commercial favour much less direct commercial influence.  I am not suggesting the Government would be influenced but the Minister should tell the House if this should be allowed to happen.  I know this arose as a matter of urgency but the Minister should tell us if he intends to ensure that this will not happen in future.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> ... A number of developments have contributed significantly to this. One was that the work&mdash;and travel &mdash;connected with the Irish Presidency of the European Community Council of Ministers was much greater even than had been expected. Moreover, there has been an increase in the frequency of meetings in the context of European Political Co-operation deriving from the decisions of the Paris Summit in December, 1974...</P>
    <P>If the amount of work and travel was greater than expected, the Minister should tell us what was expected.  To what extent was the work and travel greater because of our control of the Presidency of the European Community? The Minister was President for this period and to what extent could he have ensured that the work and travel would not have been that much greater than expected?  We were told that it was the Minister who was arranging the meetings additional to those normally held and if he is to suggest that the activities of the European Community and the Council during our Presidency were more intense than previously he can hardly complain that it cost more than we anticipated. We were presenting ourselves as the agents and the driving force behind that increased activity.  Either we were the driving force or we were not.  If we were then, at least as the driver, we should know how much the petrol would cost.</P>
    <P>The Minister, and his Department, as the ones in control, should and must be held responsible for this huge increase of 66 per cent in travelling and incidental expenses.  How much of those expenses arising out of our obligations during the Presidency of the Community will be recouped?  I believe a considerable proportion of these expenses will be recouped to us and on that basis it is not enough for the Minister to make a bland statement to the effect that the activities connected with the Council were greater than expected.  The Minister should tell us the full story; he should tell us how much of the expense in that capacity will be recouped.  We can <Col N="366" /> then consider to what extent the Minister's request this morning is justified.  Otherwise we are doing it with blinkers and I am blinkered to that extent this morning.  The Minister's brief and passing reference to this does not tell the full story.  Far from it.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the rest of the story in detail from the Minister in his reply.  Of course this Estimate is urgent.  It must be passed today so that the hardworking officials of the Department will be paid their salaries. I have the greatest respect for these officials and their diligence and contributions during the time of our EEC Presidency were very much appreciated at home and abroad.  They should be guaranteed their salaries. Like any business, the Department's book-keeping should be worked out reasonably accurately in advance and salaries are an important part of a company's expenses.</P>
    <P>Our private industries compete with low cost countries and experience great difficulties so far as the importation of raw materials is concerned. The Minister is not in competition with any other country and is using devaluation as his excuse.  This Government have been asking private industries to pull in their belts, to make their estimates and keep to them.  They have also asked workers to ensure that there will not be extra money needed.  If the smallest business in Ireland were to run its affairs as this Department have done, they would be bankrupt long ago and Fóir Teoranta would have written them off as being beyond redemption.</P>
    <P>This Minister has a reputation as an international diplomat and an economic consultant and expert.  I have respect for experts but they should ensure that their advice will result in practical effects.  If the expert cannot advise himself, it is a poor day for the rest of the country.  If the managing director of a company, with a turn-over of the order of this Department, were to go to his board during the year and say that because of international conditions and increased costs of energy and so forth, he now <Col N="367" /> wants an additional sum of £700,000, and an increase of two thirds for travelling expenses, the board would very soon tell him: &ldquo;Sorry, you may have created a great impression of activity and you may have done a lot of work, but, unfortunately, our resources cannot cover your activities. Either we have to change our programme or you will have to go to a new job&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that the Minister go to a new job but it is not enough to tell us that because of the extra activity this additional money is needed.  We must have regard to our responsibilities to our public.  On the one hand, we cannot seek praise for our work internationally and, on the other hand say that this is the cause of our economic problems.  I hope the Government and the Minister will take this problem seriously.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have been asking industries and workers to pull in their belts and help us get over these economic problems. Yet this Department are asking for an increase of 66 per cent.  One should practise what one preaches. The public are beginning to realise that this is a characteristic of this Government.  The projection is, and was, very colourful, and if I may say, very effective, but the performance and book-keeping is of sub-primary school standard.  The public are keeping a very close watch on Government expenditure at all times.</P>
    <P>Has there been any change of policy in the Department on racialism and particularly apartheid?  I have a good reason for asking this.  The Minister has been known to be an opponent of the oppressed and of racialism in all its forms.  His public image is that he is very concerned in all these areas.  But when the official decisions of our Government are in conflict with the Minister's personal image, we must ask what degree of control is there in the Department over decisions taken and votes registered at the United Nations.  We must also ask if this represents a change of view on the part of the Minister.  If it does not, was he aware of what was <Col N="368" /> being done in his name, and if so, have the matter clarified.</P>
    <P>I refer particularly to the two resolutions which came before the last session of the United Nations.  One of these resolutions was on Rhodesia and was strongly critical of the United Kingdom Government for failing to measure up to their responsibilities in that area.  It also called on that Government to take firm initiatives to ensure that the racialist regime of Rhodesia would be subject to sanctions, so that the policies of the Smith regime would be changed to bring it into line with what we profess to want.</P>
    <P>The year before last Ireland abstained on this resolution which is presented almost every year to the UN General Assembly, but at the last session for some reason Ireland voted against the resolution which simply called on the British Government to fulfil their responsibilities in relation to Rhodesia and censured them for failing to take the initiative they had said they would do.  We, being conditioned in this by our desire &ldquo;not to exacerbate the relationship with the British Government&rdquo;&mdash;the quotes are from the Minister&mdash;voted against the resolution.</P>
    <P>If our stance on international interest in human dignity and freedom is to be conditioned by our concern not to offend Britain&mdash;I hope we can at all times ensure, through co-operation and harmony, mutual benefits for both countries&mdash;if we are to be conditioned by the fact that any vote of censure on Britain would upset these delicate relationships, our foreign policy will be completely compromised, especially considering the fact that the emerging nations of Africa have always looked to us with respect.  How can we use that respect to good advantage both in terms of our own contribution to world peace and of the example we can give to these countries and the confidence they can place in us if we turn our face against the very oppression we so very often preach against?  If we fail to do this, no soft words at home can get us away from the fact that we cannot give one image at home of being liberal and freedom-loving and <Col N="369" /> take the very opposite stance where it counts most, in the UN General Assembly.</P>
    <P>But that is not the end of it.  There are two other areas and the next is probably the worst.  It relates to the omnibus resolution that comes up every year in the General Assembly on apartheid.  From time to time when Fianna Fáil were in Government we voted almost consistently for this resolution of censure and to recognise the legitimacy of the struggle of black South Africans to try to ensure their emergence to freedom and human dignity.  One might say the worst that might have happened was that while we were in Government we on occasions voted for reservations and once or twice we may have abstained because of the nature of the reservations.</P>
    <P>However, at the 29th Session of the General Assembly, the Irish representative, on behalf of our Government, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, who I believe personally supported it, voted differently.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, I might point out, was a sponsor of the Irish Anti-Apartheid body but when he became Minister he properly withdrew from that position.  On his instructions, our representative at the United Nations voted against a resolution asking for sanctions against South Africa, recognising the legitimacy of the struggle against apartheid.  Oil was a particular issue in this: there are the oil resources of South Africa.  The oppressed black people of Africa would have felt that we would have been on their side in their case for freedom and human dignity.  The attitude of the Irish Government on this occasion indicated either a terrible change of policy inconsistent with the stance taken at home by the Minister or that there is lack of control and direction within the Department of Foreign Affairs and that the Minister is not aware of what is being done in his name or has not been consulted about what is being done in his name.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  No votes can be cast on our behalf in the UN without the man who represents us <Col N="370" /> being aware of them.  If it happens that he was not aware of the action taken on this occasion it is an indication, as we have found in the Department of Finance, that there is a lack of control, of direction and of overall supervision, and the consequences for the African people could be very serious indeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat what I have stated before, that I believe Ireland has a particular role in the area of foreign affairs, not just because of action by any one man, though that is very important, but because of the respect we command among these nations probably deriving from our experience in common in emerging from colonial oppression.  That places a special obligation on us and gives us a special opportunity to ensure that newly emerging African nations can come into the full family of nations in dignity and in peace and without mistrust for the policies and the actions of the great powers with whom we associate. Surely we must at all times be jealous of that position and ensure that no action of ours will undermine our potential in this field.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion, I referred to some practical ways in which we can work to ensure that the African nations can play a full role in the community of nations.  I do not intend to do that on a Supplementary Estimate, but might I say before I leave this subject that I hope the Minister will indicate the instructions, if any, that are given to our representatives in the various UN committees?  What instructions do they seek from him or the Department before casting votes in these committees, because the results of the deliberations of such committees may be seen in the General Assembly resolutions?</P>
    <P>I might say I fully support the stance taken by the Minister and the Government on the resolution on Zionism.  It is an unfortunate development in the UN that some powers who may feel aggrieved because of the Israeli position are trying to associate Zionism with a different and more invidious animal, racism.  Whatever be the justification for the stance of either side, I support the Minister's stance. Whatever about the justification for the <Col N="371" /> stance of either side on the Middle East, it is regrettable that the Arab states and those who supported them on this can say they should not use the United Nations as an agency of associating what is obviously a problem with what are much more invidious problems, apartheid and racism.  Unfortunately the consequences of this have been that the United States in particular has almost threatened withdrawal from the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I agree that the resolution was not worthy of support and should be fiercely opposed but, in the final analysis, the very existence of the United Nations is the only guarantee we have that world order and peace can be maintained.  It is no stronger than the sum of the contributions the individual members are prepared to make.  Obviously the United Nations as a body cannot impose anything other than the consensus of its members will allow.  To that extent it is restrained, checked and limited in what it can do.  However, it has some significant achievements to its name and for a major power such as the United States to threaten that it will withdraw from the only international forum of nations because some members present resolutions that others find totally out of spirit is a very wrong stance.  The only guarantee we have that the world powers who are in competition with each other can communicate and consult is through the existence of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There has recently been the case of Angola and this will not be the last former colony that will come to independence.  I suggest to the Minister that some procedural machinery should emerge in advance at the United Nations and there should be some consultation with the world powers to guarantee that former colonies emerging into independence will not be made the flashpoints of international tension, particularly between the great powers.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Americans to say that the USSR is infiltrating into Angola&mdash;that may be&mdash;nor for the USSR to say the US is infiltrating into Angola&mdash;and that may be.  Quite <Col N="372" /> frankly, what the world generally would like to see is that neither of them should involve themselves in the problems of a newly emerging country. This has happened so often in all the flashpoints of the world and we, as a small nation, should say to the US and the USSR that we are tired of their propaganda against each other. We should tell them we are tired of being told it is all white on one side and all black on the other side and that we are tired particularly that both of them use the problems of small nations, especially where they emerge into freedom, to ensure their security around the world.</P>
    <P>I know this may be rather simplistic. I realise there may be groups in a newly emerging nation who will turn to one or other of the major powers to guarantee and secure their supremacy in that nation.  However, there must be some agreement&mdash;and I think the United Nations can take a firm initiative here&mdash;and some sanctions to guarantee that there will be no response from the major powers to any such request.  We have had enough of Korea, Vietnam, the Congo and now Angola.  Those major powers who present themselves as the guardians of the peace to those who look to them as such guardians are, to a considerable extent, the agents of violence, terror and death.  The less we see of their involvement in the merging countries the better we would like it and the world would be a better place.  Ireland could propose at the United Nations that a watch be kept on the potential flashpoints of the world and to guarantee by sanctions that these powers would not be able to meddle to the point of causing almost inevitable death and destruction in the country concerned and dreadful problems and tensions in the world generally</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the conference on energy.  Many of us have noted what might be called the Minister's idealistic stance in relation to our responsibilities particularly in the EEC and I should like to support this to the extent that one can practically support it.  However, on occasions one has to look at the practical consequences <Col N="373" /> of high-minded stances.  With regard to the United Kingdom seeking a separate seat at the energy conference, the Minister's stance, which was widely promoted and projected, may not have been quite as much in our interest from the practical point of view as would otherwise appear.  It is fine to proclaim oneself as a convinced European&mdash;all of us are&mdash;but the evidence is that the major European nations have not shown the political will nor have they introduced the political agency through which all of us may be better Europeans.  Until such time as that will emerges we are being a little naïve to play the role now that we would wish to play then.</P>
    <P>Britain has looked to its interests when it seemed right for it to do so and France has done the same.  There have been many clear examples of this.  Germany has done so even to the extent of doing something which I deplore, namely, the export of arms to South Africa which I take it is inconsistent with the stance of the EEC. Whenever it has suited them the major powers in the Community have taken action to suit their national interest.  The British Government have a fair tradition of looking after the national interest and, on this occasion, they have sought a separate seat at the conference.  Like the good European he is known to be, our Minister publicly criticised them for this request and suggested that it was undermining the solidarity of the Community.  That may be but I hazard a guess that Britain will have a separate seat.  Sometimes we should wonder whether the outcome will measure up to our hopes and, to the extent that it does not measure up, we make ourselves seem ineffective when our criticism is totally ignored and people continue to do what they wish.</P>
    <P>The reason Britain is seeking a separate seat at the conference is that she has major oil fields off her coast. We have criticised Britain very strongly and have said it is not consistent with Community membership. I do not know if the Minister consulted with the Government before reacting as he did.  In this morning's papers we read that further licences <Col N="374" /> are being granted for exploration work, up to £300 million worth, in connection with energy off our coast. Has it occurred to the Minister to consider what our position might be if our expectations in relation to oil, energy and gas are realised?  In criticising Britain so openly, do we not to a considerable extent compromise a position we may wish to take ourselves later, or are we so committed to the European idea that we, who are an undeveloped economy in terms of the Community, are prepared to forego our national advantage for the sake of notional European solidarity? I do not want anything I have said to be taken as being against European solidarity but there is no point in our being boy scouts before the troop has been formed.</P>
    <P>We have been acting the boy scout a bit in Europe and have been proclaiming our European commitment but others, while proclaiming their European commitment in one sense, are well able to look after the national interest as well.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister would like to indicate whether or not he is satisfied that his criticism of Britain's request for separate representation would not compromise us in any event if the occasion arises for us and whether or not his criticism was the outcome of Government consultations, more particularly with the Minister for Industry and Commerce who would be the man concerned in this area, because I do not think it is enough to have <i>ad hoc</i> reactions from the Minister&mdash;I am not suggesting that this was such but somehow it smacks a little of it&mdash;<i>ad hoc</i> reactions on a matter that may be of such vital consequence for us.</P>
    <P>I referred to statements of our position publicly and to the discrepancy between our public projection and the subsequent performance.  It is fine to create an impression of activity; it is fine to create an impression of influence; it is fine to convey an impression that we can dictate at the Councils of the European Community to the French, Germans or otherwise and when we do that have it spread across the pages of our newspapers here and <Col N="375" /> elsewhere.  That is fine for the moment but when the Germans, the French and all that afterwards totally ignore what we say then, of course, one wonders what the purpose is and what the final outcome may be in relation to the stances we take initially.</P>
    <P>There are many examples and the energy conference may just be one. The Minister, I think, actually said in the House that he was glad to be able to play a very effective role at the Washington Conference in reconciling the differences between the parties there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>My recollection may be wrong there.  The Minister may take issue with me on this.

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>An inferiority complex?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not an inferiority complex.  Far from it.  It is the very opposite.  It is a little bit of knowing the effective way of conducting international relations.  If we project ourselves as being something more than we are, the outcome is often a lot less than we would wish for.  I will be asking what in fact the outcome in various areas has been.  I say briefly&mdash;it has to be brief&mdash;we all recall so often the stance of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One example is the regional fund when it was being established in the European Community and the way we were castigating the British publicly and persuading the French, Italians, Germans publicly and the way we told the Press&mdash;and it is on the record of the newspapers of this country&mdash;how often we were bringing them around to our position.  We were <Col N="376" /> doing all of this.  If this is an inferiority complex the Minister can let me know.  At the end of it all what happened? We did all of the public persuasion. We projected ourselves as having done this, that and the other thing, and what do we get?  We get a lot less than we would have got, possibly, if we had done none of this public projection of our activities.  We got a miserable pittance which was not in accordance with our right or entitlement and not in accordance with the expectations of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Who, then, won the diplomatic battle?  Our Minister who spoke publicly and loudly of how he was bringing everyone around to his position or those countries who just kept their thoughts and their ideas to themselves and in the final analysis showed that in the field of hard negotiation sometimes actions are a lot more effective than words?  By speaking so loudly and prominently and publicly&mdash;even <i>The Kerryman</i> could give an example of the Minister&mdash;if you proclaim your position too freely, you undermine the possibilities of doing something effective. That is one area where we now have to our credit £6 million in this year from a fund which, by any standards one cares to apply, just does not measure up.  If you go back over the papers two years ago you would swear that it was £60 million that we would have because of our Minister in the Council of the European Community.  Between promise and performance there is a huge gap which to a considerable extent tells the story of this Administration's activities in Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>We come to the recent conference of the Six in Rambouillet.  The Minister was heard in advance to criticise this as being against European solidarity. So, Ireland's voice was heard. We would not accept and we rejected the motion that this conference of the six major powers should take place on world economy.  It was suggested that we should be there and the Community as such should be represented there.  What happened?  We said our piece and perhaps satisfied ourselves that we had spoken to the world and to the major powers and to that <Col N="377" /> extent, perhaps, satisfied our ego.  The Minister may suggest that I have an inferiority complex&mdash;I would hope not.  I am not going to suggest that the Minister has an inflated ego. Maybe somewhere between the two of us there is a balance.  The reality is that as in the vexed question of the regional fund the Rambouillet Conference went ahead exactly as planned despite all our proclamations.  I am simply saying that we might as well recognise that there comes a point when public proclamations of that nature are not the most effective.</P>
    <P>It might have been better&mdash;it must have been better, because the outcome this way has not been very much to our advantage&mdash;if the Minister clearly, personally and effectively had consulted with the various Ministers of the Community such as the United Kingdom, French or German Ministers and said: &ldquo;This is not the best thing in our common interest.  I am not going to make a public noise about it but let us see if there is some way whereby we can ensure that we will be there in an observer capacity or something&rdquo;. I would warn that at least the prospects of our interest in the final outcome being protected in those circumstances would be at least as good as what has happened in the event, where we made all the noise but got nothing in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>I may turn to another aspect.  I have questions down in regard to certain areas arising out of the announcement of cross-Border projects.  In September, 1973, at Baldonnel, between the British Prime Minister and our Taoiseach agreement was reached on the development of cross-Border projects in principle.  On numerous occasions in the House&mdash;I will quote the dates&mdash;I asked the Minister for progress reports in these various areas&mdash;on 7th November, 1974, 5th February, 1975, 9th July, 1975.  I think I can fairly summarise it &mdash;I will quote from the record if necessary&mdash;that I was requesting immediate action from the Minister.  I asked the Minister at column 1319 of the Official Report of 7th November, 1974, by way of a supplementary question:</P>
    <P>Can the Minister indicate what has <Col N="378" /> been the basis of the reluctance of the British Government to undertake this joint obligation?  Is there any good reason for it?</P>
    <P>because the Minister told me there was a reluctance on the part of the British, and the reply I got to that was:</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: I do not think I am in a position to answer that authoritatively.  If the Deputy can persuade a colleague in the British Parliament to put down a question there he is more likely to get an answer on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister was, in other words, telling me he did not know why the British Government were refusing to join in cross-Border applications of the nature we were proposing.  That is there on the record.  I said: &ldquo;I can see no reason whatever for it and I would like more information on it&rdquo; and the Minister replied &ldquo;I am not necessarily disagreeing with the Deputy on that&rdquo;. That indicates that it was because of a reluctance on the part of the British Government&mdash;they would not join us in an application and particularly because of disagreement as to the nature of it&mdash;no progress was being made.  The matter rested there until 5th February, 1975.  The Ceann Comhairle is aware that one cannot repeat a question until a certain period of time has elapsed. On 5th February I asked the Minister the date on which our Government formally requested the British Government to make a joint application&mdash;I was anxious to tie it down to precise dates&mdash;and what proposals, if any, were made in each request and the response in each case.  The Minister's reply was to refer me to his reply of 7th November, 1974:</P>
    <P>As I told him then, agreement in principle was reached on a joint approach to the Commission on the financing of cross-Border studies during the meeting of the Taoiseach with the British Prime Minister Mr. Health at Baldonnel in September, 1973.  The agreement was reiterated at subsequent meetings with Mr. Health on 18th November, 1973 and with Mr. Wilson on 21st November, 1974.  The matter remains under discussion at official <Col N="379" /> level with a view to reaching agreement on the terms of reference proposed by us for a joint approach to the commission.</P>
    <P>Time is needed to reconcile certain differences in approach between the British Government and ourselves.  I can say at this stage, however, that we are and have been for more than a year ready and willing to go ahead on an approach to the Commission.</P>
    <P>This was a year and a half after the agreement in principle was reached.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the Official Report of 5th February last, column 1717, Volume 277. Note, the Minister said: &ldquo;time is needed to reconcile certain differences in approach between the British Government and ourselves.&rdquo;  The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>I can say at this stage, however, that we are and have been for more than a year ready and willing to go ahead on an approach to the Commission.</P>
      <P>Again, the implication is that the British Government were not willing. The Minister nods his head.  At column 1718 the Minister said in relation to the differences between the two Governments:</P>
      <P>It is our concern that the proposals to be submitted to the Commission should be broadly based which would review the situation with regard to the economic development of the border areas, both the north-west and the north-east, the latter having been suggested at one point by the British Government. Our concern is to secure agreement on that and I would prefer to keep discussing with a view to securing such agreement than to have a more narrowly based circle which would be less useful and less satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There the Minister is telling us that our concern was with both the north-west and the north-east and he would prefer to wait and get that instead of <Col N="380" /> the &ldquo;more narrowly based circle which would be less useful and less satisfactory&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsequently I attended a parliamentary conference at Westminster at which members of the Government parties were present.  I asked some representatives of the British Foreign Office, the equivalent of our Department of Foreign Affairs, why they were reluctant and what their objection was and how could they justify their opposition and I was told by the Foreign Office officials that that was not in fact the position.  I was told that the difference between our Government and the British Government was merely as to the extent of the proposals and they specifically said they had made proposals in relation to fisheries and in relation to certain other projects.  On 9th July, 1975, at column 1117 of Volume 283 of the Official Report I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ldquo;if he will now urge the British Government to submit joint applications to the European Community for the promotion of cross-Border projects&rdquo; and the Minister's reply was:</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in the way of an agreement between the Irish and British Governments on the precise terms for such an application. I have adverted to these in response to previous questions.  The Government attaches considerable importance to the question and will continue to pursue it as appropriate.  I have recently been in contact with the NI Secretary of State and further discussions will take place shortly in an effort to overcome the difficulties to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Some further discussion ensued and I had better, I think, quote in full:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: I take it the Minister will accept that, in reply to the previous question to which he referred, he indicated to me the fact that the British Government refused to join in joint applications with our Government.  The Minister will accept that.  Does he accept it?</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: Let us be clear.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: The Minister will recall, when I asked about this, <Col N="381" /> telling me I should have a question put down in Westminster to ascertain why.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: I do not recall saying that.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: It is on the record.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: If the Deputy says I did say that then I am sure it must be true.  In spite of the diffculties relating to the carrying out of a general survey of the area, the Government regard this as a necessary preliminary to a more detailed approach in relation to the projects.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: On a recent parliamentary delegation to West-minister I, among others, was informed by representatives of the Foreign Office that they had, in fact, suggested to our Government specific cross-Border projects and that our Government, for one reason or another, found these were not appropriate.  Can the Minister explain to me why he informed me previously that the British Government had refused to join in applications for cross-Border assistance?</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: Because what I said on that occasion was true. What was originally proposed in 1973 was a survey of the north-western regions with a view to establishing forms of joint action desirable to improve the economy of the area which has, objectively speaking, been disrupted by the existence of the Border.  Subsequently, on the British side, there was a suggestion that a similar survey should be carried out in the north-eastern part of the area, which we thought was a good idea. However, those proposals did not make progress.  There have been proposals from the British side for specific detailed projects as a replacement for the general surveys which were agreed to at Baldonnel and confirmed subsequently and which we regarded as an essential preliminary.  It was these general surveys for the north-western projects, and subsequently the British <Col N="382" /> Government agreed for the north-east, which held up agreement.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: In fact, there have been proposals from the British Government for specific projects.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: Yes.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: May I ask the Minister why it was on previous occasions he did not so indicate to me?</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: They are not projects.  They are specific surveys. They do not involve doing something to develop the region.  They are studies of particular problems which we would regard as an inadequate and inappropriate replacement for a general survey.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: Would the Minister be precise?</P>
    <P>Here the Chair intervened and later I said:</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy: The record is there.  Was there not, for instance, a specific proposal for the development of fisheries in the Donegal and Derry areas?</P>
    <P>An Ceann Comhairle: The matter may not be debated now.</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald: A proposal for a study of the possibilities of doing that and also a study of possible development of the port of Derry the Government regarded as inappropriate and inadequate substitutes for a general survey of the north-west, and the Government have therefore pursued the original proposal, which had been agreed to by the British Government in 1973 and again in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave no indication of the position and it was not until I went on a deputation to Westminster that I became aware that proposals had been made.  This news was contrary to any impression given by the Minister.  If, a few weeks after my question in November, 1974 the British Government made proposals, why did the Minister not tell me that in February, 1975?  He knew that this was one of the issues concerned particularly when in November, 1974 he had suggested to me that I put a query to the British Parliament in order to ascertain what was their objection. The least I would have expected from the Minister then was the full story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the proposals were announced.  We read in the papers that after lengthy discussions at official level over the past few months and almost two years after the idea was first discussed by the Taoiseach and <Col N="384" /> the then British Prime Minister at Baldonnel, the Governments of Ireland and Britain had agreed to make a joint application to the European Community for financial support to undertake cross-Border studies in communications and fisheries.  We were told that what has now been agreed is a study in transport communications in Counties Donegal and Derry and a survey of the sea fishing potential along the east coast stretching from Rosslare in the south to Glenarm in the north.</P>
    <P>The Minister may tell us precisely what has been agreed but in this House in July last the Minister told us that he wanted detailed studies for the north-west, the south and the north-east and that this was the reason for the delay.  What was involved was a broad comprehensive study but now we are told that the British Government made proposals in November, 1974.  The Minister must recognise that the proposals are not anything like what he said and does not justify the delay.  There is nothing in the proposals that have been announced to justify their long being called a comprehensive study of the whole cross-Border region.</P>
    <P>We must note the difference between the final outcome and the promised performance.  In regard to matters of this kind it would be better if we had less of the imputation that the British Government are dragging their feet publicly.  By no standard can the outcome be regarded as being in accordance with our wishes and requests.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to another area which has caused some confusion recently in our foreign policy position. I refer to our attitude in relation to the execution of the Basques during the last days of the Franco regime.  There were two areas in which the EEC through their Council of Ministers seemed to act with some degree of solidarity on this question.  One was the termination of trade talks with Spain and the other was the recalling of ambassadors from that country.  I have questions down on this matter but, unfortunately, the Minister has not been present on the days they were due to be taken and, rather than receive the replies from any other Minister, I <Col N="385" /> decided to postpone them.  However, I take the opportunity of raising them now in the hope that the Minister will let me have the answer when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>Apparently, we agreed to cut off trade talks with Spain.  At least, if we did not so agree there was no public statement to indicate our disagreement. On the other hand, we did not act in conjunction with the other member states in relation to recalling ambassadors. It is clear that in each case we did the wrong thing and attempted afterwards to justify publicly our compounded mistake.</P>
    <P>At the time this situation arose it was realised that Franco's life was limited.  I am not saying that in any spirit of personal vindictiveness.  He was a man who was a major figure not only in the history of his own country but in European history.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister and, through him, the Community whether it is the case that the Community negotiate in trade only with those countries whose regimes they accept totally as being in accordance with the best standards of human dignity and freedom?  Is trade the criteria by which the Community impose their views and standards on the countries with which they associate through trade?  Obviously it is not.  The Minister will agree that the Community both as a group and as individual nations have trade associations with many countries, with South Africa, Rhodesia, the USSR and many others in respect of which much criticisms have been made by individual countries within the Community as to the limitations on personal freedoms and even in regard to the deprivation of life.  In this context we might mention the US in so far as its involvement with Chile is concerned.  The Community were prepared to continue their trade negotiations with all these countries and even to extend them but in the case of Spain, they became so holy that, as a gesture of their abhorrence, they cut off trade talks.  The Spanish people were the ones to suffer as a result of that action.  Are we then to regard trade associations as being a guarantee of our total respect of the <Col N="386" /> country with which we have these associations?  I have never known trade to be such a criteria.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to hear from the Minister as to whether, when the proposal in relation to Spain was raised at the Council of Ministers, he suggested that this was not the proper course to take.  Did he remind them that they should not terminate trade talks since they had trading arrangements with other regimes with whom by comparison Spain might be called a haven of peace and liberty?  Did the Minister disagree with that proposal? If not why not?  Why did he not express our view as being contrary to that particular position in relation to the trade talks?  All we know is that the European Community, and our Minister among them, decided to cut off the trade talks.  I think they did the wrong thing for the wrong reasons.  Particularly because of the associations they have with many other repressive regimes why single out Spain?  When we took our own initiative in relation to that event, as distinct from other members of the European Community, we took the most extraordinary initiative.  Not only did we attempt to justify it but we attempted to criticise the stance of the United States Government and others in an attempt to conceal the blunder we made.</P>
    <P>We, of all the countries of the European Community, did not withdraw our Ambassador.  How many of the Ambassadors recalled went back to Spain before the death of Franco and how many more will go back in a matter of weeks?  If a formal protest was what was called for, which would not penalise the people of Spain as cutting off the trade talks did, we did the other thing.  When the others were making the formal protest we set ourselves apart and we did not recall our Ambassador.  If we wanted to express our independence and integrity and be consistent we could have done it in relation to the trade talks and let our voice be heard.  We wanted to be clearly seen not to be influenced by the overall view but we picked the wrong issue. What was even more disquieting and <Col N="387" /> more confusing was to hear the Minister not only attempting to justify the mistake we made but to confuse the issues even more by introducing criticism of the United States policy towards Spain.</P>
    <P>I want to give some indication of the total universal reaction to the executions and projected executions as outlined in the Paris edition of the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, Tuesday, September 30th, 1975.  The calls came from all over the world for diplomatic isolation of Spain at that time. Mexico withdrew her representative. The <i>Herald Tribune</i> of that date stated:</P>
    <P>Twelve European countries have recalled their ambassadors &ldquo;for consultations&rdquo;, a manoeuvre falling short of diplomatic rupture but intended to show displeasure.  They were Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, Denmark, West Germany, East Germany, Italy, Sweden, Portugal, Switzerland, Norway and France.  The papal nuncio to Spain returned to the Vatican and met with Pope Paul VI but the Vatican refrained from saying that he had been recalled.  Spain brought home its ambassador to the Vatican after the Pope declared publicly that his pleas for clemency had been spurned. Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky told a meeting of labour unions today he would ask his Government tomorrow to approve the recall of the Austrian ambassador to Spain.</P>
    <P>The Portuguese, needless to say, took no action.  We all know the Paris reaction.</P>

      <P>Recently we had a discussion on the problems of the Third World and the Government's responsibilities in that area.  While it is included in the Supplementary Estimate today it would not be appropriate to go back over that ground again.  The last point I want to refer to is what one might call the Creegan affair, about which I expect Deputy Tunney will be able to go into greater detail.  While I was on a visit to the USSR the Minister issued a statement to the newspapers, the effect of which was that he was in consultation with me in relation to the Creegan affair. The only understanding any member of the public reading that statement could get was that the Minister was in consultation with me in relation to this over a period.  Deputy Tunney is <Col N="389" /> concerned with broader aspects of this matter.  I want to deal with one particular aspect.  The Minister made his statement on the 1st October, 1975. The statement said:</P>
      <P>The attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been drawn to recent media comment on the case of Mr. James Creegan, who is imprisoned in Mons, Belgium, on suspicion of security offences at a NATO base in Belgium.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs wishes to emphasise the following points.</P>
      <P>He spoke about the continued personal interest he had taken in it.  The end of his statement said:</P>
      <P>On the Minister's instructions every effort has been made to facilitate visits by relatives, friends and a Member of Dáil Éireann representing the constituency in which Mr. Creegan's parents reside.</P>
      <P>Later on it stated:</P>
      <P>The Minister has also been in touch on this matter with the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Michael O'Kennedy.</P>
      <P>That is capable of conveying one impression to the public who read it, which is that Mr. O'Kennedy was kept informed on this matter by the Minister.</P>
      <P>The date on which I became aware of this statement, and this was the only communication I had from the Minister apart from the unsatisfactory ones in this House, was the day after the statement was published.  When I explain the reasons why, the Minister will understand.  I was on a visit to the Soviet Union at the time.  After a stay in Moscow I went to a city 2,000 miles away in Siberia, Novosibirsk. On my return from that city I was informed that there was an urgent message for me from the Minister at the Irish Embassy.  A representative from the Embassy gave me the message which included this statement and a note for my information.  I asked the representative what my reaction was expected to be and he informed me that I was given the material for information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I looked over the statement <Col N="390" /> that evening I noticed the portion at the end which stated that the Minister had been in touch about this matter with the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs.  I came to the conclusion that it was capable of a different interpretation and I inquired from the Embassy when the statement would be published.  It was my intention to suggest that that note be amended to say that a copy of the statement was being sent to the Opposition spokesman but I was told that the statement had already been published.  The Minister knew I was in the Soviet Union although the Minister wrote to me at my home address in connection with this matter.  The Minister was not in communication with me and the impression created in the statement that I was kept informed was wrong.  Deputy Tunney kept me informed at all times of the discussions he was having and everything he did I supported 100 per cent. We agreed that it was appropriate that he, being the Deputy from the area, should pursue the matter. When we jointly pursued it in the House we got an unsatisfactory response.</P>

      <P>The practice of bringing in so many Supplementary Estimates is making a farce of our budgetary system.  The budget to be presented in January will be unreal because it will bear little relevance to the real financial situation.  I know <Col N="391" /> the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot be blamed because many outside elements influence this but the Minister should take a tight grip on things and try to give us a reasonable estimate.  No one begrudges the money to the Department but one must insist that the book-keeping is examined so that we are presented with more realistic estimates of what is required during a financial year.</P>
      <P>On the increase in the cost of travel, I recall a suggestion made by the Fianna Fáil Government that a jet should be purchased for taking the Minister, and his staff, to European destinations.  This was laughed at and described by the Opposition spokesman as an example of squandermania.  That spokesman accused us of having our heads in the clouds and not having our feet on the ground financially as regards Estimates.  However, it transpires that it might have been a good investment in the interests of economy and efficiency.  The Minister should give us his views on this and indicate if there are any reasons why we should not purchase the jet in the hope of cutting back on some of the costs.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the Minister can justify every penny spent in his Department and if that money is spent on peace-keeping exercises or on the promotion of our trade with other countries we will not begrudge him it. However, the fact that some Estimates are so far out causes concern about the whole approach of the financial section of the Government. This may be reflected in the attitude of business concerns and local authorities; they may not take their budgets seriously and follow the example of the Government.  I am not accusing the officials of the Minister's Department of incompetence because many of the things are outside their control but there could be a tidyingup in the preparation of estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for the expenditure of money on the maintenance of the UN Force in the Middle East.  This is essential and anything that contributes to world <Col N="392" /> peace will be supported by us.  Did the Minister ever reconsider the possibility of asking the UN to take more cognisance of the tragedy in our country?  After six years of turmoil, violence and slaughter in the north-east of our country it would be fresh thinking if we went to the UN to see if they could do anything to bring an end to those terrible tragedies.  It has boiled over in recent years and people here have lost their lives.  While we are aware of our commitment to world peace, and while some of our efforts in regard to the Third World are commendable, because our eyes have seen on far horizons we are not always as conscious of our duty to our own people.</P>
    <P>When I say &ldquo;our own people&rdquo; in referring to the North, I mean them all, of every creed or none, in every class and every section of that very class-conscious society.  These people have suffered and we grieve with them when we read in the newspapers or hear on the radio of people killed and maimed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister at the United Nations or in contact with them might well direct attention to the fact that people who do worry about the North feel that perhaps we will be able to do something for them through this organisation and while I am on that point, to show our goodwill in voting moneys to the help of the Third World, he might also consider whether we could, even on the basis of a token Estimate, put it forward that we are prepared to join in <Col N="393" /> an international fund, or even a national fund, as a token of our sincerity with the sufferings of our people in the North, that we would be willing to see some fund started to ensure some contribution for people crippled and maimed.</P>
      <P>Today in the papers one sees an announcement regarding the issue of licences for exploration in our coastal waters.  Would the Minister tell us what he has done about Rockall?  Has this dispute with the United Kingdom been settled?  I cannot recall the exact outcome, if any, on the last occasion on which it was raised but it takes on added importance now against the background of the possible development of our resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are moving away from the headings of the Supplementary Estimate.  This would be more appropriate to the Estimate itself rather than a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been mentioned but I will not pursue it.  The Minister might find time to give us an idea of what the present position is regarding Rockall.</P>
      <P>Somebody wrote to me recently and pointed out that in many parts of the world where Irish ships may trade we have no consular or diplomatic representation. This is understandable because we cannot have an Embassy in every country but perhaps the Minister would give us some idea of what the crew of an Irish vessel in any kind of trouble in a foreign country do for diplomatic or consular help.  Have we any arrangements with European or world powers to help in this situation, if and when help is needed?  We have not got a very large mercantile fleet but it is growing, and this matter may well come to be of much more importance than it is now.  We cannot, as I say, have an embassy in every country but the Minister might tell us what arrangement he has for the representation of our people when abroad, where we have no consular representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned what was a very sore point some time ago when all EEC countries except Ireland <Col N="394" /> withdrew their ambassadors from Spain.  Personally I think that was a pretty worthless exercise for these countries but would the Minister tell us how many of them have sent their ambassadors back to Spain?  One could argue for a long time as to the appropriate steps to take in these circumstances and we were not kept very well informed by the Department at the time&mdash;there was a certain haziness about what we were doing and not doing.  Perhaps it is not of much consequence now&mdash;I hope the souls of the men who were executed in Spain are at rest and I deplore the killing of anybody, in Spain or here&mdash;but the Minister to satisfy my curiosity might tell us how many EEC countries have kept their ambassadors out of Spain since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister's efforts regarding help to the Third World are commendable. The amount is very small indeed but it does show our willingness to contribute to that type of development and that we are concerned for the future of the peoples of the Third World and prepared to accept our financial obligations.</P>
    <P>We now have to pay&mdash;evidently there is a new provision&mdash;in our contribution to the United Nations for Ireland's share of the expenses of maintaining the UN Emergency Forces in the Middle East.  I do not cavil at that, but may I ask are the world powers such as the USSR paying their contributions? For a long time they jibbed at this.  It is only a small point perhaps but one does become somewhat sickened by the agony which the people of the former Portuguese colonies are going through and to see this interference of the USSR in these colonies, not as a way to help them, I am sure, merely to show how powerful they are.</P>
    <P>Some years ago a member of this House, now a Minister of the Government, told us, because he did not like the régime in Portugal at that time, that he would close our embassy there and open one in Cuba.  I wonder what are the Government's feelings on Portugal now which is still suffering to some extent because of the interference of foreign powers.  Would the Minister, like his colleague, consider not closing <Col N="395" /> our embassy in Lisbon, but withdrawing our ambassador from the USSR as a protest against their meddling in the Portuguese colonies?  We should ask the Russians to keep out and then try to help these people solve their difficulties.</P>
    <P>I concede that the Minister has done great work on behalf of the Third World and in Europe since we joined the EEC.  We joined the Community thanks to the previous Administration. In my view it is the Minister's first duty to bring home to the Community the suffering and the plight of the people in the north-east of this country and to ask the Community to do everything possible to bring an end to the suffering there.  In the north we could well have the seeds of further European conflict.  Apart from that, the most pressing point is that many people in the North are suffering and this should be brought to an end.  The Minister should drop some of his activities and concentrate more on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I must admit to a certain happiness and satisfaction because I was given the opportunity today to oppose as strenuously as I can the granting of any moneys for salaries and expenses to the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Initial statements of that kind are unusual, especially in respect of Supplementary Estimates, but I ask the House to listen for some minutes while I tell of the dealings I had with that Department. Then they can judge whether I should be happy about pouring additional funds into a Department which has been so neglectful and disrespectful to a public representative and which has completely and utterly disregarded their duties to Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer specifically to the case mentioned by our spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy.  He said that I, as one of the representatives of the constituency where James Creegan resides, took an interest in his case.  James Creegan was apprehended in Belgium on 16th May. He was brought before four successive courts between then and the end of May. Before one court it was indicated that there was not evidence to validate his <Col N="396" /> being held.  Having regard to the peculiarities and idiosyncracies of the Belgian penal code, it was possible for them to hold him for a longer period.</P>
    <P>In June I spoke privately&mdash;but there was nothing confidential about it&mdash;to our Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I told him that I had tabled a question expressing my concern on behalf of James Creegan, an Irish citizen held as a convicted prisoner in a prison in Mons, and I hoped he would give his full attention to this matter. He dismissed me by telling me that I should talk to John Kelly because he knew nothing about it.  I repeat, there was an Irish citizen in prison in Mons for a period, at that stage of nearly five weeks, and our much travelled Minister for Foreign Affairs did not know anything about it.  I admit that with his much publicised presidency of the European Council that, perhaps, he did not have much time for such mundane matters, but I thought that because the Irish citizen had been before the Belgian courts so frequently he might have made some inquiries or, perhaps that some of his officials might have told him about the case.  As Eamon Kelly would say: &ldquo;Things rested so for a while.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was informed in a written reply to my question in June of the peculiarities of the Belgian penal code and given a rather delicate assurance by the Department of Foreign Affairs that they were quite happy about the manner in which the prisoner was being held.  I was told that he was not in solitary confinement.  In other words, the Department were happy that an Irish citizen in a prison in Mons should be happy because he was not in solitary confinement, even though no case had been proved against him.</P>
    <P>Now I am being asked to give extra finance to this Department who look after the interests of Irish citizens in this fashion.  Am I to take it that in any future case where an Irish citizen has information in his possession to which he is entitled the Belgian or any other authorities can take him into custody and try to establish a case of espionage against him or try to prove that he is a threat to security?  If it appears that the Department of Foreign Affairs are <Col N="397" /> quite happy about that, notwithstanding his innocence or guilt&mdash;admittedly if he had been proved guilty, all right &mdash;provided he is not in solitary confinement&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not need the imagination of the Minister to realise that any Irish citizen in a prison in Mons or any other Continental city, having regard to his companions and linguistic difficulties, will in all probability be in solitary confinement anyway. The fact is that he was being treated as a convicted prisoner and the Department and the Minister were happy to exchange diplomatic notes about him.</P>
      <P>I might add that public opinion and the Press were beginning to indicate an interest in this case, but for some unknown reason, or some reason best known to the Minister, it was being indicated to the Press that, perhaps, they should not be embarrassing him or his Department by publicising the case, and that impression was confirmed here in the House when on 10th July I put a specific question to the Minister arising from Press reports. I asked him the result of the representations made on 2nd July, 1975 by the embassy in Brussels in the case of an Irish citizen.  The Minister replied at column 1361, volume 283, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It is not the practice to make public the result of representations made to another Government...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a public representative.  I am throwing my mind back to an earlier exchange between the Minister and our spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Kennedy, when the Minister accused Deputy O'Kennedy of having an inferiority complex and Deputy O'Kennedy credited the Minister with having an exalted ego.  I have neither, but I am very mindful of the honour I have to represent the people in my consituency and I do not see why any Minister should withhold from me information in respect of the rights and freedoms of any citizen of this country.  I am asking the Minister to elaborate on that <Col N="398" /> attitude when he is replying.  It is not one to which we are accustomed; it is not one that conforms to Parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>I will refer further to the Minister's reply, the report of which will indicate there was no effort on my part to be contentious or embarrassing or incisive on the matter.  The Minister mentioned &ldquo;the accused&rdquo;.  Having regard to the fact that he had been imprisoned for nearly two months and that no evidence had been presented, I found it necessary during my supplementaries to refer to the &ldquo;alleged accused&rdquo;.  That had the effect of tickling the appreciation of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs for spoken English and, I suppose, his knowledge of the judicial system.  He had a laugh. Note was taken by a Minister who happened to be present and I reprimanded&mdash;that is a schoolteacher term I should not use&mdash;I indicated that I was not impressed by the light and frivolous manner with which the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs had treated the matter before the House. The whole purpose of my supplementary was to get from the Minister whether he himself would indicate to his counterpart in Belgium the feeling of annoyance of the Irish people. Later on, I may indicate certain lines which that feeling was about to take. The Minister was quite emphatic and said he had not, and he finished his supplementary by saying that the Minister did not make personal representations to his counterpart.  He said:</P>
    <P>I did not.  One wants to get results rather than newspaper headlines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There was the headline when the Minister went out and sipped tea with those whom he had run out of his Department and where the Minister had not the courtesy of advising me of the position.  I had to read in the newspapers about what had happened.  The newspapers were not good enough for the Minister when they were endeavouring with other media to publicise the matter and to force the Minister to do something on behalf of freedom.  In the end, when <Col N="399" /> through the efforts of the media and public representatives, something had been done, the Minister very quickly went out to sip tea with the people whom he had banished from his office. Will the Minister answer that when he is replying?  He was very quick to go out to the people, and here I want him to deny or verify another charge which I make against him.  I am referring to the expenditure of public moneys on salaries of staff in the Department and how negligent they have been in looking after the interests of Irish citizens, and I am referring to a statement by the Minister that my attempt to do something on behalf of such freedom was doing him harm.</P>
      <P>When Mr. and Mrs. Creegan visited the Minister, he referred to a trip which I had made to see Mr. Creegan in Mons.  He referred to the conditions which had been imposed on me in connection with that trip.</P>

      <P>I indicated to the Department it was my intention to go to do the work the Minister had failed to do on behalf of Mr. Creegan. I indicated my intention to go to visit Mr. Creegan and the Belgian Ministers for Justice and Foreign Affairs to indicate to them how injurious I thought their action in holding Mr. <Col N="400" /> Creegan without trial would be to the state of good relations that existed between the two countries and to indicate to their Minister for Justice that what they were doing did not conform to the Irishman's sense of justice.  I felt I was in order in indicating to the Department of Foreign Affairs that they might formally advise the governor of the prison that I would see Creegan.  They did that.

      <P>I wanted to put on record the communication I got from the Department in respect of my visit.  I might add I was travelling from Amsterdam to Brussels and then to Mons.  The Department's communication stated:</P>

      <P>The communication from the Department continued as follows:</P>
      <P>This is the Paris train which stops at Mons at 11.38.  I will get on train at Brussels Midi and meet Deputy Tunney outside front entrance at Mons station.  I will be wearing a red tie.  I can then show him to prison.  We have requested in writing visit of one hour from 11.45 to 12.45.</P>
      <P>The communication further stated:</P>
      <P>We are acting on assumption that prison visiting arrangements are O.K.</P>
      <P>It continued on but there were no conditions whatever.  In my hotel in Amsterdam on the eve of my visit I had a phone call from the embassy saying that a Press correspondent from Luxembourg had been on to them indicating he understood I was going to Mons.  I told my caller that if the Press correspondent had so indicated he had got the information elsewhere than from me.  That was the only comment I made.  Here again we get an example of the attempt of the Iron Curtain hold on the Press, the media and public representatives.  I asked my caller what he had told the Press correspondent who approached him and he told me that he said they were not too sure I was coming at all, that it had not yet been confirmed. Was that part of the condition that was imposed on me?  Notwithstanding the fact that I had confirmed my visit to Mons, was it in order for the Department to say they did not know if I was coming?  I am not going to continue until the Minister listens to what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual for them to listen also.  If there were conditions in respect of that visit which the Minister considers I had broken, and which he told the parents of James Creegan I had broken to the detriment of their son, why did he not inform me of those conditions before he arranged and facilitated my second visit to the prison?  That is a fair question and, in the absence of the Minister being able to answer, he should indicate to me that what he told the parents of Creegan was not in accordance with the facts.  As far as I am concerned, he must indicate to them that he did me an injustice by saying I had dishonoured any condition which had been placed on me in respect of the visit.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will regard this matter as seriously as I do.  If I do not get satisfaction or a withdrawal from the Minister here I shall pursue the point.  He himself appreciates that in such a delicate situation where, quite understandably, parents would be vitally concerned about the well-being of their child, it was most improper of him to indicate that I had in any way done anything prejudicial to their son's safety and well-being.  To say the least, it was inspired by motives other than the truth; to say the least it was inspired by motives other than a regard for the honour of Members of this House.  The Minister is one person who is always very apt to talk about the good name of politicians and the impression we create.  Yet here he was feeding into the minds of two of my constituents a message that could not do anything but detract from the good name of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister refused to come down from the European and other clouds. He indicated no interest whatever; in fact, he indicated to me he was not happy that our ambassador had made any form of protest at all.  I do not <Col N="403" /> know the reasons for his attitude at that stage.  I do not know why he was so reluctant to intervene on behalf of an Irish citizen, a son of an Irish soldier who saw service in the Congo, decent respectable Irish people.  I do not know why the Minister did not find time or would not condescend to make an inquiry on their behalf.  However, I know that resulting from pressure and public opinion on other members of the Government&mdash;in all fairness they were more sensitive to public appeal than the Minister&mdash;the Department on 1st October, 1975, issued a statement that presumed to defend the Minister's position.  I would ask the House to bear with me while I quote from the Press release.  In this connection I would mention that on 26th June we were told it was not a matter for the papers; we were told they were only doing harm and that I had done harm by talking to Press, radio and television representatives.  I would ask the House to look at the feeble effort of our Minister for Foreign Affairs to justify himself with regard to his continuing negligence on behalf of James Creegan:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken a continual personal interest in the case of James Creegan.</P>
    <P>In July, the Belgian authorities were told.  You will note the skip from May to July.  You will also bear in mind the fact that the Minister told me himself that he did not know this chap was in prison.</P>
    <P>In July the Belgian authorities were told of the Minister's and the Government's concern.  Since then there has been frequent contact with the Belgian authorities at several levels.</P>
    <P>We were not told what they were. This statement is to confirm the Minister's personal interest in an Irishman who is in prison in Belgium and mark the details which he gave to substantiate his personal interest.  Five months later he has seen the parents of Mr. Creegan&mdash;I will not elaborate on the fashion in which he saw them beyond saying that I know that on one <Col N="404" /> occasion he told them lies about me&mdash; he has seen them on three occasions. The son is in prison in Mons and the Minister has been in Brussels, which is only 30/40 miles from Mons, on several occasions, at the expense of the Irish taxpayers, at the expense of the Creegans, the Tunneys and the whole lot.  He did not think it worth his while to mention one word.  He did not think it worth his while to go out to see him. No, he was happy in the thought that he saw his parents here in Ireland. That is one indication of his interest. He saw Mr. Creegan's parents.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's instructions every effort has been made to facilitate visits by relatives, friends and a member of Dáil Éireann representing the constituency.</P>
    <P>That is a great contribution.  That was his personal interest.  He arranged for other people to see him and finally, as has been denied by Deputy Michael O'Kennedy:</P>
    <P>The Minister has also been in touch on the matter with the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Michael O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>We know now from an earlier explanation by Deputy Michael O'Kennedy that that negotiation was that a copy of that Press release had been sent to Deputy Michael O'Kennedy and the Department of Foreign Affairs knew that at the time Deputy Michael O'Kennedy was in Russia.  They knew I was in Ireland because I was then negotiating my second visit.  They did not send a copy of it to me and I am asked to agree to vote additional moneys to that Department and that Garry Glitter of a Minister.  I certainly will not.</P>
    <P>The impression was being given that this was an area where public opinion should be dampened down, where anything the public or the media said was harming James Creegan.  You will note the attempt at defending the Minister when he was away&mdash;if he were at home it might have been better&mdash;was on 1st October.  At that stage I happen to know that the Belgian authorities in response to appeals were about to issue a statement indicating their feelings on the matter.  They issued a statement <Col N="405" /> which is in total disagreement with the attitude which the Minister has taken, his attitude of: &ldquo;Leave it to our civil servants.  Keep all public opinion away.&rdquo;  This, apparently is the new democracy, for which I am asked to vote moneys, in the Department of Foreign Affairs because the statement issued by the Belgian Ambassador&mdash;I do not propose to quote it at length&mdash; says in paragraph 2:</P>
    <P>The concern that may be caused by the detention under remand is perfectly legitimate.</P>
    <P>The Minister having denied earlier that he imposed any conditions on me did infer that the only other people who would have imposed conditions were the Belgian authorities.  Here we have the Belgian Ambassador stating that he accepts that the concern is perfectly legitimate.  I might say also that when I visited the two Ministries in Brussels, the Ministry for Justice and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, they made me most welcome.  They treated me with absolute courtesy.  They thanked me very much for the concern which I was showing, concern for an Irish citizen first of all but also for the relationship which exists between the two countries.  They told me that they would let me have a report on James Creegan, which they did and when I went back a second time it was confirmed to me on 10th October that a decision would be made on James Creegan inside the following fortnight, and it was.</P>
    <P>I am not going to embarrass anybody in the embassy in Belgium but I can say that when I gave that information to James Creegan in prison I got the impression that the Embassy was not too happy about it or at least they were not aware of it.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that I hoped to convince the House of how difficult it would be for me, having regard to the attitude of the Department of Foreign Affairs but more especially of the Minister for Foreign Affairs towards me. I know that the Minister is in control of his Department to that extent.  I know that when he speaks the whole Department speaks.  I know that we have not in that Department the open <Col N="406" /> government that we heard so much talk about.  Nevertheless, I would be prepared to listen to the Minister very attentively and I would ask him to reject anything which I have said in respect of his mishandling of this case. I repeat, in short, the charges which I make against the Minister: there was a young Irishman in prison in Mons for at least five weeks at the stage when I mentioned it to the Minister and the Minister did not know anything about it.  That is true.  I beg pardon. I mentioned it to you there.  You told me to get on to John Kelly, that you did not know anything about it and I hope you are not going to say otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

Here we have a statement from the Belgian Ambassador on 6th October that they accept as being perfectly legitimate the concern which was being expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern was not coming from that source.  Therefore, it must have been coming from the home source.  I am asking the Minister here to explain&mdash;on a personal level it is my real concern&mdash;why he told the parents of James Creegan that I had broken conditions on which I had been allowed to go to see him and I do not want any attempt at a defence similar to the one we got in the statement the Department issued on 1st October.  I want the Minister <Col N="407" /> to indicate why it was he refused to accommodate the gentlemen of the Press who sought information on this particular matter, why it was his embassy rang me in Amsterdam on the eve of my going to Mons to tell me they had told the Press there was some doubt about my going on the following morning, and why the embassy did not arrange, as I had requested in Brussels, formally to notify the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that I intended calling on them when I was in Brussels.  I want the Minister to tell me why, on the occasion of my second visit, they informed me here in Dublin that they had notified the two Ministers of my going and, when I arrived, I discovered they had notified only one.  Why did that happen?  If the Minister gives me satisfactory explanations in all these matters I shall be very happy to reconsider my attitude in regard to the continued expenditure of money on his Department.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the news that our representatives in Europe had succeeded very effectively in bringing their concern to the notice of the Belgian authorities.  Later Deputy Crowley will tell us of the efforts he made and I am sure he will confirm what I have said.  Contrary to the impression given by the Minister, the Belgian authorities were most receptive to representations made.  Having regard to the fact that James Creegan was held in prison as an unconvicted prisoner for five-and-a-half months, since his release has the Minister discussed the matter with his counterparts in Belgium?</P>
      <P>Earlier Deputy O'Kennedy accused the Minister of performance but no action.  I accuse him of no action but plenty of performance when other people had done his work for him.  It was then we got the performance. The Press was not the enemy of the people when the Minister was going out to visit Mr. and Mrs. Creegan in Finglas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had now the attitude of the Department towards an Irish citizen imprisoned abroad.  We have <Col N="408" /> had a sadder experience since.  We have had the Department's attitude to an Irish citizen who lay last week in a morgue in Switzerland, the son of a poor Irish family.  They were informed it would cost in excess of £1,000 to bring the body home and £600 if the burial took place on the Continent.  When the Department were approached and asked if they could assist the answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Efforts were made locally and are still being made to collect the money necessary and it is possible now, I understand, that the public having led the Department may follow. Apparently that is the attitude of the Department in everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I intervene for the purpose of clarification of something that arose earlier, something the Minister asked me to clarify?  I referred to a resolution on Rhodesia passed by the United Nations on 13th December, No. 3297, deploring the attitude of the British Government.  I was not entirely correct in what I said earlier. I said our Government voted against. In fact, they abstained.  The resoluion was passed by 11 votes and the resolution is as follows:</P>
      <P>Strongly deploring the failure of the Government of the United Kingdom to discharge its primary responsibility as the administering power and in conformity with the relevant decisions of the United Nations to put an end to the situation in Rhodesia which, as repeatedly affirmed by the Security Council, constitutes a threat to international peace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulae Deputy Tunney on the humane work he did on behalf of James Creegan.  But for his intervention and his persistence I am sure Mr. Creegan would still be locked up in a cell in Brussels.  I attended the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 3rd October.  It was a committee meeting on population and refugees and under the heading &ldquo;Changing of the legal status of aliens&rdquo; I raised the plight of Mr. Creegan.  I am quoting from the minutes of the meeting:</P>
      <P>Mr. Crowley drew the attention of the Committee to the case of an Irishman who had been detained for a considerable period in a Belgian jail on the grounds of alleged unlawful observation of aerial traffic.  He urged the Belgian members of the Committee should be invited to take up the matter and press for the man in question to be either charged or released.  He emphasised that the man in question was not eligible for release on bail.  The chairman stated that the Committee was not in a position to take up individual cases but urged Mr. Crowley to discuss the matter privately with the Belgian Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that meeting the Belgian delegate expressed his readiness to investigate the matter on receipt of the necessary information.  I telephoned Deputy Tunney's house but as he was not there I spoke with his wife and informed her of the type of information the Belgian members were seeking. That evening, during the open session of the Council of Europe, I consulted the Minister for Aero Transport, Mr. Geens, and he, although a member of the Belgian Cabinet, was totally unaware of the plight of Mr. Creegan. This would indicate to me that our Minister for Foreign Affairs had not been doing his work in regard to Mr. Creegan's plight.  I might add that of the four civil servants present with the Minister at the Plenary Session, <Col N="410" /> three were unaware that there was an Irishman in jail but the fourth was aware than an Irishman, Mr. Tunney, had been in contact with the Department in connection with the Creegan case, Confirmation of what Deputy Tunney has said cannot be highlighted more dramatically than by recalling the ignorance of the Belgian representatives in relation to Mr. Creegan.  There was no awareness of what was happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a man for whom I have the greatest respect.  He is doing his job very efficiently but, yet, he has fallen down dramatically in displaying even elementary humanity towards a fellow-Irishman and it is in this respect that his first duty should lie.  He may have been a great success as President of the Council of Ministers and as Minister for Foreign Affairs but if he does not succeed as a public representative in catering for the needs of Irish people, his other activities cannot be considered successful.  All I can do in regard to the Creegan case is to add my voice to the trojan efforts of Deputy Tunney&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who despite the number of obstructions placed in his way and despite the insidious insinuation that he was doing harm at a time when the prisoner and his family were at their emotional lowest, continued his efforts in the case.  It is significant, too, that in the early days of October the Minister issued a Press release in relation to the affair. This was at about the time I had indicated that I intended to raise the plight of Mr. Creegan at the Council of Europe.  I am not saying there was a connection but the coincidence is a bit much to ignore.  This House and the Irish people as a whole should be forever grateful for having a representative of the calibre of Deputy Tunney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, also, about another matter.  This is the manner in which Irish people are being treated in their journeys to and from England.  In this regard I speak from personal experience.  I would have thought that when one was on an <Col N="411" /> Irish plane one could be regarded as being virtually on Irish soil.  However, I had the experience of seeing three Special Branch men standing at the door of an Irish plane and searching people as they went on board although these passengers had been searched at an earlier stage.  I saw a British policeman standing in the centre of the corridor of that plane. I protest vehemently that this should be the situation and I would ask the Minister to pursue it with the British Government and to draw their attention to the attitude being adopted towards Irish people by some British policemen.</P>
    <P>In discussing an Estimate of this nature it can usually be taken for granted that the voting of the moneys required will be a formality but, like Deputy Tunney, I have serious reservations on this occasion because of the attitude adopted by the Department when they were subjected to public scrutiny.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My maiden speech in this House two-and-a-half years ago was on the subject of foreign affairs and I rise today to record my disappointment with the performance of the Minister in the task he was given by the Taoiseach after the last general election.</P>
      <P>Let us examine what is before us today&mdash;a Supplementary Estimate for a further £737,000.  We have a situation where the Minister for Foreign Affairs is one of 15 members of a Cabinet who were charged by the people with administering their affairs in a proper manner.  Through the media the Minister had gained the reputation of being a brilliant economist who, given the opportunity, would look after the affairs of this nation in an excellent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite any reasonable person to examine the performance of this man who, in the original Estimate for travelling and incidental expenses alone sought a figure of £660,000 but who, a few months later, is back seeking an additional £440,000&mdash;an increase of 66 per cent.  If a Minister is incapable of projecting the amount of <Col N="412" /> money he needs for his Department for a period of 12 months how can he possibly make reasonable and rational decisions at Government level for the whole Government expenditure for a 12-month period?  In opposition Deputy FitgGerald loved to talk of future economic planning.</P>

If a Minister is incapable of calculating air fares for himself and his entourage travelling around the world on the affairs of the people of the country and makes a mistake of 66 per cent how could he possibly administer the affairs of the country and of the economy generally as part of the collective Cabinet responsibility?</P>

      <P>I was being specific. I do not like arguing with the Chair but we are being asked, on a basic item of travelling and incidental expenses, for an increase of 66 per cent.  The Minister has a reputation of being an economist but he was incapable of calculating the amount needed for travelling and incidental expenses in his Department over a 12-month period.  I can understand being out 10 per cent, 12 per cent or maybe 25 per cent but to be out two-thirds in relation to the Estimate for travelling expenses alone seems incredible.  What was the end result of this expenditure by the Minister's Department?  I believe the Minister and his Department have not delivered one single item which is to the benefit of the national interest.  We have a lot of froth, a lot of publicity and a lot of speeches made, on behalf of the problems of every country in the world except our own, by the Minister and his Department.  What is the result of the vast travelling and talk of the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  I have tremendous respect for him and I would not like it to be considered that what I say in any way reflects on the personality of the individual.  The Minister has a task to perform and in my view he has failed in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister could be a brilliant foreign correspondent for any of the journals in this country and perhaps abroad.  I have no doubt that at the drop of a hat he could give a view on any major, minor or trivial problem anywhere in the world but he is responsible to this House for what goes on in his Department.  Deputy Tunney and Deputy Crowley spoke about one real incident which affected an Irish citizen abroad in the last 12 months.  The Department of Foreign Affairs could have helped but did not in the case of James Creegan.  It is only right that I record the thanks of the people for the efforts made by Deputy Tunney on behalf of one of his constituents. He was elected to look after the problems of his constituents and <Col N="414" /> being conscious of his responsibility he worked diligently on behalf of the Creegan family.  The man who could have done most to help James Creegan was the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

He would still be there if it were not for the efforts of Deputy James Tunney and his colleague, Deputy Flor Crowley, a member of the European Parliament.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said this morning:</P>
      <P>There is a further small sum required to cater for the repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens abroad but this is offset to a large extent by a corresponding increase in receipts under Appropriations-in-Aid due to the repayment of repatriation and maintenance advances.</P>
      <P>The affair of James Creegan is not to the credit of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department.  If it were not for the efforts of Deputy Tunney, Dublin North-West, the constituency from which James Creegan comes, that man would still be in Mons jail.  It is not a way of handling the Department of Foreign Affairs to have cups of tea with the relatives after failing to look after James Creegan's interest when the pressure was on.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about the co-operation between our various embassies abroad and the semi-State and other bodies operating in foreign countries.  The Minister should use his staff to a far greater extent in promoting Irish industry, Irish products, Irish life and culture by establishing premises similar to Ireland House in London.  The Minister should have an Ireland House in countries where we have an Irish embassy.  Irish embassies abroad to a great extent operate in an enclosed convent mentality with the high walls around them.  Officials in them attend cocktail parties in other embassies but have no relationship with the people of the country in which they are based.  Our embassies should play a more active role in bringing industries here, selling Irish products and working in closer co-operation with our tourist interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot afford the luxury of having five or six offices for semi-State bodies in a European city.  Our embassies should be the hub of Irish activity within a country and should reflect all things important to the Irish nation.  We should not have duplication, triplication, or further efforts to have secretaries for our semi-State bodies.  We should have one unit operating on political, economic and tourist matters within each country in which we are based.  In this way we could build up our image abroad <Col N="416" /> as being efficient and well organised. This is what the embassy should be and not the cocktail circuit that some of them are at this stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to embassy buildings it is important that in choosing such buildings we use imagination with regard to their siting and consider whether the buildings are under lease or ownership of the State.  As far as possible the Minister should rationalise the question of ownership as distinct from lease in many of the Irish premises abroad.</P>
    <P>For a country of our size we have played a major role in the affairs of the United Nations.  At this stage of the development of that organisation a major worry has come on the horizon and it concerns the institution and the complex of the UN.  We have a major responsibility to see that the UN, the great bulwark of democracy as far as small nations are concerned, is protected and developed.  The Minister should play an important role in this regard on behalf of our people.</P>
    <P>One of the great threats to foreign affairs is the question of the expansion of the detente.  We all want to see detente, to see the people of the world coming together, but detente at present is a one way street with the West giving to the East and no reciprocation from the other side.  All our western standards are being given away on the basis that if more is given the Russians might be kept happy, but we are receiving nothing in return.  We saw evidence of this in the disgraceful incident of the Nobel prizewinner being refused an exit visa from Russia like many of his colleagues.  This refusal was in spite of the great Helsinki Conference and the signing of pieces of paper by the Russians and other Eastern countries.</P>
    <P>People may ask what this has got to do with this small country but I believe it concerns anybody who speaks on behalf of democracy and the protection of democracy.  Too many people are prepared to close their eyes to the problems of the Communist attacks on the standards of the Western world.  If we need an example of how the Communist countries can influence the affairs of nations we need only look at the tragic occurrences in <Col N="417" /> Portugal where we have the wolf in sheep's clothing; the Communist threat playing an active role to the detriment of the people of that country.</P>

      <P>Under salaries, wages and allowances, the Department deals with embassies assigned to Ireland.  Any foreign representatives I met were a credit to their country and they are doing an excellent job on behalf of their nation but I feel obliged to mention the &ldquo;Berlin wall&rdquo; it is proposed to built around the Russian Embassy in Dublin.  We do not need that type of thing in Dublin and the other embassies have not engaged in such work.  We have heard a lot about our natural resources and the proper use of them.  As an island we have one of the greatest natural resources of all, our fishing rights, but we are not making full use of our fishing.  We have the cod war between Great Britain and Iceland in progress at present but I should like to see the Minister taking some action at the international conferences to have our fishing limits extended.</P>

      <P>The treatment of Irish citizens in Britain was mentioned by Deputy Crowley.  Deputy Wilson has a question down to the Minister today asking him if he will set up consulates in some of the major cities in England and I feel that in view of the vast number of Irish people of first and second generation living in England at the moment, the Minister should act on this suggestion. I know that we have consulates in some, but for a clarification of the Irish position in England and for the protection of our citizens and their children, with the anti-Irish feeling engendered there which can be seen in the type of cheap British humour, anti-Irish humour going on, the Minister has a responsibility to do something to counter this particularly insidious type of propaganda against the Irish people.  This is to be seen, as Deputy Crowley mentioned, in the type of searches going on at British airports of Irish people and foreigners travelling into Ireland.</P>

The sum is being voted for Salaries, Wages and Allowances and I am suggesting that some of that money be <Col N="419" /> devoted towards the setting up of consulates in British cities to protect our people and to counter the type of anti-Irish propaganda which is going on there at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ray Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Far be it from me to argue with the Chair, but echoing what I said at the beginning, in my view for the money being spent on this Department, we have in the person of the present incumbent in office a Minister who is an expert on everybody else's problems and who could without doubt write a brilliant newspaper article for any journal in the world on the problems of any part of the world, but a Minister who has done little or nothing for the Irish nation in the time he has been Minister. We have had a lot of talk and a lot of travel to the extent of an increase this year of £440,000 on an original Estimate of £660,000.  We have had a lot of talk and a lot of <Col N="420" /> travel, but on the one occasion when the Minister and his Department could have helped an Irish citizen, it was left to a Fianna Fáil Deputy, Deputy Tunney, to defend and rescue James Creegan from the clutches of the Belgian authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that has worried me since I came into this House is the number of Supplementary Estimates coming up daily.  This is a Supplementary Estimate for an increase of 56 per cent and I cannot understand it.  The excuse was given that we held the Presidency this year of the EEC in which office the Minister acquitted himself with distinction, but before the year began everybody knew we were to have it.  Everybody knew there were to be increases and there was no attempt in the original Estimate to budget for increases and for inflation and this is what I think is very bad.  It brings us back to the point we made about the present Government, that they got into office promising to make reductions, knowing they could not do it.  Every Supplementary Estimate that has come before the House is for a huge amount over and above the original Estimate.</P>
      <P>I believe, and they are very intelligent men over there, that it is deceitful to bring in an Estimate for a particular amount of money, knowing that you will have to come in with a Supplementary Estimate, and we have that here in the form of this huge Supplementary Estimate, and to seek to get away with the excuse that we held the Presidency of the EEC and travelling expenses had gone up is not good enough.  This is very bad.  I am not against a small Supplementary Estimate but it is not just good enough to bring in a huge Supplementary Estimate such as this, and this is only one. We have other very important Departments, maybe not as important as the Minister's, that may be coming in with Supplementary Estimates as well. The position is that the Government when budgeting have not the slightest idea where they are going and this is the biggest fault of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various things were mentioned in relation to this very important Department <Col N="421" /> but, again, we had the matter of which Deputy O'Kennedy spoke, our voting at the UN, and the Minister presented an image which I thought the vote did not present.  We were more or less back at that image. Working within the framework of the EEC, whereas we are all the time telling everybody that they must keep the rules and we are keeping them all the time, we did not seem to have sufficient impact to keep the other members of the Community to the rules and regulations and the general principles of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the very important task of seeing that our fellow-Irishmen across the Border and on the Border are protected from the encroachment of British troops.  I do think that Deputy Burke was fairly relevant in this regard because I know a little about this.  It is the Department's job to look after our people in England and protect their interests. With regard to the situation in which Deputy Tunney was involved, I followed that matter through the medium of the newspapers and to be quite honest, I was astonished that Deputy Tunney did not seem to get the co-operation from the Department that he should get, because to my mind in the case of any Irish citizen in any part of the world, it is the duty of the Department to see that everything possible is done to ensure that no injustice is done to anybody and nobody is imprisoned without trial.  That is the job of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs is very important.  I cannot understand, and nobody will convince me, that the present Minister did not know when he brought in his Estimate that it would have to be increased by a huge amount.  This is what I call deceit. He was not giving the House the exact facts, as any man with intelligence&mdash;such as the present Minister &mdash;should know.  We are regularly getting Supplementary Estimates from every Department with the result that we are having budgets every two or three weeks.</P>
    <P>This Government will have to take <Col N="422" /> a good look at themselves and tell the people that they will always try to be honest&mdash;and the Department of Foreign Affairs are not being honest.  I give them credit for intelligence.  You know that when an intelligent man deceives you it is done deliberately. This Government deceived the electorate about what they could do within the context of the EEC and how they could reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs brought in what they knew to be a completely unrealistic Estimate with the result that they had to come here again with this Supplementary Estimate. Their travelling expenses have increased by two-thirds.  Anybody with even schoolboy's intelligence would have known that the original Estimate would not cover all the travelling that was to be done.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister give consideration to the Fianna Fáil suggestion to buy a jet?  In the long run would it not have been more economical for the Government to own a jet than to have to pay such enormous sums in travelling expenses?  Is the nation getting a good return from all these trips abroad?  When I asked in this House for information about trips abroad, it was very hard to get it.  I am very worried about this.  Are we getting a just return for the cost of keeping our Ministers and Members at the Council in Brussels?  It is about time the country realised that this Government are not presenting realistic Estimates to this House.  This, to my mind, is not the way to govern a country.</P>

      <P>I would like to say a few words about this bankruptcy Estimate.  I understand that if it is not passed today there will be no money to pay the salaries of the officials of that Department.  Is that correct?  If the Estimate is not sanctioned today, will we have to call in a receiver?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having had a serious look at this very grave situation, I have no intention of delaying the passing of this Estimate through the House.  As one reads through the Estimate one sees travel, travel, travel mentioned.  It appears to be a travel Estimate or <Col N="423" /> a report from a travel agency.  This Government have excelled themselves in travelling.  Each Minister, without exception, made numerous trips abroad. We are told of their wonderful success and, on one occasion, one young lad got lost in Bangkok.</P>

    <P>I reported a person missing to the Department and asked them to try to locate him.  I was wondering what <Col N="424" /> action the Department took when a Minister was reported missing to locate him so that he could continue his trip. Members of this Government are doing a considerable amount of travelling abroad.  I feel for these men who, we are told, are under constant threat when they travel abroad.  The Department have the added responsibility of keeping a close check on these Ministers, particularly the younger men who seem to be less responsible than the older men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to Irish citizens being lost, in difficulties or going astray, abroad.  When a report comes into the Department, what immediate action is taken?  Are the reports dealt with immediately? How are they dealt with?  Can information be supplied to Members of this House who seek it?  This is a very important matter.  When a person is reported missing or in difficulties abroad and representations are made to the Department, surely when the Minister is questioned in this House he has a responsibility to Members to make the position absolutely clear about what action his Department will take.</P>
      <P>I want to refer to Volume 283 of the Official Report of 10th July last when the Minister said in reply to a question by Deputy Tunney:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the practice to make public the result of representations made to another Government.  The embassy in Brussels is, of course, continuing to do everything appropriate <Col N="425" /> to be of whatever assistance possible to the accused and will, needless to say, keep in close contact with the Belgian authorities in the matter.</P>
    <P>What about the Irish authorities? What about Members of this House seeking information?  They are told, as the Minister told Deputy Tunney, that it is not the practice to make known the results of representations to other Governments.  A Member of this House seeking information about a constituent is told this.  Surely he is entitled to such information.  So is the House as a whole.  Either there were no representations or they were so limited that they would appear to be a disgrace to the people claiming to have made them.  Even at this late stage the Minister will have to indicate what the representations were.  In my opinion no representations were made until a Member of this House moved and then that Member was denied a diplomatic passport to enable him with convenience to visit an Irish citizen abroad.  That was not the action of a responsible Minister&mdash;to deny a diplomatic passport and then to refuse information about the representations made.  Was it a question of the Minister not wanting the Deputy to move in that case or that the Department thought if he did not get the passport he would not pursue the matter further?</P>
    <P>We might ask similar questions in relation to other Irish citizens abroad. A young man was killed in Switzerland and a local tenants' organisation had to provide for the funeral. What action did the Minister and the Department take?  The Minister seems to be more concerned with matters far removed from the real problems confronting Irishmen at home and abroad.  Apparently he has no concern for individuals.  There is the case of the young man who went astray in Bangkok.  Many young Irish people of tender years need a guiding hand abroad but will they get it from this bankrupt Government and Department?  Is it that the money was a factor in these cases?</P>
    <P>The matter was raised here yesterday. <Col N="426" /> Irish workers who have spent three, four or five years working abroad and who come back to be told they cannot get unemployment assistance unless they have at least one stamp on their cards here.  Is this part of the free movement of workers within the EEC or does this apply only to Irish workers who come home?  The Minister must know it is impossible for such people to get jobs here that would enable them to provide this one stamp.</P>

      <P>A considerable portion of the expenditure of my Department&mdash; perhaps two-thirds&mdash;is spent abroad in a wide range of currencies which have appreciated in value against sterling during the course of the year.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide additional funds now simply to maintain activities at the level already budgeted for by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>This includes money for travel and EEC business.  The question I am raising relates to the free movement of workers within the EEC.  It is not a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  The problem of Irish workers abroad who come home and are unable to get benefits from the Department of Social Welfare is a matter for that Department.  I want to ask the Minister if the system applied here is the same as that in the other EEC countries with regard to the free movement of workers.</P>

There was also the case of the refusal of the Department to provide some form of assistance by way of a passport to this Deputy.  The Minister also failed to supply this House with information demanded by the Deputy in Question No. 3 on 10th July last.  All these matters should be clarified.  He should reply to the points raised by Deputies in the course of this discussion, limited though it might be within the confines indicated by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

      <P>It would appear from the Minister's reply that an enormous quantity of equipment has been loaned when the time involved in compiling it would be so considerable.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, no military equipment should be moved without escort or be used by civilians, but armies, naturally, have all sorts of other things such as the Deputy or I might use in our way of life and I suppose the removal of an ordinary non-military thing would not require a military escort.

I want to point out <Col N="432" /> that on 16th April, 1975 I received a letter from the Minister's Department which indicated that this man had served a total of three years and a day, which is a day more than the qualifying service.  His discharge indicates that he had served a three year period and his discharge recommendation was that he was a member of the presidential escort of honour, carried out his duties in a most satisfactory and honourable manner and was a most honest, sober and trustworthy young man and could be recommended to any employer.  Nevertheless, this young man, because of the fact that military justice has not been updated was a victim of circumstances and of double punishment.</P>

      <P>The trooper in question was awarded 15 days' detention on 28th March, 1973, by his commanding officer, from whom he elected to accept punishment, and he had an option of going to court-martial, for appearing on training parade unshaven and using insubordinate language to his superior officer. When he left the Army he would have lost the gratuity to the amount of between £54 and £55.  At that point in time that was his loss.  We are not running a kindergarten.  We are running a men's army.  To use insubordinate language before his fellows to his superior officer because he mentioned the matter of appearing on parade unshaven was a serious offence.  Defence Force Regulations lay down that any period of detention does not count as far as qualifying service is concerned.  The man's present position, having rejoined and been taken in on the basis of the good discharge mentioned by Deputy Dowling, is that when he has served <Col N="434" /> his six years the total loss to him will I would estimate be around £15.

      <P>This is the reply that the personnel in Cathal Brugha Barracks have got over a number of years.  The fact that a transformer house has been built some years ago and that there is a cable there is no indication that the matter is being rectified.  Can the Minister say if the security factor is affected by the defective electrical supply to this important military establishment?  Does it affect the lighting and the signal equipment, sound equipment, pumping units, televisions or flood lighting or the sensitive alarm systems to the ordnance stores, if they are there at all?

The necessary works in connection with the take-over of the occupants of married quarters in the barracks as direct consumers of the Electricity Supply Board are being carried out by the board and are expected to be completed by the end of this year. As regards the supply to the barracks proper, apart from the married quarters, a new sub-station has been erected inside the main gate by the Corps of Engineers.

Would the Minister now assure us that a temporary supply will be laid on to ensure the military have the necessary power to meet their requirements in the event of a general alarm when the whole system would be switched on?  Security is the important factor, not television.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is fully aware that it is much easier to give a <Col N="436" /> small area of the barracks where the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are working a separate supply.  This is a very large barracks and it needs a new sub-station and the best thing was to put the married quarters on to outside electricity supply.  That is being done and the work is being pressed forward as quickly as possible. I am entirely confident that the military in charge of the barracks are fully capable of looking after the security aspect and there is no question of unauthorised people entering the barracks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <P>I am there myself most days and, therefore, I can observe what goes on.  The position is that when people are recognised and their <i>bona fides</i> properly established they are let in.  The staff are rarely changed and there is constant contact between the gate office and the main office?  If the Deputy calls to visit me he has to be identified by me.  No one gets past the gate until such time as he is recognised and his <i>bona fides</i> established.  Whether it is people from Dockrells or from other State Departments that form of screening is fully adequate.</P>

      <P>Nobody has the right of entry until his <i>bona fides</i> are checked and established.  Those who look after this matter advise me and they have advised me that the present system is the one that should obtain. A full-scale appraisal of the situation was done within the last six months and, as a result of that, I myself saw Board of Works employees working on certain things in relation to security which I had been advised should be done.  Everything that should be done is being done.  Suggesting another <i>modus operandi</i> does not necessarily mean it would be the right one.  The one being used is regarded as the right one and I am quite happy about that.</P>

      <P>If a person wishes to go to the restaurant in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries he has to have a special picture taken and a special identity card.

One has to be recognised and one's <i>bona fides</i> established.  One has to be vouched for. That will happen even if it is Deputy Lemass, Deputy Dowling or the Minister for Local Government.  Everyone has to be vouched for and recognised and his <i>bona fides</i> established.  That, in my view, is a much better method than the cards the Deputy speaks of. Anybody can have a card.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the statement which was issued by the Government Information Services on 17th October on behalf of the Minister for Finance, regional development fund support has been committed on a global rather than a project by project basis.  Commitment figures for individual projects have not, therefore, been specified.  The global assistance committed following the approval of 48 infrastructural projects, including the project referred to in the Deputy's question, amounts to £2,543,424.  Fund assistance in respect of all projects will be paid to the Exchequer and will be used by the Government to increase the amount which would otherwise be available to finance investments contributing to regional development.</P>

      <P>That depends on what decision Kilkenny reach next year in regard to the scheme.  If they say to me that they are prepared to proceed with the scheme from whatever funds they may receive next year, the scheme would be given top priority.  The Deputy would be in a much better position than I to know whether this is likely but I think both of us would agree that it is not likely.  Therefore, the question of whether the scheme will be proceeded with next year is anybody's guess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an expansion scheme which is likely to cost more than £1,500 per house.  I suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of formulating alternative proposals which would service the Clogh/ Chatworth areas but reports by the consultant engineer and county engineer would appear to indicate that this would not effect any worthwhile reduction in the capital cost because of certain problems.  I have not yet given any decision on the contract documents which are before my Department because the capital available for sanitary services is necessarily limited.  Since we cannot finance all schemes at once, priority must be given to those which are most urgent and which give the best return on expenditure. <Col N="445" /> Accordingly, it may be some time before I will be in a position to give approval for this scheme. The Deputy is aware that there was a deputation received last night and that some progress was made.</P>

If Kildare County Council or any local authority want to put schemes on top priority there is no point in putting them down the list, writing to the Department and asking why we are holding up the schemes.  They know the answer to that.  As far as this one is concerned I imagine it should be fairly high on the list but I cannot now say when it will be proceeded with.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the successful contractor for the Knockgraffon water scheme, Cahir, County Tipperary has the necessary materials and is ready to commence work but cannot do so because his Department have not made the necessary money available; and when the money will be available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I can explain quite easily.  The position is that the proposals last year were for certain works in South Tipperary and adequate money was made available for them. Later in the year, as in many other areas, extra schemes were proposed. It is not possible to find big money like that at the drop of a hat in the middle of the year and, therefore, they have got to wait until the money is made available.  I have not got it and although they have twice as much as they had the previous year they still have not near enough.  I mentioned this on a number of occasions. The failure to provide the necessary finance for water and sewerage schemes over 30 years has created a back-log which has got to be tackled.  We are tackling it as best we can but we cannot find money in the middle or towards the end of the year for a scheme that was not on the list at the beginning of the year.</P>

      <P>In the nine-month financial period of 1974, Kerry County Council's authorised expenditure on the local authority housing programme was £715,000 or equivalent to £953,700 for a 12-month period, as compared to £585,117 in 1973-74 and £448,695 in 1972-73.  The total expenditure authorised last August for 1975 was £1,232,000.</P>
      <P>The council have since sought authority to spend additional moneys and following examination of their request, I have agreed that they may spend an additional £140,000 to meet unavoidable commitments.</P>
      <P>The amount of money which will be allocated to the council in 1976 will be decided in the light of the total amount of capital resources which are made available for the local authority housing programme for that year, and the claims on that amount which are received from all housing authorities, including Kerry County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that members of his party on Kerry County Council stated there was unlimited money available for house building?  We projected a large number of houses with the result that the county council had to borrow £400,000 to meet some of the commitments involved.  They are not able to pay contractors over and above that figure, and for this reason I should like the Minister to give something to relieve the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that. I would not blame the Fianna Fáil or the Fine Gael councillors for thinking that there is unlimited money available in view of the fact that the total expenditure for 1975 authorised was £1,232,000, with £140,000 on top of that, as against £585,000 a couple of years ago.  That is more than twice as much, and in view of that I would not blame them for thinking there was unlimited money available. Kerry County Council knew what they had asked for; they knew the amount they would receive and they produced pretty firm estimates.  We have met them very well as my figures show.  I am sorry, but there is <Col N="455" /> no more money available for 1975.  I am not aware that contractors have not been paid; my information is that all contractors due money who have been requesting money have been paid because of the final £140,000.</P>

I know of a contractor on one housing scheme who was asked to ease down because the money was not available.

      <P>It is possible that the Deputy knows the local scene better than I, but I should like to point out to him that, in fairness to his own officials, it was agreed that a maximum of £140,000 would do what they wanted.  The matter was discussed with them as recently as 6th November. It is unfair&mdash;Deputy O'Connor is not usually an unfair man&mdash;to give the impression to the House that the officials, who will be looking for contractors next year to do work, are not meeting their commitments for one reason or another when we have been assured by them that they are.  I would hate to shake confidence in people who are building houses.  As Deputy O'Connor is aware there are contractors who, for one reason or another, build housing schemes in one year and ask that the money not be made available until the next year or suggest that they will continue with a scheme but will not ask for the money until the next year.  It would be as well if we left it at that because there might be a slur cast on contractors and on the council, and that slur should not be cast.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The superannuation of servants of local authorities is governed by Part III of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  There is no scheme, as referred to, at present before my Department for sanction.  A number of proposals for amendment of the Act generally have been submitted to me and these are being examined in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has not got the matter correct.  When the value of an estate, which includes a pension or a gratuity, is over a certain amount &mdash;widows of servants with more than five years service may collect a substantial amount of money&mdash;probate <Col N="457" /> has to be taken out because there might be a counterclaim.  It is in order to protect themselves that local authorities insist on probate being taken out.  The amount of money involved is very small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the need to bring more farms up to a viable size, he will make a statement on the 31 per cent drop in loans for land purchase as disclosed in the 1975 annual report of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary objective of the Agricultural Credit Corporation's lending policy in relation to land purchase is to ensure that adequate funds are available to enable <Col N="464" /> genuine farmers expand the size of their holdings.  Priority is given to those who have small and medium sized holdings and who need extra land to improve their economic viability.  At the same time the corporation are always conscious of the fact that land prices can be inflated if too much money is provided for land purchase, and so they try to ensure that loans for land purchase do not form an unduly high proportion of total lendings.</P>
      <P>The demand for land purchase loans was very high in 1973-74 and such loans accounted for over 15 per cent of the value of total loans issued that year.  As a result, the corporation had to impose restrictions on land purchase loans and this, together with the drop in the number of farms offered for sale in 1974-75 led to a reduction in land purchase loans to a normal level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, a drop in the number of farms offered for sale, so there were less cases in respect of which the issue could arise, and secondly, the proportion of loans was exceptionally high in 1973-74 and this is something which it is always sought to avoid in order to prevent an excessive volume of money chasing too few properties and thereby pushing up the price of land inordinately.  With a view to bringing that into balance, the proportion of money used for this purpose was reduced in 1974-75.  This together with the fact that there were less farms available for sale accounts for the drop in the proportion.</P>

    <P>The Dáil according to order, resumed consideration of Supplementary Estimates for Public Services for the year ending 31st December, 1975.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £737,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated clearly at the beginning of his speech the reasons for the massive increase of £737,000 when he said that it was due to the continued fall in the value of our pound against non-sterling currency. This is a major problem, because not alone does it affect the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs but it also affects the goods we have to buy to keep our industries going, and our exports.</P>
      <P>When we entered the Community in January, 1973, the pound could buy 120 Belgian francs.  Today we get only 81 Belgian francs.  This means that the pound against the non-sterling European currencies has devalued by about 30 per cent.  This is the prime reason why the Minister had to come here today to look for this very large sum to keep his Department going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> Later in his speech he gave other reasons.  He said:</P>
    <P>One was that the work&mdash;and travel &mdash;connected with the Irish Presidency of the European Community Council of Ministers was much greater even than had been expected.</P>
    <P>My opinion is that all the expenses of the Minister as President of the Council were paid by the Community and not by this Government.  I thought the same applied to him as applied to the 10 Members of the European Parliament.</P>

      <P>I wish to restate that this problem not alone affects the Department of Foreign Affairs but it affects our industries, exports and imports and brings about the situation to which the Taoiseach and others referred recently when they said that inflation here is running at two-and-a-half times that in most continental countries, particularly member countries of the EEC.  Until this Government comes to grips with this problem, not alone this Department but every other Department will have to come back here with Supplementary Estimates to keep them going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of the European Parliament and I was a member of the EEC Joint AA Committee which met for the last time in Dublin some time <Col N="475" /> ago.  I would like to record my appreciation to the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of Public Works for the excellent job they did during the summit meetings held here.  I know the difficulties they had.  Meetings were held in the Castle and at each meeting adjustments had to be made to the electronic equipment. The people from these two Departments had to work over the weekends to make sure that the work was done.  This was very much appreciated by parliamentarians from outside and inside Europe.  The president of the Joint EEC AA Committee asked me particularly to convey his thanks to you, Sir, and to the various officials for the reception given to the delegates.  As a result, our image in Europe and beyond is very good.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned devaluation and the extra money needed by the Department.  But are we getting full value from our membership of the European Fund?  Before I left Luxembourg this morning I asked for particulars dealing with FEOGA grants for drainage.  I was amazed to discover that there was not even one application for a grant for drainage submitted by the Irish Government&mdash; a country which spends millions of pounds on drainage.  Yet, the island across the water has already been paid almost £1 million in grants for drainage purposes.  As a member of the European Parliament this worries me: are we getting value for money?  Are we doing too much of the Kissinger act going around the various countries and forgetting what we call the bread and butter issues and reasons why we joined the EEC?  I sincerely hope when this House votes the extra money for the Departments of Foreign Affairs that we in this House and the various Departments&mdash;Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Labour, Industry and Commerce&mdash;will take a look at ourselves and get the benefits which are to be availed of in Europe.  I do not want to delay the House further, but I should like to put on record my disappointment, and that of my colleagues, about the way in which we are availing of the financial aid we could get from Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want first of all to deal with the financial points made by Deputies in relation to the Estimate proper.  A number of Deputies remarked on the magnitude of the increased expenditure under the travel subhead.  I accept that this is a matter for concern and that these criticisms can understandably be made because of the scale of these increases.  I should like to make clear, however, that travelling expense excess is only one part of the increase, indeed a minority.  I was asked by, I think, Deputy O'Kennedy, how much was the air fare section of the bill.  The year is not over yet and we have not got this.  It will come in gradually, but roughly speaking the portion of the air fare paid to Aer Lingus will be in the order of £12,000, but there are, of course, other air fare payments where the bookings were made through other channels in other countries.  I could not give the total for air travel but I can say that the figure is abnormal.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised a point in relation to a matter which I had informed him on before the debate, a sum in the order of £40,000 for air fares.  That is very much of an estimate, my own private estimate and not of the Department because it is not possible to estimate to what basic figure the increase would be applied.  It looks as if the rate of increase for the year as a whole would be in the order of 15 per cent, but exactly what the 15 per cent will be on in these un-normal circumstances I could not say.  It would be in the order of £30,000 to £40,000, I imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, an important element is the question of devaluation.  It poses a very great problem for my Department, much more than for other Departments though it is something other Departments will have to face in a relatively minor way.  In our case, the element of travelling abroad presents a real difficulty from this point of view.  Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that the devaluation of the pound was well under way when the Estimate was prepared and that we should have been able to foresee the trend, but if one could foresee <Col N="477" /> that kind of trend one could make a lot of money in currency exchange transactions.  The fact is, of course, that it is not easy to foresee what the value of any currency will be for any prolonged period ahead and indeed in respect of certain important currencies there was no trend in the period when the Estimate was being prepared which would have justified a forecast of the kind of climate that occurred.  The Estimates were finally prepared in September, 1974 on figures furnished in April, 1974.  In August, 1974, the dollar was at 2.37 to the £.  Ten months later it was at 2.31 and I understand from today's newspapers that it is 2.3. The Canadian dollar was at 2.31 in August, 1974, 2.30 in June, 1975 2.05½ in September, 1975.  The yen was 6.93 in August, 1974, 6.62 in June, 1975 and 6.16 in November, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I do not think one can validly foresee the effects of devaluation.  One might in a general way have an expectation that the pound might lose some of its value in the year ahead but one cannot put a figure on it.  The Government's accountancy system could not attempt to speculate on a thing like that.  It is arguable that a way to deal with this would be to buy currency forward, and I have raised the question as to whether that might not be a wise thing.  It would give one the advantage of knowing with a degree of certainty what the cost of the international exchange of money would be on the budgeting situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the foreign exchange market were to go up you would pay more for the pound in the days ahead, but if you took the precaution of buying ahead you would acquire a measure of certainty now, but it is the kind of operation which on the scale involved here, where we are dealing with several million pounds, would be a new venture for this state to embark on.  While it <Col N="478" /> should be examined, it may be that the experts will tell us we would be likely to lose more in the long run than by carrying on as we are now. Certainly, from my point of view, it creates some embarrassment having to come to the House and submit an Estimate on a large scale because of this.  I want to emphasise that it is not fully covered under the particular subhead.  The majority being spent is not accountable by devaluation.</P>
      <P>I should like to make that point clear as I do not want to cover the fact that the Estimates were incorrect. I would be much happier if I did not have to face coming to the House in September with Supplementary Estimates complicated by devaluation, although I would emphasise it is not solely because of this that the increase have occurred.  The situation must be unsatisfactory when budgetary control, of necessity, is unsatisfactory. That applies to a wide range of the items listed under the subheads.  The fact remains that the Estimates under both votes were much greater than can be accounted for by increases in air fares which could not be foreseen at the time when the Estimates were prepared. There were new developments such as Euratom and other matters which we could not have known about, such as the increase in the frequency of meetings in the context of European political co-operation and the extra work attached to the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers and, of course, the increased travel.  This was all un-normal expenditure.  We had never had experience of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Though much of the cost involved was reimbursed, it had its effect on the expenditure.  Moreover, there are costs arising from the Presidency that are purely costs for us to incur and which are possibly not reimbursable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Presidency it seemed opportune and wise for us, for example, to undertake bilateral visits to a number of countries where our position in the Presidency at that time would enhance our standing and make the impact of our visits much greater.  This was true in the case of <Col N="479" /> our visits to the Middle East and Turkey.  The Middle East visit might not have taken place in that period but for the Presidency but it seemed to be the right time to go there as an Irish Foreign Minister when the impact we could make would be greater because of the aura of the Presidency surrounding us.  These things could not be planned in advance or in detail. It was only as we got the feel of the job that we began to see what opportunities there would be and how we should make use of them.  The fact remains that the underestimation of requirements in the current year is unsatisfactory from a parliamentary point of view and I apologise to the House for the size of the excess.</P>

      <P>I have said what I have to say on the subject and I have apologised to the House.  I think we should have been able to have estimated more accurately.  The Deputy's interjection does not seem very appropriate in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the executive jet and another Deputy also referred to it.  This is becoming a hardy annual.  Of course, it is a matter that should be kept under review.  The experience we have had in almost three years has been that there certainly have been occasions on which an executive jet would have been useful and when its absence created some problems.  It would be astonishing if this were not the case.  However, the number of such occasions is relatively few and can be isolated quite easily.  There were times when I had to move rapidly from one meeting to another with other Ministers and when I was able to get assistance from other Ministers with regard to transport; I have been able to get a lift with other Ministers on a number of occasions.  Perhaps there were four or five such occasions. There was the exceptional occasion when I attended the conference at Lucca recently when I was facilitated by the owner of a private jet at Dublin Airport.  The number of such <Col N="480" /> occasions is very few and it could not conceivably be economic for that number of occasions, where there was an emergency problem and a genuine difficulty in using scheduled services, to have an executive jet.  Such a plane could cost approximately £500,000 and to run it for a year on a 600-hour basis, which is a low utilisation, would cost £100,000 per year.  I do not think I could justify it on that basis.</P>
    <P>Of course, if we had an executive jet it could be used not only in emergency cases but on other occasions when it would facilitate movement.  It is possible if there were occasions when it could be filled that it would be slightly cheaper on direct operating costs than a scheduled air service although the cumulative over-heads for the entire year would more than outweigh that in the year as a whole.  In a seven-seater jet, we would need to fill five seats in order to save enough money on scheduled services to pay for the jet fuel, landing fees and so on.  Even if the plane were filled all the time, when taking the overheads into account, the costs per passenger would be higher than the scheduled services.  Certainly it would be convenient, but how much one is entitled to charge the taxpayers for the convenience of Ministers is a question which the Deputies opposite will understand we are sensitive to.  At the present time, having regard to the small number of emergency occasions and for convenience on other occasions I would find it difficult to justify the purchase of an executive jet.  Perhaps we should consider whether we could make arrangements on a certain number of occasions to hire an aircraft when there is a particular problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to the occasion which Deputy O'Kennedy dwelt on at some length about going to the meeting in Lucca, the position then was quite abnormal and I do not think any arrangement would have catered for it.  There was no aircraft at Dublin Airport serviceable and capable of taking off because of the fog situation other than the single aircraft.  All Aer Lingus aircraft except one were at Shannon and other airports.  The aircraft at Dublin was unserviceable <Col N="481" /> and had to have an air test before it could be used.  It would have to take off and land again and, while it could take off, it could not land again because of the fog.  In the conditions prevailing there was no other aircraft that was capable of being flown out of the airport other than the single jet that happened to be going to London because the firm concerned were going there.  In those abnormal circumstances, it would have been very curious if I had not sought the assistance of the people concerned with a view to getting to London and making a connection there with an aircraft going to Milan.  When I arrived in London I found that, because of problems with the airline concerned, the plane to Milan was diverted to Naples and there was no way of getting to Lucca except to continue my journey by courtesy of the company concerned in their aircraft.  It seemed better to go than not to go.  It was an unforeseeable circumstance and, even if there had been an executive jet, I certainly would not have been using it on that occasion to travel considering the only people travelling were my wife and myself.  My wife was invited to the weekend meeting with the wives of the other Ministers.  Even if we had an executive jet, it would not have struck me as appropriate to incur on behalf of the taxpayers the expense of flying my wife and myself to Lucca when I could get there quite comfortably on a scheduled aircraft. Even if we had the jet I would not have been using it for that purpose and I would have been in exactly the same position.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage of the year to give precise figures of anything.  Even the Supplementary Estimate had to be an estimate of what the cost would be.  The position with regard to the EEC, as I have explained, in the Deputy's absence I think, is that the travel costs are refunded. The amount involved in 1974 was £4,000.  The amount we estimate to recoup this year is £11,000, although this includes some delayed recoupment for 1974.  This is in respect of my own Department, I think, but there are, of course, recoupments in respect of officials of other Departments as well. I am referring, naturally, to my own Department here.  I am dealing with my own Vote.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that the EEC refund relates to travel only going to and from specific meetings which we are entitled to get recoupment for.  It does not cover subsistence or any other costs.  It does not cover travel arising from Community activities but not attending Community meetings.  It does not, for example, cover any of the European Community Co-operation meetings or other international conferences related to the EEC and does not cover bilateral travel arising from our European activities, including the substantial bilateral travel undertaken by me as Irish Foreign Minister during the Presidency on visits which seemed to me beneficial to the country at the time when we held the Presidency of the Community.  The cumulative effect of all these would be very many times more than the single small item of <Col N="484" /> £11,000 for travel by my Department to and from Community meetings in Brussels refundable by the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course. I want to turn to the detention of Mr. Creegan.  A number of points were raised here.  I would like to deal with them as fully and also as calmly as I can.  First of all, I should like to say as a general statement that cases involving personal problems and difficulties of Irish citizens rank very high, indeed, not merely with the Department but with me as Minister and I believe this has always been the case and, indeed, I think this is the case generally throughout the world, that individual cases where somebody who is your citizen has been unfairly or wrongly or harshly treated or is in difficulties are cases to which a lot of ministerial time is given because of the intrinsic importance of the human person and in any case where there is a difficulty of this kind the Minister himself will usually involve himself to the fullest extent necessary to assist the person concerned.  That has been my practice as Minister not just in this case but in others.  I want to state that as a general issue at first because an attempt has been made in some of the things said to suggest that I as Minister am too busy doing other things of general concern and not sufficiently concerned with individual cases.  In fact, what happens is at times the other way round, that the problems of individual cases, because of their essentially personal character and often the urgency attached to them, do have to take up a disproportionate amount of time even at the expense of other urgent business and that is as it should be in any humane administration.</P>
      <P>On the particular case here, I did not fully understand Deputy Tunney's remarks about talking to me about it the first time.  He seemed at one point to say he did so in June, another time in May.  I am in some doubt about this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy had spoken to me in May, as he has twice in this House claimed that he did, I would quite possibly, had the date been May, have said to him that I did not know about it.  The fact is, of course, that he did not speak to me in May, despite his repeated assertions to the effect that he did.  He spoke to me in June.  At that time I, of course, knew about it and certainly did not say to him that I did not know about it because&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I recall that when I arrived at Luxembourg airport from Istanbul on the 16th questions were put to me by journalists because it had been featured in the papers two days previously. I answered those questions as best I could.  The Deputy hardly expects to be believed that having had that experience of these interviews I came into the House, talked to him and said I did not know about it.  Of course, I knew about it.</P>

He knows perfectly well that the contact was in June, not May, as he attempted to mislead this House into believing; that when he spoke to me in June it had been in the papers several days before that; that I had myself been interviewed by the papers about it and that I certainly did not say anything as stupid as that I did not know about it.  At that stage I was not familiar with all the details of the case.  The details of the case at that point were known to the Parliamentary Secretary because he had been present in Ireland during the ten days when I had been absent. The Deputy should not attempt to mislead the House in this way as to the timing of events or as to their nature.  So much for that.

Not only at the beginning but even after Deputy Tunney's behaviour had prejudiced this case we continued to assist him on my instructions.

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided, however, that although there was a danger that my facilitating Deputy Tunney further might adversely affect Mr. Creegan's case, I must take a chance on that because of my prior duty to a Deputy of this House and I instructed my officials therefore to seek interviews for him with the people he sought interviews <Col N="488" /> with, to facilitate him in a further visit to the prison, informing him once again of the conditions in respect of that visit that the Belgians had laid down, and those instructions were to my knowledge carried out.</P>
      <P>The Deputy did say here&mdash;it is the first time I have heard this allegation&mdash; that arrangements were made to meet only one of the two Ministries and not both of them.  If that is so, I was unaware of it and it was certainly not in accordance with the instructions I gave. That is the first time I heard it suggested that there was any failure to facilitate him in any respect in this whole affair.  The Deputy should not make allegations of that kind about my Department because I was determined that he would have no reason to complain about the assistance given to him even if it might not have been helpful in the particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Let me now come to the question of the conditions laid down by the Judge which is in the following form:</P>
      <P>Je me permets d'assister de que cette visite a lieu avec toute de discretion suitable.</P>
      <P>That was communicated to the Deputy, its implications of not making statements to the Press that would prejudice the case.  It was communicated to him by an official of my Department.</P>

      <P>Arrangements were made for this visit.  Subsequently Deputy Tunney was contacted in Amsterdam and told the position.  Subsequent to that the second visit came up.  I was concerned on the basis of the reports I had from my Embassy in Brussels as to the consequences for Mr. Creegan of the fact that Deputy Tunney had spoken to the Press after the first visit. Deputy Tunney has said that he did not tell the Press he was going there. My information is that that is correct. The information seems to have come from an officer, as I understand it, of the European political party with which Fianna Fáil is associated who had, I understand, informed the Press of his visit.  Just who on behalf of Deputy Tunney informed him of the visit, I do not know.  The visit was notified to the Press, as I understand it, in that way.  The journalists were accordingly outside at the instance of the European Progressive Democratic Party official and Deputy Tunney, despite being told of the requirement for discretion, spoke to the Press in terms which were not likely to encourage the Belgain authorities to be helpful in regard to the case.  The information I received subsequently, was that the impact of this was adverse and it may well have been&mdash;I was told by the Embassy in Brussels&mdash;a factor leading to the refusal to return his car and to the termination of visits by his fiancée. In those circumstances I instructed that Deputy Tunney be told in regard to the second visit once again of this condition and of the damage that could be done if it were breached.  He was so informed.</P>

      <P>Things were said by Deputy Tunney and by some newspapers which were not harmful but, by and large in cases like this, publicity on the facts is useful; abusive publicity is not and can be damaging and, in this instance, may well have led to a longer incarceration of Mr. Creegan than was in any way necessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seems to think I might have communicated with him. I think my recollection on this is clear &mdash;I do not want to be in any way incorrect&mdash;and my understanding is that I was informed in the United States that Deputy O'Kennedy had made a statement on the subject of Mr. Creegan's incarceration, at a point when I was preparing a statement because of the misrepresentations by Mr. Tunney of what had been done.  I instructed that the statement be prepared and issued, that it be communicated to Deputy O'Kennedy &mdash;who I knew was in the Soviet Union &mdash;and I instructed my Department to telex it to the Soviet Union and to get it to Deputy O'Kennedy before it would be issued.  I have heard for the first time now that Deputy O'Kennedy was in Novosibirsk and, in the absence of Irish diplomatic representation at consular level in that city, the message does not seem to have got to him in time.  I am very sorry if that was the case because it was my intention that the Deputy, as Shadow Minister&mdash;if he made a statement on this&mdash;should be communicated with at once on the subject.  I did so.  I am very sorry we did not get through to him.  Certainly it was not any fault of mine, nor I am sure of my Department, that he was not communicated with immediately.</P>

      <P>I apologise to the Deputy if he is unhappy with the <Col N="496" /> formulation there.  I agree that it could have been better expressed and should have been better expressed. The final point is that I visited the Creegans to tell them the news of their son's release.  I had seen them on a number of occasions in the Department before then.  The position was that we got a preliminary warning about half past four and I waited for confirmation until round about half past five.  I instructed that a statement be issued immediately to the papers and, having given that instruction, I realised that Mr. and Mrs. Creegan might possibly hear the news on the wireless.  They are not on the telephone.  It was too late to contact Mr. Creegan in the Government Department where he works and I thought it better to get the news to him before he would hear it on the wireless.  I cancelled a prior engagement and went straight to the Creegan home.  I did not communicate that to the Press.  I did not instruct anyone to communicate it to the Press.  The Press heard about my visit from the Creegans, who were grateful for my visit.  I am not aware that anyone in my Department communicated it to the Press.  I sought no publicity on that or on any other aspect of the case.  I thought it right that I should endeavour, having issued a statement, to make sure the parents heard about it first.  In fact, they heard it on a flash on the wireless three minutes before I reached them.  I did not seek any publicity and the Deputy knows that perfectly well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To return now to the question of the resolution in the United Nations raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, his reference was to Rhodesia in 1974.  I misunderstood him there.  In respect of this resolution, it is one in respect of which we abstained from voting.  It is one which relates to Britain's actions in Rhodesia.  The wording of the resolution seemed to us to require more of Britain than it was physically possible for Britain to perform and, therefore, <Col N="498" /> I had doubts about giving it full support. The spirit of it was entirely in accord with our views and I accordingly instructed that we abstain on that occasion.  The Deputy will appreciate, I know, how difficult these decisions are.  Apart from the personal considerations, perhaps the most difficult problem one has to face as Minister is a succession of resolutions in the United Nations, many of them ones with which one would agree in broad outline but containing, and this is increasingly true as the years go on, clauses which are objectionable in some way or another with which we cannot directly associate ourselves. This does pose great problems as to whether you abstain or vote for or against.  If you vote against then it is so objectionable you cannot have any association with it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised the question of the extent to which all this is done by my direction or otherwise.  The communication maintained on this is really very complete though there are obvious difficulties.  Sometimes resolutions are formulated at a very late stage indeed and one has to take a decision at a couple of hours' notice.  I recall, in fact, in 1974 the decision on PLO being allowed to speak in the General Assembly which was notified to us in Luxembourg.  The terms were finally notified to us when the Ministers were meeting and we were told the vote would take place anytime between seven o'clock and nine o'clock, and we had to sit down and make up our minds in the knowledge that by the time we had made up our minds our representatives might have had to vote.  This is in no way abnormal.  Subject to this, we discuss the kind of resolutions coming up and the general policy line to be followed. As the resolutions emerge or are likely to emerge I am consulted on the general line we will take.  We try to anticipate the particular form resolutions will take and give general instructions on the line to follow in the debate and how to seek to amend them to meet our particular views. When the resolution comes forward in final form and a vote is sought, if time permits&mdash;normally it does, but very narrowly&mdash;I am consulted to give <Col N="499" /> a decision.  There will be times when because of travel or something I will be unavailable at that particular moment.  At the same time, the preparatory work that goes on before the meeting and even during it is such that the officials, even though they cannot consult me, are able to interpret my views accurately, and I have never found any action taken in those rare circumstances when I have not been available for consultation contrary to what I would have done myself.  The time element is such that at times all nine Ambassadors in the United Nations have to decide before there is any possibility of getting their Ministers' views.  This involves very close co-ordination in advance to ensure that what is done will be in accord with those views.  I am very satisfied with the way the system works in view of all the strains and stresses and I stand over every decision taken&mdash;95 per cent of them by direct decision and in a few cases on the basis of what my views are understood to be.</P>

      <P>The only resolution we voted against in regard to South Africa&mdash;we supported a number of them&mdash;was one which contained this year for the first time a phrase referring to the illegitimacy of the racist regime in South Africa and which said that the racist regime in South Africa is illegitimate and has no right to represent the people of South Africa.  That represents in our view, and, in the view of our partners and a number of other countries, another attempt to challenge the right of a government to represent the country in the United Nations.  We had this over Israel, and our view is that the principle is that the government of a country shall be represented in the United Nations, that there shall be universal representation, regardless of what sort of regime it is and that this principle must be adhered to.  We saw the introduction of this phrase for the first time as an attempt to revive this issue, which has gone on for a long time, the attempt to expel South Africa, and because it was seen <Col N="501" /> in that light we and other countries felt obliged to vote against this resolution and made our position and reasons for doing so clear.  It was the only resolution we voted against; it was only on this occasion and only for this reason, a reason which I think the Deputy will respect and which on reflection he may share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read out the wording.... &ldquo;is illegitimate and has no right to represent the people of South Africa&rdquo;.  This is seen by this Government and by other Governments in other parts of the world as an attempt by another route to introduce the expulsion of South Africa and following that, of Israel, from the United Nations.  We are not prepared to agree that the universality of the United Nations should be threatened in this way, and cannot therefore accept that any resolution at the UN shall declare that some regime is illegitimate and has no right to represent its people.  Whatever we may think of the regime the system only works if the government of the country is there, can be talked to, and be under pressure to change its views.  That is what the United Nations is for and that is why we voted against that resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raised this issue and I wanted to explain to him the reasons for our position.  I am very glad he raised it because it is important that there should be no misunderstanding as to where we stand or about the reasons why on certain occasions our vote must be influenced by a particular part of a resolution which prevents us from giving it the support which in other respects we would wish to give it.  This is a perennial problem, and it has become a much worse problem in the past couple of years, the reason being that we and other countries whose views are certainly anti-racist have been forced into the position of being unable to support resolutions which in a different form in earlier years we were able to support.  This is part of a confrontatory effort by certain countries which is highly undesirable and which is, as we see in the case of the Zionist vote, greatly weakening the force of the fight against racism.  Our concern is to diminish this confrontation and through our diplomatic contacts with these countries to persuade them not to adopt tactics which are weakening the cause which we are all trying to serve in the interest not only of world peace but of ending racism in Africa and other parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy raised a point on Angola and expressed his very proper concern about the intervention of outside powers in this area.  I share his views on this point.  What has happened here has been a very prolonged liberation struggle in this territory in which different groups have formed and are strong in different parts of the country.  During this period of the liberation struggle these groups sought and received support from different outside powers so that now when Angola is independent these different groups are struggling to control Angola with the support of outside powers.  The history goes back a long way and I am not in a position to say what Government began the process <Col N="503" /> of foreign intervention in the preindependence period by supporting particular liberation movements.  Who-ever began it the result is pretty disastrous now with the Angolan people, in a sense, set against each other with the support of the great powers.  One can only hope that this situation will be brought to a peaceful and early conclusion so that a Government can be formed representing the whole people of Angola and that peace can be restored there.  Any influence we have&mdash;in matters of this kind it must be very small&mdash;must be directed towards that end.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the cross-Border study.  I listened attentively to what he had to say but I had difficulty at the end of it in detecting the exact burden of his complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened carefully to see exactly what I had done wrong to annoy the Deputy and at the end of his speech I was still not clear on what it was.  The matter was raised by our Government, by the Taoiseach, with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Health, in September, 1973 at Baldonnel. Agreement in principle was reached on having a regional development study of the north-west, financed partly by the Commission.  Subsequently, a suggestion was made on the British side that there might be another study of the north-east and we naturally welcomed this.  This was in the days when the Assembly in Northern Ireland was seeking to establish an Executive.  When the <Col N="504" /> Executive was established a draft outline of the study was forwarded by the Taoiseach to the Chief Executive in Northern Ireland in January, 1974. It was also transmitted by the embassy in London to the Department of Trade and Industry at the same time. Mr. Faulkner replied to the Taoiseach in February expressing doubts as to the practical value of such a wide and comprehensive study and suggested that the proposal be reassessed in the Council of Ireland context.  This effectively prevented further progress pending discussions on the Council of Ireland.  The whole situation was changed then by the Ulster workers' strike and the fall of the Executive.</P>
      <P>The matter was taken up again by us with the British Government when the Executive had fallen and was discussed with the British Prime Minister on 1st and 21st November, 1974 when a reiteration of the agreement in principle to the study was secured. I replied to a question of the Deputy's on 7th November after the meeting in London with the British Prime Minister and before the meeting here on 21st November.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not. Will the Deputy allow me to explain? I will recite the situation fully if the Deputy will allow me to do so.  On 1st November at meeting in London we managed to get a reaffirmation of the agreement in principle and this was reaffirmed on 21st November, 1974.  However, some weeks after that, on December 12, 1974, the British Government proposed two subjects for study&mdash;a fisheries study and a study of the future development of Derry Port in relation to its hinterland.  We regarded the fisheries study as useful in its own right but not representing the kind of study we had in mind and had agreed on <Col N="505" /> originally.  The question of Derry Port which had been studied a number of times already by different groups did not seem to us to be a cross-Border study of an economic kind which was the sort we looked for although it would obviously have considered the hinterland of the port. It did not seem to us to be on a scale commensurate with the obligation that was acceptable to the British Government in 1973 and, again, in 1974.  Therefore, the matter was reviewed at official level and has been reviewed sedulously since then though without much progress until the second half of the current year when I made further efforts directly to get something moving and to get a certain amount of willingness on the British side to shift and widen the scope of the proposal in order to make of it something closer to what was envisaged originally by the two Governments.</P>

      <P>Because I was not asked for that information.  All we had from the British at that stage was a proposal which was not consonant with what we had proposed, and we were arguing with them that the proposals should be changed in order to take the form we had sought.  We have not accepted their proposal.  We were not accepting it as adequate.  The Deputy did not ask whether there were counter proposals but asked what was the position about the proposal that had been made.  The position was that we were still negotiating it and were negotiating it until two weeks ago.</P>

      <P>What I said was that a proposal for a study of the possibilities in relation to fisheries and also for a study of possible development of the port of Derry were regarded by the Government as inappropriate and inadequate substitutes for a general survey of the north-west and that, therefore, the Government had pursued the original proposals.  The one we sought was in respect of the north-east.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and another Deputy, also, raised the question of Spain.  One of the questions I was asked in this regard was when the ambassadors of the other EEC countries returned to Madrid.  The information is as follows: on September 27th last the ambassadors left Madrid except for the Italian Ambassador who left on the 28th.  The UK and German Ambassadors returned there on 8th October, the Danish and Belgian <Col N="509" /> Ambassadors returned on 10 October, the Dutch Ambassador returned on the 11th and while I am not sure of the date of the return of the Italian Ambassador I can say that it was before October 15th.  The position in relation to France is that the French Ambassador was not recalled because he was on vacation in France at the time.  However, the French Government expressed strong views on the subject of the tactic employed by some Community members in withdrawing their ambassadors, and they gave the strongest support possible to the Irish position in this matter.  So far as Luxembourg is concerned, they have no ambassador in Madrid, and while I cannot be certain on this my opinion is that had the Luxembourg Government had an Ambassador in Spain they would not have withdrawn him.  I say this from the information at my disposal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When did the French Ambassador return from Madrid?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He was on holidays when the situation arose which led to the withdrawal of some ambassadors, but the French Government made it clear that they disproved of the withdrawal of ambassadors.  The information the Deputy attributed to him was absolutely incorrect.  As far as the withdrawal of ambassadors is concerned my view was and remains&mdash;and I communicated my advice from the United States to the Taoiseach and the Government&mdash;that the suggestion made by several Foreign Ministers in New York informally that they were going to withdraw ambassadors and their request to us as to what we would do was one which should have been replied to by saying that we did not think it was a good thing to withdraw ambassadors, that to do so would be likely to increase the strength of the right wing in Spain because of the ease with which xenophobia can be aroused in that country.  Moreover, the early return of the ambassadors, which would <Col N="510" /> have to take place with a view to having them in position there to prepare for the change of regime, would merely make the position worse, would make the Spanish right wing free to think they had secured some kind of victory in forcing the countries concerned to climb down.  For these reasons I recommended that we should not withdraw our ambassador.  As I say that view was strongly endorsed by the French Government and I think it was also the view of the Luxembourg government.  Other governments have privately indicated since then that they made a mistake and we were right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We better have those governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy rejects what I am saying.  I am entitled to say what I know to be true.  If the Deputy does not accept it he need not. So much for the ambassadors.  The Deputy raised the question of why we agreed to suspend trade relations with Spain.  The answer to that is that we did not.  The position about the trade negotiations with Spain is that these negotiations are undertaken by the Commission on a mandate given to them by the Council.  The Commission have the right to continue or not to continue these negotiations as they see fit.  This is the juridical position.</P>
      <P>The Commission decided not to continue the negotiations for a period. They asked that the Council would consider this and endorse their action. The Council considered it.  The Irish position was stated by the Parliamentary Secretary, who was attending the meeting on my behalf.  He made a plea for rational discussion.  He said that to break off trade talks would have the same disadvantages as withdrawing ambassadors because at a later stage we would have to decide when to renew them again.  For how long would they be suspended and on what grounds would they be resumed?  He raised those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a debate in which other countries who had different views took part.  Several countries strongly supported our views on this subject.  The Parliamentary Secretary, speaking again at the end, said that Ireland is <Col N="511" /> not and cannot be dispassionate about the Franco regime, that we look forward to democracy in Spain.  He inquired what was the aim of the Community policy on Spain.  The emotional gratification of public opinion now of forty years ago should not be put before a rational policy.  Protests have reinforced support for Franco.  The Spanish were proud and could be resentful about outside condemnation. Following the Irish intervention and that of other countries, which did not think the suspension of trade negotiation was wise, the council did not agree to endorse the Commission's reaction but simply confined themselves to noting that talks cannot be continued at present in view of the Commission's attitude.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is misinformed in thinking that our Government or the Community as such has endorsed this decision.  There are other reasons why I think the decision is inappropriate. The fact is under the present situation when there is no agreement with the Community, Spain derives a number of economic advantages.  These advantages derive from the fact that a country like ours, Britain and Denmark have not in the past imposed tariffs on certain imports from Spain, for example oranges, a very large import. The trade negotiations will lead to an agreement under which we will have to impose the common Community duty on these goods.  Therefore, when the negotiations are concluded, Spain, in respect of oranges and in relation to the overall balance of trade, will be worse off rather than better off as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>This is a complicated issue and I do not want to develop it at any great length here.  The fact is that Britain and Denmark have not so far fulfilled their commitments to increase these tariffs.  We did so according to our Community obligations.  Last year I notified the Council and these countries that we could not continue to be in a position where we fulfilled our obligations and they did not fulfil them, but are put in a better position as regards the price of oranges and benefit Spain accordingly.  I made it <Col N="512" /> clear that we could not accept this. I have recently reiterated this and asked that the commitments entered into last December by these countries should be fulfilled, otherwise I do not think we can continue to fulfil our commitments if they are not willing to honour theirs.  I have made that clear, and the matter comes up for discussion on the 9th December.  The position under which trade negotiations are suspended by countries which are withdrawing their Ambassadors and which feel it is important to take action against Spain is that they are in fact, by not having an agreement and by not implementing the Community obligations, benefiting Spain.  This is a situation which I cannot accept as a member of the Community and it is something which I said will have to be discussed further on the 9th December.  On this point the Deputy has been misinformed.  The position is quite different from the one he understood to exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  There are a few other points I want to deal with in the small amount of time remaining.  One Deputy raised the question of ownership of embassies. Our policy is to move as far as possible towards ownership because the long term effect on the costs of an official, if one is renting a building, where the rent can be put up and up with inflation, is enormous.  We try as rapidly as capital permits to acquire embassies, but obviously this is not always the highest priority in the public capital programme and it has necessarily to be a slow process.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies raised the case of the boy who was killed in an accident in Switzerland and said that our Department said they could be of no assistance.  The Department said that there was no provision for the payment of the expenses of burial or the return of the remains to this country from public funds.  There is no question of the Department being unhelpful. In these cases the officials of the Department go out of their way to be of any assistance and comfort to the people concerned, but we are bound by the legal provisions and we are not entitled to use public funds for this purpose.  In those circumstances we try to assist in any way we can.  We try to ensure that the cost is minimised, to advise what will be the least costly way of handling the problem, to give assistance to people who go out there and try to deal with it, but we are not in a position to use public funds for this purpose.  I regret that this House should suggest that the Department, in carrying out their obligation in respect of public expenditure, are being unhelpful to people who have been affected by tragedy of this kind.  Nothing could be further from the case.</P>
