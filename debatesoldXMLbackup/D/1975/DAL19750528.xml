    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I could assist the Minister.  He was dealing with a point I had raised on subsection (9) in regard to a forfeited deposit of purchase money.  The subsection provides that where a deposit of purchase money on sale is forfeited, that money is to be deemed to be disposal and acquisition and subject to capital gains tax.  I questioned whether this was consistent with other provisions in the Bill to which the Minister had referred from time to time, specifically the provision that a disposal of money or currency is not subject to capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="986" /> The Minister was arguing there was more involved here than money, that there were rights under contract, rights to property normally.  I suggest that when the deposit is forfeited the question of right to property has ceased because the contract has been terminated and the deposit has then been forfeited.  What is involved is simply a money transaction.  So far we have been dealing with the person who received the forfeited deposit but I want the Minister to say what is the position of the person who loses the deposit: is he entitled to claim the amount of the deposit so lost as an allowable loss?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The position is that the person to whom the money is forfeited has made a gain out of the property because he has sold to another person the right to acquire the property.  The person who forfeits has no capital asset on which he has suffered a loss.  The right is extinguished through its non-exercise.  He has no capital asset and, therefore, has no loss to set off but the other person has a property on which a gain has been made and, therefore, has had a capital gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In an earlier section the Minister said he would not allow cash deals as allowable losses but I do not think the Revenue Commissioners can have it both ways.  In one section it is maintained that a cash transaction will not be an allowable loss and then we come to another section where there is a cash transaction.  How often have we seen a deposit placed on a property at auctions and so forth and a person fails to raise the necessary money to carry through the deal? This is strictly a cash transaction but the Minister builds it into a capital gain under this section, while at the other end a man who loses his deposit &mdash;he could have other property&mdash;will not be allowed to claim it as a capital loss.  I do not think the Minister is consistent.  It is a cash transaction. The Minister has stated that cash transactions are not allowable losses, yet we come to this section where a man takes an option and puts a deposit <Col N="987" /> on property, if he fails to raise the necessary money to go through with the deal, the Minister says the deposit is a capital gain.  There is no consistency between the two previous sections and this one, but to make matters worse the Minister is not allowing a chargeable loss to a man that may already have one or two properties and who borrows from the bank to put a deposit on a new property for which he fails to raise the necessary cash.  Surely there is a case there for an allowable loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that a person who makes any profit out of an option should pay tax, I felt yesterday that in this discussion there was a certain amount of bitterness or hatred against people who might be in this option market or who might be involved in a speculation.  There are many people who sell shares.  If they can buy them at a lower rate they can sell them at a profit and if they cannot buy them at a lower rate they must pay a higher rate and lose.  It is a risk.</P>
      <P>However, on this question of options, say there are 11 properties in a deal.  If a property manager said tomorrow morning: &ldquo;I am going to buy them&rdquo; those involved would all look for treble the price, but if he gets an option on, say, half or one-third of them and goes along to the remainder and says: &ldquo;Your property is worth £X as it is.  Developed it is worth £2X, which I am willing to give you&rdquo;, if ten people agree and one refuses, the one person who refuses may be blackmailing the property manager and holding out for, say, six times the amount.  Therefore he cannot go ahead with the development. If he has paid 10 per cent of £1 million, he has paid £100,000 on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these people who get £10,000 each pay income tax on it, but the man who pays £100,000, the man who is needed to get all these people together, if he sells all his options, he pays tax on it; if he develops the property he pays capital gains on it, or if it is a company they pay normal <Col N="988" /> tax plus corporation profits tax.  If a person takes this risk I cannot see why he is not allowed on it, whether he is an individual or sets up a £100 company to do it.  If he puts in the money and loses it it should be chargeable as a loss.  If this is a company that is in a capital gains position, does the Minister intend that they should get no allowance for the losses on options on such properties as I have spoken about?</P>
    <P>Furthermore, if you are a trading company, you pay tax in the normal way and you are not in for a capital gain, but in a straightforward business, if you buy the property with the intention of developing it and fail to develop it, are you allowed tax on your losses on the option?  I agree with the section in so far as it deals with people who are just in and out, but there are people who are legitimately in the business, and areas would not be developed without them. Dublin city is crying out for development of flats rather than business properties. It would be a retrograde step if a person who was prepared to buy property in a package deal and then develop it was prevented from doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man pays £100,000 on a property worth £1 million and one person refuses to deal with him, the development cannot take place.  He pays £100,000 reasonably hoping that he will get planning permission. Supposing the planning permission is refused, are the Government going to charge tax in such a situation?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is depicting a scene in which a person <Col N="989" /> loses £100,000 because he does not exercise the option.  The reason why he does not exercise the option is irrelevant here, whether it is planning permission or because he changes his mind or anything else.  He is abandoning the option here and he has a loss in the situation depicted, and this would be an allowable loss.</P>

      <P>is disposed of or abandoned, then&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is very easy, indeed, to fabricate losses by arrangement. Persons could arrange with other persons in their confidence to have a contract under which losses would be fabricated and deposits forfeited by agreement.  It would be impossible to police developments of that kind.</P>

      <P>I agree in the case of fabrication.  What the Minister is talking about is where somebody who has a loss transfers it to somebody else.  But if an individual has a genuine loss in an occasional transaction, since if he had made a gain he would be chargeable, he should be able to charge a loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the difficulties of collection and policing but here, again, I should like to urge on the Minister the importance of working on the principle and not trying to close every conceivable loophole because you will leave some big gap in any case.  This is the sure way to do it.</P>
      <P>First, there is a principle in this Act that capital gains are to be taxed and I think there is universal acquiescence in that but the Minister has emphasised that, as the obverse of the coin, allowable capital losses will be set off against capital gains.  I leave it to my colleagues to deal with actual details, Deputy Belton, Deputy Dockrell or Deputy Fitzpatrick, and I shall try to deal with the legal principles because we are making law. If that is the principle of the legislation, it is important to apply it universally. That raises the first practical difficulty which we understand, the difficulty of the Revenue Commissioners when they are up against people indulging in planned avoidance of the provisions and the difficulty of policing.  Policing difficulties restrict all of us in the community whether it is policing for the Revenue or for crime.  The next principle one would rule is that there be fairness in the restriction.  Every effort must be made to see that no person is penalised or no group penalised or put at a disadvantage more than another.</P>
      <P>I see that principle being infringed here as I have mentioned on earlier sections.  Here, for anti-avoidance purposes a situation will develop where some genuine people will be penalised in that they will be liable for gains but will not get the equity available to others under a provision which will be exploited by the people on whom the Minister is concentrating. The genuine people will be penalised as against others.</P>
      <P>To encourage the friendliness and usefulness of the discussion we have had I want to tell a story that once happened in the old days.  It will illustrate the futility of trying to foresee everything and block every outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the county of Dublin 50 or 100 years ago, it was the custom in a certain <Col N="993" /> town for the boys and girls on Hallowe'en night to go around with a stalk of cabbage and bang the doors. There was a cranky old dame in one house who was utterly determined that no one would bang her door and she went to all the trouble of having the door taken off and brought beside her at the hob.  She sat there guarding the door and said: &ldquo;They won't bang my door tonight&rdquo; but what happened? One of the girls, the least expected of anyone, quietly came in and said: &ldquo;Goodnight, Maggie; aren't there terrible noises around?&rdquo; Suddenly out came the cabbage stalk and banged the door and out she went.  The door was banged all the same.  The Minister and the Revenue Commissioners can never block or prevent everything and the more the Minister goes on with this, the more his door is going to be banged and this is what I have been fighting on all these sections.  I know that the Minister has not got unduly irritated by my insistence but it is an awfully important point.</P>
    <P>What is really activating the Minister here, it seems to me, is not any particular desire to penalise anybody. In answer to Deputy Belton, he has brought out the dangers, but I am going to ask him on the principle: can he not face this without going to the extent of making an exception in the general principle of the Act of allowing losses where a person is in principle chargeable for gains?  I will even concede that certain very clear cases might force something like this but not, I think, where <i>bona fide</i> and genuine business or transactions are concerned.  That is my plea to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Secondly, on the section as a whole, the Minister will recall that I said last night, and say again, that this is a necessary section as it goes, and Deputy Colley, I think, joined with me in that, but we have to look at its provisions and try to make it a better section than it is in the Bill. I want to be assured that it is not revenue-getting that is involved here. Here is a question which we have not asked the Minister very much so far on the Bill and I refrained from asking <Col N="994" /> it but the type of thing envisaged here may involve very big monetary transactions and I do not completely accept that this section is merely included to be explicit on action and prevent abuse.  I have a feeling that revenue considerations may come into this.  In other words, it is definitely a taxation section and the Minister hopes to get a significant contribution, and particularly what I might call an economic contribution, from this.</P>
    <P>To explain what I mean, and I do not wish to appear to be making a Second Reading speech, certain taxes give a high return and are easy to administer&mdash;PAYE, for instance.  Here the cost of collecting has been virtually handed over to the private citizen and it is not difficult to police it and it has a very high content of return. Something the same could be said about VAT.  A capital gains tax can be a less remunerative tax, for tax it is, however dressed up in social conscience, and none better than the Minister to give it a very good look from that point of view.  It is taxation, however dressed up, and the Revenue Commissioners are obviously concerned with enforcement because in this whole capital section in the end the assessment is placed on the taxpayer and the sanctions are there to see that he pays.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside that aspect however, I should like to know how much in relation to this section the revenue element comes in.  If it is a case, and this is the crunch, that it is anticipated that considerable sums will come in under this head and although nobody wants to say it explicitly, the allowing of losses would decrease the contribution or leave it too uncertain, that is a policy matter and should be stated positively.  Note my &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;.  The Minister will understand that there are no imputations in this.  I am merely trying to dissect the problems which have arisen on this section.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that there are three problems on the section, which we all agree should be in the Bill in one form or another.  The first is&mdash; and I ask the Minister to answer this general policy question first&mdash;why can <Col N="995" /> we not continue to apply the general principle of setting off allowable losses against allowable gains in this area?  If there are specific cases where it is necessary to modify that principle, the Minister should say specifically what they are.  The Minister would shorten our discussion and help us greatly if he could do so policy-wise and, in fact, answer the question.</P>
    <P>Secondly&mdash;we know that there is a lot of anti-avoidance in this section, that that is nearly the purpose of the section&mdash;would he say&mdash;I am only guessing when I put the question but I am still entitled to ask it and to get an answer&mdash;is there a significant revenue element here and, if so, would the allowance for losses significantly influence the position?  Let us have the answers to these questions before we get lost in further discussion.</P>

      <P>I understand the position but I did not get involved in the discussion because I would need to be practising in a solicitor's office daily to argue the matter fully.  I accept some of what the Minister has stated.  A person who buys property is in it to make a capital gain and he is willing to pay 26 per cent tax but if he loses, and he can lose for many reasons other than his own bad judgment, he should be able to use that loss against a capital gain in the future.  If of 11 people involved in a scheme one does not come across with the result that the scheme has to be abandoned and there is a loss of £100,000 the Minister has said if a person who suffers that loss is in for the first time, is a gambler, he does not see why he should get an allowance. I do to an extent.  It is usual <Col N="996" /> that such a person gets options for a sizeable amount and he must be backed by a strong company.  While the options are being prepared, it must be remembered that planning permission for the development of the area has not been sought or obtained from the planning authority.  The planning authority may then say they want a road to go through the property because of the provision of Government offices there.</P>
      <P>When the planning authority place a CPO on the property the person is stuck with a loss of £100,000.  He will get some of it back with the houses up the middle but he will get none of it back from the development on either side.  This loss has occurred through no fault of that person; it has occurred because the planning authority interfered. That person, who was willing to pay capital gains tax, is then faced with a capital loss.  If a local authority held up the passing of plans, that person could be put into an unprofitable position, a position he did not foresee and for which he is not allowed anything. I accept that the Minister is endeavouring to stop the fly-by-night individual but the person I have spoken of is not catered for.  The person who sells his 10 per cent after paying the Minister his tax and then loses that 10 per cent afterwards should be allowed something on it.  I can understand how this works with a trading company.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am confused as to what the Minister said in regard to trading companies.  I should like to give an example.  Mr. A. has an hotel and he buys a site from Mr. B. for £8,000 to build another hotel.  Mr. B. owns a public house apart from the site.  Mr. A. fails to find the rest of the money and loses his deposit of £8,000.  That person then sells his hotel.  As I see it, he cannot write off that loss of £8,000 against the capital gain of £20,000 which he makes on the sale of the hotel.  If Mr. B. sells the site that he has taken the £8,000 for and makes a capital gain of £20,000 the £8,000 will be added to the £20,000 and become a £28,000 capital gain.  Is that the correct interpretation?</P>

      <P>Yes, but not backwards. So far as the non-trade transactions are concerned it is most unlikely that there will be any hardship by reason of the operation of this section. I cannot say what the revenue element is; we do not know.  We do not know the number of transactions of this kind here because there has been no obligation to bring this to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners hitherto.  As ordinary men of the world, we know these transactions occur.</P>

      <P>In so far as it will be operated to discourage avoidance it means there will be a revenue return.  There could be a situation in which a person has a capital gain of £5,000 and he could arrange with ten <Col N="998" /> other people a scheme under which ten deposits of £500 each would be forfeited to ten others.  Those £500 lots of themselves would not be taxable because they would be below the limit and who can say whether or not money passing in that situation on paper would not be handed back in more casual locations and would not come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners? There could be a situation then of having ten fabricated losses being used to prevent a charge on a gain of £5,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the position but one might generate these over a number of years in anticipation of gains in such a way as not to make the evidence readily available to the Revenue Commissioners.  I will look at the points made here to see if we can tackle this matter in some other way. The genuine case where there is not a fabrication of losses and which is not designed primarily as an avoidance device might deserve different treatment if hardship were caused.  I doubt very much if there would be hardship in many of the cases that have been described, but neither would I want any element of significant hardship. &ldquo;Hardship&rdquo; is an emotive word and it is a condition that is difficult to calculate.  People seldom talk about taxes without using the word &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; and they seldom talk of a loss without calling it a hardship.  It is not necessarily something that causes all that much pain or disturbance.  However, I should like some time to think about the points that were raised and if it is possible to have a different way of treating these issues, I will be disposed to consider it for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to subsection (5) on a number <Col N="1004" /> of occasions and I would like some further clarification on the subsection. The subsection refers to two kinds of options:</P>
      <P>(a)  an option to subscribe for shares in a company, or</P>
      <P>(b)  an option to acquire assets exercisable by a person intending to use them, if acquired, for the purposes of a trade carried on by him.</P>
      <P>The section then goes on to say that if an option of either kind is disposed of or abandoned certain things will happen.  If it is abandoned &ldquo;the abandonment shall, nothwithstanding subsection (3), constitute the disposal of an asset (namely, of the option). . . &rdquo;. The Schedule provides that restriction of allowable expenditure for wasting assets shall not apply and accordingly subsection (4) shall not apply to such an option as is mentioned in paragraph (a).  Perhaps that is clear to the Minister but it is certainly not clear to me because the subsection is dealing with two kinds of assets.  It provides that, in the event of an option of either kind being abandoned, then so and so shall happen but it does not say what happens if it is disposed of. Furthermore, it seems to apply some parts of the subsection and previous subsections to one kind of option and not to the other.  Whatever the intention is, what is purported to be achieved in this is anything but clear. I would, in particular, like the Minister to spell out precisely where the question of the loss resulting from the abandonment of an option is treated as an allowable loss.  It says here if the option is abandoned the abandonment shall, notwithstanding subsection (3), constitute the disposal of an asset . . . &rdquo; would the Minister pursue that a little further and spell out precisely how that produces the situation of an allowable loss because the next part says that the allowable expenditure in respect of a wasting asset does not apply while the next part seems to apply only to shares.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am a little bit confused now about this point.  Let us take the case that we were taking.  There have been strangers, without naming names or giving indications, who have come along in this country in recent years and who have promoted industrial activity because they had capital resources or who were motivated by social reasons or, perhaps, if one wants to be cynical, the reasons that motivated them were personal reasons but that motivation caused them to do good.  It is not unknown that such a person has been willing to come in and take a company or a business which was failing, revive it and deal with it.  This is the case that I want to focus on.  On the point we are currently discussing I am not quite clear how this section applies to him if he proceeds to deal with it by way of option.  He may want to deal with it by way of option to gain time or to resolve uncertainties and to keep things going.</P>
      <P>I can think of a case in this city of many, many years ago.  I will not indicate it but it cannot possibly cause any emotions now.  It was a case where somebody of the nature described, a very well-known citizen, did come and revive in this kind of way at least one industry that I have in mind which today is still flourishing as a result of that intervention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to know how this affects the encouragement to people. I think that is the net point which <Col N="1006" /> Deputy Fitzgerald could have made in order on this section.  There is a further point but, perhaps, until the Minister answers that one I will reserve it.</P>

      <P>I agree completely. It is still relevant from the point of view of encouragement.  For instance, let me be more specific.  I may wish to take an option on some assets&mdash;I am saying &ldquo;assets&rdquo; now&mdash; for time but also for social reasons and I am faced with the fact that I may be liable for a gain but I am going to take a certain risk and I will not be in a position to set off an allowable loss.  I think that is the net point.  I am not going outside the rules of order when I say that that is a disincentive. We have on other sections discussed social reasons.  I have not even mentioned the social reasons.  I am leaving it as abstract as that.  I am asking the Minister does he take the point or what is his answer?  He has mentioned subsection (5) as his answer.  When I get that answer, I will come on to the technical point.</P>

The fact that he did it for social and humanitarian reasons would not disqualify him from the relief in respect of a trade.  Here we are going into an area of trying to analyse motivation and trying to calculate whether or not a man is sensible to be engaging in certain transactions. Quite clearly, we cannot legislate for those situations.  The Revenue Commissioners would look at the facts of every case.  They would not deny a man his right to claim a capital loss merely because from a business point of view they may consider his original investment to be an imprudent one even if motivated by the best possible charitable reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister is, so to speak, accepting some of the points I made earlier.  What we want to avoid here is the tying up.  This section might unduly tie the Revenue Commissioners.  The powers that are given them in certain provisions are necessary, as we said at the beginning of the discussion on this section, but I would like to feel that the Revenue Commissioners were not tied.  In this case the specific nature of the proposed legislation does tie the Revenue Commissioners. Of course, I agree with <Col N="1008" /> the Minister that we cannot legislate for motivation.  What we must do is have regard to the general consequences of our legislation both social and taxwise.</P>
      <P>The Minister is shoving an open door with me when he talks about relying on the judgment and discretion of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then he has to provide for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He has to provide for that.  I would like him to look at subsection (5) from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners in the context in which I am talking. Paragraph (b), to which Deputy Colley referred, says:</P>
      <P>an option to acquire assets exercisable by a person intending to use them, if acquired for the purposes of a trade carried on by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case I have visualised, again taking it in the abstract, a person, he might be one of our citizens who has done well abroad or somebody who has come here and become naturalised&mdash;I am thinking of a very famous person in the oil world who was a great benefactor of this country years ago&mdash;comes in and is not carrying on a trade or business in that sense and he certainly will not acquire the assets for the purposes of a trade carried on by him.  If, for instance, Deputy Fitzpatrick is running a business making glass marbles and he gets into difficulty and I am somebody who has capital; perhaps I was fortunate in diamond mining in South Africa, although I cannot think of anything more remote from possibility than that; this man has the capital and has returned to this country.  He is probably motivated by personal reasons. He is ready to save that industry and the employment in it.  He has to act immediately.  This is very often a consideration in options.  It is a genuine device for taking quick action where the whole commitment cannot be effected in the time.  This person may be engaged in business plus philantrophy. He will intervene in this in a way that cannot possibly be captured by the phrase &ldquo;purpose of a <Col N="1009" /> trade carried on by him&rdquo;.  This man probably never saw a glass marble since the day he played with them in an Irish schoolyard.  He will not be acquiring this business for the purpose of a trade carried on by him. Therefore, I fail to see that subsection (5) will cover him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he will look at an amendment but he is getting to an amendment which brings in a double question of intention. This subsection talks about a person intending to use the options.  If the Minister is to cover the kind of case highlighted by Deputy Fitzgerald and now by Deputy de Valera he will also have to provide by way of an amendment not only for his intention in regard to the use of the assets but for his intention to carry on a trade.</P>
      <P>It is not quite legislation for motivation but it is getting very close to it, the thing the Minister said could not be done.  It is legislating for intention. The more I look at subsection (5) the more unintelligible I find it.  There are a number of other difficulties involved in it as well but I do not want to pursue them at the moment and perhaps take away the Minister's thoughts from what Deputy de Valera said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Colley said, I said I will have a look at it.  I can accept there can be such situations but we all know how impossible it is to try to draw up a Bill to treat every known tax difficulty and every hypothetical one as well.  There is no reason why we would not anticipate in the future, if some hardship case was thrown up or some case in which a philanthrophist was being unfairly dealt with, that we would not amend the law.  I would much prefer to think that we were legislating now in a perfect way so that further amendment was not necessary.  I have indicated my readiness to have a look at this as long as we can be assured that any provision in relation to future conduct will not be available for use in a way which would lead to abuse. Obviously, if an option is not exercised the query then arises as to why it was not exercised.  This goes to the very root perhaps of the original intention, <Col N="1010" /> particularly if the person had not been engaging in the marble trade beforehand.  I will certainly look at it. I am anxious to assist a genuine case such as that illustrated by Deputies de Valera and Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that it is not to tie the Revenue Commissioners by law here but to give them power and discretion. That is what motivated me in raising the last point.  I would be absolutely satisfied with cases like that provided they were not tied hand and foot.  I would fear the section would do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to again refer the Minister to subsection (5).  I have been trying to make some sense of it. I am trying to simplify it as it appears. It states that where an option is of the kind specified and it is disposed of or abandoned then under (1) if the option is abandoned, (2) paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 and so on shall not apply.  Would the Minister tell me if it is intended that paragraph (i) will apply only in the case of abandonment and that paragraph (ii) is intended to apply in the case of disposal or abandonment?  On the face of it, it does not appear to be drafted that way, but is that the intention of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first one says an abandonment is a disposal.  As it is a disposal paragraph 9 shall not apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought at first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point Deputy Colley is making is why use the words &ldquo;disposed of or abandoned&rdquo; if it only relates to abandonment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) treats of the disposal of a transfer.  This appears to be purporting to treat disposal or abandonment although subparagraphs (i) and (ii) appear to be relating only to abandonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may be raising a drafting point.  I do not think it is very much more.</P>

    <Col N="1011" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taking this in stages.  If the Minister goes on to look at the proviso he will see the matter becomes even more complex.  It goes on to say: &ldquo;Provided that the provisions of this subsection do not apply in the case of such an option as is mentioned in paragraph (a),&rdquo; unless it is of a particular kind.  Paragraph (a) provides for an option to subscribe for shares in a company.  Subsection (4) deals with a disposal by way of transfer of an option binding the grantor to sell or buy shares or securities which have a quoted market value. This proviso goes on to say that what has been said already will not apply, although you would think it was saying it would apply, to options to subscribe for shares in companies unless it is a certain kind of option.</P>
      <P>The more I look at this the more I think this subsection is virtually inapplicable because so many convulutions come about to try to cover all sorts of things.  I am certain it could be drafted more simply.  It is a crucial subsection having regard to the point raised by various Deputies, including Deputy Belton.  The Minister relied on it to assure him that the kind of case the Deputy was talking about would not be affected.  It transpired that the kind of case the Deputy was talking about would be affected in certain circumstances.  Then the Minister relied on subsection (5) in regard to a person acquiring assets for the purpose of a trade carried on by him, but we have established that that is not sufficient.  The Minister has agreed that that would have to be amended to meet the kind of cases we are talking about.</P>
      <P>The whole subsection in my view is so drafted as to make it almost unintelligible. Instead of putting things in and then taking them out, it must be possible to start from scratch and draft it in some way that would be simpler and more to the point and on which we could rely.  It is quite a crucial section.  Since the Minister will have to do some redrafting I take it he will have it looked at from scratch.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  I want to come back to subsection (9).  Apart from the points raised earlier, I want to ask the Minister about another point. In the case of a deposit being forfeited under, say, an ordinary contract for sale of property, as I understand it the provision at the moment is that the would-be vendor who receives the forfeited deposit becomes liable to capital gains tax on that, whereas the would-be purchaser who loses the deposit is not allowed the deposit which is lost as an allowable loss.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person becoming liable to capital gains tax&mdash;in other words, the would-be vendor&mdash;will he be allowed as a deduction from the amount of the forfeited deposit the expenses which he has incurred and, in particular, the interest which he has incurred?  I presume he will not because I think the interest is precluded under Schedule 3.  In the normal way as the Minister well knows&mdash;I think it is true to say that in law&mdash;the vendor is not entitled to the deposit as a forfeited deposit unless he can show that it represents liquidated and ascertained damages which he has suffered.  In other words, he can show that is the measure of his loss.  If he shows that is the measure of his loss should he, in fact, be subject to capital gains tax on this?  I think the Minister will agree that legally he is not entitled to the deposit unless he can show it is a measure of his loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly we have to treat forfeited deposits in a similar way to options or else all options would become forfeited deposits.  I would not go all the way with Deputy Colley in relation to deposits in contracts for sale.  A great deal will depend on the provisions of each particular contract. Of course they can vary.  There might be an absolute forfeiture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;irrespective of whether the vendor suffered any loss. Compensation for damages would not involve an element of capital gains if it was no more than compensation for expenses which had been incurred. Supposing compensation included an <Col N="1013" /> element of the higher price which the vendor would have received if the original sale had taken place than the price which the vendor received when the subsequent sale took place, in such a case the vendor would obviously enjoy a greater gain by the enforcement of the provisions of the first contract than he would enjoy if the first contract had not existed at all.  To that extent there would be a gain element over and above the compensation for expenses actually incurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley raised the point as to whether the total amount of the forfeited deposit has to be taken into account.  It seems to me that a case can be argued, and no doubt it will be argued, that the only element which should be taken into account is the element of net price gain as distinct from compensation for costs actually incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the right principle but I am not so sure that is what the subsection says.  In fairness to the Minister he was thinking on his feet. I suggest he came up with the right conclusion but I do not think that is what the subsection provides.</P>

Would the Minister have a look at the word &ldquo;as&rdquo; in that context?  Subsection (1) provides that an option is a disposal.  Subsection (2) deals with the case of exercise.  Subsection (3) talks of exercise or abandonment. Subsection (5) talks of disposed of or abandoned, and so on. The phrase &ldquo;. . . . which is not exercised&rdquo; seems to be based on what I might call the residue after positive legislation.  It is a question of drafting and expressing the Minister's intention in words.  Perhaps the wording of that subsection should be attended to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier on we discussed the principle involved here of charging a capital gain on a forfeited deposit or in the type of situation described by Deputy Belton in which there was an option on property which had to be abandoned.  The person who received the benefit from that was liable for capital gains tax but, on the other hand, the losses incurred in such cases <Col N="1015" /> were not to be allowed, subject to what has been said, as allowable losses.  I am not quite clear on what precisely was the Minister's attitude to this question.  I wonder could he clarify his approach to the problem raised.  It seems to me that what is involved here is not merely a question of drafting or anything else; it is a question of principle in the way one approaches it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who has acquired a forfeited deposit has certainly made a gain.  Nobody can dispute that.  You may say a person who has forfeited a deposit has made a loss, but in respect of the person who has forfeited the deposit there is no asset upon which the loss has arisen.  The person who makes the gain makes it in relation to an asset which he retains. The other person has put money down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If one has disposed of an asset and ascertained one's loss, then one does not have the asset.  Therefore, one has one's loss but it is not related to an asset which one holds.  I do not see the logic of what the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In simple terms, would not the forfeiture, in itself, be a disposal of the asset in which there is a loss from one point of view anyway?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not happy about losing anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is a disposal of the asset because, in a sense, he had a certain ownership of that asset from the moment of the option.  Let us take the example of an option to purchase land.  In a sense, that very option is an interest in land; it is an interest; it is an interest in the <Col N="1016" /> asset.  It can be argued either from the point of view of the vendor or purchaser that there is no interest. There is a very definite interest on both sides.  There is a very definite disposal within the meaning of this Bill. The very fact that I contract with somebody else to purchase land, or a house, gives me an interest in that land or house.  Certatinly, it would be an interest within the meaning of practically all legislation and, in certain cases, would be an interest for tax purposes. It is an interest; I have acquired an interest by taking that option.  The vendor has disposed of an interest in so doing.</P>
      <P>Let us go back to the definitions. &ldquo;Asset&rdquo; in this case is not confined to being the realty.  Take the house&mdash; and I am speaking about a definite case now&mdash;here is a house; I am going to sell the house to say, Deputy Belton.  I do it by an option&mdash;even if one calls a forfeiture an option&mdash;which is really what the deposit procedure is.  But, suppose I do it formally by an option.  I give Deputy Belton an option to buy the house.  I have disposed of an interest in that house and Deputy Belton has acquired an interest in it.</P>
      <P>Let us take section 7.  One must not think of the house as being the asset here only.  The Minister's argument, if I understand him correctly, might be all right if one did that.  But we must be consistent and use the same term throughout.  Section 7 says:</P>
      <P>All forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of this Act whether situated in the State or not, including&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  options, debts and incorporeal property generally,</P>
      <P>(b)  any currency, other than Irish currency and sterling, and</P>
      <P>(c)  any form of property created by the person disposing of it, or otherwise becoming owned without being acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, clearly the case I cited here is the passing of an interest.  I would go even further, in the normal case, where there is a sale of land, where there is an ordinary selling contract, where there is a forfeiture clause, and <Col N="1017" /> say that that certainly passes as an interest. Again, I am speaking of principle and I should like the Minister to bear that in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An option is a wasting asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>So is a contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So is a contract.  It wastes into nothing if not exercised. To take the transaction between Deputy de Valera and Deputy Belton, Deputy de Valera visualises himself as giving a right to Deputy Belton to acquire some asset or other which he, Deputy de Valera, holds.  If Deputy Belton does not exercise that right it wastes away into nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, though he may have suffered a cash loss, at the moment of suffering it he has suffered it on a non-existent asset as far as he is concerned.  On the other hand, Deputy de Valera has made a gain on an asset which he still retains, unaffected, undiminished, with no part of it disposed of at the very time that he makes the gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He may not have made a net gain; he may have made a loss.  Suppose Deputy Belton did not take that house and forfeited his deposit to me, he might have done so for a very good and simple reason. Supposing some intervention had occurred, as Deputy Belton says, such as planning permission.  Supposing Deputy Belton contracted with me to buy a house.  That house had certain amenities which Deputy Belton would like to have and then, say, a circumstance such as planning permission or a drop in the market intervened in the matter.  There are circumstances where losses can occur. The Minister's argument that I had made a net profit because I got the deposit does not stand up on an analysis of that nature; even the Valuation Office would not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House by pursuing this.  I do not want to put the Minister to the trouble of <Col N="1018" /> chasing all sorts of hypothetical cases. What I am saying is this.  Let us get back to simplicity, get away from worrying about anti-avoidance.  Do not tie up the Revenue Commissioners by attempting to legislate for everything. Give them scope to exercise their good judgment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I do not want to be put in the position of having to chase both Deputy de Valera and Deputy Belton in respect of capital gains on hypothetical cases or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately under this section it would appear as if the Minister would be chasing them for capital gains but not allowing them any capital losses.  I think the Minister ought to pause and think when he finds himself, with all due respect, having to argue in such a thin way to justify on this section a breach of two principles laid down in the Bill and to which he has referred repeatedly. They are both breached in this section. One of them is that a transaction which is a transfer of cash, whether in Irish or other currency, is not subject to capital gains tax and is not to be allowed to create an allowable loss.  That is one principle.  The other one is that any transaction which is subject to capital gains tax can give rise to an allowable loss.  They are two principles laid down in the Bill to which the Minister has referred repeatedly.  Both are breached in this section.  That fact alone should give the Minister food for thought.</P>
      <P>The only way the Minister can even attempt to deny the breach of these things is to produce a totally artificial interpretation of people having losses but not related to particular property, whereas they have gains on a particular property.  The Minister knows in his heart that that is a very thin argument which does not stand up to analysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is something wrong with a section which obliges the Minister to breach these two principles laid down in the Bill.  Having regard to the consequences of what is being done in the section, I am trying to ascertain what <Col N="1019" /> is the Minister's attitude in principle to it, as distinct from the actual drafting and what may emerge from amendments.  Does he accept, where a transaction may produce a capital gain and thereby be subject to tax that, if it produces a capital loss it should be an allowable loss?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with capital and the losses must relate to capital disposed of and gains must relate to capital disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.  The Minister specifically provides in some sections for the collection of capital gains tax on transactions where a gain accrues, but a person does not acquire any property or asset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Options and deposits are special and obviously are distinct from non-wasting assets.  The options and the circumstances which lead to forfeiture of deposits are changing all the time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is really saying that options are contracts. If that is his thinking, he had better rethink subsection (7).  Under this Bill we are trying to have things both ways, and, of course, that is the one sure way of ensuring that we will not have it at all.  I understand the anti-avoidance problems and I will not repeat all I said on this.  The Minister is putting an interpretation on &ldquo;capital&rdquo; which is not in the Bill.  I pointed out that there was a trap here because we could think of assets in terms only of tangible assets.  When we talk about &ldquo;capital&rdquo; we are falling into the trap of implicity defining capital in a restrictive sense.  That will lead us into all kinds of legal traps before we are finished.  Again I want to emphasise that we should keep this simple.  If we give discretion to the Revenue Commisisoners we will avoid all these traps.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but a number of points were raised where redrafting is necessary.  I am trying to ascertain the Minister's attitude on the principle as well as the drafting problems.  I am not trying to be difficult but, in my opinion, it is important that we know this.  Does the Minister accept that we should endeavour to provide that a transaction, which may give rise to a chargeable gain, can also give rise to an allowable loss?  Does he further accept that a transaction which does not give rise to a chargeable gain, because it is in money, should not give rise to an allowable loss?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing here with more than money transactions.  We are dealing with the sale of rights, including wasting rights.  I have discussed the principle as I see it and I will consider what has been argued here and see if we can produce a better section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that he is getting himself into black knots in this section?  As an anti-avoidance measure, probably all that would be achieved here is injustice to the genuine cases.  From what the Minister said I take it that he intends looking at the section and introducing amendments to clarify it.  I am also taking it that he will also look at the principle involved.  If we agree to this section it will be on that understanding. If the Minister finds he is unable to redraft the section so as to accept the principle we were adumbrating in regard to genuine cases, we would feel it necessary to introduce an amendment on the next Stage, to achieve it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some points I want to raise on this section.  There is a provision in the section which reads:</P>
      <P>The situation of any such assets are as specified in this section shall, except as otherwise provided by section 4, be determined in accordance with the following provisions . . .</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary, having regard to section 4, which is fairly complex, to lay down other apparently alternative provisions here?  Subparagraph (b) reads:</P>
      <P>subject to the following provisions of this section, the situation of rights or interests (otherwise than by way of security) in or over tangible movable property is that of the tangible movable property.</P>
      <P>I take it that what is intended to be conveyed there is the situation of tangible movable property at the date of disposal, which is the crucial time in determining this.  It does not quite say that but I presume that is what the phrase means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be helpful if the Minister could give an example of the kind of thing envisaged in paragraph (b).  In regard to paragraph (e), the Minister will note that it states:</P>
      <P>subject to paragraph (d), registered shares or securities are situated where they are registered and, if registered in more than one register, where the principal register is situated.</P>
      <P>On the face of it, that makes sense, but in the light of it may I refer the Minister to paragraph (h):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>patents, trade marks and designs are situated where they are registered, and if registered in more than one register, where each register is situated <Col N="1022" /> and copyright, franchises, rights and licences to use any copyright material, patent, trade mark or design are situated in the State if they, or any rights derived from them, are exercisable in the State.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of that provision if the register is situate in the State?  It would appear to constitute a considerable difficulty in dealing with these items.  Paragraph (f) deals with a ship or aircraft.  Are they deemed to be either wasting assets or tangible movable property?  Paragraph (h) provides that patents and so forth are situate where they are registered.  The Minister will probably agree that rights in regard to trade marks are frequently exercisable not only in the State but outside it, at the very least in Northern Ireland and sometimes further afield.</P>
    <P>In that situation what is the position that will arise where it is exercisable in practice both in the State and outside it, which would very often include many countries in western Europe?  What is stated is that they are deemed to be located in the State but sometimes the right, while exercisable in the State, may be a minor part of what is really involved&mdash;the major part could be exercisable outside the State.  Does that provide any problem in the matter of assessment of capital gains tax or losses&mdash;I do not mean in theory but in practice?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope I can deal with all the specific questions that have been asked.  In regard to paragraps (b) I will take, for example, a picture.  The location is, of course, the place in which the picture is located. On paragraph (h) I was asked why it is treated differently to paragraph (e) which states the position in regard to registered shares and securities, that they are situate where they are registered and if registered in more than one register, &ldquo;where the principal register is situated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that patents, trade marks and designs may be registered in a number of countries and have separate capital values in the different countries.  Obviously, if <Col N="1023" /> a patent is registered here the right to use the patent or trade mark or design is limited to our jurisdiction or Northern Ireland or possibly some other area depending on the patent or trade mark laws of other countries. Whichever country, it has a sale value.</P>
    <P>If the same patent or trade mark or design is registered elsewhere the fact of its registration elsewhere means there is a separate right to use it elsewhere.  The mere fact that it is registered in Ireland does not mean that the person acquiring it in Ireland would acquire the trade mark, patent or design in some other jurisdiction. Each one has to be separately assessed.  Though the patent may be a similar one, it is the right to use it that gives it the marketable value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>So that in theory it is one register here and in other countries for the purposes of the Act but we would be concerned only with the registration in Ireland and the value of that?</P>

      <P>This section gives us again the type of problem I can foresee growing up on this.  Here we start a section with the words: &ldquo;except as otherwise provided in section 4&rdquo;.  I go to section 4 and I read that its provisions are &ldquo;subject to any exceptions in this Act&rdquo;.  So which is which?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsections (6) and (7) which deal with gains accruing on the disposal of exploration or exploration rights are the subsections which are relevant to section 48.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (7) refers to &ldquo;gains accruing to a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State on the disposal of such assets . . . &rdquo; I shall follow the Minister's train of thought in a moment, I want to raise the relevancy <Col N="1025" /> of subsection (1) of section 4 which reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to any exceptions in this Act, a person shall be chargeable to capital gains tax in respect of chargeable gains accruing to him in a year of assessment for which he is resident or ordinarily resident in the State.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be carping about this, but this is one of the traps, that you make two provisions mutually subject to each other; and if you do so, what is the consequence?  The Minister would be quite right if there was no relevancy in this, but I want to show that there is.  Do not let us get lost as to whether it is a subsection or not. That gets into another area of interpretation. We shall have to bring all the canons of interpretation down here before we finish this Bill.</P>
      <P>In section 4 you read: &ldquo;Subject to any exceptions in this Act&rdquo; and then you read in this section: &ldquo;except as otherwise provided by section 4&rdquo;. Naturally one asks oneself which is the cart and which is the horse.  However, subsection (2) goes on to say: &ldquo;subject to any such exceptions&rdquo;. Therefore, the exceptions in subsection (1) of section 4 are carried on into and qualify subsection (2).  In subsection (2) there are three paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  Quite clearly paragraph (a) relating to land in the State, raises no problem; paragraph (b) in relation to minerals in the State, in so far as they are tangible assets, raise no problems, that is the minerals themselves, but paragraph (b) <i>in toto</i> reads:</P>
      <P>Minerals in the State or any rights, interests or other assets in relation to mining or minerals or the searching for minerals;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consider the wording there: &ldquo;Minerals in the State or any rights, interests or other assets&rdquo;.  I shall not delay the Minister by giving the reference to all the sections, including the section defining assets, as I have done already, section 7 and so forth.  Come to section 48, the section we are discussing. It excepts as otherwise provided in section 4, and presumably <Col N="1026" /> excepts as provided in subsection (2) of section 4.  If it excepts as provided in subsection (2) of section 4, then what difficulties can arise on paragraph (e) of section 48 and, indeed, (d), because I am thinking of the rights of oil exploration.  Incidentally, even in the section itself, subsection (8) (b) says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;designated area&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by section 1 of the Continental Shelf Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>Therefore, clearly, in contemplation of the drafting of this Bill the oil in the Continental Shelf and in our coastal waters comes within the purview of this legislation.</P>
    <P>To continue my point, here you will have the tangible asset situate under the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b), that is, the actual mineral or oil, but associated with this in that very complex financial structure and all the coming and going with leases, options, contracts and so on, these interests&mdash; I am using the word for short&mdash;may come into the category of registered shares or securities.  In that case what rules?  In other words, I am posing to the Minister the question of taking paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of section 4, on the one hand, and paragraph (e) and possibly (d) of section 48, on the other hand.  Is there a latent possibility of contradiction and complication here?  I might go to refer to paragraph (g) which reads:</P>
    <P>The situation of goodwill as a trade, business or professional asset is at the place where the trade, business or profession is carried on.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, what the Minister is up against is that intentionally section 4 is dealing with the person; section 48 is primarily intended to deal with the asset.  That is where the dilemma arises.  Section 44 is intended to determine the location or situation of the person and section 48 deals with the location of the individual. Section 48 attempts to prescribe, I use the word &ldquo;prescribe&rdquo; although it is not exactly a precise definition.  The difficulties are portrayed by the words used in the following provision.  Normally, if you meant this to be positive legislation you would say &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;<Col N="1027" /> but the difficulties are disclosed and the cat is let out of the bag by the phrase &ldquo;be determined in accordance with the following provisions&rdquo; instead of the definite &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;.  I appreciate the reasons for that.  Yet, it is legislation and &ldquo;be determined&rdquo; will be given some measure of mandatory sanction.  When a court comes to these paragraphs and compares them with the clearly mandatory provisions of section 4, conflict could arise.  It is significant that the wording in section 4 is &ldquo;shall be&rdquo;.  Such a possible conflict could be the most fruitful cause of extensive legislation for the State.  You are now in an area where very big interests are involved and I should like to warn the Minister&mdash; when I say &ldquo;warn&rdquo; I mean&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the word I want.  I want to keep this discussion on a friendly plane and I hope, despite the time we are taking that we are helping the Minister a little.  The primary purpose of this legislation would be construed as taxation but legislation as a whole often has to be looked to in the courts.  Here, you are entering an area&mdash;I have mentioned oil specifically&mdash;where very big interests may be involved from the point of view of the Minister's colleague in another Department and the Government as a whole in dealing with what promises to be one of the greatest preoccupations of our Government's for the foreseeable time. There is that factor on the one hand and the challenging of the legislation on the other which might well involve the State in very great legal and administrative expense not only here but in other jurisdictions.  Therefore, the greatest care and attention should be given to possibilities arising from uncertainties of the kind I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I should like to make my point more specifically.  Subsection (2) of section 4 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to any such exceptions, a person who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State <Col N="1028" /> shall be chargeable to capital gains tax for a year of assessment in respect of chargeable gains accruing to him in that years on the disposal of&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That deals with the person.  Subsections (d) and (e) locate the very interests that are special there.</P>
    <P>What I am really saying to the Minister is that I should like to alert him to the possible dangers of defining the location of the interest or the asset on the one hand and legislating accordingly, and defining the location of the persons chargeable in respect of this asset on the other hand.</P>
    <P>To pursue the point more closely I would have to put myself in a hypothetical case&mdash;which I do not want to do&mdash;and then examine the Bill as if it were law from the point of view of counsel seeking to advise a client on a particular aspect which the client raises.  The difficulties I fear can arise in two ways, either when a substantial client consults his lawyers and counsel approaches this Bill to advise him, or the State itself is involved in negotiations which require that the State's legal advisers look into the matter in much the same way.  When that arises it is a very different situation from that in which we approach a Bill here. When somebody approaches it in a case like that he has a fixed viewpoint. Our difficulty always in regard to legislation is that we do not have a uniform point of view.  That is why we were adumbrating principles on the previous section.  In most legislation, especially when considerations of anti-avoidance or anything like this arises we do not keep a uniform point of view.  But the lawyer who will attack this in the way I have suggested will have a uniform point of view with the result that he will take the whole Act on the point that is mentioned and finecomb it.  The Minister who is a lawyer and Deputy Colley who is a lawyer and all of us who deal with the law will appreciate that when one gets something like the contradiction that is between section 4 and section 48 that I have mentioned, it is a very fruitful beginning.</P>
    <P>I have expanded on this because I fear it may involve very big interests; <Col N="1029" /> even the State itself may be involved and the State would be involved in either case because of the costs of legal actions, either in our jurisdiction or elsewhere, and this is the type of thing that could arise in other jurisdictions. I have given the case of oil and the net point is the attempt to define location of the person chargeable and location of the asset and then the total exception in section 48 and section 4.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I would most urgently and co-operatively press the point on the Minister, and not in the spirit which we may sometimes find here.  I really do urge on the Minister to consider whether, if he is in a real dilemma about this, section 48 is necessary at all.  It seems to be tidy and neat, but we cannot tell what the double effect of these two sections on the whole Act is.  If this thought had occurred earlier, what one should do is take a hypothetical case&mdash;I do not want to be specific, to prompt anything&mdash;and then sit down as counsel would sit down and see how I can use two things to burst something somewhere else in the Act.  That is what I want to alert the Minister to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for doing so.  He may be assured that our objective is the same as his and we feel that it is very necessary to have section 48 because without it there would be considerable dispute as to the location of some of the assets.  I cannot see that it is contradictory of section 4.  What it does is to give the provisions of section 4 in relation to certain assets precedence over section 48, those assets being particularly offshore oil and gas and mineral deposits which are described as being exploration or exploitation rights in the designated area.  They are caught very specifically relating to persons so as to ensure that any gain arising out of the disposal of them will be caught.  The exceptions to which the Deputy referred in subsections (1) and (2) of section 4 refer of course to all the exceptions and exemptions which are in the Act.</P>

I know that that is the intention and that that is what is said but what I am trying to say is, and I am talking purely legally now&mdash;I do hope there is no contradiction that could arise but &ldquo;except as otherwise used&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;except&rdquo; is the word used in section 48 and you do not define exceptions and exception is not only exception in regard to money.  Exception can be construed as excepting provisions of the Act, so one has to be very careful as to the legal meaning of the two words.  For instance, the Minister might have a point if he had &ldquo;save otherwise as provided in section 4,&rdquo; but the very fact that he uses the word &ldquo;except&rdquo; in section 4 was what alerted me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 41:</P>
      <P>In page 44, subsection (3) (a), lines 21 to 25, to delete subparagraph (ii) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(ii)  where bargains, other than bargains done at special prices, were recorded in that list for the relevant date, the price at which the bargains were so recorded, or if more than one such price was so recorded, a price halfway between the highest and the lowest of such prices,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) (a) of section 49 sets out the method used to ascertain market value of quoted shares by reference to the official quotations on the stock exchange list.  There are two sets of figures shown on the list, the price at which bargains were last recorded, known as the previous price, and where bargains were recorded on the relevant date, the bargain price.  The object of the subsection is to allow the lower of these two values to be taken as it appears in the Bill.  Paragraph (a) (ii) of the subsection involves a further <Col N="1032" /> calculation outside the bargain price and will take the mean of the bargain price and the previous price. This is a somewhat complex procedure and it is better to confine the calculations in paragraph (a) (ii), to bargain prices only.  Thus the amendment will simplify the calculation and there will then be two values to be looked at, the previous price and the bargain price, taking the lower value.</P>
    <P>The amendment to paragraph (b) (ii) brings the wording into line with that of paragraph (a) (ii).  The same principle of calculation in relation to bargains will therefore apply to both the Irish and the London lists.</P>

      <P>It is purely a drafting matter but, while essentially the same as that, the balance of the substituted paragraph is different.

      <P>The Minister has informed me that this paragraph applies only in relation to shares or securities listed in the Stock Exchange Official List (Irish).

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>That is true.  A bargain price may be fixed for a variety of reasons.  It is difficult to determine them all.  There could be rearrangements, reorganisations and mergers and matters of that nature for some reason or other might put a special price which would not reflect what strangers bargaining in the market might themselves pay but if they are recorded there is no trouble. If they are unrecorded there is no trouble either because they are not within anybody's knowledge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The taxpayer has a right under paragraph 8 of Schedule 5 to appeal against an assessment to capital gains tax.  The basis of valuation of assets <Col N="1035" /> would form a valid ground for an appeal, which would be determined in accordance with paragraph 8 of Schedule 5.  Section 49 (6) also deals with claims under the Act and where a decision on a claim&mdash;not itself an appeal&mdash;is disputed by the taxpayer the application of section 432 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, as adapted by paragraph 2 of Schedule 5 to capital gains tax confers on the taxpayer a right of appeal against the decision. The appeal would be heard and determined in the same way as an appeal against an assessment.

      <P>In subsection (3) we are dealing with the two stock exchanges with which we are most familiar, the rules of which are well known.  With regard to the value of shares that may be registered in other stock exchanges, there may be a variety of different ways of presenting those valuations and short of putting in a section to deal with every stock exchange in the world we could not provide for it in the legislation.  In looking at the facts of particular cases, the Revenue Commissioners would tend to apply the disciplines and ideas that are used in our stock exchange, subject to whatever qualifications it might be proper to consider in relation to prices on other stock exchanges.  The world is becoming more integrated and probably the differences are less than they would have been at another time but it was considered we could not deal adequately in this legislation with the variety of different arrangements, actions and assessments that operate elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of market value has been accepted and it is probably the fairest one for this legislation.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In estimating the market value of any assets no reduction shall be made in the estimate on account of the estimate being made on the <Col N="1037" /> assumption that the whole of the assets is to be placed on the market at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>I question the necessity of that provision quite apart from wondering about its equity.  I am in some difficulty here as I do not want to depart from discussing this Bill.  There is a certain homogeneity about this capital legislation.  For instance, the market value of a property in a block and the value of that piece of property could be different&mdash;first, if it was a simple disposal in its own right and, secondly, if it was a disposal as part of a block. That type of situation arises frequently in this city.  I am not saying whether this acts in favour or against the State or an individual but I am pointing out there is a real question of estimating the value of this subsection.</P>
    <P>Before Deputy Belton came into the House I mentioned the question of a property in the middle of a block that might become available for development. The purchase of the block could make a big difference to the market value of the property.  The same thing could happen with regard to a block of shares.  For the moment I am not considering subsection (3) and what follows because I do not wish to be sidetracked from my main point by an extraneous consideration.</P>
    <P>In principle, the market value of a block of shares might be very different from the actual value of the shares.  For instance, if a block of shares gave virtual control of a substantial interest, a purchaser might be prepared to pay substantially more for the block than the quoted market value of the shares taken individually.  Conversely, a person might have a large holding he wanted to get rid of and the fact that he had a purchaser on the spot might prompt him to sell the holding at a smaller price.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister whether subsection (2) is necessary or desirable. By referring to market value, are we not giving discretion to the Revenue Commissioners who, in turn, fall back on the Valuation Office?  We are tying the hands of the Revenue Commissioners with such a provision.  I may appear to be too trusting in my attitude <Col N="1038" /> but I think I am right to ask why insert a subsection which is not necessary. Are there any loopholes it is designed to block?  As an ordinary citizen I would be happy to leave it to the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners to decide in any transaction whether there had been an appreciation or depreciation of value because the asset was or was not part of a larger deal.  The Revenue Commissioners would be well able to cope with such a matter without having to look at a section that can put them in difficulty because it removes elasticity.</P>
    <P>Though sometimes so regarded, the Revenue Commissioners are not a lot of ogres.  People talk about oppression but I have known cases, and so have many other taxpayers, where the inspector was anxious to find an answer in an equitable case but was tied by the provisions of the Act.  Do not let us get this complex that the Revenue Commissioners are always grinding the faces of the poor, so to speak.  Very often they work the other way.  The important thing is the system has worked fairly and equitably and in all my time here I have never heard any really serious complaint levied against the Revenue Commissioners; any complaint there has been against the provisions under which they operate.  I would urge the Minister to consider seriously whether subsection (2) is appropriate at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection really means that the value to be placed on an asset is that value which would be obtained if a normal transaction, subject to normal conditions and so on, were to take place and it eliminates any abnormal fluctuations in price which might occur if the market were flooded with a vast quantity of similar assets at some particular time resulting in an unusually low price.  Deputy de Valera asks is it necessary to have the subsection there at all.  I think he has in mind to say that is the kind of reasonable rule reasonable people would assume.  One would take a normal price in a normal transaction in normal conditions, and not any abnormal fluctuation, as an estimation of the true value of property.</P>

      <P>He assumes that the particular rule here is such a reasonable one he could not visualise any valuation other than a reasonable valuation arising out of normal circumstances being taken as the only true valuation.  One could have a situation in which people would argue that a price related to a flooded market price rather than to the appropriate one and that would be a wrong assessment and a wrong valuation to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand what the Minister means by a flooded market under subsection (2). I purposely said &ldquo;Forget subsection (3) which brings in shares&rdquo;.  There are two points.  First, what does the Minister mean by abnormal?  He talked about flooded markets.  Are fluctuations in the property market normal? Keep to the case I mentioned&mdash;the sale of a house or small business premises in a larger block where there is a possibility of development.  Quite clearly the price of that particular house will vary according to whether it is going as part of the acquisition of the block or otherwise&mdash;to perpetrate a pun, whether it is going with the block or whether it is blocking the block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a case.  It is abnormal. Why does the Minister have to legislate for it?  Would not the true market value be the circumstances?  A small business in a large block can determine the value of the rest of the block.  The price that will be given for it will depend on whether the sale is such as to facilitate the acquisition of the block by a developer or whether the acquisition will be a hindrance to the acquisition of the block.  Surely that is a market factor <Col N="1040" /> and surely it is a factor for which one cannot legislate.  In the last analysis, surely the proper value is the price in the open market, if market value means anything.  We are talking here about market value.  Surely the true test of market value is the actual value in the open market.  By the way, a great deal of what I am saying here is in favour of the Revenue and not the reverse.  We only have recourse to valuations and other standards of measurement when we do not have the direct test.  The property has not come, so to speak, on the open market.  That is one case, normal or abnormal.</P>
    <P>There is then another case for the Minister to consider.  I would be only too happy in the case I have given to leave things to the Revenue Commissioners because they would be able to ask the appropriate question: is this a fiddle or a straightforward deal?  If it is a straightforward deal and a genuine market transaction, why does the Minister want to put in something in contradiction of subsection (1), because that is what he is doing here?  Subsection (2) will prevent the implementation of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>I will give another example.  The Minister talked about a flooded market.  I can understand the Minister's point but markets become automatically flooded due to economic conditions.  Consider what happened to house property some 12 months or so ago.  Property was climbing out of all proportion in value on the open market.  Property was soaring.  Suddenly that stopped and there was a decline.  Was the upward spiral the opposite of flooding? Remember, flooding can be positive or negative.  I would like to test this. I can think of a house in the suburbs of Dublin that a few years ago went for £7,000 and was sold very recently for £13,000.  That is not flooding. Supposing the Government succeed in their avowed objective of providing housing and accommodation and the market value of houses slumps, is that flooding?  No.</P>
    <P>I am making these points, as on other sections, purely by way of <Col N="1041" /> illustration to show that there is substance in them.  I believe that the Revenue Commissioners are perfectly capable of implementing subsection (1) through their staff, their assessors, inspectors and so on.  The true market value is the test.  Subsection (2) can be a contradiction of subsection (1). If the Minister will not accede to my plea to delete that subsection, I would like him to give us some concrete reason as to why he feels the Revenue Commissioners need subsection (2) to implement the Bill because I fail to see that they need it. In fact, I think it will impede them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) is not directed primarily to land or house property but is also directed to stocks and shares.  This illustration might help to indicate what we have in mind: you could have a person with, say, £2 million worth of stock in a particular concern.  The normal transaction in the market in relation to that company might be £5,000 to £10,000, even £50,000 a day.  With such a pattern, obviously, the price would remain fairly stable but if the whole £2 million were to be put on the market in one day the price would come tumbling down.  The number of persons seeking a particular stock at any given time dictates what the pattern will be. Obviously, if there was a sudden flooding of the market with a particular asset, the demand might be normal but if the market was flooded, obviously the price would come down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are saying is that if an estimate has to be made of the market value the estimate must be based on what would be the normal price, not the price if the whole £2 million worth were put on the market in one day.  If the owner of the shares were disposing of them for a consideration other than cash one would have to assess their value.  The value would be determined, not on the assumption that £2 million was going on the market in one day but on the basis of the normal price of those shares. If it is £X, then two million times £X is the appropriate figure and not, as it might be argued if we had not got the subsection, by the owner of the <Col N="1042" /> shares: &ldquo;If I put the £2 million on the market the value of the shares would be £X minus £Y and that is the figure that we should estimate this at and not the other.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera might say that it would be unreasonable to argue in that way, and that, therefore, section 49 subsection (1) is sufficient because that says that it is the value which those assets might reasonably be expected to fetch on sale in the open market.  The trouble is, what are those assets?  Are these assets the £2 million worth of stock or are they the amount which assets of that type if sold in normal quantities might be expected to fetch on the open market? You would certainly have to amend section 49 subsection (1) in order to deal with the situation which I have indicated.</P>
    <P>Let me come back to house property that the Deputy was talking of. Of course, if the place is sold on the open market that value would normally be accepted without further ado.  It is not common for people to sell land or house property on the open market in a contrived situation. It can happen, I know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amounts involved are so massive that it is improbable but it is certainly possible. One would not say that because house property was obtaining a low price because of an economic recession that was not the appropriate market price, that it should be a price related to times when things were better.  The person who is putting house property on the open market seldom contrives to create the economic situation which might result in either boom or depression in demand.</P>
      <P>What we are dealing with primarily in subsection (2) is that situation in which it could be argued that a person disposing of a very substantial block of assets would by disposing of them on one day receive a smaller price for those assets than would be normal if they were sold piecemeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1043" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On this question of subsection (2), first of all, it should be noted that it provides only for there being no reduction in an estimate in the circumstances envisaged.  It does not say: &ldquo;nor increase in an estimate&rdquo;. It is only dealing with the possibility of the estimate being reduced on the assumption that the whole of the assets are placed on the market.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in general the kind of situation in which this can arise is only where one portion of assets is sold and it is necessary to apportion as between the whole and the part sold and, therefore, one has to estimate the value of all the assets.</P>
      <P>I had a suspicion when I read this, and that suspicion has been confirmed very strongly by what the Minister has said, that, basically, this subsection is designed to prevent avoidance in terms of stocks and shares. There is a theoretical case but in practice I cannot find it easy to envisage any other kind of assets where the market could be flooded if one put all of them on the market.  It is theoretically possible but in practice stocks and shares are what this is concerned with.  If that is so, a specific reference to stocks and shares and confining it to that would probably make this more acceptable and more workable. I am not sure that anything would be lost if that were done.  I do not know if Deputy de Valera would agree with me in that approach, whether he might still think it necessary to have subsection (2).  It strikes me that in practice stocks and shares are involved here and to confine it to that would make it far more intelligible and acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There might, of course, be rights in commodities, or something of that nature.  Obviously, there is a lot in what Deputy Colley says and, indeed, what I say.  I could not visualise many assets other than stocks and shares to which subsection (2) would apply.  I have no doubt that many ingenious people would be able to contrive new situations to avoid paying tax if we did not deal with it in the way it is at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> It may be of some interest to Deputies to know that a similar provision has existed in estate duty law since 1910.  The legislators were probably simpler people in those days.  Yet they had to get around to making some such provision.  I am not aware that it has caused any difficulty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice that was used only in relation to stocks and shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that when I started on this section I specifically excluded consideration of subsection (3) onwards because I knew the point which has developed would arise on it.  I am glad to have the opportunity of showing that I am willing to go with the Minister some of the way if he can convince me.  As Deputy Colley says, this subsection is more appropriate in relation to subsection (3) and could be included in it or after it but that does not quite meet the point I am making here.  I still believe it would be better to give discretion to the Revenue Commissioners but I am a little perturbed about what the Minister said as to what policy might be adopted in regard to it.</P>
      <P>Before I suggest a compromise I should like to emphasise the importance of subsection (1).  I should like to think that the Revenue authorities would approach any transaction in the spirit of the fair and genuine market price at the time.  I agree that in relation to stocks and shares a very real problem arises.  In relation to stocks and shares, I should like to have included in the appropriate place that no reduction shall be allowed other than at the discretion of the Revenue Commissioners.  If you feel something positive has to be done, it should be still left discretionary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like an undertaking given that the whole thing would be administered genuinely in the spirit of subsection (1) and that the genuine market value, whether it is property, shares or anything else, would be the ruling factor.  If such a device as the <Col N="1045" /> artificial flooding of the market were attempted to be used to defeat subsection (1), I would gladly give the Revenue Commissioners the right to disallow a reduction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley cannot imagine a case outside stocks and shares arising. The first line of the subsection states: &ldquo;In estimating the market value of any assets . . . &rdquo; Take the shop in the block that I have been talking about, which could be developed.  The value of that business cannot be arrived at, short of an actual sale, without taking the value of the block, the other assets, into consideration. For valuation purposes it is a question of what are the assets.  The word &ldquo;assets&rdquo; used in the subsection is really used to apply to two different things at the one time, the particular thing that is being valued and the assets around it which determine the valuation.  A valuer will look at this and say that the shop is worth so much if sold by itself.  In order to determine what the market value would be the whole block would have to be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe I am right in saying that under the subsection the question of the whole block can only come into it if it is owned by the same person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The assets of somebody else are what will determine the market value of the assets in question.  The market value is determined by the value of surrounding assets.  The word &ldquo;assets&rdquo; can be used in the double sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This subsection has nothing to do with the block.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that only the assets are involved but the circumstances are there.  Subsection (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> In estimating the market value of any assets no reduction shall be made in the estimate on account of the estimate being made on the assumption that the whole of the assets is to be placed on the market at one and the same time.</P>
    <P>In order to reach the value of the assets in question you have to know the value of the surrounding assets.  It is a question of how you estimate the value.  It could be construed that you could not value the block or the environment except by reference to whether that block went as a whole or whether it was sold in pieces like the premises. That is the point.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of the chargeability. It is at the base of the valuation. Although the point may be strained to some extent, the fact is that in a case like this, it would be better to have discretion.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he should put the subsection lower down and if possible qualify it.  The qualification I would like to see in it would be a discretionary one.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that in estimating the market value of any assets no reduction shall be made in the estimate on account of the estimate being made on the assumption that the whole of the assets is to be placed on the market at one and the same time.  The value of my shop depends completely on the value of the block. The value of the block depends on whether it is put on the market in part or as a block.  With a bit of ingenuity the subsection could be used unfairly to defeat subsection (1).  I would ask the Minister to rephrase it in such a way that the Revenue Commissioners will have power but it will not be mandatory on them to exercise that power.</P>

      <P>I am also satisfied that there is clarity and that the taxpayers will know where they stand if the subsection remains as it is.  The worst that can be said about it is that it might work to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.  I do not think that is so. We are not dealing here with cases of actual sales.

      <P>Could I refer the Minister to paragraphs (a) (i) and (b) (i). Paragraph (a) deals with the valuation of shares or securities listed in the stock exchange official list, Irish.  In effect, paragraph (b) refers to the stock exchange list in Britain.  A different method of valuation is prescribed in the case of those on the Irish list and those on the British list as illustrated in subparagraph (i).  In the case of the Irish ones it is the price shown in that list at which bargains in the shares or securities were last recorded and, in the case of the British stock exchange, it is the lower of the two prices shown in the quotations for the shares of securities on the relevant date plus one-quarter of the difference between those two figures.  Could the Minister tell us why there is a difference in approach between the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are differences in the manner in which prices are fixed on the Irish stock exchange, and the stock exchange in Britain.  Therefore, it is necessary to provide rules for valuing shares and securities listed in the Irish official list as well as those quoted on the stock exchange daily official list which is how the list is known in Britain.  For shares or securities shown on the Irish list the valuation to be taken is the price at which bargains were last recorded.  Where shares or securities are listed on both lists on the same date, provision is made for taking the lower relevant valuation.  Does that answer the Deputies question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it does. I think I know the reason for it but it might be as well if we could get it on the record.  I think what the Minister was referring to was a subsequent provision in the Bill and also the amendment which only amends subparagraph (ii) in each case.  I was referring to the difference in paragraph (a) (i) and paragraph (b) (i).  In the case of paragraph (a) which deals with the valuation of securities listed on the Irish stock exchange, in the circumstances envisaged what is provided is that one takes the price shown in the list at which bargains <Col N="1049" /> in the shares or securities were last recorded.  When one is dealing with the securities quoted on the British stock exchange the corresponding provision is the lower of the two prices shown in the quotations for the shares or securities on the relevant date plus one quarter of the difference between the two figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Further on in subparagraph (3) there is said:</P>
      <P>Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>and then there are listed paragraphs (a), (b) and (c).  In paragraph (b), line 51, there is reference to a more active market.  The provision reads:</P>
      <P>(b)  this subsection shall not apply to shares or securities for which some other stock exchange affords a more active market;</P>
      <P>What I would like to know in this regard is, first, how is it proposed to ascertain that another stock exchange provides a more active market? Secondly, having ascertained it&mdash; assuming it is a stock exchange in X somewhere in Europe or in America &mdash;how will the securities be valued on the basis of the quotations there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These provisions are similar to the practice followed for estate duty purposes.  If some other stock exchange affords a more active market for the shares or the securities in question, the valuation will be based on the quotations in that stock exchange.  If any of the stock exchanges concerned is closed on the relevant date, the market value is to be based on the lower of either the latest previous figure or the earliest subsequent figure on which the stock exchange is open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whichever is the lower?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, whichever is the lower.  Mining shares come quickly to mind as an example of shares which might be more actively traded in stock exchanges other than the London exchange.  The Revenue Commissioners, if they felt that the London price was not the most appropriate one, would raise the question of the price in another exchange.  Indeed the taxpayer initially might offer the price <Col N="1052" /> on another exchange and there might be no dispute about it.  If, of course, there is a dispute and the taxpayer feels disadvantaged by the quotation from the more active exchange, then the matter would go to appeal for decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of any dispute as to which was the more appropriate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really what I wanted to know.  Once it is determined that the other is the more active exchange, then the valuation is arrived at on the basis outlined by the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will note that subsection (5) deals with the ascertainment of the market value in relation to unit trusts.  At the end of subsection (5) there is a provision reading:</P>
      <P>. . . shall mean an amount equal to the buying price (that is the lower price) so published on the relevant date, or if none were published on that date, on the latest date before.</P>
      <P>But in paragraph (c) of the proviso to subsection (3), there is a somewhat similar provision in relation to securities on the stock exchange which continues to say:</P>
      <P>whichever affords the lower market value.</P>
      <P>That does not appear to be provided in subsection (5) and I am wondering if it is a deliberate omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The stock exchange price is one which is determined by the forces of the market between two parties deemed to be at arms length. But the unit trust situation is not one in which the price is determined by the inputs of two different persons, one selling and one buying.  The price is that which is fixed by the managers of the trust who are inviting, as it were, people to tender at that price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what practical effect does that have?  I am thinking of this from the point of view of the taxpayer who, in the case of stocks <Col N="1053" /> and shares, can opt, in effect, for whichever of the market values is the lower.  He cannot do that in the case of the unit trust quotation.  Does the reason the Minister has advanced have relevance from the point of view of the taxpayer who wants, say, to rely on the lower valuation that would have been open to him were this provision the same as in the case of the stock exchange?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The stock exchange gives a very active, regular and independent assessment of valuations.  The same cannot be said for unit trusts which are more limited.  The buying and selling prices are determined by the managers of the trusts, not by the market forces.  One cannot assume that one gets the price which is as closely related to the market value as that which operates in respect of the stock exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>This subsection ensures that in arriving at the market value in the case of a foreign security coming within the exchange control regulations made under the Exchange Control Act, 1954, allowance is to be given for the part of the premium over the official rate of exchange which, because of the regulations, the owner of the securities would lose on a sale.  I will now give an example.  If a New York stock exchange sale realises $1,000, the premium would be $150.  The resaleable value would be $850.

      <P>Subsection (1) means that capital gains tax will be one of the taxes which, to be changed, would require a financial resolution of Dáil Éireann.  Subsection (2) places on the Revenue Commissioners the same responsibilities to account for capital gains tax as already lies on them in respect of other inland revenue duties. The section is necessary because capital gains tax is a new tax being introduced for the first time.  As the <Col N="1056" /> House is aware, similar provisions already exist in respect of value-added tax by virtue of section 28 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972.  The Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927, section 1, contains a list of definitions and states that the word &ldquo;tax&rdquo; includes duties of customs, duties of excise, income tax and super-tax but no other tax or duty.  VAT has already been added to that list, so has turnover tax and to these will be added the capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister will be aware that under existing death duty legislation if a return is not made the assessment of duty cannot be made until the return is received by the commissioners in the normal way.  If they were aware of it they might be able to make an assessment of their own, but normally speaking they cannot make an assessment until they get an Inland Revenue affidavit from the executors.  Notwithstanding that, the interest there is charged by reference to the date of death&mdash;on the value of realty from 12 months after the date and on the net value of the personalty, from four months after the date of death, irrespective of the time of assessment.  I imply from what the Minister has said that it will be otherwise here and I wonder if that is wise. If a return is not made to enable an assessment to be made, as far as future gains are concerned it would seem one can avoid the payment simply by not making a return.  I do not think this should apply to gains that were made before the passing of the Act because nobody could make a return at that time.  I am thinking about future gains and drawing a contrast with the existing situation in death duty legislation.</P>

      <P>It provides that the technical provisions of Schedules 1, 2 and 3 and the provisions of the Bill fixing the amount of consideration deemed to be given on the disposal or acquisition of an asset are to be treated as having effect before 6th April, 1974, where it is necessary to compute a chargeable gain by reference to events and circumstances before that date.</P>
      <P>The subsection, for example, would apply where under paragraph 18 of Schedule 1 a chargeable gain on the disposal of an asset acquired before April 6th, 1974, is computed by apportionment of the gain over the whole period of ownership.  It would also apply where for the purpose of paragraph 16 of the same Schedule the amount of the whole gain on the disposal of a block of shares acquired before 6th April, 1974, is compared with the amount of the gain arising by taking the base cost as being equal to the market value of the shares on 6th April, 1974, in order to ascertain the lesser amount to be taken as the chargeable gain.</P>

      <P>I did not, possibly, hear all the Minister said when he gave the meaning of subsection (2), but it seemed to me, from what I heard of it, to give rise to a problem that may perhaps have been dealt with earlier in the Bill but nonetheless would arise on this subsection in the light of what he said, that where it is necessary to go back before 6th April, 1974, to ascertain a capital gain as between the date of acquisition and the date of disposal, the amount that would be chargeable would be the proportion of the gain that would be deemed to have arisen since 6th April, 1974.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of principle, it seems to me that, in the light of the particular situation that has existed in this country since April, 1974, there may well be many assets which, over a long period since their original acquisition perhaps 20 years ago, have undoubtedly made a gain if they are being disposed of, say, at the present time, but no part of that gain would in reality be referable to the period subsequent to 6th April, 1974.  Indeed, there may be many instances where the value of the asset would be much greater at or before 6th April, 1974, than it would be on the date of disposal.  In those circumstances, since there is either no gain or a loss since 6th April, 1974, is it fair to charge capital gains tax on a proportion of the total gain since the date of original acquisition <Col N="1060" /> which might be as far back as, say, 1953 or 1954?  I agree that the further back the date of acquisition the smaller the proportion of the gain that would be sought to be made referable to the period post-6th April, 1974, and therefore the amount cannot be very great proportionate to the value of the asset.  Nonetheless, as a matter of equity and in recognition of the depressed state of so many markets in the past 12 months, if the taxpayer could show, as he probably could in a great many cases, that there was no capital gain on the assets between 6th April, 1974, and today, if he sold the asset today, he should not be liable for any capital gains tax, notwithstanding the fact that there may be a substantial capital gain between the date of original acquisition and the date of sale or disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxpayer may, of course, elect to take the value as at 6th April, 1974, and if the taxpayer is able to establish that no gain has been made since then or can show a loss since then, then no doubt that would be the date he would take.  Therefore, the option is there at the taxpayer's election as to which date he takes, that date or the original date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with that, I would make one point before we come to the Schedules.  Again we are back to an old problem.  This is only one Act in a series of three at least, excluding the income tax and other provisions.  The Minister is rather cleverly posing the problem for all taxpayers: the value you would like to put on it for the purpose of one Act at that date will be the opposite to the value you want to put on it for the purpose of the next Act.  In other words, if you value anything for the purpose of capital gains on a base date, that value may be favourable from a point of view of this Act, but it may be most unfavourable from the point of view of another Act in the series.  Am I right in that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All values are inter-related and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>For, instance when it comes to death duties under the Acquisitions Tax Bill&mdash;as there will be death duties under that legislation&mdash; if you value upwards to minimise your gain, you are going to value to be caught on the disposal on death, and in the same way on the wealth tax. The implications of this section are really tied up with the other measures, and it is very difficult to discuss it.  Am I right in that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they are inter-related.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If I have an asset and I want to sell it under this Act and I have to go back to find the proper valuation on the 6th April, 1974, or any other base date you care to take, I must have regard to the fact that I am also placing a value on that asset from the point of view of the other Acts.  If I take the highest value I can <Col N="1062" /> get so as to minimise the capital gain, I am maximising my liability under the other two Acts.  Is that the situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a strong encouragement to be honest at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I like the way the Minister puts that, and he is right, but, unfortunately, in the words of the song, it is the poor that gets the blame, and it is the honest that will pay the tax anyway.  It is the dishonest I am worried about.</P>
      <P>I do not think we have really adequately considered the whole question of base valuation.  This section raised the basis of valuation.  On the previous section we spent a long time discussing market value but in our minds all the way through we were thinking of the value and discussing it mainly in relation to value at the date of disposal and gave very little thought to value by reference to the base date.  Perhaps the Minister will say that this arises under the Schedule&mdash;possibly it will in detail as it arose elsewhere&mdash;but I should like the Minister to say what are the mechanics involved.  How can one find the value of assets at a certain date?  Already a year will have elapsed and two years will have elapsed before the case becomes really practicable under this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has already mentioned the question of that date and dates anterior to it.  How is it visualised that one will find the value of an asset at the base time?  What evidence will be accepted of that value?  These are matters vital and substantive to the Bill and I think it is on this section we should discuss them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily a matter for the relevant Schedule and, with respect, it does not arise on section 51 except in so far as section 51 applies the whole Schedule but rather than have a general debate on the whole Schedule now, before we pass section 51, I suggest we leave over the detailed argument until we come to the Schedule itself.  But, to reply briefly to the Deputy's question, the normal position in relation to valuations of property where valuation is on record, as it is on the stock exchange for instance, is to obtain a certificate of <Col N="1063" /> valuation from a reputable valuer.  The Revenue Commissioners may or may not accept this.  If it is not agreed there are negotiations and usually there is a settlement.  If not, the matter must be determined elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the fact that we shall not have a flood of sudden disposals but we shall have people disposing of their property gradually over a period of years, we do not anticipate any particular difficulty in working this section.  Historical valuations are not unusual especially in relation to estate duty where generations are involved sometimes and you may have to go back decades to get valuations, particularly of farm land, as it has been transferred from one generation to another.  Obviously, the farther you go back usually the less relevance to current tax liability the historical valuation has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going further into the content of the Schedule it seems that there is something unusual in this section at the end of a Bill.  Surely when Schedules are referred to they have effect for the purposes of the Bill.  Perhaps I am repeating something said by Deputy Colley when I was not present and if the Minister has answered this point, I do not wish to repeat it.  Subsection (1) reads:</P>
      <P>Schedule 1 (computation), Schedule 2 (companies and shareholders), Schedule 3 (leases), Schedule 4 (specified securities), Schedule 5 (administration) shall have effect for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course they are in the Act for that purpose, not anything else, I presume. Therefore, why do you say &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;?  If you were to say &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act only&rdquo; I could see the point.  It would mean you wanted your definitions to be exclusive and not over-intrude into any other area.  I could understand the Minister saying that Schedules, especially schedules such as those in this Bill where there is a good deal of substantive legislation, were confined to the purposes of the Bill.  If they were not, such substantive <Col N="1064" /> enactments as are contained in them would normally be in the body of the legislation.  I am fairly certain that in more than one place there is a substantive enactment here in the form of a definition or positive legislation for a contingency.  I am puzzled as to why we must say &ldquo;shall have effect for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. That they are included at all and referred to in each section should be enough.  Does the Minister intend that they shall have effect for the purposes of this Act only?  Or is he merely ensuring that the substantive provisions in the Schedule are carried over into the Act?  In the latter case I would make the point that both in the drafting and in the presentation of legislation that is no way to do business.  We should have substantive legislation in the Bill itself and Schedules should be confined.</P>
    <P>We have had legislation by order and by God-knows-what other means but if we are to have a new type of legislation by Schedule we are embarking on further legal confusion and becoming involved in further traps and dangers.  Could the Minister tell me what is the purpose of inserting subsection (1) and could he specifically advert to what I have suggested that the purpose could be, that it was intended that the Schedules would be strictly confined to this Act and not be interpreted as general legislation such as the Act itself will be?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot be related to any Act other than this but it is necessary to have this subsection in order to ensure that everything in the Schedules is applicable to this Bill.  I agree that there are references to the Schedules from time to time and to particular parts of the Schedules but I would not like to guarantee that everything in the Schedules has already been brought in by reference in another section.  This is a safety clause, as it were, to make sure that it is all applicable.  It is normal and there are many other examples.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are practical difficulties in furnishing the information sought by the the Deputy for the following reasons:</P>
      <P>(1)  The VAT returns furnished to the Revenue Commissioners by the Electricity Supply Board state the total tax from sales of electricity and of appliances and from contract work and installation and repair services carried out by the board.  Receipts from electricity sales are not shown separately;</P>
      <P>(2)  In the case of traders registered for VAT the tax invoiced to them by the board is deductible from their own tax liability on their sales of goods or services.  As the tax paid by the board to the Revenue Commissioners includes these deductible amounts it represents the gross figure which is not the amount that ultimately accrues to the Exchequer;</P>
      <P>(3)  In the financial period April 1st to December 31st, 1974, the ESB paid to the Revenue Commissioners a total of £1,971,119 in respect of VAT and, in the calendar year 1974, a total of £2,334,653 but, as I have explained, these are gross figures which include VAT borne by traders registered for VAT, and also the VAT in respect of sales of appliances, contract work and so on.  In addition, where the ESB themselves incur VAT on purchases, the amount involved would be deducted by the board from their VAT payments to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the element of the bill on which VAT is charged was in relation to costs incurred long before the introduction of VAT?  One would assume that the ESB had paid for the installation and committed their capital outlay to these installations, including I take it receivers and things of that nature.  That would not seem to be equitably chargeable at any rate.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are aware, since the introduction of value-added tax on 1st November, 1972, equipment used in schools and school books have generally been liable to the tax and no change in the system is contemplated.</P>

If a science teacher goes into a shop or depot and buys equipment such as a test tube to teach science in his class he is charged VAT but if he said it was for hospital work he would not be charged VAT.  We are encouraging teachers to be dishonest and declare the tube or such equipment is for something different.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if portion of the regional fund allocation will be used under Article 4.2 (b) of the fund regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 4.2 (b) of the Council Regulation (724/75) of 18th March, 1975, establishing the regional fund provides that fund assistance for qualifying infrastructure projects may consist wholly or in part of a rebate of three percentage points on loans made by the European Investment Bank.  While we may consider availing of this option, I would point out that, given the small size of the fund, to use portion of our fund allocation in this way would confer only very limited benefit.  The Government's basic objective is to use regional fund assistance to finance additional industrial and infrastructural investment in the areas of greatest need.  The article referred to in the Deputy's question, if applied by us, would simply reduce the cost of borrowings already negotiated with the European Investment Bank and would not therefore meet our primary requirement of additional capital for development purposes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will no doubt be aware that applications for regional fund assistance and for European Investment Bank loans are not interdependent.  The European Investment Bank have already made three infrastructure loans totalling £21 million for telephone and rail development in this country and discussions are taking place with the bank on possible further infrastructure loan projects.  These discussions will proceed independently of our application for regional fund assistance.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the figure of £172 million under the heading of &ldquo;Other Borrowings&rdquo; in the table of receipts into the Exchequer between 1st January and 13th May, 1975 (a) the names of the banks and countries involved (b) the reason for the extent of such borrowing as compared with the corresponding figure for last year of only £3.69 million (c) the interest rates and (d) the repayment date of each loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure of £172 million mentioned by the Deputy is a gross borrowing figure against which should be set the repayment figure of £116 million on the issues side of the Exchequer statement.  The net figure is £56 million.  The money has been advanced to the Exchequer under temporary overdraft facilities by the Central Bank.  As this facility was extended only towards the end of last year, the figures for the period up to 13th May, 1974, would not have contained any comparable amounts.  The interest rate is the same as the Associated Banks AAA overdraft rate which varies from time to time but which on 13th May, stood at 10¾ per cent.  As the facility is on a day-to-day <Col N="1082" /> basis there is no set repayment date that specific advances must be repaid as quickly as possible but at any rate within a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the opinion of every international institution of repute is that a country like Ireland, affected by the oil imbalance, should borrow in the short term. It is the Government's long publicised strategy to borrow in present circumstances but to reduce the borrowing over a period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to look at any particular economic force in isolation.  As the Deputy knows, they are inter-related.  What I have said about the Government's economic policy is still true, namely, that our circumstances require borrowing on a more substantial scale now than anything we experienced previously.  The alternative to such borrowing would be to cause a devastating slump in the economy which would have the most harmful economic and social effects. The Government are very carefully assessing the situation and, as the requirements of the day dictate, borrowings will be made according to our capacity to repay as well as current needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that there is a deficit of £100 million in the Exchequer returns up to 13th May this year as compared to only £18 million for the same period last year; and if he has any plans to arrest this imbalance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the Exchequer position as compared with the corresponding period of 1974, it has to be remembered that the 1975 budget envisaged a current budget deficit of the order of £125 million so that it is reasonable to expect that the week-by-week Exchequer deficit in 1975 will be at a higher level than in the corresponding period of last year.</P>
      <P>The deficit of £100 million referred to by the Deputy takes account of expenditure of some £45 million on voted capital services so that the deficit on current account alone on 9th May, the date of the Exchequer return, is only slightly over one half of the amount referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>In addition it has to be remembered that considerable fluctuations occur in the budgetary position during the course of a year because of a number of factors, including differences in the timing of expenditure and receipts and, accordingly, whatever the budgetary position in the early part of a particular year may appear to be, it will not necessarily reflect the eventual outturn for that year as a whole.</P>

      <P>Of course the Minister for Finance is concerned about the financial situation.  I would, however, point out to the Deputy that the figures he has quoted include £45 million on voted capital services so the deficit on current account is not as the Deputy has depicted it to be.

This programme involves the survey of all urban areas at a scale of 1 : 1000 (63 ins to 1 mile approx), an overall survey of the country at 1 : 2500 scale (25 ins to 1 mile approx) and the production of 1 : 5000 (12 ins to 1 mile <Col N="1086" /> approx) scale plans which will include contours at 5 meter intervals.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the progress that has been made on the cost/benefit analysis of the rivers on the arterial drainage list which was commenced some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost/benefit study of drainage proposals for the Maigue catchment has been completed and when the report has been edited I shall arrange to have it available in the Dáil Library.  The study for the Corrib-Mask-Robe area is well advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In this study have all the rivers listed for arterial drainage treatment been completed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Before further arterial drainage is carried out a cost/ benefit analysis must be carried out on the particular catchment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that in the time of his predecessor, in relation to rivers far down the list, probably about 25th or 26th, as far as my recollection serves me, 2½ or 3 years ago a cost/ benefit analysis was to be put in hand? Such does not seem to have happened and is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not likely to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it these rivers low down on the list are not likely to be done for many years to come?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confused about this.  The rivers are surveyed but cost/benefit analysis has not been carried out on the rivers that are far down the list.  The first cost/ benefit analysis that was carried out was finished only last October.  That was on the Maigue.  The second one is on the Corrib-Mask-Robe and that will be finished within a month or two.  No other river that is on the list has been cost/benefit surveyed.  Does the Deputy understand what I mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1091" />
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's reply but what I am still trying to find out is what hope there is of rivers that are down the list being done in the foreseeable future.  I refer not only to cost/benefit analysis but to actual work being carried out.  If cost/benefit analysis has any meaning I take it that the proposition is that quite a number of those on the list may fail on the basis of cost/benefit analysis and will not be regarded as worthy of being drained.  Since the process of cost/ benefit analysis appears to be so slow and as only three rivers have so far been subjected to this examination, one would have thought that the others would be in process of being analysed so that they would take their place up the list as others were eliminated.</P>

Consideration by the Council of this decision did not require unanimity of voting and the question of a veto did not arise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  The Minister will recall that we raised the question of compulsory purchase on the Second Stage discussion.  The point involved here is that, when there is a compulsory purchase, it seems to us to be in quite a different category from a voluntary disposition or acquisition as the case might be.  This is something which takes place compulsorily without the taxpayer, who may be subject to capital gains tax on the transaction, having any choice in the matter.  First of all it might strike one that one should exempt completely compulsory purchase transactions from capital gains tax.  This would present a great deal of difficulty for the local authorities and for their operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed as what I hope is a reasonable compromise which would not interfere with the operations of the local authorities but would, at the same time, take account of the fact, from the point of view of the taxpayer, that a compulsory purchase is not a voluntary transaction on the part of the taxpayer.  The effect of the amendment, if accepted, would be that where compulsory purchase powers were exercised by a local authority, say, as a result of which, let us assume, property was acquired, which from the point of view of his ordinary requirements the taxpayer wanted to replace, he would not be <Col N="1107" /> assessed for capital gains tax on the basis of what the asset had originally cost him deducted from the price he received on foot of the compensation assessed under the compulsory purchase machinery, but would be based on that, less the cost of acquiring a comparable asset.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable proposition.  It ensures that account is taken of the fact that in this case the transaction is not a voluntary one but one which is forced on the taxpayer by virtue of power given on foot of legislation passed by Parliament in the interests of the common good, but, nevertheless, takes account of the position of the taxpayer.  It provides that, if the asset in question is compulsorily acquired, he will be allowed&mdash;before any question of his liability to capital gains tax arises&mdash;to replace the asset with a comparable one.  Of course, if after doing so he still has a gain then, by all means, one can, and perhaps should, apply capital gains tax to that surplus.  But to apply capital gains tax to the alleged gain the taxpayer has, without taking account of the cost of providing himself with a comparable asset, would be quite unjust, having regard to the fact that he had no choice in the matter but had it forced on him by compulsory purchase powers.  I would hope the Minister would find it possible to accept at least the principle involved in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite centain what the Deputy is hoping to get at here.  If a person is in trade, there will be roll-over relief if the proceeds are reinvested in a trade or business. If it is a private dwelling and an acre around it, there will be no liability and, of course, no allowable loss either. Therefore, I am not quite certain what would be the kind of cases in which the Deputy visualises it would be necessary to give additional relief. If the Deputy's amendment were one which would provide additional relief where compulsory purchase occurs, then it would seem to me that the real, social effect of his recommendation would be to encourage people to oblige <Col N="1108" /> local authorities or the State to proceed to compulsory purchase.  If they are going to get additional relief as a consequence of compulsory purchase, why should anybody agree to a reasonable price?  Why not force compulsory purchase?  The social and economic effects might well be to slow up the process of acquiring land for public use.  Where compulsory purchase occurs, it does so because statutory powers are given to the State or the local authority for the public good and for that purpose only.  It would seem to me to be very inadvisable, indeed, to provide any scheme in this or in any other Bill which would have the effect of encouraging people to hold out for compulsory purchase procedures in order to get a benefit which would not be available to them if they agreed to sell a property.  Perhaps the Deputy has in mind that once a public authority was endeavouring to acquire it, these provisions should apply.  But I do not think there should be any difference between the handling of purchases whether it be a public or private interest making the purchase.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that acceptance of the amendment would result in a slowing down of procedures very necessary for the public good.  For that reason alone I feel I cannot accept it.  But I should like to hear from Deputy Colley where he feels the provisions relating to trading or business assets and private housing would not ensure that a person would not be caught for such gains anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to trading assets, I think the Minister by dint of repetition of something appears to have convinced himself that what he has been saying in this House repeatedly is fully accurate.  Of course, it is not.  Roll-over relief in the case of trading assets is merely a postponement; it is not an exemption from capital gains tax. As time progresses and the assets are replaced, time after time, the potential liability to capital gains tax grows, so that one could easily end up with a situation in which, when assets were being finally disposed of by a trader, he could have a liability to capital gains tax which had increased practically year by year and stretched back <Col N="1109" /> for a period of a generation or longer with a very substantial liability to capital gains tax arising at that stage.</P>
      <P>Therefore, to say that this amendment would provide no relief in the case of people involved in trading is not correct.  Of course, it would provide such relief.  I should like to stress and I should like the Minister to remember, that roll-over relief is not exemption from capital gains tax; it is merely postponement.  Of course, it is true that in the case of a principal dwelling house and one acre surrounding it there is exemption. But other kinds of assets can be involved than a principal private dwelling house and an acre around it, other than trading assets.  In that case, relief would also be provided under this amendment.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether acceptance of this amendment would hold up or interfere with the operation of compulsory purchase machinery by local authorities, it was precisely because of the danger of that happening that this amendment was not designed to exempt such transactions from capital gains tax. It does not do that.  The only benefit that would arise here would be if the gain resulting from the amount of compensation was such that, having replaced the asset compulsorily acquired with a comparable one, there was still a surplus gain which could be liable to capital gains tax. That is what is envisaged under this amendment.  In that case, in order to give somebody, if you like, a built-in inducement to compel a local authority to resort to compulsory acquisition, as distinct from agreement between the parties, it would be necessary for the owner of the asset to be sure that the compensation he would receive on foot of compulsory purchase would be such as to ensure he did not pay capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might say: &ldquo;Ah, yes, but as long as he is allowed the deduction of the cost of a comparable asset, there is a gain and a benefit for him in this&rdquo;.  That may be true but I want to put it to the Minister that the position of a person whose asset is acquired compulsorily is not <Col N="1110" /> the same as, or comparable with, the position of a person who voluntarily enters into a transaction to dispose of some asset he possesses.  To try to compare the two and pretend they are the same is to ignore the realities. There are many people who have assets acquired compulsorily, say, by local authorities, who have no wish whatsoever to part with them and, indeed, who would oppose the compulsory purchase order as strongly as they can not merely in an effort to try to get higher compensation but because they do not wish to part with the asset, because it does not suit them; it does not suit their way of life; it does not suit the manner in which they intend to conduct the rest of their lives.  Some people are very seriously upset on foot of compulsory purchase acquisition.  To ignore that is to ignore realities.  To treat a person in that position as being in the same position as somebody who voluntarily enters into an agreement to sell part of his property is not in accordance with reality.  We in this House, and the Minister in particular, have an obligation to take that reality into account in a practical way by providing that where a person is forced to part with an asset, on foot of powers given by this Parliament, he is not put in a position that not alone is the asset he wants to retain taken from him, but he is assessed for capital gains tax on the alleged gain arising.</P>
    <P>If a person were allowed to keep his asset, he might not want to part with it.  If and when liability for tax arose, it would arise with his successor after his death.  In this way, with the operation of the compulsory purchase powers, the asset is taken from him and he is made liable for capital gains tax at a time when he does not wish to be disturbed in the enjoyment of that asset.  It seems unreasonable that the exercise of compulsory powers should result not only in his being forced to give up the asset, but also in being, willy-nilly, subject to capital gains tax on what is in many cases an imaginary gain.  This gain is imaginary in many cases because he will effectively be obliged to find the money to <Col N="1111" /> replace the asset.  If he is not allowed the cost of replacing it, then it is an imaginary gain.  If he has been assessed for capital gains on the alleged gain, he may not even have enough money to replace it with a comparable asset. This savours of the exercise of statutory powers gone mad and producing a grave injustice for many taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I do not say that this situation would arise in every case of compulsory purchase because that obviously could not be true.  The situation I have described could arise in many cases on foot of a compulsory purchase order.  We cannot escape our obligation to take account of the occurrence of such a situation and make provision for easing the difficulties which may arise.  I believe we can do that by the acceptance of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to my colleagues in this amendment. The Minister gave his answer in two ways.  First, he said that it would encourage compulsory acquisition procedures.  That is not necessarily so.  In any event, a simple drafting adjustment would get over that. The essence of the transaction is not the compulsory acquisition proceedings but the fact that the acquisition has taken place in consequence of powers vested in the public authority or any other authority who are in a position to acquire, whether the vendor consents or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essence of the word &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; is not that one must go through a procedure and get a judgment, it means that there is a statutory provision here which enables the authority to acquire that asset and a compulsion arises from that.  There is no change in that element.  If the seller and the local authority agree on the purchase price and the terms of the acquisition, or if they get an arbitrator or judge to decide, the method by which the compulsion is implemented is relatively immaterial.  The compulsion itself is the governing factor and the dictating condition, whether compulsory legal procedures are invoked or not.  For that reason, I submit that the Minister's objection on these grounds can easily be met by <Col N="1112" /> appropriate drafting.  I am sure Deputy Colley would not object to his amendment being modified if his intention is carried out.</P>
    <P>The second point goes very deeply into this legislation and obviously influences the Minister: It is difficult to discuss this point especially on Committee Stage since it ranges over at least three Bills and we are on Committee Stage discussing one part of a Schedule.  Since the Minister mentioned what he called &ldquo;social factors&rdquo; perhaps I might be allowed reply.</P>
    <P>I certainly agree that any interference in any tax or other statute that is not directly concerned with established legal procedures under another Act, is undesirable.  I also agree that from a social point of view to stimulate fractiousness and the invocation of compulsory procedures or legal processes of that nature unnecessarily, are socially to be discouraged. I wholeheartedly take his point on these ideas.</P>
    <P>In my view the Minister is in danger of falling into a different social view than the legislative occasion demands. I would have been more convinced of his social point if he had said that Deputy Colley's amendment would tend to keep wealth concentrated rather than distributed.  He made that point on other sections of the Bill. When he mentioned &ldquo;social considerations&rdquo; I thought that was the point he was coming to.  Even though he has not mentioned it I feel I should deal with it.  The point made on compulsory acquisition can be got over.</P>
    <P>Is the point I have made now in contravention of the social policy? Frankly I do not think so&mdash;quite the reverse.  What would tend to happen, as is happening these days, is that when there is a compulsory purchase the cases Deputy Colley has mentioned occur often, but there are cases where people are quite glad of compulsory acquisition and are able to concentrate the proceeds in a way that would not fit in with the philosophy I believe the Minister believes in.</P>
    <P>The only safeguard against erring from the straight and narrow here is to do the simple, just thing.  Therefore, <Col N="1113" /> it seems to me that the acquisition of a comparable asset is merely a replacement, in many cases at a loss.  I will not repeat Deputy Colley's argument on this but I am in wholehearted support of the cases he has made.</P>
    <P>I want to put an additional case, additional in the sense that it is a different type of case.  It could happen that it would be hardly desirable socially that an asset be replaced.  The Minister brushed that aside and instanced a dwelling house.  It is not as simple as that.  As Deputy Colley said, the owner may not want to part with an asset, parting might be a loss and a hardship though the loss may not be measurable by the same standards as we have measured gains in other parts of the Bill.  I can think of a case where a person has an office or small business on a corner site.  He might employ a number of people&mdash;it might even be a factory.  In other words, the asset involves employment of others.  If Deputy Colley's amendment is accepted it will be an encouragement to such a person whose property has been acquired compulsorily to replace it with a comparable asset&mdash;in other words, to continue the business on comparable terms.  Here I am diverging for social reasons and here I contrast the point with the Minister's case about conglomeration of business and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is probably right in many or perhaps most cases of compulsory acquisition.  There are many people who do not wish to part with an office or business.  That is the case Deputy Colley has made on the amendment but there are the other cases to which I referred which are completely different from and in strong contrast to the cases Deputy Colley had in mind, namely cases where people may be just as glad to have the asset acquired or at worst will be willing to make the best of a bad job.</P>
    <P>I come again to the case of the corner office or small business.  The purchase price goes to the proprietor who has the choice of carrying on but with a change of place, or he may be very glad to get out of business.  There are people in such cases who would put <Col N="1114" /> their wealth and their profits away in areas which are socially unproductive. Surely the giving of employment in the office or factory I have spoken about would be socially desirable and probably productive.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it may be possible for Deputy Colley and the Minister to modify the drafting of the amendment so that there would be a direct incentive in the type of case I have mentioned, so that the person in the conditions I have spoken of would be inclined to reinvest the proceeds of compulsory acquisition in a comparable asset.  I should like to know what the Minister thinks of that point.  It is not a case of merely looking to see if somebody got a few pounds more profit or something like that.  It is a matter of equity and social desirability.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;This does not happen every day of the week.&rdquo; It can happen, particularly in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not because there is supposed to be this involuntary element.  There are many decisions made by people over much of their lives which are involuntary and they do not receive compensation because the decisions are not to their own liking. <Col N="1115" /> There are many decisions which are forced upon people through failure in business, through family circumstances, through family poverty, none of which are deserving of any lesser treatment than that towards those who receive total compensation under the Compulsory Purchase Acts.</P>
      <P>What is the difference?  Why should the one be treated differently from the other?  The poverty which forces somebody to sell is far more agonising than the upset and inconvenience which somebody else suffers because he is obliged to sell to answer a community need but receives adequate compensation when he does so.  There are many people who are forced to sell because of their own impoverished circumstances and who receive less than they might receive if they were able to hold on or force the matter to compulsory purchase arbitration. There is a suggestion here once again that I have to deprecate and it is forever rearing its ugly head in this House, that the State is always wrong, that the State can do no good, that the State acts against the common good.  The notion here is that an evil State is grabbing hold of somebody's property.</P>

      <P>No.  The small boys are not called upon to suffer at all. The person who is in business, the person who is in a private dwelling, who is the small person that Deputy Colley says he is concerned about, is protected by the exemptions that are there already, and it does not need additional exemptions here.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Deputies to consider seriously what they are suggesting and I would illustrate this with an example: a person could acquire an asset worth £5,000 and it could be compulsorily acquired at £10,000. The Opposition are suggesting that that £10,000 should not then be considered for capital gains tax purposes and that a person could get a new asset for £10,000.  That £10,000 might be invested in a new asset which might later be compulsorily acquired for £20,000, and so the lucky person then has a new asset at a starting price of £20,000.</P>

      <P>Yes, exactly, and the very amendment that has been suggested is designed to encourage people &mdash;I am not saying it is designed intentionally&mdash;to look out for property that might be compulsorily purchased, because the longer they held their asset in that way the greater could be their tax-free gain.  Ultimately, they could arrive at a situation where the asset might be worth £100,000, and it might be then reinvested in a comparable asset and then immediately resold on the open market without waiting for compulsory purchase.  In that situation a person would have made a tax-free gain of £95,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fairly satisfied that these are the kinds of cases that would develop if special treatment were to be given to compulsory purchase cases.  I do not think it would be possible to sign any amendment to prevent the situation where people would invariably force local authorities to make a compulsory purchase order. Even if this amendment were to be accepted, it would either have the effect I described or else it would affect the purchase price.  It might, of course, affect the purchase price to the advantage of the community in that the price demanded on compulsory purchase might be less than the reserve, if it was a private sale, because if it was on a public purchase one would know that the gain was going to be made without any liability to tax, whereas if it was a private sale there would be liability to tax.  But that is only a book-keeping transaction.  The public interest will lose out anyway if the tax has to be foregone because of a compulsory purchase situation. Therefore, we are back to square one in any event, and all we have done is to build into the Act a new calculation, a new exemption, which only the people of substantial means and leisure and the capacity for intrigue and speculation will be able to make any money out of.  If the small man is the person to be considered, that is the person who has a house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I intend to talk about the average person.  Evidently the Minister is far removed from the operations of the average businessman and has spent his whole day as far as this Bill is concerned witch hunting regarding tax evasion.  He thinks of the average businessmen as being out to make an easy profit.  I am not questioning the authority of public acquisition but what Deputy Colley is trying to do in this amendment is to deal with the case of the average person caught by public acquisition.  I know many business people in Dublin Central where urban renewal is going on and main roads are being run right through the city and major parts of it are being acquired, drapers, grocers, publicans and so on and they know they will be acquired in the very near future. Acquisition can come at different times of life and this is important. If a man's property is acquired at age 35 he may have the initiative and drive to reinvest in the suburbs but the view put to me is that the amount of money he gets as a result of acquisition will not be sufficient to acquire a suburban property because the price level is so high.  These people have no desire to leave their present places of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the type of person I am talking about, not the super-speculator the Minister is trying to catch in this Bill.  I have no doubt I shall <Col N="1120" /> meet many decent, honest traders in the next five or six years in my constituency who will be caught by this Bill.  One can visualise a man of 55 who has every intention of spending the remainer of his life in his property and who has a compulsory acquisition order served on him.  He will have no hope of acquiring property or reinvesting the money.  I know the value of suburban property: it is impossible to get sites in the suburbs. Suburban development is almost completely in the direction of shopping centres and the amount of available investment business is negligible.  It would be impossible for many of those I am talking about to invest in business in the suburbs when their property is acquired.  How will the Minister deal with this type of operation? I know how the Bill will deal with it. When a man, through no fault of his own, fails to avail of the roll-over provision the Minister will come in under this Bill, after compulsory acquisition has put a man and his family out of business, and take 26 per cent of the capital gain.  That is socially wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he is not concerned about that type of person but rather about the professional speculator.  There are more of the people about whom I am speaking, genuine traders and businessmen who may have an office block or a factory or any type of shop, than the other type.  Compulsory orders are being made right across the city and I know several businessmen who are under acquisition orders at present.  They know what their future is.  They know that with the amount they get when their property is compulsorily acquired, perhaps in seven or eight years' time, they will have no hope of replacing it in the suburbs.  That is the injustice we will cause when we operate this Bill.  We also know there is a time limit as regards reinvestment. In the amendment introduced by the Minister if they reinvest outside the business in which they were engaged, he allows them two years to invest.  The Minister knows that in the case of the person we are dealing with coming under a <Col N="1121" /> compulsory purchase order, such a person has no hope of complying with that regulation as regards reinvesting within the two years allowed by a previous section.</P>
    <P>I sincerely believe that Deputy Colley's amendment should be accepted because if not, the Minister will be taking money from people whose property has been acquired compulsorily and who have no way of engaging in any type of business. We know the rate of inflation.  If a property is compulsorily purchased now and a purchase sum is fixed it can be a considerable time before that money is paid before the owner would be in a position to reinvest. With inflation running at 25 per cent and every possibility that it will go to 30 per cent, you can visualise what the money will be worth as regards reinvestment in two years' time. Assuming the man failed to get back into business&mdash;this can happen&mdash;and if he does not avail of the roll-over clause, capital gains tax will take 26 per cent.  If he gets £100,000 for his property and fails to reinvest the State will take 26 per cent and, with inflation at 25 or 30 per cent, one can see how this capital is eroded in a very short time.  It would be reduced to about 50 per cent.  Surely there is no justice in that.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this amendment seriously.  There is much merit in it.  If the Minister does not accept it he will be treating the average businessman unjustly under this Bill.  When I first saw this section in the Bill&mdash;although we changed our minds later&mdash;I thought that a man whose property was compulsorily acquired should not be subject to any capital gains tax.  We found this might create certain problems that we could foresee.  But I think Deputy Colley's amendment deserves serious consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was a little surprised at the vehemence of the Minister when he rose to answer me. First, I took it as a compliment and that my argument had, so to speak, gone home.  I hope I did not sound as aggressive as I was made to think I had been.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that I took that as an indication that there was some weight behind the arguments which Deputy Colley and I were advancing.  We do appreciate that it is a prolonged and difficult task to be in the Minister's seat at the moment with this stack of legislation, but it is not easy for us either.  We are not doing it just for fun and I would like him to take what we are saying as a serious contribution.  I give full weight to the substantive things the Minister said in reply.  He did cause me to understand the weight of his argument in regard to the speculator and particularly&mdash;and I am sure my colleagues, too, will appreciate it&mdash; the possibility of a series of quick purchases which, quite frankly is something I had not been adverting to.  Let us take that in its due course.</P>
      <P>There are three things I should like to say in reply to the Minister.  First, nobody on this side is approaching the State as a tyrant.  I think that is an uncalled-for accusation and in the circumstances not quite fair to us, but that is not the point.  The point is that certain individuals are, because of the action of the community, put into a certain situation and this is why we were taking particular pains to reinforce the personal equity argument by a social and community argument. Whether you take the points made by Deputy Colley, by Deputy Fitzpatrick or myself, there is a community aspect in support of this amendment.  In respect of Deputy Colley, there is the social argument as to the replacement of an asset compulsorily acquired by an asset of comparable value and it is most likely to be in regard to the acquisition of property, lands and buildings for development by the public authority.  In that case, quite apart from the equity to the individual, there will usually be a strong public argument for the reinvesting of the money in a comparable asset, its replacement as a comparable asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley has spoken in terms <Col N="1123" /> of the compulsion bringing about a psychological attitude, and in fact it is taken from the person without any willingness on his part and the natural reaction of a person in that position is to pack up and get out&mdash;&ldquo;Let me give the Revenue a few more pence&rdquo;&mdash;but it is an attitude of mind which does not do the community any good.  Take the point I made of the acquisition of an office or small industry. If the proprietor simply takes the cash in hand and waives the rest, there are social factors and particularly, as I mentioned, employment factors. This ties up rather closely with Deputy Fitzpatrick, who made the very concrete and important case which all of us city Deputies know about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there are big developments being pushed forward by local authorities; and although I do not subscribe at all to the idea that the State is a big bully, sometimes some of these schemes are rather grandiose and they are very ruthless, and if no more than the employment issue which I have mentioned as a social one, the very fact that you are stifling trade and small trade by disencouraging people to keep small businesses going, is that not a social aim that would justify this amendment?  If it is the Government policy, the policy of the House and public policy to wipe out the small man and go further towards State socialism, let us say so; but do not let us pay lipservice to the idea of trying to keep the small man in business if we are not going to take the opportunities that offer to help him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from that consideration, there is the actual stimulation of trade.  I can think of a village not very far from where I am which has stagnated because of compulsory acquisition, or incidentally to that, because the main road was driven another way.  It is highly desirable that something should be done in that area to stimulate the businesses which have closed down.  I want to reinforce Deputy Fitzpatrick's point that the <Col N="1124" /> maintenance of trade, the maintenance of economic activity, of the very business that is required to give the revenue in any way the Minister is seeking, the maintenance of economic trade in community which is the basis on which we are all living&mdash;let that die and we can argue away about taxes because there will be nothing to collect and nothing to support the tax collecting and administrative elements of the State.  We must be aware of legislation&mdash;but I am going too far; I will keep it for the Fifth Stage.  I am sorry if I was waxing away on a tangent. What I want to say is that we were not as unreasonable as the Minister seems to think.</P>
    <P>To come to his point on the acquisition tax, the Minister suggested to me a point which is not quite the amendment.  He made the point that this would stimulate compulsory acquisition proceedings and told us to stick to the Planning Acts.  Unfortunately in the way legislation here is, all Acts are getting very much tied together and I put it to the Minister like this.  Supposing the people sponsoring the Planning Acts wanted to build in an incentive to avoid compulsory acquisition by putting in an amendment to give exactly what Deputy Colley wants to give in the case where the parties arrive at an agreement and as an incentive to avoiding compulsory acquisition proceedings.</P>
    <P>Suppose the Government came to the conclusion that in order to discourage waste of time in legal proceedings and delay in compulsory acquisition and to encourage the parties involved to agree a price they would bring in Deputy Colley's deduction would it be in the Planning Act or in one of the Minister's Acts.  I believe we would find it in a Finance Act or have some Minister coming in making a great point about it.  I freely concede the weight of the force of some of the Minister's arguments and any reasonable person would but will the Minister concede the weight of the force of our argument and let us, between us, see if we can get an answer?  On this amendment we have an opportunity of doing something <Col N="1125" /> socially desirable as well as equitable. Section 28, the section which gives roll-over and reliefs of that nature, is hedged in.  I urge on the Minister the force of the approach of Deputy Colley's amendment in relation to that section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The social case made by Deputy de Valera for the encouragement and reinvestment of moneys received on foot of compulsory acquisition in business is so compelling that I would be prepared to amend my amendment so as to provide that the relief proposed would be available only when a comparable asset had been acquired.  The amendment does not provide that but I would have no objection to it being amended in that way so as to ensure that the inducement Deputy de Valera spoke of is there.  With all due respect to the Minister, when he finds himself reduced to the position of having to produce an imaginary case of a kind that I do not believe could ever occur to argue against this amendment he ought to examine his position again.</P>
      <P>The case the Minister gave us against this amendment was somebody who starts off by deliberately acquiring premises which he expects to be compulsorily acquired.  The Minister put the case that that person would then invest the proceeds he receives in compensation in other premises which he anticipates would be compulsorily acquired.  He then reinvests the compensation he gets from those premises in premises to be compulsorily acquired and so on.  The Minister cannot seriously be putting that forward against the reality described by Deputy Fitzpatrick of what is taking place in many parts of the country but, specifically, in the city of Dublin.  In my constituency, and I would say in the Minister's constituency, small traders are becoming the subject of compulsory acquisition by the local authority.  All of the problems attendant on that described by Deputy Fitzpatrick are the reality of what is happening.  The Minister has not given a sufficient answer to the effect that these people can get roll-over relief if they invest again in another business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1126" /> It is not a sufficient answer because roll-over relief is merely postponement. As Deputy Fitzpatrick cogently pointed out, many of these people will find themselves in the position where they cannot acquire another business and where the compensation they get, even though assessed in accordance with law, is not sufficient to enable them to acquire another business in the suburbs even if such were available. These are the realities of the situation we are trying to deal with in this amendment and not the situation envisaged by the Minister of a person deliberately investing to get compulsory acquisition and compensation and then doing the same again. There is no reality to that situation and the Minister must know it.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have regard to the realities of the situation.  If the Minister fears that there would be a loophole in this for the kind of person he has described, it is probable that his advisers could produce an amendment which would achieve what we are trying to achieve and still close the loophole.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that is impossible and that the loophole has to be left. I would take serious issue with the Minister if he attempted to justify doing what is proposed to be done here to the various small people whose assets may be acquired compulsorily and justifying that on the basis that if he does not do that somebody is going to get away with the kind of operation he has described.  That operation is so far removed from reality as to lack all credibility.  If that loophole cannot be closed, are we justified in inflicting a deduction of 26 per cent from the gain on a compulsory acquisition, a gain calculated in a very artificial way in many cases, and not allowing for the person concerned having and trying to reinvest in a comparable asset?</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister also on the basic principle involved in this. When I was moving this amendment originally and talking about the difference between the position of a person subject to compulsory acquisition and the person who voluntarily engages in a transaction for disposal of his <Col N="1127" /> assets, I thought of the situation of the person who fails in business and is compelled then to dispose of his assets. However, I did not feel it was worth mentioning it because it was so self-evidently different.  I could hardly believe my ears when I heard the Minister say that he could not see any difference between the position of a person who fails in business and, therefore, has to dispose of his assets and somebody who is subjected to compulsory acquisition of his assets on foot of the authority vested in a local authority by Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is a major difference in the position of somebody who is subjected to compulsory acquisition of his property, against his wishes in many cases, and has no choice and the person who voluntarily enters into an agreement to sell his property.  To try to compare these positions and say they are the same is, I suggest, getting far removed from life as it is here.  I am afraid the Minister is becoming so indoctrinated with certain theories that he is losing touch with the reality of life as it is lived by the Irish people around us. The case described by Deputy Fitzpatrick is the one which will be seriously damaged unless an amendment is accepted on the lines of the one I put forward.  It is not good enough for the Minister to sweep all that aside on the basis that some smart-aleck will keep on having his property compulsorily acquired in order to evade liability for capital gains tax. The arguments put forward for this amendment deserve a better answer than that.  If that is the best answer the Minister has, it should be an indication to him that he should examine more closely the principle involved in this amendment.  I am quite convinced there is substance in the case put forward for this amendment.  I freely accept that it may be necessary to do some re-drafting; I reiterate I will be quite happy to re-draft it to ensure that the relief proposed is available only if and when a person actually reinvests in a comparable asset to achieve the incentive referred to by Deputy de Valera.  However, the principle involved, which acknowledges there is a <Col N="1128" /> difference in the position of someone who is forced, whether or not he wishes, to give up his property as compared with a person who voluntarily enters into an agreement is important and should be recognised by the House. I do not think the Minister is doing justice to himself or to his party if he refuses to recognise that.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 44a:</P>
      <P>In Part I, page 47, to delete paragraph 3 (3).</P>
      <P>Paragraph 3 (3) is very short.  It reads:</P>
      <P>No payment of interest shall be allowable as a deduction under this paragraph.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the reasoning behind this provision.  I have no doubt the Minister will throw some light on it when he replies but on the face of it it appears to be a most unreasonable provision.  As far as my inquiries go, I believe that there is provision for a deduction in respect of interest in certain circumstances under the capital gains tax legislation in Britain but whether there is or not does not seem to me to be particularly relevant, not only because the circumstances here are different from those in Britain but also because we should be concerned with doing what we believe to be right rather than just what is done in Britain.</P>
      <P>The Schedule allows expenses of disposal such as the fees, commission or remuneration of professional advisers and the cost of sale including even the cost of advertising to find a buyer for the property and the cost of obtaining advice as to the market value of the asset.  In those circumstances it is very difficult to understand why interest should be singled out as an expense which would not be allowed as a deduction.</P>
      <P>All sorts of different transactions are covered by this but one where the matter would be of considerable importance would be property development where, I understand, interest payments frequently amount to as high as 25 to 30 per cent of the overall expense and consequently where a loss or even a small profit may be made on the final development a calculation of capital gains tax could bring about a further considerable loss overall.</P>
      <P>I should also like to pose the question as to whether the non-allowance of interest is in accordance with the Constitution because where a person has genuinely incurred interest related only to the cost of acquisition of the asset and subsequently sold the asset the non-allowance of the interest will result in taxation on a profit which was never made.  The taxation of a profit which the individual did not make is very likely to be unconstitutional and for that reason I have moved this amendment to delete the provision which prohibits the deduction of interest as an expenditure in calculating the gain on which the tax should be assessed.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that this provision in paragraph 3 (3) is not confined to what we might call private assets but appears to extend to business assets as well, which makes it even more reprehensible.  I can see no justification for this approach and I will be interested to hear the Minister's reasons for including this provision in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has referred to the position in Britain.  The position there is that the relief in respect of interest applies only to companies and it applies where a company has defrayed out of borrowed funds the cost of the construction of the building structure or works and has earmarked the expenditure in the accounts as capital expenditure.  There the interest is payable only in respect of capital tax liability and not in respect of any income tax liability.</P>
      <P>I will be giving consideration to this matter later this year in dealing with our own corporation tax position and having regard to the fact that a company may, in fact, have this capital expense and incur this interest it might be appropriate to do something. Whether I should leave it over until the corporation tax Bill or deal with it in this Bill, I am not too sure.  I would be prepared to consider the matter between now and the next Stage to see if pending the corporation tax Bill I should do something about it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I just clarify something?  Do I take it from what the Minister has said that what he is considering is the allowance of interest in respect of trade assets but not in respect of non-trade assets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering it in relation to construction works by a company.  It would not be possible to give this concession to an individual but only to a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister dwell on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if it is an ordinary stock-in trade, and so on, it would come under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If an individual expends interest solely in relation to the acquisition of a particular asset, what is the difference in principle between the individual and the company in this case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Britain, it applies only to companies and does not extend to individuals.  The Deputy is aware that in last year's Finance Act we took steps to prevent the use of <Col N="1134" /> credit facilities to individuals for tax avoidance purposes.  It would not be possible effectively to control the situation if unlimited interest was to be allowed to individuals and I consider that if the concession is to be given to companies who are trading companies, that is the limit of what would be tolerable.  It is interesting to find our neighbours have found it necessary to restrict the concession in the same way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person is in property business or any business where a large amount of money is involved, he purchases and the bank reckons a two- or three-year period in which to finish the operation and they usually sign for that period.  They let the interest roll over and they treat it as a capital charge.  It is the same if you pay for an architect, an engineer or a quantity surveyor.  It is an expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the cost of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You pay it out. It is like bricks and mortar.  A person can have everything lined up to finish on a certain day and because of economic circumstances, delay in planning or a particular planner out sick at a time when a decision cannot be made, you have to wait up to four months.  You have to pay for this delay, which is no fault of the developer or company.  If there is a scarcity of property the interest rate will not be that important.  There is always a period, such as when there is an economic boom, where certain property may take six months to get rid of.  You have to pay interest on this and you pay more in extra costs. Instead of paying income tax and corporation profits tax at 49 per cent you could end up paying 60 per cent if you were not allowed on your interest. This will stop employment, I feel interest must be allowed.  If you buy a premises for so much and you go to your local bank in the morning and ask for a loan for £X you repay it at so much plus the interest.  You pay capital plus interest and your costs are added in.  Your local bank or merchant banker will tell <Col N="1135" /> you the amount you must pay back to him per year.  I cannot see interest as anything else but part of the costs.</P>
      <P>In another Bill the Minister allowed no more than £2,000 interest but this is a different matter.  Here it is part of paying out.  If a person bought a bulldozer to do a job he would have to write that off against the cost of building shops, an office block or whatever it is.  The interest is the charge on it.  If you are on a very tight margin there is no profit at all and we will be back to what we were discussing earlier, where you will have a capital loss rather than a capital gain.</P>
      <P>Let us take a reasonably sized business where you borrow from 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the money required.  If it is an office block you can borrow up to 90 per cent.  Your interest charge on this is greater than the costs of all the professional people you employ.  It can be as much as 50 per cent of total costs, including the land.  If there is any delay in finishing the building you could end up with no profit at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House understands that if a company or an individual is trading in this way then interest on money borrowed is set off against income.  Under our law, interest is treated as being a revenue item.  It has not been treated until now as a capital item.  I know we are changing the law in relation to capital taxation and that is why I said I am prepared to look at this.  It is a new treatment of interest which until now has been set off against income.  It is one of the outgoings of a company or business.  Interest has been allowed on personal loans too and was unlimited until last year when we considered it was necessary to impose a restriction unless an individual was borrowing for the purpose of a business, in which case if it was for the improvement of the business or the purchase of a business, there was no limit to the amount of borrowing which could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked to deal now with a separate situation, where a person is not in the business of developing, <Col N="1136" /> if I understand Deputy Belton rightly.  That is a situation I want to look at very carefully.  I would not want to rush into giving any undertaking now as to what precise amendments might be made to this Bill or to say if I would deal with it in this Bill or later in the year in the corporation tax Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned interest not being treated as capital.  About eight years ago I went into a bank manager and this was the first time I ever used the words &ldquo;cash flow&rdquo;, which all the whiz kids use. The bank manager told me there was no such thing as a cash flow.  &ldquo;It is a bigger overdraft or a smaller overdraft you are looking for&rdquo; he told me.  Interest to me was always capital.  You were worth £100,000, for instance. You owed £50,000 plus interest.  You took all that off your £100,000 and the remainder is what you were worth. This is as basic as bricks and mortar. You have it or you have not got it. Cash flow is an overdraft and interest is capital.  It is a capital sum which you owe and you must pay it.  If you cannot do so you must sell out and pay it and you are left with a net figure.</P>
      <P>The one thing I can agree with the Minister on is the case of a person who might have done a deal with an insurance company and he might have a fixed interest rate of about 6½ per cent.  This man could sit back and need not let the place.  He is making capital profit every day of the week and with inflation going up he is sure to make a large profit.  The best example of that is Centre Point in London where the individual who owned it had a fixed rate of 6½ per cent and the going rate was 15 per cent.  He sat back and the insurance company, which gave him the fixed rate, had to give a large sum of money to buy him out because he made such a large amount of capital.  The Minister should stop that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am speaking of the case of an individual or a company paying £100,000 for property.  The cost of vending is £100,000 but he may borrow £150,000.  He is paying 15 per cent or 13? per cent interest on that.  That <Col N="1137" /> means the total cost is £200,000 plus 15 per cent or 13? per cent of the £150,000.  He should get something for his own £50,000 but he will let that go towards the profit.  That is his risk capital in it.  Surely that man must get the interest allowance, which is really part of his capital.  If I thought people were getting away with it and doing something wrong I would be all in favour of doing something about it. If this happens the Minister and the Government will get their cut out of it.</P>
    <P>I am afraid there will be less building and, if there is not less building, the charges will be a lot higher.  If a person has flats, office blocks, shops, or whatever you like, he gets a rent and sells at a certain number of years' purchase.  He then takes off his costs. The interest rates will be very high and they will not be allowable.  This means he will lose money.  If he is to make money he must charge a greater amount.  This means that there will be a scarcity of buildings and whoever has a few buildings will make money. In my opinion we are upping the price artificially.  I do not think anybody can deny that an interest charge is a capital charge.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Youth Development Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce a comprehensive policy on youth development which has had a serious effect on youth organisations throughout the country and calls on the Government to announce their policy, if any, forthwith.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Wyse)</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night that I felt the whole community should be involved in a youth development policy. In the policy being evolved by the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton, we must ensure that the cold <Col N="1138" /> hand of bureaucracy does not fall on the voluntary bodies who have done tremendous work for our youth.  Whatever policy is put forward must be an aid and a guide to these voluntary organisations.  We do not want an authoritarian document laying down rules and regulations.  This would cause more problems than it would solve.  Knowing the Parliamentary Secretary I have no doubt that this will not happen but, not knowing what is in the document it is important that that should be said in the House.  People are asking why the document has not been issued to date.  Last night the Minister clearly indicated that it is almost completed.  I hope that it will issue some time in the near future.</P>
      <P>A youth development policy encompasses quite a number of Departments apart from the Department of Education. The Department of Labour and AnCO are involved in apprenticeship training.  The Department of Local Government are involved in the community. Where young people are in trouble with the law, the Department of Justice are involved.  The Department of Health are involved in remedial work.  When we are talking about a plan it is important that the whole aspect of youth activity from A to Z is taken into account.</P>
      <P>Too many people think that youth involvement is connected with sports only.  This is important but it is only a facet of the problem.  Greater emphasis should be placed on physical education for young people.  In many schools it is haphazard.  If a teacher is interested in athletics and sport, that school will have a greater participation in physical education than another school where there is no teacher who is interested in those activities.  There should be a co-ordinated effort in all the schools at the primary level.  This is the proper place to develop an attitude towards physical education.  Later, young people have adopted certain attitudes and they have lost the initiative to participate in physical education or sporting activities.  The Minister should examine that thoroughly because it is easy to mould the minds and attitudes of young children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The National Youth Council are doing excellent work in co-ordinating activities.  Great credit is due to them. They could play a significant role in moulding public opinion.  We are very vulnerable to advertisements.  Clothing is advertised to appeal to the herd instinct of young people rather than to the individual mind.  We are living in a consumer society.  Young people have good earning potential and they are the people who spend.  In many ways advertisers use young people unscrupulously. People who are concerned about our youth should launch a campaign against this nauseating exploitation of young people.</P>
    <P>We should have local authority youth officers in the country such as we have in the Dublin area. They could play their part as youth leaders and they could train our young people.  If this type of thing is too centralised it becomes too impersonalised. When people are involved in an area, they become part of that area. With regard to training officers, they train the people in their area, which has the effect of providing the type of leadership needed.  One of today's problems is that we have not got sufficient youth leaders within our voluntary organisations.  One way of achieving this would be through local authority development and it is to be hoped that such bodies might be involved in whatever plan the Parliamentary Secretary has in mind.</P>
    <P>Opposition speakers spoke about the breakdown of youth services and there was some hysteria shown in that respect.  I do not believe there has been any breakdown.  Indeed, the figures prove that greater numbers are entering youth organisations, which is something we should encourage and in respect of which larger sums of money have been allocated by the Government since they assumed office.  There was grave neglect of any youth policy by the last Government, which is one of the reasons it has taken a fair amount of time to produce the requisite document to coordinate the various aspects involved. Had we had an ongoing policy over the years, this would not have been <Col N="1140" /> the case.  Rather we had stop, go efforts to which very little thought was given.  Any policy that will withstand the test of time requires indepth study and consideration.  When one considers all the Departments involved, it is, indeed, necessary that that policy withstand the test of time. I think the Minister indicated it would be a policy which would be carried through to the end of the century. The Minister said so with confidence which I have no doubt was justified.</P>
    <P>There are grave problems being experienced in our society today, amongst which are those of vandalism, bad school attendance, violence and so on.  One of the reasons is the type of consumer society in which we live where not sufficient emphasis is placed on civic education.  Sufficient attention is not paid to the development of young people's minds.  There are good libraries in Dublin; there are also the Museum, Art galleries and so on but they are under-utilised.  People do not know their cities or their historical backgrounds.  Recently I was in a school not a mile from here.  I asked the pupils there where Leinster House was situated and, after some minutes&mdash;out of approximately 20 pupils&mdash;one boy told me.  That is the kind of knowledge that is lacking, all of which stems from lack of education. Of course, education begins in the home.  Then we move into school where there should be provided this type of civil education, development of the mind and of one's ability to question.  If we can get people to ask questions, then there will not be this herd instinct that tends to obtain at present, from which emerge pop groups and the mass hysteria developed by the media solely for profit and not for young people's enjoyment.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the problems that will have to be tackled in the parliamentary report when it is published, with suggestions being made as to how we can build a better society because the foundations of any society are its young people.  We must inspire them with a degree of idealism. If youth has not idealism, a nation will suffer and in the youth of today that type of idealism appears to be lacking.  There is a certain degree of <Col N="1141" /> nationalism around which is evil.  An idealist is one who looks into the future and who builds a nation.  We are a young country facing a tremendous challenge as a result of entering the industrial scene with the advent of oil, gas and mineral deposits.  We must ask ourselves are our young people equipped to meet that challenge. If not, hopefully we still have time to achieve that aim.  Again, education will play a vital role in gearing them to accept the challenge.</P>
    <P>But whatever the future brings, up to now the people who have participated in the development of youth are deserving of the highest praise for their dedication and concern.  I would urge the Government to give every help and encouragement to such people so that we may look forward to an Ireland that rears to manhood people who are concerned with, say, the elderly, the feeble, the needy; that we develop in our people that deep social conscience.  This can be done. The voluntary bodies consist of people who have a deep sense of social commitment otherwise such people would not be rendering service to them. That is why I am completely in favour of voluntary bodies because they instil in people the same sense of dedication, honour and service which are important.</P>
    <P>I look forward to this document. This motion was badly worded and, in that sense, unnecessary.  We are all concerned with youth.  I am satisfied that when this policy is announced the voluntary bodies will get its objectives working and will receive the requisite assistance from the various Departments.  If we can achieve that, we can, indeed, look forward to a bright future for our country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Minister's speech last night reminded me of one of the unwritten rules of youth leadership.  A youth leader should never appear to be patronising the young people he or she is looking after.  If the youth feel they are being patronised they recognise it immediately and resent it.  My reason for saying this is because I wish to draw a parallel between the Minister's speech and what I have just said.  I <Col N="1142" /> do not believe there is one youth leader in this country who will not feel that the Minister's speech was an attempt to patronise.  He obviously had not spent much time preparing it.  If it was prepared by his Parliamentary Secretary he owed more to it than he contributed.  When Members on this side of the House tried to get copies of his speech from his Private Secretary they were told they were not available.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of courtesy the Minister might have supplied copies.  However, we managed later to get copies and I would like now to deal with some points.  The Minister said that the youth policy was not promised by a particular time, that it was undertaken by the Department of Education and was not hived off to some commission or other who could have used it as a blame-taker.  By saying that he did not seem to be aware of the fact that at every youth seminar over the past two-and-a-half years, at which his Parliamentary Secretary spoke, he told these people that a youth policy would be produced shortly.  It was to come out before Christmas, 1973, then the summer, 1974, then Christmas, 1974, and we are still waiting for it.  While the Minister's statement did not promise it by a particular time, youth organisations were led to believe that it was imminent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This document is apparently ready because parts of it were leaked to a newspaper early in February.  Of whom is the Minister afraid?  Why does he not produce this document and let the youth organisations see what is in it?  He stated on a number of occasions that this would be a discussion document.  How long will the youth organisations have to wait before they can discuss it?  It is very important to realise that youth organisations need a framework within which to work.  Before they organise themselves into the regional structures <Col N="1143" /> they would like, they need to know approximately what is in the Department's mind and they are not being told.</P>
    <P>I am also worried about the half hearted treatment of this section of the Department.  It is not even listed in the State Directory as the Youth Recreation Section.  Apparently it does not even warrant listing.  A Parliamentary Secretary was appointed.  He has now also been appointed to the Department of Industry and Commerce. We now have what I would describe as half a Parliamentary Secretary. In that section there are four administrative assistants and one part-time assistant.  Most of these workers are part-timers.  They are not allowed devote their full time to this most important work.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that it was important not to tie up resources in permanent but potentially redundant expenditures.  He listed as examples buildings and permanent full-time youth worker posts.  That must come as a very severe shock to the youth organisations.  I hope he will reexamine this because one of the basis of future growth of the youth service must be the recruitment of full-time youth officers on a regional basis.  Youth workers want a partnership with the State.  They do not wish to take over from the State nor do they, as Deputy O'Brien said, want to see a bureaucracy dictating to them.  They want a partnership where State, local authorities and youth organisations can work together.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the importance of buildings and the money tied up in them.  On the north side of Dublin city alone there are over 1,000 young people on the waiting list for scouting organisations, because there are no premises available.  Approximately 30 per cent of our young people actually belong to youth clubs.  It is very important that more of our young people, particularly the unattached, belong to these clubs.</P>
    <P>While on that subject, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance about <Col N="1144" /> the Bourn Vincent Park.  The Office of Public Works say that groups of scouts cannot be trusted to use the national parks, in spite of the requirements of the Bourn Vincent bequest. I would be very happy if the Parliamentary Secretary would do this, as would the scouting organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that on the point made by the Deputy&mdash;I think he was referring to Deputy Wyse&mdash; and by others&mdash;who had not even spoken&mdash;that progress is being held up because of a lack of policy, that people who so contend should be asked to identify the precise proposals which are being held up.  I would now like to identify some of these proposals. One is the in-service training scheme for full-time youth workers. This will facilitate the training of volunteer youth workers so that they will become more effective.  Several bodies have applied to the Department for this service.  This has been held up and no answer has been received on it so far.  It was processed through the NYC in October, 1974, and submitted by Comhairle le Leas Óige, Macra na Tuaithe, The National Federation of Youth Clubs, Macra na Feirme, the Catholic Youth Council and the Young Women's Christian Association.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would need to know the costings.  An approximate figure of the cost of employing a full-time director would be, in the first year, £20,000, out of which he would get his salary and administer the work and arrange courses, seminars and so on for youth leaders.  Another proposal held up is the scholarships for professional trainees in the Northern Ireland Polytechnic course in youth and community work.  In 1973, the Minister gave permission for two people to go there.  The NYC proposed a joint monitoring of the relevant course with the Department of Education.  The scheme was stopped the following year without any explanation to anyone.</P>
    <P>Where are we to get trained full-time Irish youth leaders?  We do not have any courses here for them.  One of the essential parts of a youth policy is to establish a full-time youth training course.  In the meantime I suggest <Col N="1145" /> that the Minister would give attention to the possibility of getting a full-time director of training courses from Scotland, England or some other nearby country who would be familiar with the problems involved.</P>
    <P>There is another proposition before the Minister's office which has also been held up.  It is the pilot scheme for regional youth officers.  That was applied for in mid-1973 and nothing has been done.  It is proposed to have this done through the local authorities or their subsidiary bodies like the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>They are just a couple of items which have been suggested.  Another very important proposal which has been held up is a national award scheme on the lines of the Duke of Edinburgh Award.  It could be called the President's Award Scheme.  In 1972 the NYC proposed a scheme for young people on those lines.  Something like it operates in 40 different countries throughout the world.  We still have heard nothing on this.  It would not necessarily apply to young people in youth organisations <i>per se.</i> It is for schools, for young workers, for community development associations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney on many occasions mentioned that this is something which was progressing but which came to a standstill.  I earnestly ask the Minister to see what can be done to get some response on this.  The Minister knows that youth leaders are dedicated and completely committed to the work they are doing and they suffer tremendous frustration if nothing appears to be done about their complaints.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>In parallel on the international front, links have been strengthened with the French Government under the Franco-Irish cultural agreement and rapid development in exchange schemes for youth are taking place. Approaches are also being made to Germany and the United Kingdom with the same object in mind.</P>
    <P>First of all, when the Franco-Irish agreement was reached concerning <Col N="1146" /> youth in sport, it was for leaders only. A selection committee was to be set up composed of the Department of Education, the National Youth Council, the French Cultural Service and one other organisation here.  The committee have not even met yet although I understand the Parliamentary Secretary is in Paris with the Director of the Catholic Youth Council who does very fine work.</P>
    <P>As far as the German and British exchange schemes are concerned, they were proposed two years ago by the NYC and there has been no action. The German Embassy as late as last month had heard nothing about it. As far as the exchange agreement with Britain is concerned, up to last Monday there was no initiative on it. I should like the Minister to examine the briefing he has had.  The speech he made last week was full of optimism but we find that all he said was happening has not been happening in many instances.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that in a short time, two years, we had done a massive amount of work yet in the past two and a half years there had not been any constructive contribution put forward by the Opposition.  That is not true.  I am on record in the House personally as putting forward suggestions for a youth policy.  I can give the Minister three suggestions I put to the House:</P>
    <P>1.  The appointment at local level by statutory organisations of full-time youth officers.  These would work in close association with the voluntary organisations in that area. The possible frameworks in which the local youth officer might work are the regional Health Boards or the Vocational Education Committees. This would depend on how local government is to be restructured, and whether one might envisage a central government department of the family, or a unit within the Department of Health with this function.</P>
    <P>2.  The provision of additional resources to some of the voluntary organisations so that they can attract more young people by developing <Col N="1147" /> their programmes and expanding their organisations.  To do this they will need full-time development and training officers, so that they can make the maximum use of the commitment of the voluntary leaders.</P>
    <P>3.  The establishment of a course for full-time youth workers at an existing institution of third level education.  There is no such course at present and there are no recognised training facilities for full-time or voluntary youth workers.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, there is no question that the development of a youth service will cost money.  It does not have to cost all that much. It is more important that they can have a framework from which they can organise themselves, that they can start a partnership between the State and local authorities early on without huge investment of capital.  If the development of a youth service will cost money, our failure to provide a youth service will also be likely to cost money.  I am on record as having said that young people are energetic and if we cannot find ways of harnessing their energy into at least neutral fields, and if possible into positive fields, it will inevitably be turned into an element that will be destructive to our society.  The evidence for this is increased vandalism and violence which we are only too well aware of.  The problem is particularly severe in Dublin where there is a greater concentration of population&mdash;the stresses, completely new to Ireland, of living in a completely urbanised environment.  I also said that the energy which smashes a telephone kiosk must be diverted into an activity which is of value both to the individual and, in the long term, to society as a whole.  Another point that I made was that if we were to increase the State's commitment to voluntary youth organisations by 500 per cent, the total figure involved would still be less than £1 million. The resources required in the context of total government expenditure are minimal.  The benefit of enabling our young people to mature fully, to develop their faculties, to relate themselves <Col N="1148" /> to the society in which they live, hardly needs to be spelled out. Therefore, when the Minister states that we have made no constructive suggestions from this side of the House, I ask him to accept that this is not so.  I know that the youth organisations know that this is not so, because they get a copy of every single Dáil debate in which any discussion affecting youth policy is debated.  They follow it and are very interested in it.</P>
    <P>I am glad our spokesman, Deputy Wyse, put down this motion because it is the first time, other than through Question Time and questions on the Adjournment, that we have been able to debate youth specifically, and it speaks well for Deputy Wyse for having put down this motion.</P>
    <P>A national youth policy should be a partnership, as I said, between the State and voluntary organisations.  It should be providing a service to enable young people to develop their full potential.  A supportive framework is what is being asked for.  A national youth policy requires State support to enable training to be given to the voluntary leaders, support of voluntary organisations at national and local level through the VEC; rent of premises and equipment would be some of the requirements.  Leaders need video and other equipment.  Such equipment could be funded and it would not cost that much money on a regional basis through the VEC or whatever body to which the youth are to be affiliated.  Outdoor sports equipment, training materials could be shared among the various youth organisations. Youth organisations are willing to share, because, as the Minister knows, idealism, although not the monopoly of young people, is very high in most young people.  Idealism is probably strongest in our teenage years.  As you find it hard to fight for what you want, you become disheartened, but when you are between 17 and 21 you become very active but quickly disappointed if you do not get anything through.</P>
    <P>There should be links with adult education training and sport.  Again, the State must be involved because financial assistance is needed for renting <Col N="1149" /> premises and dealing with the problems of urban areas.  Take an area like Tallaght where there is a huge population and nothing really there for the young people.  We need more community centres.  Let me say again that to me youth and community are one and the same thing.  It is shortsighted and wrong to talk about youth and the community as two separate entities, because it is only a short space of time until the youth of today are the adults of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Every youth policy must cater for the unattached young people, those who are not in youth clubs.  I remember talking to a man who is a famous entertainer, Frankie Vaughan, and who was awarded the OBE for his work for youth.  I met him when he was over here and he said: &ldquo;I am not interested in people who are in youth clubs.  They are being looked after. The people who are not in youth clubs need attention.&rdquo; There are so many people who cannot get into youth clubs because there is no accommodation for them.  There is a little youth club in my own area which has roughly 300 members.  They have to meet on various nights, sharing out the week.  The space available to them is very small but they make the best of it.  I should like to quote the Minister for Labour who made a profound comment for him.  I know the Minister agrees with me.  It was such a surprise to me, too.  Maybe his surprise is for a different reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>He mentioned we were developing a lounge bar society.  This is true because the only place of amenity and recreation in Ireland today is the pub.  I remember that when in a debate I suggested that some civic-minded publicans might allocate a section of their pub where only soft drinks would be served, one Member of the House, who was a publican and who shall be nameless, just laughed. The only place for recreation where <Col N="1150" /> people can meet in comfortable surroundings in towns and villages is the pub.  We must combat that.  It is all very well talking about curbing advertising of drink and so on, but there is nowhere else for them to go in many areas.  This is why we need greater recognition of the importance of youth work.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the Government allocating something very substantial to this.  We have been told about the increases already given to youth work, but we have not been told about the amenity grants being cut back.  On the question of finance, £156,000 is the amount that was allocated for this aspect of youth work.  The Minister in his speech stated:</P>
      <P>I cannot help feeling, however, that some of the claims being made for financial and professional aid of one kind or another do not take adequate cognisance of the measure of our financial resources, and that the examples which are quoted of expenditure of other countries do not show evidence that there is a sufficient understanding of the significance of the figures quoted or of the relative magnitude in the context of the population of the countries concerned.</P>
      <P>For the Minister's interest, Scotland allocates £5 million a year.  The North of Ireland allocates £3 million a year. I do not think that is comparing like with unlike.</P>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would find out what happened to the £22,000 which was voted last year and which still has not been allocated? Has that disappeared?  The Comptroller and Auditor General sometime ago made some disquieting remarks about where some of the money in the Minister's Department was being used. Is it being used for the purpose for which it was voted?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>It may well be, but maybe the Minister could say where it is being used.  There was also £56,000 left over from the 1970 vote. What is intended to be done with this <Col N="1151" /> money?  I have spoken for almost my 30 minutes, and I should like to end by referring to the Minister's concluding remarks in which he stated:</P>
      <P>When this policy on which so much work has been done has been produced it will be a monument to the interest of the Parliamentary Secretary in youth affairs and will guide the destiny of youth policy in this country for the remainder of the century.  I would like to commend him in the House for the work which he has done under my direction and to say that the publication of this document eventually will be its own monument to him.</P>
      <P>It is very important that it should be a monument.  I do not care who does it as long as it is done, but do not let it become his tombstone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is pleased to have the opportunity of discussing the problems of youth and of a youth policy, and for that reason we must be glad that the motion has been put down.  However, it is unfortunate that the wording of the motion is so negative.  I do not think that Deputy Wyse or any member of his party would be entitled to deplore the failure of the Government to produce a comprehensive youth policy when their own party was in office for 16 years and did very little to promote such a policy.  I do not want to make this a political contribution and I doubt if anybody else wants to make a political issue out of this debate but I believe that a more generous motion would have been fitting on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education set up an advisory panel on youth in August, 1973, and they set out to formulate a national youth policy.  Such a policy could not be formulated over-night nor without consultation with the many organisations, voluntary and otherwise involved in youth activities.  Personally, I would prefer a sound policy which would indicate short and long term objectives of youth policy, to be formulated and published without undue haste&mdash;better have a good policy produced <Col N="1152" /> slowly than a bad policy produced quickly.  I understand the policy is near completion and, like every other member, I shall welcome its publication.</P>
    <P>In a recent publication by the National Youth Council of Ireland Mr. Webb made a long statement in which he said, as reported in the February/ March 1975, <i>Youth Forum:</i></P>
    <P>. . . the youth organisations were grateful for this increased financial support which was far in excess of that provided by previous Governments.</P>
    <P>He is discussing the moneys being provided by the present Government. The voluntary youth organisations are receiving £156,150 this year as opposed to £57,050 for the year 1972-73.  This year the estimates provide for £390,000 for use in sports organisations.  That itself was an 86 per cent increase. Other moneys are being allocated in substantially increased amounts to Macra na Tuaithe.  I understand in regard to the problem of youth workers with Comhairle le Leas Óige in Dublin that there are some moves to make their positions permanent which it is hoped will be successful.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the need for a youth policy and look forward to its publication.  Such a policy must not try to supplant existing voluntary activities and activities at various levels throughout the country but must be one which, I hope, will offer generous financial and expert aid to voluntary organisations. I should not like to see the State in a take-over bid for youth policy.  I would prefer a generous policy of giving grants to various voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Council of Europe and I would like to put the question of youth policy in European perspective.  I refer to a report to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on group participation by young people, document number 3590.  In time I hope the Irish organisation will be able to make contact with the European Youth Foundation and the European Youth Centres which are actively and independently involved with the problems of youth <Col N="1153" /> activity and in the formulation of youth policies in Europe.  We should look to Europe for advice and see what experience they have had in this field.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting suggestion in the report that there should be a European charter for youth participation. Such a charter would be very interesting and would give youth a far greater feeling of involvement in society than it now has.  It is of the essence of the problem that we involve youth in society that they be seen to participate in it and that adult society does not seem remote or divorced from youth.  We must make society attractive for youth; they also have rights and responsibilities of which we must take cognisance.  The report discusses what should be in this chapter and says, in paragraph 26:</P>
    <P>Whatever the form and application of this &ldquo;charter&rdquo;, there are certain principles which I believe are fundamental and ought to be borne in mind when the text is drawn up; here are some of them: giving priority to participation on a joint basis; giving young people access to the mass media; giving aid on special terms to youth organisations with democratic structures; replacing the officially used terms &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; and &ldquo;for&rdquo; young people by &ldquo;with&rdquo; and &ldquo;by&rdquo; young people; taking care not to give young people a status which might arouse hostility in other &ldquo;strata&rdquo; of society.</P>
    <P>Those remarks are, at least, interesting. Other points in the report include the role that can and must be played by communication media.  This is something that has not been fully discussed in the House.  It involves giving young people time in the mass media, allowing them to use the media to ensure that a constant flow of information goes from young people up to adults.  This will allow young people to voice their feelings and opinions.  I become enthusiastic when I see young people arguing about civil rights, the rights of poor people, of under-privileged or under-educated people, taking up causes.  It is up to us here to ensure that they are allowed <Col N="1154" /> a voice when it comes to matters of national, regional and local importance. If this is to be their country in a few years and if they will be at the helm, they have a right to be heard.</P>
    <P>Another point made in the report concerned giving young people access to information media and giving public financial assistance to information centres for youth managed by young people themselves.  This is a possible approach to which we should give serious consideration.  Why should young people not have access to information centres?  Why not allow them to tackle their own problems? Obviously, they would have to seek advice from and work with older people but it would give them greater independence and a greater involvement in the society in which they live. Those two suggestions are worthwhile processing and I would hope that they might lead to a wider public debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>There are a few problems I should like to deal with.  With regard to the direction of the financial assistance, which obviously must be forthcoming, there might be a danger of unnecessarily institutionalising the flow of financial assistance from the Government down through a rigid system. That might be a mistake and I would see a great need for flexibility.  I should imagine that one of the main reasons for the delay, if there has been any delay&mdash;and I do not think there has&mdash;or for the slowness in producing a report would be the need to avoid a rigid structure of channeling finance and to ensure that a flexible system might emerge which would not give rise to any problems year in and year out.  It is a difficult problem because there are so many diverse organisations, voluntary organisations, clubs, movements such as the scout and the guide movements are all so involved and these organisations change and take on a different format from one year to the next, and whatever system is adopted must be flexible enough to take account of changing circumstances within any society.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the National <Col N="1155" /> Youth Council of Ireland being expanded on a very democratic and open basis, and to see regional committees and local committees of the National Youth Council which would give youth strength in numbers and ability to put forward their policies and feelings in relation to a number of matters, which to them, and I should think to society, are vitally important.</P>
    <P>I am not at all happy with the court treatment of young offenders and I think it is a system which urgently needs to be changed.  In relation to the young people, I do not think the present court system is one that will tackle the problem of the young offender.  We need a more sophisticated system.  The system in Scotland is far more flexible and the American system should be studied because, while I am not always in favour of things American, we can at least learn from their mistakes.  We need a different type of court system, a different type of dealing with young offenders, a system with more understanding in many cases of the social, educational and cultural problems that confront many underprivileged children. We need perhaps a different approach, a more humane and generous approach, and more expert staff to deal with these problems.  I do not think that a six months detention will necessarily be a deterrent to further offences.  I do not think it will at that age and the system needs to be tackled differently and immediately. I am aware of the good work being done by the liaison officers in the Garda Síochána and I am well aware of a number of people actively involved in trying to help young offenders but I do not think it is being done on an adequate basis.  There is a need for a more sophisticated and better equipped approach to the problem from the Government side.</P>
    <P>The whole question of youth policy must be seen in association with what is being done in the schools because the schools are the most organised places for children, who are there every day up to the age of 15 and in many cases the ages of 17 or 18. <Col N="1156" /> The school curriculum to me is very important and I am not happy that the present school system is sufficiently pliable and wide in scope to allow of a rounded education for our young people.  I feel that it is too academically oriented and there is a need to expand on the physical education and games aspect in schools, a need to expand the civics courses in schools to give young people a greater understanding of how society runs and functions and what structures there are in it.</P>
    <P>There should be a change from a system of academic education to one of allowing the system to be used to the best advantage by the people in the schools to give them a rounded personality and wide interests which will not die when that person leaves school, an interest in the living education. This is important and I do not think we have tackled it sufficiently in our education system.  We are too academic.  Academic education is good for certain young people who are academically minded but many people are not academically minded in the narrow sense.  They will be going into a trade or an office and they want, deserve and are entitled to an education which will allow them an on-going education process after school is finished, an on-going interest in things around them.  Our schools curriculum should change direction in this respect.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see the National Youth Council at local level co-ordinating recreational sports activities for young people.  There is a great need to inform young people of the many activities available to them, and I often feel that young people go into public houses because they are not fully informed of the many other activities they could easily take up.  Again this stems from lack of information flowing from the schools.  There is a need for coordination and the dissemination of information to young people.  One can only be encouraged by the activities of young people in involving themselves in the problems facing old people.  There are many people in the community who are helping aged <Col N="1157" /> people and this again must be encouraged. There are some great voluntary organisations in every village, town and city in Ireland who do not receive praise, who are practically ignored, but the House and the country owe so much to these people who take care of old and handicapped people and of the young offender. These are people who spend their time in seeing that the community in which they live is helped in every way possible.  We indeed owe a great debt of gratitude to them.</P>
    <P>There is also a great need for the financing of voluntary organisations to enable them to provide career guidance services, both inside and outside schools, a following service of career guidance.  Many people want to change their careers and they should have information.</P>
    <P>We have pre-marriage courses and, therefore, we should provide a service for dealing with the legal problems many young people have.  In many cases they are reluctant to go to a solicitor because they do not want to spend the money or do not have the money.  This would be an excellent field for a voluntary organisation to become involved in.</P>
    <P>These advice bureaux could be run by voluntary organisations and staffed by young people, under the direction of adults.  These voluntary services should be helped directly by the State. While I appreciate the necessity for institutionalising State aid, I should like to emphasise that such channels that do come about must be flexible.  The best way of ensuring flexibility is to give sufficient power to local bodies to work locally rather than giving a blanket grant to national bodies.  Every case must be treated on its merits.</P>
    <P>The amenity grant scheme operated by local authorities was mentioned and it is unfortunate that this scheme is not operating now.  I look forward to its re-activation.  The Waterford City Council voted moneys for three community centres, one in each ward, which is the most equitable way of using scarce resources.  These centres, working under the aegis of parish councils, should be flexible so as to be in <Col N="1158" /> a position to take in as many youth organisations and bodies as possible. We cannot afford to give money to the boy scouts, the girl guides and to the community centres and for this reason there must be a rationalisation of the use of such halls to ensure that the local people can benefit from them.</P>
    <P>There are so many youth organisations that it will be difficult to deal with them all equitably.  The best approach would be to ensure that there will be local committees to deal with the voluntary organisations.  I believe this will emerge from the policy document.  While this new policy will be a national one it must be centred at local level.  The channels must take into account the local problems, local structure and local organisation.  Otherwise we will have a lot of petty jealousies and in-fighting between the various organisations as to which of them should get a grant.  This will be a difficult job but I hope the organisations will be centred locally and will be such as to allow a lot of flexibility.</P>

      <P>It is only fair to give reaction and that is what I have done. The purpose of this motion was to try to get the Government to realise the importance of announcing a comprehensive policy for youth and I expected the Minister would have availed of the opportunity to give the young people an assurance that the Government <Col N="1159" /> have such a policy.  We wanted the Government to dispel the anxiety existing in youth councils and youth organisations.</P>
      <P>If there is such a policy and if it is about to be finalised that policy should be submitted to the National Youth Council and other youth councils for their observations before a final decision is made.  As a matter of courtesy this should be done.  The people involved in youth organisations have given of their time and effort promoting and organising youth activities. They have a right to know the thinking of the Government and the Minister where the youth are concerned. The Minister should seek the views of these councils.  Then the young people would know the Government are serious about implementing a comprehensive youth policy.</P>

      <P>I agree with a lot Deputy Collins said about involvement in community activity.  However, we have heard during the course of this debate that we are depending mainly on voluntary organisations to do the work.  These organisations are the foundation but they need professional support.  We should not expect people to work from early morning to late at night on youth activity or any other service.  We must have specialised people engineering all the activities of a youth council.  If the Government are prevented from introducing a comprehensive youth policy now because of the state of the economy and it is the intention of the Minister to introduce it piecemeal he should let <Col N="1160" /> us know his priorities.  One of the priorities is the appointment of a full-time professional person who will be responsible for organising and training the voluntary youth leaders.  The National Youth Council and those who specialise in youth work will agree with me that this is a very important matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned a number of matters that showed the lack of communication that exists between the Department of Education and the various youth bodies.  I have always maintained that a comprehensive youth policy must be a shared responsibility by the Government and the youth groups.  There is no point in using those groups in an advisory capacity and asking for their views if they are not consulted when final decisions are made.  The Minister should look at the large file of correspondence from the National Youth Council to his Department which has not received replies.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out last night, we are not using political gimmicks.  I put down this motion to prevent any further disruption in the structure of the National Youth Council.  I know a number of projects had to be suspended pending the announcement by the Government of a youth policy.  In my contribution last night I tried to impress on the Minister the three areas of importance, namely, training facilities, finance and buildings.  The young people are prepared to play their part in the community but they must have some place where they can meet, where advice can be given to them, where there are indoor recreational facilities and where they can organise themselves.  Fianna Fáil have certain ideas as to how this could be financed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If this is hurting the Deputies opposite I am sorry but I am only telling the truth.  It is only right that local authorities should be asked to put a levy on the rates to help in the matter of finance.  It has been done in Cork and in Dublin. The money should be spent locally in promoting youth work.  I do not think ratepayers would refuse to make contributions because in a sense they would be investing in their children and in the future.</P>
      <P>We must be realistic.  There is no point in always pleading for voluntary contributions.  The people in the voluntary organisations are giving much time and effort but they need the professionals to organise, promote and train youth leaders.  If it does not start there the Government can fold up whatever ideas they may have of a comprehensive youth policy.  Last night the Minister placed much emphasis on that point and I agreed with what he said.  All of us are aware of the work of voluntary groups but they cannot survive without the support of social workers and trained youth leaders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are using youth organisations in an advisory capacity but I would go a step further.  They should have a representative who will be involved in the preparation of a youth policy. The officials in the Department cannot be considered to have all the experience so far as youth development is concerned.  There should be somebody who would be directly responsible for this.  I do not think even the Parliamentary Secretary is directly responsible for youth activities.  It is passed from one to another and there is no one specialising in this very important work.  One official deals with the matter today and another one will deal with it tomorrow. I am sorry for the Parliamentary Secretary who has to work under that kind of a strain.  The Minister would be well advised to consider this matter and to make sure that <Col N="1162" /> one person is responsible for this area, who will reply to the many communications sent by the various youth organisations.  It has been said that Fianna Fáil have done little or nothing about this matter but that is not true.  We have tabled a number of questions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I strongly recommend that he would submit that policy to those who are promoting youth work so that they might give their views and recommendations before a final decision is made.  Only then will the young people know the Government are serious about their welfare.  My main reason for putting down the motion was that someone would convey to the young people that the Government have a comprehensive youth policy.  If they have not such a policy they should state this frankly and then the National Youth Council will have to consider how best they can organise and promote the valuable work they are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned I pointed out the circumstances in which capital gains tax would arise and how persons would <Col N="1165" /> be allowed interest against a capital gain.  There are four main ways in which a person could make a capital gain.  First, there is the property dealer who purchases property and without doing anything to it, sells it. That will not be regarded as a capital gain.  He will be liable to tax under Schedule B and corporation profits tax.  Secondly, a person purchases a site, pays architects and takes the risk of building on the site and sells the building to an institution. If the economics of the situation forced him to sell he would be liable to capital gains tax and not to Schedule B tax.  If it were a trading company, it would be liable to Schedule B tax and corporation profits tax.  That does not arise except where he can prove it was a forced sale. That is where there would have to be some examination.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, there is the case where an extension is built to a business structure or works and interest charges in respect of that extension are allowed as a capital expenditure.  It might be an hotel or manufacturing business that was extended.  The interest charge would be allowed against the profits. If it were sold, interest charges would be allowed and it would be taxed as a capital gain.</P>
      <P>The fourth case may be the reason the Minister is catching the whole lot. It is the case where a person gets in quickly and buys up property which is not his home or place of business and sells it at a huge profit.  This transaction is liable to capital gains tax. If there is interest payable this would be allowed in the normal circumstances. At the moment the person would be able to get away with it. It is a once and once only profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to create loopholes or to get the Minister to agree to things that are unfair.  The fourth case that I have described is the one that any Minister for Finance would try to catch but in order to catch that case the other three legitimate cases are caught.  In fact, the Minister will catch four or five cases instead of the one that he wants to catch. In doing so he will stop development and will create the position that tax <Col N="1166" /> of 65 per cent will be payable.  This is very wrong.  I am not speaking for companies only.  There may be a private dealer who purchases property and sells it.  He is in the property business.  He has to pay income tax and corporation profits tax and sur-tax. I do not think it is right to penalise so many in order to catch one.  If the person who moves in, buys property, sells it off and looks for interest charges on it were isolated the matter of allowing interest would be feasible.  When I refer to property it can be flats or any type of building or construction.  The Minister has promised to look at it.  I would like to catch the Smart Alec who comes in and gets away with something but every other straightforward businessman, whether he be a property dealer or something else, who is engaging in this work in the course of his business, should not be victimised.  The man who is engaging in this business, if he is a trading company, pays 49 per cent or if he is a property dealer, pays income tax, sur-tax and corporation profits tax.  I would like the Minister to consider this very carefully.  He is closing one gate and he may get another method of locking that gate without locking the gate to every businessman, property dealer or construction man in the business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly easy and cheap thing to form a company.  I would, bearing in mind the kind of property deals Deputy Belton is talking about, consider that the outlay for the formation of a company is very small cheese compared with the advantage which a person could gain if a concession were given in respect of interest incurred by a company on capital borrowed for construction purposes. The reason for the distinction in Britain between the treatment given to companies and individuals is that in the case of companies the capitalisation of the interest is controlled by the fact that the company have charged the interest to capital account and therefore it cannot apply to income account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously the same control is not <Col N="1167" /> available and cannot be applied in the case of an individual who cannot be subjected to the same constraint in respect of interest paid.  This is a significant administrative difference between a company and an individual. This is the reason why if we make an adjustment to the Schedule here that it will have to be confined, as it is in Britain, to companies and not be available to individuals.  As I said in my opening remarks it is such an easy process to form a company that there would be no serious charge on anybody who is interested in availing of this concession to form a company but by so doing becoming subject to the disciplines which apply in respect of company accounts.  If the House is good enough at this stage to accept my readiness to make an adjustment here I will consider what is the best way of doing it and bring in an appropriate amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could this not be done by having it substantiated that it was interest which was put to capital use by a recognised bank or institution? Would this not suffice in the case of an individual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be difficult for the bank to assess the use to which the money was put.  Even an accountant, in furnishing accounts, has to rely on the accuracy of information received.  A banking institution and an insurance company would also have to have the same reliance. It would not be appropriate to push the onus on to them.  I am not too certain what the consequences of that might be either for them or for the Revenue Commissioners.  Having regard to the fact that a person wanted to avail of any concession which may be given there is a fairly easy way of achieving it.  It is not unreasonable to ask them to make that election.  I suspect the cost of forming the company would at least be no greater than any premium which would have to be paid to an insurance company offering a bond or a certificate in the same position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  A person engaged in any sizeable property <Col N="1168" /> deal will not get away with a shadow company.  There will have to be some risk of capital involved.  He might have to give his own personal guarantee.  He might not want to go into a company.  If he is to guarantee the thing he might as well guarantee it in his own name.  Those people will not accept a sham company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The same point made by Deputy Belton struck me.  It is a valid point but he has been correctly describing the case for allowing interest in terms of property development such as flats, houses, office blocks or anything else.  I would like to point out that this restriction on the allowance of interest applies to much more than property development. It applies to all transactions in which capital gains tax can arise.</P>
      <P>There are certainly transactions which could attract capital gains tax and in which interest could be a substantial factor where a limited liability company would be quite inappropriate. While I appreciate the Minister is prepared to look at and has by implication&mdash;although I do not want to commit him to this&mdash;agreed he would accept that in the case of a company allowance should be made in respect of interest.</P>
      <P>This does not meet all the case. There are a number of instances in which only an individual would be involved or in which, while there might be a company, as Deputy Belton has pointed out, the individual's role in the matter could be a crucial one in obtaining credit from the bank and so on.  Although the company might be the nominal party involved the interest could well fall on the individual and not be allowable against the company's liability.  This extends further than the situation of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put this matter a little further.  There can be individuals as well as companies involved and any transaction, which could attract capital gains tax, is affected by this.  Since the Schedule allows as expenses, which may be deducted, such things as I mentioned earlier as the payment of fees, commission or remuneration to professional advisers, the cost of sale and even the cost of advertising, is it <Col N="1169" /> not true that the cost of money should be allowed just the same as the cost of all the other items?  The cost of money is, of course, the interest.  The question of the interest, should in my view, on principle, leaving aside the practicalities of it, be allowed just the same as the cost of any of the other items.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that the reason for the Minister's hesitation in this is that he sees considerable possibilities of evasion.  He has not said this.  I cannot think of any other reason.  I should like to know if that is what the Minister's difficulty is and, if it is, is it not possible to control the interest which may be claimed by making the person claiming it establish to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was interest genuinely incurred as part of the cost of the acquisition of the particular asset.  What is the principal difficulty the Minister sees in doing this?</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why interest should not be treated as a cost, as Deputy Colley says, in the same way as professional fees.  The Minister is obviously prepared to look into the matter.  He strikes me as somebody who has a problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He is a bit reticent about sharing his problem with us.  Would I be forcing the pace if I suggested that the provisions of paragraph 4 are relevant: &ldquo;Exclusion of expenditure by reference to income tax.&rdquo; In paragraph 4 deductions are allowable.  In the case of a company there is a balance sheet and a profit and loss account.  The interest is charged on the profit and loss account and there are allowances.  On the other hand there are also capital allowances in regard to premises and so on.  Possibly the Minister has something to <Col N="1170" /> tidy up so far as companies are concerned. Why the distinction as against an individual?</P>
      <P>If the Minister has to deal with the matter in the case of companies, I cannot see why he cannot face the same principle in the case of individuals and why the simple fact cannot be faced in both cases, as a principle, that interest is a cost properly chargeable as such and traditionally allowable as such in trading.  When you come to capital transactions, is there any real reason why you should depart from that principle?  We suggest that there is a very simple way of preserving consistency by treating interest as cost.  That would mean the deletion of this subsection as the amendment suggests.  In view of the Minister's anxiety I am putting this in a neutral way rather than in an advocatory way.  I cannot see why he cannot do this.</P>
      <P>It seems to me in the net, that the complications of corporate body accounting are causing the Minister a dilemma and that he is seeking to find a solution within the framework or the terms of the conventions of corporate body accounting where he could drive right through cleanly by simply deciding that interest was a cost and applying it in a similar way to capital gains as it would be applied as a cost on the trading side of the enterprise.  I do not know if such considerations are relevant to the Minister's thinking.  I can certainly see that subparagraph (3) of paragraph 3 is intruding on the grounds, so to speak, of the provisions of paragraph 4.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having said how far I am thinking of going, that is, in giving a concession to companies but not individuals, the principal reason why we cannot go so far in relation to individuals is that the legal requirements for keeping accounts differ and are much tighter in respect of companies. Interest charged to capital account is clearly identifiable and cannot be confused with income charged to revenue.  I doubt that individuals would welcome having applied to them the more severe regime in relation to <Col N="1171" /> keeping accounts which applies to companies.  Maybe we could say that any individual wishing to avail of this concession would have to keep accounts in that form, but even that might create quite a number of complications administratively.  I can see merit in the arguments which has been advanced from both sides of the House.  I will endeavour to produce an amendment&mdash;I would like to go all the way if it were possible to do so&mdash;which will go some of the way to meet the main bulk of expenditures of this kind.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can see the Minister's point about tightening up the form of accounting in regard to companies, but I do not think he should victimise the independent businessman.  Businessmen have to produce the same type of trading accounts for income tax as any company.  When the Minister is making provision on Report Stage he should take into consideration the independent businessman who is not a company.  There are thousands of business people to whom this section will apply.  It would not be justice to give this concession to a company and to exclude the ordinary private businessman, or any private person.</P>

      <P>I remember sitting on the committee which dealt with the Companies Act in 1963 or thereabouts.  I remember facetiously remarking when we came to the title of the Bill that it should really be entitled an Act in aid of the Revenue Commissioners.  What I meant by that was that all the accounting procedures, although dressed up with the <Col N="1172" /> appearance of being there to protect shareholders, were really all in aid of supervision by the State and particularly in regard to revenue information. We should not approach this or any other Bill on that basis.  Let us try to do everything we can to facilitate the persons and agencies who have to assess and collect the revenues of the State.  Whether it will be administratively convenient or will facilitate administrative action should not be a primary consideration in imposing liability on the taxpayer. Putting Deputy Fitzpatrick's point in more abstract terms, I do not think it right for us in this House to say that, because the accounts of companies will be nice and tidy and easier to get at, companies will get a concession that an ordinary, individual trader or person would not receive. I bring that consideration to the notice of the Minister and I shall not press the matter beyond that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear the earlier part of the debate on this amendment but the latter part centred round the cost of money, by way of interest, which is raised for the purpose of buying property or an asset.  There is another form of interest which is not the cost of money raised for the purpose of buying an asset but is in the form of a penalty for non-completion of a sale or purchase at the stipulated time.  I do not know whether that was referred to in the earlier part of the debate.  On the assumption that it was not, I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that subsection (3), which totally excludes interest as an allowable deduction, would be quite unfair in relation to the type of interest about which I speak because it is very much a cost of the acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister will know, that type of interest is shown on the apportionment account on the close of the purchase.  From the point of view of the purchaser it is every bit as much an expense as are auctioneer's fees, solicitor's fees, stamp duty or anything else.  Certainly any amendment the Minister makes to this subsection should take that penal type of interest <Col N="1173" /> into account rather than the cost of borrowed money and certainly should be an allowable deduction.  The rates being fixed in contracts at present are very high, often as high as 18 per cent. No purchaser willingly involves himself in the payment of such a penal rate.  Mentioning the 18 per cent brings to mind in fact that that is the penal rate the Revenue Commissioners have adopted for now themselves.</P>
    <P>It strengthens the point I am making, that no purchaser willingly involves himself in that kind of situation, where he may have to pay a rate of interest as high as that on delay in closing the sale.  Therefore, with the very high rates current nowadays no purchaser willingly delays the closing any longer than he need, or beyond the closing date specified in the contract.  The delay may be due to problems of title or a variety of other matters but, if that interest does become payable, certainly it should be allowable as a deduction so far as capital gains are concerned because it is an expense of the purchase in the same way as are the various forms of fees, stamp duty, Land Registry fees, or anything else.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in making the amendment he proposes on Report Stage the Minister should bear in mind that that type of interest, as opposed to the other, which is the cost of money borrowed, should certainly be allowable in full as a deduction.  It is a capital form of interest in the sense that it is a once and for all capital payment on the closing of the purchase rather than an interest which will continue to run for as long as the money is borrowed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 45:</P>
      <P>In page 52, paragraph 11, to delete subparagraph (b) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  for any contingent liability of the person making the disposal in respect of any covenant for quiet enjoyment or other obligation assumed&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appear to have solved my own problem by reading it aloud.  Does the Minister intend to operate this subsection in such a way that life assurance funds would be liable to capital gains tax?  If it is so intended, that would appear to be contrary to paragraph 88 of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that subparagraph (1) provides that the gain accruing on any disposal of money or money's worth which is charged to income tax will be excluded from consideration for the purpose of assessing capital gains tax, and presumably losses, but the subparagraph goes on to say that despite that there will be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing gains or losses such income as is dealt with under section 214 of the 1967 Act. Broadly speaking, is that not what it provides?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They are picked out as a special case because of that, but that special provision in section 214 of the 1967 Act is because it is dealing specifically with relief.  The effect of this proviso in subparagraph (1) is that it is subject to capital gains tax on gains accruing on the disposal by a life assurance company of investment funds.  It is necessary from the point of view of policyholders that the insurance company should manage investment funds prudently and there would therefore be a number of instances in <Col N="1179" /> which disposals would take place.  If each of these disposals which produces a gain is to be subjected to capital gains tax, this could seriously affect the profits available on what are called &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; policies.  Probably the effect will be felt by Irish life assurance companies rather than foreign companies and it seems to be contrary to what was stated or indicated in paragraph 88 of the White Paper.  If the effect of this is to reduce the amount of profits available in the context of &ldquo;with profits&rdquo; policies in the case of Irish life assurance companies as distinct from foreign companies operating here, this would seem to be a very retrograde step and I wonder why the Minister would propose to do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are charged to Case I, I think the effect of the proviso would be that even though they were so charged they would still be taken into account in assessing the gain for the purpose of capital gains tax on the basis that under section 214 of the 1967 Act they would be refunded though charged to Class I. The first part of it excludes from consideration for capital gains tax purposes gains that were subjected to income tax, but the proviso seems to include these considerations, though subject to income tax, when the income tax was refunded.</P>

      <P>Where the insurance company is assessed under Case I on its profits, the gain will not be taxed to capital gains tax.

The Minister ought to examine this, first, to ensure that there is no disadvantage, at any rate, to the Irish companies and, secondly, to see whether or not this provision is in accordance with paragraph 88 of the White Paper.</P>

      <P>There is another matter on paragraph 2 that I want to raise.  In general, this paragraph provides that any expenditure which is allowed as an expense for the purpose of income tax will not be allowed for the purpose of capital gains tax.  I think that is the general proposition in it, but can the Minister state categorically the converse, that a profit or gain which is liable to income tax will not be chargeable for the purpose of capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state that categorically?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in the Bill which purports to say that, but I do not think it does say it.  At any rate, that is the Minister's intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention, and I believe we have achieved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some doubts on that subject.  I have to refer back a little to get this in context.  Paragraph 1 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Reference in this Schedule to sums taken into account as receipts or as expenditure in computing profits, gains or losses for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts shall include . . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sets those out.  Then paragraph 2 provides that any such sums taken into account will not be taken into account for the purposes of capital gains tax.  However, subparagraph (2) of paragraph 1, which defines the references in the Income Tax Acts includes, and is said to include, &ldquo;references to sums which would be so taken into account but for the fact that any profits or gains of a <Col N="1183" /> trade, profession or employment are, not chargeable to income tax or that losses are not allowable for those purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would seem that Revenue receipts from export relief companies, Shannon relief companies, exempted artists, or golden handshake payments generally, as they are called, would be excluded from capital gains tax.  I assume that is correct.  If that is so, could the Minister say whether termination payments, which are not liable to income tax because they are excluded by section 115 of the 1967 Income Tax Act, are outside the scope of capital gains tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that certain profits may be relieved does not mean that they are not brought into charge. They are brought into charge under the Income Tax Acts; then they are relieved like the export profits.  The technical process is to bring them into charge and then relieve them.  They would not be caught by capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the practical effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was so, but I am wondering whether, in addition, the practical effect is that the termination payments, which, by virtue of section 115 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, are not liable, are excluded from capital gains tax.  Section 114 makes them liable to tax, but section 115 sets out circumstances in which they are not liable.  What I want is confirmation that those which are not liable under section 115 will also be excluded from capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, payments on retirement or removal from office or employment, which are in general, like the export tax, brought into charge under Schedule E in relation to retirement by virtue of section 114 of the 1967 Act, will not be chargeable to capital gains tax.  Even where such amounts are exempted under section 115, they still come within the income tax net and thus they will be excluded <Col N="1184" /> from the charge of capital gains tax notwithstanding that they are paid for a surrender of contractual rights. The golden handshake of up to £3,000 on leaving employment is, therefore, exempt from both income tax and capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to get that clear.  On paragraph 3 (2) there is a point which Deputy Fitzpatrick raised on an earlier section on which I would like to get clarification.  I think it is true to say that the cost of insurance of an asset against risk is not allowed as an expense to be deducted from the gains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the principle there is correct, whether it is not, in fact, a normal expense undertaken by any prudent taxpayer in respect of an asset of real value and that the exclusion of this as a deduction will&mdash;admittedly to a small extent &mdash;to some extent contribute to inducing people not to effect such insurance, whereas it is only prudent that they should effect such insurance to preserve the asset.  If they fail to do so and the asset is destroyed, the Exchequer will lose also if it is destroyed without compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>It might be prudent to insure in case you are not lucky but it is not essential to the preservation of the asset that you have it insured.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This case is slightly different. The ordinary business insurance is chargeable against the profits of the business but suppose a person buys an antique or a picture and has no trading business.  He takes out insurance of £100,000 or £200,000 and pays the premiums out of private income.  Having <Col N="1185" /> held this antique or picture for ten years enhances the value of that object and this is how capital gains tax comes in.  The money spent on insurance has been paid out of the owner's private means and is not set off against income tax as in a normal business.  That is the difference between this type of insurance and the ordinary trade insurance which would automatically qualify for an allowance as a charge on the running of the business.  Here the insurance is paid from some other income.  During the time it is insured its value is enhanced and capital gains tax comes in.  There is a case for an allowance in that situation.</P>

      <P>Timber does not come into charge for capital gains tax because each individual tree, when felled, becomes a chattel and would normally fetch less than £2,000 on disposal.  It is essential, therefore, that when computing a gain accruing from the disposal of woodland, both the consideration received and the outlay attributable to trees on the land should not be taken into account.  For example, where the cost price of the woodland is £10,000, £7,000 might be attributable to growing timber and attributable to land £3,000.  The selling price of the woodland might be £12,000 of which £8,000 would be attributable to growing timber.  The balance of £4,000 would be brought into account and the chargeable gain would be £1,000.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to Part II of the First Schedule.  Some of the provisions are not entirely clear. What I am about to say may not represent a correct interpretation of the relevant part of the Schedule and, if so, no doubt the Minister will correct me.  In view of the fact that the stock market was at a low level in April, 1974, and that subsequently share and property values fell very substantially&mdash;although there has been some upturn since&mdash;it would seem that some serious problems may well arise for persons who wish to take assets out of private companies.  The assets may originally have cost more than their market value at 6th April, 1974, and, indeed, substantially more than their present market value.  It would seem that on a transfer of the assets to the shareholders, the cost, as indicated in the Schedule, to the shareholders would be the market value at the date of transfer, and if the assets were subsequently to appreciate and to be sold, a very substantial chargeable gain could arise, even though the proceeds of that sale were less than either the April, 1974, market value or the original cost of the asset.  Am I interpreting the provisions of Part II correctly when I say that situation could arise?</P>

      <P>I have been intrigued by the variety of hardship cases and anomalies that can be produced by people who are familiar with these problems in recent times, but there is scarcely any tax provision in respect of which you cannot produce some package of arrangements and circumstances which does not indicate some difficulty or anomaly.  I am not saying we should brush these aside but very few of these ever exist in isolation and people can find ways&mdash;the law permits ways &mdash;to reduce losses and indeed also to adjust gains so that the least possible tax liability arises.</P>

      <P>In relation to quoted securities the Minister takes the 6th April, 1974, and it appears he allows one to assess one's whole gain but this is qualified by subparagraph (3) of paragraph (16).  Apparently, the Minister will allow a gain in relation to 6th April, 1974, but he will not allow any greater gain or any greater loss though the loss or gain that will be allowed by relation to the earlier period will always be in favour of the revenue.

      <P>(2)  For the purposes of this Act it shall be assumed, wherever relevant, that any assets to which this paragraph applies were sold, and immediately re-acquired, at their market value on the 6th day of April, 1974, by the person who held them on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1192" /> The effect of that general provision is that the assets were acquired on 6th April, 1974, as the base date and if that stood alone unqualified gains or losses would be calculated at any subsequent date by reference to that date.  Is that correct?</P>

      <P>That subparagraph is qualified by a conundrum provision which was prepared with official benediction.  It takes one some time to read and understand it.  The provision I am taking about is subparagraph (3) of paragraph (16) which reads:</P>
      <P>Subparagraph (2) shall not apply in relation to a disposal of assets&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  if on the assumption in that subparagraph a gain would accrue on that disposal to the person making the disposal and either a smaller gain or a loss would so accrue (computed in accordance with the provisions of Part I of this Schedule) if subparagraph (2) did not apply, or</P>
      <P>(b) if on the assumption in subparagraph (2) a loss would so accrue and either a smaller loss or a gain would accure if subparagraph (2) did not apply.</P>
      <P>Even if there was a smaller loss or gain computed from the actual date of acquisition if there was not a base point, he must be content with a smaller loss or gain than would accrue if he took the base point of 6th April, 1974.  Similarly, for subparagraph (b) of subparagraph (3) a loss would accrue.  Although there is an alternative it is always in favour of the Revenue.  There cannot be a greater gain in one case or a greater loss in the other.  The answer is always in favour of the Revenue and any advantage from these subsections is accruing to the Revenue and not to the individual.</P>

      <P>No.  I should like to give the Deputy an example which will show this not to be so.  Suppose a person buys shares in July, 1972, for £500 and sells them in 1978 for £850 and that those shares on 6th April, 1974, had a value of £400, the <Col N="1193" /> gain would be computed as follows: proceeds of disposal £850, less the value on 6th April, 1974, £400, leaving a gain of £450.  The alternative which is available to the taxpayer is: proceeds of disposal £850, cost £500 and overall gain £350.  Therefore, so far as the taxpayer is concerned there is a benefit because the lesser figure would be chosen.</P>

      <P>Paragraph (17) deals with the sales of land reflecting development value.  Would the Minister state his policy consideration in regard to the charging of capital on such land?  This is a matter of considerable public importance.  There has been much uninformed talk about the acquisition of land for development value.  Perhaps the Minister would spell out the effect of this paragraph?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It provides that land in the State which has development value is to be taken at market value as at 6th April, 1974 and any capital gain on a subsequent disposal is to be calculated from that base.  A time-apportionment formula is not considered appropriate to such land as its value might not be increasing at a uniform rate.  Its rate of appreciation would depend largely on its becoming suitable for development.  Its value could appreciate rapidly in a short space of time or it could remain relatively static for a long period.  Valuation at 6th April, 1974, would eliminate any possibility of retrospection in the tax charged.  However, where the land was acquired earlier at a price higher than the market value on 6th April, 1974, subparagraph (4) provides an alternative basis which takes into account that higher price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be readily seen that by taking the land at development value <Col N="1195" /> on 6th April, 1974, the section operates to the relief of the taxpayer.  I have no doubt my friends opposite will convey this to Deputy Lalor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fairly straightforward. If it has development value in April, 1974 then that is the value that will be taken as the acquisition value and obviously it will be very much higher if the land was of agricultural use value in 1974 and later sold as development land.  There would be a very rapid escalation and a very substantial gain, but by taking into account, as it were, the development value existing in 1974 it operates to reduce any gains which may subsequently be calculated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I have to make on paragraph 18 is that the total gain is assumed to grow at a uniform rate over the whole period of ownership.  How will this be calculated?  You know the period of ownership and you know the amount of time before 6th April, 1974.  In what way is the uniform gain computed?  On what basis do you arrive at a uniform rate?  Paragraph 18 provides:</P>
      <P>Subject to the following provisions of this Schedule, the gain shall be assumed to have grown at a uniform rate from nothing at the beginning of the period of ownership to its full amount at the time of the disposal and the portion attributable to the period beginning on the 6th day of April, 1974, shall be determined accordingly.</P>
      <P>Supposing we have a disposal in 1979 of an asset acquired in 1970 the total period of ownership would be nine years and there would be four years up to 1974.  What is the proportion? Is it four over nine or five over nine?</P>

      <P>In paragraph 19 you come to election.  My first reaction is, although I can see an equitable or other intention in it, to query whether an election is really <Col N="1197" /> any great advantage.  An election is irrevocable.  It gives an election to depart from the base date but election cannot be used to enhance a loss and it cannot turn a gain over the whole period into a loss.  That is fair enough. It may not be used to get at what one might call a real loss.  Supposing one bought property at £1,000 in 1972 and it appreciated to £1,500 in 1974 but depreciated again subsequently and was sold in 1976 for £1,200, the apportionment method of operating there would give a taxable gain of £100 and an election would, I think, give a taxable gain of £300.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that the provision making the right of election irrevocable goes too far and that the right should be revocable.  I say this for two reasons.  First, it seems to me that in practice if the market value at 6th April, 1974 is to be determined it would have to be negotiated with the Revenue Commissioners and it would be necessary to know this value before you could make a decision on election and that it is possible, at least, that the Revenue Commissioners might not agree to negotiate a figure as market value until you made an election.  So, you could be in a catch 22 situation.  Furthermore, it seems to me that the election which you might make in all ignorance could produce a greater taxable gain than the time apportionment method and might even convert an overall loss into a gain.  This would look like setting a trap for the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that the right way to approach this is to give a right to the taxpayer to choose the lower of the two calculations and not to force him into the position of making a final decision which may turn out to be a trap.  If this is, as the Minister says, in aid of the taxpayer, the right way to approach it is to give him the option between the two and that can be achieved by simply providing that the right of election shall be revocable rather than irrevocable.</P>

      <P>The Minister would accept that as a general principle&mdash; and indeed it has appeared in one or two places&mdash;where there are two ways of assessing liability for tax the Revenue Commissioners ought to apply the one which is more favourable to the taxpayer.

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it should be final.  Decision is not the same as election. Election is the process by which you proceed to decision.  Surely the taxpayer <Col N="1201" /> should have the opportunity of finding out, before he makes an irrevocable election, what his options are? Surely it would not be too much to let the thing proceed to the stage of finality of decision, the letter or whatever it is, and then by all means make it irrevocable?  Is it not possible to do that?</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley pointed out that if the Revenue Commissioners sit back and leave it for election, without giving any indication about the matter, it may be that the elector makes a mistake, which he would correct if he knew what the answer would be.  I am suggesting that there should be some loophole.  I am pretty certain in many cases if the wrong course was adopted the inspector would probably be the first person to point out to the taxpayer that he was not being quite fair to himself.  The way this paragraph is worded the inspector's discretion would be blocked from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo; and this is Deputy Colley's point.  I quite agree that once the thing is decided with the inspector it is final and should be irrevocable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners, by virtue of subparagraph (5) of paragraph 19, may extend the time within which a person must elect. That is sufficient to ensure that the two-year time limit will not be unreasonably enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not really a question of limit.  It is a question of doing an act which cannot be changed even by the inspector.  I believe a way could be found out of that dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to undertake, on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, that they would at least indicate their view on the market value as at 6th April, 1974 before the election takes place and if they find themselves unable to do it within the time limit would automatically extend the time for election? That, at least, would enable the taxpayer to know what he was electing about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy will appreciate that the Revenue <Col N="1202" /> Commissioners might not be in possession of all the facts before the appropriate date.  That is why I said there has to be a question of discharge of some onus on the part of the taxpayer. The Revenue Commissioners must be given such information as will enable them to make a proper assessment. These, in practice, are matters which best fall to be dealt with by the inspector of taxes and the relevant taxpayers.  If there is a genuine effort on the part of both parties to achieve agreement and to arrive at the correct figure and the two years is up quite clearly the Revenue Commissioners will allow an extension.  If there is a delay on the part of the Revenue Commissioners or they are unable to get to the root of the matter within the two years they will, of course, give the necessary extension time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister has given, in his own words, the key to the problem, which is assessment. It is the assessment, not the election, which is final.  Once the assessment is made, the method by which it is arrived at is irrevocable.  Let the assessment be final.  As the Minister has pointed out, it has to come in at a certain time.  If the assessment is final there is ample chance of finding out beforehand.  I presume it would be possible, before that, as Deputy Colley says, for the Revenue Commissioners to give some indication of what is accepted.  For instance, they would be able to get agreement on the market value on 6th April, 1974 and other relevant facts agreed before there was an actual election.  I believe the point is worth pursuing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind pursuing it but I would not be disposed to remove certain responsibilities in these matters from the taxpayers.  They have an obligation to pay the tax and to bring the information relating to the capital gains to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners.  I believe, if we extend the period or if we move the onus entirely over to the Revenue Commissioners, it is making life a little too easy for those who have certain obligations.</P>

    <Col N="1203" />
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the pendulum could go too far the other way.  Paragraphs 20, 21 and 22 essentially relate to the matters in Schedule 2.  We are in a debating dilemma here.  We have agreed to take the Schedules, Schedule by Schedule and paragraph by paragraph but there are provisions in these paragraphs which deal with shares that cannot be fully appreciated until we have gone through Schedule 2.  Paragraph 21 makes specific reference to Schedule 2. It is a bit difficult to follow the logic of this Part of the Bill.</P>
      <P>As usual, the greatest clarity is to be found in these provisions relating to companies, principally because company accounting is a pretty definite thing.  Paragraph 20 applies to securities and shares and makes the base date 6th April, 1974.  Subparagraph (4) states:</P>
      <P>Shares shall not be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as being of the same class unless if dealt with on a stock exchange in the State or elsewhere they would be so treated, but shall be treated in accordance with this paragraph notwithstanding that they are identified in a different way by a disposal or by the transfer or delivery giving effect to it.</P>
      <P>That subparagraph is then extended by subparagraph (5) to other assets. It seems to me that what is intended there is to identify the individual asset from the beginning.  Paragraph 21 (1) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, it shall be assumed that any shares or securities held by a person on the 6th day of April, 1974 (identified in accordance with paragraph 20), which, in accordance with paragraphs 2 to 5 of Schedule 2, are to be regarded as being or forming part of a new holding, were sold and immediately re-acquired by him on the 6th day of April, 1974, at their market value on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new metamorphosised shares are to be deemed to be disposed on 6th <Col N="1204" /> April, 1974.  Is that right?  Subparagraph (2) reads:</P>
    <P>. . . the amount of any gain on a disposal of the new holding or any part of it shall be computed&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  by apportioning in accordance with paragraph 18 the gain or loss over a period ending at the said time, and</P>
    <P>(b)  by bringing into account the entire gain or loss over the period from that time to the date of the disposal.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (3) reads:</P>
    <P>This paragraph shall not apply in relation to a reorganisation of a company's share capital if the new holding differs only from the original shares in being a different number, whether greater or less of shares of the same class as the original shares.</P>
    <P>As I see this, a share that has not changed its nature from 6th April, 1974, to the date of actual disposal, may be treated as any other asset and a gain may be calculated with relation to the base date.  Am I right in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am right in that, where the circumstances visualised in Schedule 2 materialise, where there has been what I call a metamorphosis of the shares after that date, then we have to use the time apportionment method only. Where there is no change in the nature of the shares you have your election.  Am I right?</P>

Is that a fair reading of this part of Schedule 2?  I am referring to the effect of subparagraph (2) of paragraph 21.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>5th April, 1970. There was a bonus issue of one new preference share for every one ordinary share held on 5th April, 1975.  The whole holding was sold on 5th October, 1984, for £15,000.  It was estimated that the market value of the enlarged holding on 5th April, 1975, was £12,500, after the issue of the new preference shares.  The holding is regarded as having been sold on 5th April, 1975, for £12,500 and reacquired by him on that date for the same amount.</P>
      <P>The following is the way the chargeable gain is computed: Deemed consideration for the disposal on 5th April, 1975, £12,500; Cost of acquisition on 5th April, 1970, £10,000; Overall gain at 5th April, 1975, £2,500; Chargeable gain to 5th April, 1975, of £2,500 multiplied by one-fifth, £500.  That is the year 1974-75. The consideration for disposal on 5th April, 1984, is £15,000.  The deemed reacquisition cost on 5th April, 1975, is £12,500.  The chargeable gain, therefore, from 5th April, 1975, to 5th April, 1984, is £2,500. Thus of the total gain of £5,000&mdash; £15,000 less the original acquisition cost of £10,000&mdash;the chargeable gain will be £3,000&mdash;£500 plus £2,500&mdash; which is deemed to arise on 5th April, 1984.  No tax is payable on 5th April, 1975, when the bonus issue was made as the calculation producing a gain of £500 is only of significance when there is a realisable gain when the shares are sold on 5th April, 1984.</P>

      <P>This paragraph shall not apply where a loss, and not a gain, accrues on the disposal.</P>
      <P>There may be a good reason for this in the circumstances envisaged in paragraph 22.  Nevertheless, is it not true that this is another breach of the principle on which the Minister was standing as we went through the Bill &mdash;that a transaction which could attract liability to capital gains tax could also attract the possibility of an allowable loss?

      <P>On paragraph (1) of Schedule 2 a point arises which I raised on Second Stage and in respect of which I do not think the Minister has brought forward any amendment. Therefore, I am raising it again.  It is raised in ease of the Revenue Commissioners. It appears that where a shareholder receives a capital distribution, no matter how small, in relation to the shareholding, a charge to capital gains tax arises, subject, of course, to the exemptions for individuals.  This would seem to be a situation which could well involve a great deal of time wasting on trivial items by the Revenue Commissioners.  I understand that in Britain, in cases of this kind, they treat distributions which are small in relation to the shares held as a reduction of the cost against future disposals.  If this were done here the Minister would save a great deal of unnecessary work on the part of the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>That is a fair definition.  That clears the ground for paragraph 2.  Paragraph 2 applies fairly widely to what is a reorganisation of a company.

      <P>Because it is very easy to go haring up the wrong road on this Bill.  Reorganisation enters into any case where there is a reorganisation of capital.  Subparagraph 2. (a) (ii) reads:</P>
      <P>any case where there are more than one class of shares and the rights attached to shares of any class are altered;</P>
      <P>Then, in subparagraph (b) &ldquo;original shares&rdquo; are defined.  Paragraph 2 (2) reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to the following subparagraphs, a reorganisation or reduction of a company's share capital shall not be treated as involving any disposal of the original shares or any acquisition of the new holding or any part of it but the original shares (taken as a single asset) and the new holding (taken as a single asset) shall be treated as the same asset acquired as the original shares were required.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 2 (2) provides that such reorganisation does not involve a disposal. Paragraph 2 (1) (a) (ii) reads:</P>
      <P>any case where there are more than one class of shares and the rights attached to shares of any class are altered;</P>
      <P>If this stood alone, the effect would be to exempt shares in a company, whether public or private, from capital gains under those circumstances.  Am I right in that approach?  At first glance this seems to be a complete give away on the Minister's part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disposal if a person, in a reorganisation, gets a new package of shares for the old package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This has to be taken in conjunction with paragraph 2 (4) of this Schedule and with paragraph 21 (2) of the previous Schedule. In general terms, what is the effect of this?  Clearly if one has a company, public or private, the company has <Col N="1211" /> two measures of its capital.  It has its shares&mdash;and, if they are quoted, they are at a quoted value on the stock exchange&mdash;and its shareholders' assets.</P>
      <P>A capital reorganisation is usually based on the latter, not the former. What is the Minister's intention in assessing gains where there is reorganisation, from the point of view of the shareholders because they will have made the gains?  A company does not make a capital gain on reorganisation. Am I right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The gains that accrue, or the disposal deemed to take place in order that gains may accrue, are in relation to the persons holding the shares in these companies.  These gains are measurable by market value, or notional market value, arrived at by, say, time apportionment but ultimately by the assessment of the stock exchange.  On the other hand they are not unrelated to the actual capital assets of the concern.  The entire matter needs a clear statement of the Minister's intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with reorganisation of companies where, for example, persons are allotted shares in a company in proportion to their existing shareholdings or when rights attaching to different classes of shares are altered.  In the absence of any provision to the contrary, the reorganisation or reduction would represent disposal of the old shares and acquisition of the new shares with a consequent liability to capital gains tax.  The central principle in the rule is that the mere exchange of one block of shares for another on a capital reorganisation by the company is not to be treated for capital gains tax as a disposal of the old shares and the acquisition of the new shares.  Instead, the new holding is to be treated as if it had been acquired at the same time and cost as the original holding was acquired and a gain or loss on the old shares will not be regarded as accruing until the new holding is disposed of in whole or in part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1212" /> Paragraph 2 (2) also provides for the case where as part of the reorganisation scheme some consideration, other than the new shares, is given or received by the shareholder. When consideration is given, it is to be added to the cost of the shares. Where consideration is received the shareholder is to be charged with capital gains tax by reference to the amount of the consideration as if it were a disposal of part of the shares. Rules are given for apportionment of the cost of the original shares in computing a capital gain or loss on the disposal of any part of the new shares.  There is also a special rule that where rights issues are not taken up but are disposed of, the cash received is treated as if it were a capital distribution received from the company and chargeable accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  Two points arise on that.  It seems clear that in the case of a reorganisation without any distribution, that is, a simple internal reorganisation where the rights from one class of share to another is transferred, or bonus shares are issued, we are applying the notional procedure to bring things to the base date and afterwards time apportionment and you calculate your claims on that in accordance with paragraph 21 of the foregoing Schedule.  In the case of a rights issue, the Minister quite rightly considers that there has been a purchase of these rights enhancing the value of the holding accordingly.  Am I right?</P>
      <P>Suppose there is a distribution at that point.  Why does one have to go to the trouble of regarding that as capital if the rights are sold for cash? To the seller, they are income, and to the purchaser they are capital gains.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lalor has been informed that any broadening of the scope of the subject matter which he is raising on the Adjournment, for example, to bring in unemployment or the lack of employment for school leavers, would not be in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank you for enabling me to raise this matter.  I gathered from your office that I could not use the occasion to talk about the fact that there is a difficulty about the 52,000 school leavers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to do so to the greatest extent possible, but it is extremely difficult because I have here before me <i>The Irish Independent</i> which conveys information of announcements by various organisations, State, semi-State and otherwise, that recruitment is being curtailed or being done away with altogether. Built into this announcement is the knowledge that the civil service have spoken of a strict control on expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I sought to raise this matter on the Adjournment because the civil service is the only direct State employment agency here and with the desperately serious crisis that looms ahead for potential workers, clerical and otherwise, one would have hoped that the Minister for the Public Service would in some way arrange that recruitment to the civil <Col N="1214" /> service this year, above any other time, would be expanded to the greatest possible extent.  For some time we have been debating financial measures in the Dáil from which the Government hope to collect huge sums of additional money and during the debates it has become very obvious that the Revenue Commissioners' staff will need to be increased enormously to cope with the additional work.</P>
    <P>Instead, we have had the civil service, over which the Minister for the Public Service presides and for which he provides the money, stating that not alone will they not be able to provide employment to absorb the 52,000 school leavers, not to talk of the 103,000 others unemployed, but that they intend to tighten up.  I endeavoured to check today with the Department and the information I got is that due to the rapid rise in public service pay in the last few years, strict control will now be maintained.  A special effort to improve efficiency in the service is being maintained, which is the same as saying that this is not the continuous position in the civil service. Anyway, they say they are looking for the efficiency that makes for the greatest use of existing staff.</P>
    <P>I, as a parent, am especially worried about this lack of recruitment to the public service, like the parents of the 52,000 school leavers this year. One of my children is doing his leaving certificate this year, I am reasonably happy in the knowledge that he is quite young, and he has taken the decision that he will do his leaving certificate again next year to try to improve his chances of finding a suitable job at the end of that time, mindful of the prospect that by this time next year the inevitable will have happened, that there will be a change of Government as so many people have been hoping and longing for.</P>
    <P>Of course, I do not accept a change of Government would mean a miraculous re-creation of job prospects immediately, in the background of the situation we have today when the economy is so low.  There is not a Government spokesman from the <Col N="1215" /> Taoiseach down who would have the nerve to create the impression that the position will not be far worse before it gets better.  Even if there was a major expansion in civil service and semi-State recruitment, I am afraid it would absorb only a very small percentage of the 52,000 school leavers. I listened to a programme on RTE today in which there was a discussion. The writer of a career guidance document who had recommended jobs in the civil service said that only about 10 per cent of school leavers this year will find employment.</P>
    <P>A spokesman from AnCO promised to do the best he could in providing places for training but first preference would have to be given to unemployed married men out of the total of 2,000 places, which is minimal in relation to present requirements.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the fact that the Minister for the Public Service could not take this debate tonight.  I am human enough to realise that he has been here since 10.30 this morning and has had a 12-hour session.  However, I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to offer even the sop of assuring us, on behalf of the Minister and the Government, that there will not be a cut-back in civil service recruitment this year.  While that is only a drop in the ocean by comparison with requirements, the situation demands some response from the official employer, the State.  We realise that among the 52,000 boys and girls are a great number who will not have been trained for the civil service but for manual or what we traditionally call blue collar jobs who cannot be accommodated.  But let the Government endeavour to give the good example.</P>
    <P>Since I was elected as a Deputy in 1961, and having served mainly on the Government side of the House, I can say I have had a number of embarrassing moments and quite a number of difficulties to deal with as Parliamentary Secretary and subsequently as a Minister.  Therefore, I feel for the Government and particularly for the back benchers who have to carry the can and meet the mothers <Col N="1216" /> and fathers of boys and girls doing their leaving certificate either in secondary or vocational schools this year and having to admit that there is no employment for them.</P>
    <P>The spokesman for AnCO finished up the interview on radio today by advising young people to take any job they get, not to be choosey.  The brother who wrote the career guidance booklet suggested the Minister for Labour should set up an advisory council.  This is probably one of the things the Minister will do, through the Minister for Labour, because an advisory council could create about ten jobs for the &ldquo;boys&rdquo;.  We have had enough of that, and the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; I am talking about are not the boys of 17 or 18 years of age who badly need some type of job at present.  Everybody knows who the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; are from that point of view.</P>

      <P>We want the creation of genuine employment for these 52,000 young people, and it behoves the Government to ensure that there will be no falling off of job creation within the civil service.</P>
      <P>If I had time, I could go through the taxation legislation that has been passed by this Government over the past two years, creating in its own way a huge number of administrative problems and positions within the civil service. It is deplorable that these young people should be told that there will be such streamlining within the civil service that there will be no jobs available for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has become recognised in the last ten years that the civil service has not been getting the cream of what is leaving our secondary schools because of the competition from Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the banks, the corporations. Here is a glorious chance, with the lack of recruitment in industrial and other organisations, for the Government to re-inject high-class talent into the civil service.  I am not saying this is a welcome thing&mdash;it is anything but that&mdash; but it does provide the civil service with the opportunity of revamping <Col N="1217" /> itself.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary and the various Ministers know&mdash;and if they do not, I am surprised the secretaries or assistant secretaries have not been informing them&mdash;that the best talent was being taken off by developing and progressive industry that was generated under Fianna Fáil. I am surprised that any Deputy on the other side of the House would smirk at the statement that we developed industry.  Up to two years ago when this Government took over industry was developing and expanding.</P>

I served in four different Departments and found nothing but dedicated service in all of them, but I am also aware that over the last ten years the really talented young people have not been going into the civil service because they were able to get better money in developing industry.</P>
      <P>Although the office of the Minister for the Public Service had to make some statement arising out of the inquiries that were made of that office, I question the advisability of issuing a statement at this critical time saying, as reported in <i>The Irish Independent</i> today, that there would be strict control over expansion, that a special effort was being made to improve efficiency, and that it was proposed to introduce re-deployment to meet the needs of additional staff requirements. That means: &ldquo;We are not taking on extra staff this year.&rdquo; It is more and more of the cut-down.  It means that the Minister for the Public Service is as broke as everybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to Deputy Lalor attentively. I want to apologise for the absence of the Minister&mdash;I am grateful <Col N="1218" /> that Deputy Lalor realised that the Minister is a very tired man after 12 hours non-stop here today.  I should like the Deputy to analyse his final statement when he said that he received dedicated service during his years in office from the civil service. Does he now imply that the civil service is not doing its proper job or that in any section of it there is room for greater efficiency to be achieved by increasing the number of the staff surplus to the needs of the nation?  I think he does.  If he got dedicated service, further recruitment and further expenditure and further cost to the taxpayers would not make the service any more efficient than it is now or than it was in Deputy Lalor's time.</P>
      <P>The total number of civil servants, excluding those designated as industrial staff, is now in the region of 47,000 representing an increase of approximately 30 per cent over a five-year period.  By general standards this is an extremely rapid rate of increase. It has also made a huge impact on the public service pay bill which is now over £400 million and is moving towards 40 per cent of voted current expenditure.  The provision for the pay of civil servants alone for this year exceeds £150 million.  These statistics do not lie.  We must consider the people who are paying for this service and there is a clear obligation on us to have a critical look at the rapid expansion of the civil service and ensure that there is strict control of this expansion while at the same time guaranteeing adequate staff to provide a full range of services. That is an irrefutable fact which Deputy Lalor has not contradicted but has rather confirmed&mdash;he received dedicated service.  I believe the civil service is doing the same job now.  If we expand further we are expanding for the sake of absorbing extra staff at a cost of more millions.  Does he think that would be right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the Government have taken the proper view.  The Government have only restricted the creation of new jobs within the service.  All the vacancies that will accrue will be filled.  Approximately 3,200 new jobs were created in the civil service in <Col N="1219" /> 1974.  This was a record figure.  Not all these jobs are yet filled and the filling of them in addition to the new jobs created this year and filling normal vacancies arising from retirements will provide significant opportunities for school-leavers.  The Deputy need not smile&mdash;this is a fact.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lalor proposes that recruitment be expanded to absorb school-leavers.  That would be irrational.  What would you do with them when already the civil service is working efficiently to meet the needs of the country?  The criterion for the number recruited must be the need of the service to carry out its work efficiently.  I ask any Deputy who visits Departments is the civil service not doing this?  I think it is.  We can find no fault with it.  Deputy Lalor is suggesting that we should recruit civil servants that we do not really need.  We will recruit, but only to meet our needs.  If the Deputy is logical he will realise that I am right.  The morning paper carrying the lurid headline, &ldquo;Jobs&rdquo; put him into a tizzy.  I did not realise that a motion could be taken in this way. Apparently the Deputy, on seeing that headline said: &ldquo;This is an opportunity for me to raise in the Dáil the recruitment of civil servants and the matter of 52,000 school-leavers&rdquo;.  I believe the Deputy has adopted a confused idea, a misapprehension of the situation.  While expansion of the <Col N="1220" /> civil service is being curtailed to a certain extent there will be ample opportunities for school-leavers.</P>
      <P>Almost every year there are about 50,000 school-leavers.  How are they absorbed?  Deputy Lalor mentioned only the civil service; he did not mention the public service.</P>

The numbers employed in the following categories of the public service in 1975 were: gardaí 8,000; Army, 14,000; teachers, 31,000; health boards, 30,000.  If the motion were correctly framed it would have included those categories.  There is no curb on the expansion of the Garda in the current year.  On the contrary, the number of gardaí is expected to increase by 300 to 400 and Army numbers may rise by 1,200.</P>
