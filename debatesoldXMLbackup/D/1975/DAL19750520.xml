    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will outline the provisions he is making for the placing of girls in post-primary schools in the western area of Cork city for the term commencing September, 1976; and if he is satisfied that the primary school leavers from Scoil Spriod Naomh girls national school, Curraheen Road and St. Catherine's girls national school, Model Farm Road will be adequately catered for in convenient post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the future provision of second-level educational facilities for both girls and boys in this area is at present under active consideration in my Department in the light of the proposed housing developments in the district generally and of the accommodation position in the existing schools.  The Department are also negotiating with Cork Corporation for the provision of a site in the area for an additional second-level school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that this out-worn term &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo; is hardly adequate for the needs of this area and other areas on the perimeter of Cork city.  Has the Minister any specific proposals to absorb the primary school leavers in the area referred to in this question in September, 1976, and, more urgently, the male secondary school leavers in the adjacent parish of The Lough and in the parishes of Blackrock and Ballinlough in Cork city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that assessment is not necessary at this stage?  What is needed is the provision of facilities for secondary education.  May I <Col N="5" /> suggest to the Minister that the provision of the facilities might be proceeded with while the active consideration exercise is also under way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are doing both. In fact we have asked the corporation to reserve a site for a second-level school and the timing of that provision will be examined and is being examined at present.  The question of second-level places for Cork city is raised every year and in each case, in respect of each year, we have provided places in spite of the suggestion that we are not doing it.  Places are provided every year in the second-level schools in Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, would the Minister, therefore, give an assurance or give reasonable hope that adequate secondary school places will be provided in Cork in the school year commencing next September and the school year commencing September, 1976?</P>

Teachers who served in these colleges and are now employed in other schools are paid basic salary and allowances in accordance with the common basic salary scale payable to all teachers, but receive in addition an amount equal to the Gaeltacht grant payable to secondary schools teachers, teachers serving in schools in the Gaeltacht in which all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish together with a special allowance of £150 per annum by way of compensation for the difference between the inclusive scale of salary formerly paid to preparatory college teachers and the salary scale of secondary school teachers.</P>

These areas include, in particular, the environs of Limerick city and the north central area of the county.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The archaeological excavations at Wood Quay accord with a plan agreed between Dublin Corporation and the National Museum.  This plan takes into account the archaeological importance of the site and is being put into effect on a phased basis which allows development of the site by the corporation to commence.  I understand that the excavations are being carried out by the officers of the museum to a high archaeological standard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that competent archaeologists were disturbed and took to the media to advertise the fact that they were not satisfied with the arrangements made between Dublin Corporation and the National Museum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a degree of controversy along those lines.  The controversy relates to a strip of ground along Wood Quay near the road.  I gather from the museum staff that this area is landfill; that the inhabitants of Dublin city built more and more out into the river in this area.  By virtue of this fact it is not of the same archaeological interest as the land which was always dry land because it was a dump.  The material there is in unstratified form.  Because of this conclusions as to the age of particular items and their relevance to particular periods or to one another cannot be drawn as easily in relation to this particular area nearest the road as they can be drawn in relation to the area further back.</P>
      <P>The museum have carried out substantial excavation in relation to a fairly large part of the area which is landfill and, therefore, are well aware of what they are likely to find there. They have mapped out and photographed the different revetments, the items of wood used to hold back the water.  In the area which has been excavated in bulk, the area immediately nearest the road, they have retained certain smaller typical portions for investigation.  That investigation is taking place at present.  I saw officials carrying out excavations yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the excavations are being carried out to a high archaeological standard.  I should say that there are individual items likely to be lost in this area which is being excavated <i>en bloc.</i> I am not saying that there are not things of value which may be lost but I am saying that, relatively speaking, this area is not of as great a value at all as the areas further up.  In order to allow the retaining wall to be built by the corporation, this area had to be excavated in this rather rapid fashion.  The fact that the retaining wall is now being built by the corporation and the trench has been put there for that purpose has meant that there is much less flooding of the remainder of the site further back, which is important.  If that retaining wall was not put there, excavation on that more important part of the site would not be able to take place to the same extent at all.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that in Dublin the development of Comhairle le Leas Óige has been halted due to the lack of a national youth policy, that in the past year a large number of full-time workers have resigned due to the lack of an adequate career structure and that if there were a proper youth structure the Comhairle could be very helpful in dealing with drug problems among the young; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that the development of Comhairle Le Leas Óige has been halted due to lack of national policy.  Grants to An Chomhairle have, in fact, been increased.  For the nine months ending 31st December, 1974, it received State aid at an equivalent of £150,000 per annum as against £130,000 for 1973-74.  Grants for 1975 will show a further increase on this figure.</P>
      <P>Since my reply to Deputy Lemass on 18th July, 1974, Question No. 85, my Department has authorised the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to offer permanent pensionable posts in the service of the VEC, as officers for out-of-school activities, to seven youth officers who had been employed in a temporary capacity by Comhairle Le Leas Óige.  An Chomhairle have expressed themselves as satisfied with this arrangement.  Conditions of service for the permanent pensionable posts which have been submitted by the VEC are at present under consideration by the Department.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that even if the central <Col N="35" /> committee have come to some sort of arrangement with him at local level, and, indeed, in my constituency, there is a lot of disquiet over the lack of a national youth policy which I understand was promised some time ago? Could the Parliamentary Secretary give any indication as to when there might even be a White Paper issued on this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is aware that <Col N="36" /> places made available to youth workers in the Twenty-six Counties for the youth community course at the Northern Ireland Polytechnic were lost due to the decision of his Department not to sanction any further scholarships until the national youth policy was decided upon; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>The annual grants paid by my Department to youth organisations normally include a provision towards the expenses of the organisations' training programmes for their voluntary leaders, and I understand that, in 1974, of the £119,100 allocated approximately £22,500 was spent by the voluntary youth organisations, including Macra na Tuaithe, in the provision of training courses.  As announced by me on 3rd May, 1975, this year's allocation of grants of £218,350 to those organisations represents an increase of about 83 per cent on last year's grants, and I hope that this will enable the youth organisations to invest a larger share of their resources in the provision of courses for their adult volunteer youth leaders.  Indeed, I may say that it is my belief that adult voluntary leaders must be the catalyst in youth work and that their training needs should get top priority.  In addition to these general provisions, the uniformed organisations, scouts, girl guides, etc, have through the National Youth Council made a special case for a joint training scheme for leader trainers.  This scheme will retain the valuable voluntary character of the organisations but give them professionally developed skills.  A sum of £2,000 will be made available this year, subject to arrangements to be worked out later, towards the operation of this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards grants for the training of youth leaders at courses in the Northern Ireland Polytechnic, Jordanstown, the position is that two students were awarded grants to <Col N="37" /> attend a two-year course at that centre on an experimental basis.  The course being attended by these students will be completed in June next and a decision on the question of awarding further such grants will not be taken until an assessment is made after that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they the only two students who went for training to the polytechnic in Northern Ireland? Were there more than for the previous year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there were any in the previous year.  I think there is one attending this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>43.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he has yet sanctioned the appointment of full-time youth workers in Limerick, Kilkenny and Waterford; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not sanctioned the appointment of full-time youth workers by the vocational education committees in these areas.  The general question of the need for full-time youth workers is being examined. It is considered that the priority in youth service development is more resources and skills to support and expand the number and work of adult volunteer youth workers and not just to appoint full-time youth workers as an end in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, substantial financial aid amounting to £156,150 is being provided for youth services under existing grant schemes to 20 different youth organisations from which the areas mentioned by the Deputy in common with other areas throughout the country can benefit. A special payment of £16,000 has been sanctioned, in addition to its normal grant of £24,000, for the National Federation of Youth Clubs this year for the purposes of assisting the regional and local youth councils to develop club activities, provide equipment, etc.  Grants are paid by Limerick City and Limerick County Vocational Education Committees to the Limerick Diocesan Youth Council, towards the cost of providing youth leaders.  My Department has sanctioned, on an experimental basis, <Col N="38" /> the creation of a post under County Kilkenny Vocational Education Committee for a teacher who would have responsibility for the development and co-ordination of adult education activities in the committee's area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £177,022,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig na <Col N="44" /> Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that despite the economic difficulties which affect the country in the current year, it will be possible to increase public, non-capital expenditure on our health services from £169 million, in the national twelve month period for 1974, to an estimated £198 million for 1975.</P>
    <P>This increase in estimated expenditure will not only enable services to be maintained at the high level provided for in last year's Estimates, but will, in addition, allow some further developments and improvements to take place during this year.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to predict with accuracy the real rate of increase in expenditure at this time of the year, but I believe it should be possible to achieve a real growth rate of around 1½ per cent in our health services in 1975.  This growth rate will be achieved, of course, after allowance is made for the effects of inflation on health expenditure.</P>
    <P>I feel it desirable to make this point at the beginning of my statement today, since I have heard it said that there are dangers of cut-backs in health service provision in the current year.  There will be no cut-backs, either in services or in expenditure in real terms in relation to last year. Indeed, the opposite will be the case. New and additional facilities will be provided, although not obviously to the extent they would if our economic climate were more favourable.  We will, therefore, be able to continue the progress made, since the Government took office in the spring of 1973, in extending health service provision as rapidly as our national economic circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>Our achievement to date in this respect has been considerable.  In 1972-73, the total amount of non-capital health expenditure was £107.4 million.  This year, as I said, it is estimated at £198.0 million.  This represents an increase of 84 per cent <Col N="45" /> in money terms and around 17 per cent in real terms.  In addition, capital expenditure has risen from £6.63 million in 1972-3 to an estimated £10 million in the current year.</P>
    <P>Public health expenditure will, therefore, increase by an average of almost 6 per cent per year in real terms, in the three years 1973-4 to 1975.  This represents a considerable achievement and, it is in this context, that this year's real growth rate must be seen.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is expected that health expenditure will constitute an estimated 5.7 per cent of gross national product in 1975, as compared with 4.8 per cent in 1972-3.  No matter what financial yardstick is used, therefore, our health services are seen to be expanding in a real and sustained way.  If the international and national economic climates had been more favourable in the current year, our achievements, since taking office, would have been even more marked.  However, we must take the good years with the less good. That is the lesson of economic history.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that we will, nonetheless, maintain our progress to date and will end the year with a higher level of health service activity than we began it.  I feel it might be useful to Deputies if I explain at this point, the funding sources of the public expenditure figures I have quoted.  In doing so, I will be able to demonstrate the relationship between the monies I am seeking today and total public health expenditure for 1975.</P>
    <P>Total public expenditure, capital and non-capital, will amount to £208 million.  The Estimate before the House provides for £177.02 million of this amount.  The remainder will be funded as follows:</P>
    <P>£9.6 million from the rates; £8.5 million from health contributions; £2.0 million from receipts under EEC regulations; £0.4 million under the Supplementary Estimate, approved earlier, to provide aid for thalidomide children; £1.85 million to increase the rates of various allowances and provided for in the budget; for which there will need to be another Supplementary <Col N="46" /> Estimate later; £4.3 million non-voted capital, that is, from the Local Loan Fund and Irish Hospital Sweepstakes receipts; £1.5 million from sweepstakes receipts, for non-capital purposes; £2.83 million to be provided for in next year's Estimate to meet balances of grants due on the basis of final accounts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from the figures I have quoted that the Exchequer will meet about 90 per cent of the total expenditure involved.  This proportion compares with a figure of 63 per cent in 1972-3 and is explained primarily by the Government's continuing commitment to transferring health charges from the rates to the Exchequer.  In 1975, a further transfer of about £9 million to the Exchequer is provided for, so that only £9.6 million of total expenditure will be met from rates this year.  This continuing reduction of health charges on our rates is in line with the Government's pre-election commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer is now, therefore, almost the exclusive source of funds for our health services.  This situation has been brought about within a very short period of time, due mainly to the need to remove health charges from the rates on grounds of equity.  If we add to this the fact that health services, because of their labour-intensive nature among other factors, are particularly prone to rapid cost increases, we are faced, as a society, with the need to study in depth both the future financing of the services and the need to derive the best benefits from them.</P>
    <P>Because of the rapidly rising cost, the increasing demand, and the rapidly changing technologies associated with health care.  Governments all over the world are being forced to find vastly increased sums each year simply to maintain health services at their current levels.  We are not unique in this respect.  The richest countries in the world are faced with this problem and on a larger scale.  We must carefully look at the resources available for health care, so that we may continue development in the future.</P>
    <P>It will not be enough to look at financial questions.  As was pointed out <Col N="47" /> clearly at the seminar I organised in Waterford last week-end, we must also look at the services we are operating. We must analyse the value of each individually and determine priorities between them.  Each service must be continuously evaluated to ensure that the benefits derived from it in terms of health care are, at least, commensurate with the money being spent on it.  If not we must be prepared to shift new resources to high priority programmes. This is a problem of the correct allocation of human and financial resources to meet the needs of the future.  It is one which we must face up to also.</P>
    <P>I, of course, have determined some major priorities, since becoming Minister for Health.  These include, the development of our community services, the training of handicapped people for employment, the provision of free hospital care to all, the adoption of a general hospital plan, and the development of our psychiatric services and services for deprived children.  I will speak about these in some detail later.  My point here is that the task of defining and refining priorities must go on continuously and in depth.</P>
    <P>In this decade, more than any other, Governments everywhere are being forced by spiralling costs to look more closely at priorities within the health services and to seek out the most effective health care programmes for development.  We cannot escape this world-wide phenomenon either.</P>
    <P>To help this country play its part in coming to grips with this twin problem which besets all countries&mdash; the problem of financing and determining cost-effectiveness within the health services&mdash;I have instituted a number of important measures.</P>
    <P>Preliminary work is being carried out at present on a review of health service financing.  This will continue throughout this year, with a view to exploring in depth whether we can make some beneficial changes in our financing arrangements.  There is no obvious answer at this time but, as a responsible Government, we have an <Col N="48" /> obligation to explore the question thoroughly and this we intend to do.</P>
    <P>I think we will all accept, that our task in Ireland in future years will be to look much more closely at the effectiveness of programmes in terms of their contribution to health care. Because of high costs, if we are to achieve the best possible health service, we will have to utilise cost/ benefit, and similar techniques, much more effectively than we have in the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider the problem in more detail before making arrangements for the development of this kind of evaluative approach.</P>
    <P>I should say, however, that some steps have already been taken in this direction within my Department.  I was concerned, when I took office, that the data and management structures on which this kind of qualitative approach could be based were not adequate and have taken steps to put this right.  A special planning unit has been set up, a reasonably sophisticated system of data processing has been instituted and the concept of programme budgeting has been introduced. These recent innovations have taken place precisely with a view to initiating studies on priorities.  I intend to consider this problem in more depth, with the intention of speeding up the process of introducing more sophisticated planning techniques within our health services.</P>
    <P>Before concluding this section of my statement, I would like to emphasise that what I have said about the need to study the questions of financing and planning our health services, does not arise from any feeling of pessimism about the future. Rather it arises from the opposite feeling.  Our health services will continue to improve, as they have done in recent years, even if we continued with the relatively unsophisticated techniques of the past.  I believe, however, that we can devise better planning techniques, which will maximise growth in the future and which will enable us to make the best use of additional resources in order further to improve the health of our people. <Col N="49" /> It is for this reason only that I am initiating the studies and new techniques which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak about developments in our health services themselves since the last Estimate debate in November.  Since that was only six months ago, I do not intend to deal with each programme in detail, but rather to highlight the developments which have taken place in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on our general hospital services, including long-stay services, will amount to an estimated £110 million on current account in 1975.  This figure represents about 55 per cent of total current expenditure on the health services.  In addition, approximately £6.6 million will be spent on general hospitals on capital account, or about 66 per cent of total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>As I said during previous Estimates debates, I am concerned that such a high percentage of total expenditure is occurring in the general hospital programme.  This reflects, it seems to me, essentially two fundamental difficulties.</P>
    <P>The first is that precisely because over half our financial resources and about 43 per cent of total health care staff are engaged in the general hospital programme, the rate of increase of financial demands from this sector is higher than in other areas of health care.  This emphasis on hospital care both in terms of expenditure and manpower, is one which I inherited, but it does mean that the major demands for additional health expenditure in any one year still arise from this source.</P>
    <P>The second difficulty is the related one, that it is extremely difficult to shift the balance of additional expenditure in favour of community and preventive health care.  If we had a high level and efficient hospital system and if we already had good preventive services of a high level, then it becomes easier to concentrate resources on prevention. But when the demands to improve hospital care are still at a high level, and when community health care is not sufficiently geared up to <Col N="50" /> reduce the numbers seeking hospital beds, it is extremely difficult to initiate the shift in resources I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, difficult to arrive at the right balance between hospital care and community health care.  We in Ireland started somewhat late in the day.  Nonetheless I intend to press on in this direction as rapidly as is practicable, given that real demands exist on both sides.</P>
    <P>I would now like to indicate the major on-going developments which have taken place within our general hospital programme since November last.</P>
    <P>Progress in building the 600-bed Cork Regional Hospital is continuing. It is hoped that the main six-storey patients block can be &ldquo;topped-off&rdquo; during the autumn of this year.  In addition, the architects for the hospital are confident that, without unforeseen stoppages, the hospital will be completed on schedule in December, 1977.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has agreed that the planning of the Cork Dental Hospital should be resumed. It is hoped to enter into a contract to build the hospital in the autumn, on the same site as the general hospital. The cost will be met from the funds of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>At the Orthopaedic Hospital, Clontarf, adaptations have been carried out which will enable an extra 60 adult, post-operative patients to be transferred there from various Dublin city hospitals.  The effect of this will be to relieve the pressure on acute hospital beds in Dublin.</P>
    <P>In Dublin also, the adaptations to provide a cardiovascular unit at the Mater Hospital have been completed. Extra cardiac beds and a new intensive care unit are now being brought into use.</P>
    <P>At Jervis Street Hospital, work on the detoxification unit for drug abusers is virtually completed and is expected to be brought into operation in July.  Improvements to the accident and emergency department at Jervis Street Hospital are also well advanced.</P>
    <P>At St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, a new 26-bed geriatric unit and <Col N="51" /> a new 24-bed psychiatric unit are in the process of being erected.  A new intensive care unit has been completed in St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, as has a new pathology laboratory at the Castlebar County Hospital, and a new central x-ray department at St. James's Hospital.  In addition, a new nurse training school was recently opened at James Connolly Memorial Hospital.  Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>In addition to the projects I have mentioned a wide range of other major general hospital building works are in progress at present.  These include: A general scheme of improvements and a new 30-bed ward at St. Laurence's Hospital; Improved kitchen and dining facilities at the Meath Hospital; A scheme of reconstruction at Linden Convalescent Home; A new gynaecology unit at Erinville Hospital, Cork; A new operating theatre at the Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, Cork; A new Cheshire Home at Bohola, County Mayo; A new geriatric assessment unit and a maternity unit at Wexford County Hospital; The extension of the x-ray department at Portlaoise County Hospital; the provision of a public analysts laboratory and geriatric assessment units at St. Finbarr's Hospital, Cork; The provision of an intensive care unit, an x-ray department and a coronary clinic at Galway Regional Hospital; The provision of a new ophthalmic unit at Ardkeen Hospital, Waterford; The provision of a new 30-bed district hospital at Donegal.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the on-going improvements which are taking place in our general hospital provisions at this time.  In addition to these, a number of other development projects will commence in the current year. These include:</P>
    <P>New pathology laboratory at St. James's Hospital, Dublin; new paediatric and psychiatric units and a laboratory at Limerick Regional Hospital; a new delivery suite at Airmount Maternity Hospital; extensions to the x-ray unit and out-patients' department at Letterkenny General Hospital; the <Col N="52" /> provision of a theatre at Sligo General Hospital; the renovation of St. Kevin's Unit at St. Colman's Geriatric Hospital, Rathdrum; the reconstruction of theatre No. 3 at the Mater Hospital; the installation of a linear accelerator at St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin; additional accommodation for the mentally handicapped at Peamount Hospital, County Dublin, and Ballybaan, Galway and at Cloonamahon, County Sligo.</P>
    <P>I am also proceeding rapidly in the planning of the new St. James's Hospital in Dublin.  Discussions are taking place between officials of my Department and the authorities concerned with a view to reaching agreement on a plan for that hospital.</P>
    <P>As well as this, I have given the North-Western Health Board permission to plan a major development of Letterkenny Hospital and this planning is going ahead in conjunction with my Department.  I have made a similar decision in relation to the extension of Tralee County Hospital.  Officials of my Department and of the Southern Health Board are currently devising a detailed plan for implementing this project.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the details I have given, a great deal is being done to continue the development of our general hospital services.  More important than all of this, however, in terms of its long-term effects, has been the planning exercise which I have gone through to determine the locations of major, acute, general hospitals for the future.</P>
    <P>This exercise has taken me the best part of 18 months, but I am pleased that I will shortly be able to announce the Government's decisions on the matter.  As I informed the House previously, what I have been trying to do, during that time, has been to determine a national plan for general hospital development for the future.</P>
    <P>The need for such a plan has been widely recognised for more than a decade.  Up to now, however, a practical solution had not been found.  When I took office, it was generally agreed that the Fitzgerald Committee recommendations, which had been accepted by the previous Government, were unworkable <Col N="53" /> in our context.  While it could be argued that they provided a solution amenable to the needs of the health services professions, it was generally accepted that sufficient account was not taken of the need for a reasonable geographic distribution of acute general hospitals.</P>
    <P>I was aware of the urgency of adopting a suitable plan when I became Minister for Health.  Without one, it will be impossible rationally to allocate resources in the future.  Nonetheless, because of the general questioning of the Fitzgerald Committee's views, I felt it necessary to recommence the planning exercise from the beginning.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, this exercise has been going on for some time. I do not need to repeat the details of the exhaustive consultations which have taken place with all the health advisory and administrative bodies concerned. These are contained in my November Estimates speech and in other statements I have made.</P>
    <P>The hospital plan for Dublin, which I have already announced, has met with widespread support.  I believe that the plan for the rest of the country, when I announce it shortly, will prove equally acceptable.  It cannot please everyone, of course, but when it is seen as a whole, I believe it will be accepted as one which reasonably balances the conflicting demands for larger, more centralised hospital units and the need for a reasonable geographic distribution of locations.  In announcing their plan, the Government will have tackled and solved one of the most urgent health care problems facing this country.  We will have taken the first step towards the creation of a fully modern, acute hospital system and solved a problem whose solution has evaded previous administrations.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on our general hospital programme.  I would like to comment on a number of other matters.  As the House is aware, it is Government policy to provide free hospital care to the entire population, irrespective of income. The extension of free hospital care to all was to have become operative from <Col N="54" /> 1st April, 1974.  Unfortunately, the implementation of that decision had to be postponed, because it was not possible to reach agreement with the medical organisations on the method by which consultants would be paid in future for work done for public patients.</P>
    <P>In an effort to resolve this impasse, I set up a review body in July last, to make recommendations to me on the system or systems of payment which should apply to consultants in the context of a free hospital service.  The review body invited submissions from interested parties in September last.  I made my submission in November.  I am at present awaiting the review body's report.  When I receive it, I would hope to resume negotiations with the medical profession with a view to implementing the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>I would also like to inform the House that I will shortly be setting up a consultative body to carry out a general review of matters affecting junior hospital doctors, excluding matters which would be dealt with under the normal conciliation and arbitration scheme.  The setting up of this body is a follow through on commitments I made to junior hospital doctors during their last dispute.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to that area of our health services which is concerned with meeting the needs of the mentally ill and mentally handicapped in our society.  Here again, I do not wish to repeat much of what I said in November last.  I will concentrate instead on discussing only the main developments which are taking place.  Expenditure on these services in the year will amount to an estimated £35.8 million on current account and £2.9 million on capital account.  These figures represent 17.9 per cent and 29 per cent respectively of total expenditure on current and capital account.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned, since taking office, to carry out a major review of these areas of our health services.  I have said before that they were badly neglected in the past and that one of my priorities is to put this right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> As the House knows from my November statement, I decided to start this review process by focusing on a specific area of need&mdash;that is the need to provide adequate training and employment opportunities for our mentally ill and mentally handicapped. As Deputies are aware, I set up a working party of experts to advise me as a matter of urgency on ways in which we could rapidly meet this need.</P>
    <P>I accepted and published their report in January last.  I would now like to place on record my gratitude for the imaginative and effective way they went about their task.  I believe their report offers a plan for a major breakthrough in this area of training the handicapped and I give my firm commitment to implementing its recommendations as rapidly as circumstances allow.</P>
    <P>Already a number of its recommendations have been implemented. For example, AnCO have initiated training courses for instructors of the handicapped.  About 40 instructors have either taken this course or are in the process of taking it.  More will undertake it later in the year.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have agreed that State welfare allowances, due to handicapped trainees, may now be paid directly to training workshops, to enable these workshops to pay more realistic incomes to trainees while they are undergoing training programmes.</P>
    <P>I am engaged currently in discussions with the National Rehabilitation Board, with a view to seeing how I can help it to take on the major role recommended for it by the report.  As the House may be aware, it is envisaged that the board will play the central role in planning training and job-placement services in the future. I intend that it should take on the overall responsibility of providing an integrated plan for the future and of putting that plan into effect.</P>
    <P>All of this will constitute a major additional task for the National Rehabilitation Board.  I am pleased to say that they have indicated a willingness to take it on.  I have already <Col N="56" /> strengthened the board to help them implement their new responsibilities. The discussions I am having with them now are concerned with agreeing on their need for additional management staff and technical expertise.</P>
    <P>In short, I should hope that the National Rehabilitation Board will, by the autumn, have geared themselves up to carry out the major task which I have assigned to them.</P>
    <P>I have entered into discussions also with the Commission of the European Economic Community, at the highest levels, to explore with them the amount of financial assistance we might expect from that source in implementing the other major recommendations of the report.  These discussions have proved encouraging to date.  My objective is to implement the main recommendation of the report in a planned way over a short number of years.  To enable me to do this, I am at present breaking these recommendations down into &ldquo;phases for implementation&rdquo; and simultaneously seeking the necessary means of financing.  I hope to make a more detailed statement on this matter later in the year.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that we now have a coherent and workable plan for training our handicapped people in the future.  As I said earlier, I consider this to be the first step towards reviewing the services as a whole for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped in our society.  It is a logical first step, since if we cannot get as many as possible of this group into employment, we will not be able to achieve what must be the primary objective of this area of our health services, that is to help as many as possible of our mentally ill and mentally handicapped to live a normal life in our community.  If we cannot create job opportunities for them, then that objective cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of our psychiatric services and our services for the mentally handicapped need to be looked at also, of course.  These include such questions as determining the proper balance between institutional and community care; determining the relationship between statutory <Col N="57" /> and voluntary agencies which will offer the best hope of coherent planning in the future; what to do about some of our excessively institutionalised and old psychiatric hospitals; how to develop better preventive techniques and measures; how to provide more suitable accommodation for the mentally handicapped who are now in our psychiatric hospitals and who should be elsewhere.</P>
    <P>These and other questions have to be looked at and solved.  As I said before, this area of our health services has been neglected in the past.  It was neglected, I suppose, because these members of our community rarely speak out for themselves as other groups do.</P>
    <P>We in this House, however, must speak on their behalf.  We must bring the services which they need up to the level of effectiveness of our other health services.  This is my objective.</P>
    <P>The review which is being carried out at present into these and other questions will culminate in the publication of a major White Paper.  I should hope to publish this in the autumn.</P>
    <P>Already wide-ranging discussions have taken place in preparation for its publication.  Officials of my Department have met with officers of health boards and with a wide range of psychiatrists to consider the issues involved.  Further discussions will take place in the coming months.  I intend to use the experience and knowledge of as many as possible of those working in these services to help me formulate my policy.</P>
    <P>My approach is that of breaking the total service down into its component parts including child psychiatry, acute treatment, forensic psychiatry, rehabilitation, alcoholic addiction, drug addiction, prevention and education. The needs of each is being studied in detail.  Ultimately, priorities for development will be determined as between them.</P>
    <P>The publication of the White Paper will mark the second stage in the modernising of services for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped. Together with the report on training and employing the handicapped, it will <Col N="58" /> provide a blueprint for planning in the future.  The publication of these two documents will mean that this country will have a clearly defined policy in relation to this aspect of our health services.  This will be a considerable achievement during this Government's first term of office and one of which we can all be proud.</P>
    <P>These then are the steps I have taken to develop a coherent policy for the future.  They will bear considerable fruit in due course.  Needless to remark, however, a wide range of on-going developments are taking place and have taken place since November last. Again I shall not list all of these but I should mention some of them.</P>
    <P>Major capital building works which have been completed since November last include: a geriatric assessment unit and hostel accommodation at St. Brendan's Hospital; industrial therapy units at St. Patrick's Castlerea; St. Otteran's Hospital, Waterford, and at St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny; a day centre in Bray; a day care unit at Cheeverstown House; an assessment unit at St. Vincent's, Cabra; a child development clinic and training workshop at St. Michael's House, Ballymun; a day care unit at Lady Lane, Waterford; a major scheme of extensions and adaptations involving 274 places at St. Raphael's, Celbridge; a 100-bed unit for adolescents and adults in Kilcornan, County Galway.</P>
    <P>In addition to these, work of a capital nature at present in progress includes: an assessment and research unit at St. Patrick's, James's Street; a psychiatric unit at St. Finan's Killarney; a sheltered workshop at St. Brendan's Hospital; a psychiatric unit at Letterkenny County Hospital; adult units for 100 persons and an additional 60-bed unit at Cregg House, Sligo; a new village centre for 150 adults at Bawnmore, Limerick; an assembly hall and workshop at Carriglea, Dungarvan; an assembly hall, physiotherapy department and swimming pool at Moore Abbey; an assembly hall and gymnasium at Delvin; a village community for adults at Duffcarrig, Gorey; additional accommodation for 50 pupils at St. Anne's Corville; additional adult <Col N="59" /> units and training workshops at St. Patrick's, Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Together with these, a wide range of additional projects are also at tender stage.  I think I have mentioned enough, however, to indicate that a great deal of progress is being made in the current year.  Progress of this kind, when seen in conjunction with the steps I am taking to plan soundly for the future, is indicative of the Government's commitment to this area of our health services.  There is no room for complacency however. A great deal still remains to be done before we bring these services up to a level we can all accept as being reasonable.</P>
    <P>Before concluding my remarks on this aspect of our health services, I should like to say that I have been concerned for some time about the shortage of clinical psychologists available to work in our health services. The greatest need for these is, perhaps, in the areas of working with children and in rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>At present, there are very few qualified people available in the country.  In an attempt to put this situation right, officials of my Department have had discussions with health board officers and with members of that profession, regarding the possibility of introducing a postgraduate training scheme for clinical psychologists.  This is designed to ensure an adequate flow of members of this profession into the health services in the future.</P>
    <P>If the agreement of the universities and of the professional body concerned is forthcoming, it is hoped that the proposed training scheme can be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss now some of the main developments which are taking place within our community care programme.  As the House is aware, this programme of health services activity is designed to provide a wide range of primary medical and welfare services in the community. Its objectives include the prevention of ill-health, the provision of as much <Col N="60" /> health care and welfare as possible within a community setting and the reduction of demand for institutional care.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that our health care system placed too much emphasis on institutional care, in both the medical and psychiatric fields.  This reality still persists and will take a considerable time to alter and put right.  My objective is to bring about a shift in resources in favour of community services, in the belief that this will lead to a better health service overall.</P>
    <P>This is not proving easy, however. It is true that our community medical and welfare services have been improving rapidly in recent years, but I must admit that our institutional services are still taking the bulk of additional resources made available in any given year.  This is so for the reasons I mentioned when discussing our general hospital programme.  The primary reason is that, because so much of our financial and personnel resources are already engaged in providing institutional care, and because this is highly labour-intensive, the demand for additional resources from this sector far outstrips demand in other areas of our health services.</P>
    <P>In short, because the traditional pattern of health care in Ireland places great emphasis on institutional care, this sector very quickly eats up most of the additional resources available for development in any year, and particularly in a time of high inflation. Nevertheless, a shift of resources towards community services is taking place, even if it has not been possible to proceed in this direction as rapidly as I would like.</P>
    <P>I know that the central theme in the emerging health policy of the Opposition is that greater resources should be placed in community services and in preventive services generally. They do not need to convince me of the validity of this argument.  I have held this belief since before I took office as Minister for Health, and I still hold it.</P>
    <P>All my efforts have been directed towards this end, and with some success <Col N="61" /> I may add.  Nevertheless, I must point out that the task is not as easy as it may appear, for the reasons I have given.  A further difficulty arises from the fact that it is not as if our institutional services are perfect and can, therefore, stand still, while community services are brought up to an acceptable level.  As I pointed out earlier, nothwithstanding the needs of community services, our general hospital system needs to be rationalised and developed at enormous cost, and many of our psychiatric hospitals need to be improved or replaced.</P>
    <P>Unlike the Opposition, therefore, I cannot focus only on the needs of community services, valid though these are.  I have got to create a reasonable balance between developing these and modernising institutional settings.  This is what I am attempting to do, bearing in mind my objective of shifting the balance towards community care services as rapidly as proves practicable.</P>
    <P>In the current year, I expect that about £44 million will be spent on non-capital account on our community care services.  This figure represents about 22 per cent of total non-capital expenditure.  In addition, it is estimated that £0.5 million will be spent on capital account, representing approximately 5 per cent of total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, our community care programme is broken down into two broad divisions of services&mdash;these of a primary health care nature and those which can be described as community welfare services. I propose to deal with these in turn, although the division between them is somewhat artificial, for reasons I will refer to later.  As far as the primary health care programme is concerned, our on-going services are being developed.</P>
    <P>In the case of the general medical services scheme, 1,095,919 persons were covered by medical cards on the 31st March last.  This figure represents 35.2 per cent of the population. It compares with a figure of 864,106 people or 28.4 per cent of the population, covered on 31st December, <Col N="62" /> 1972.  Expenditure on this service has increased from £12 million in 1972/3 to an estimated £21 million in 1975, an increase of 75 per cent.  These figures indicate clearly my commitment to improving the income guidelines, under which people become entitled to entirely free medical care, on a continuing basis.  There are two very definite constraints on progress in this field, however.</P>
    <P>I estimate that raising the income guidelines for eligibility to medical cards, in real terms, costs about £1 million per £1 increase.  The guidelines are reviewed regularly now, of course, in line with inflation, but achieving a real increase in numbers covered would cost amounts of this nature.  I would add that these estimated cost figures do not take into account any increase in fees which might be sought by the medical and pharmaceutical professions, as a result of increasing the percentage of the population covered by medical cards.  This could be a significant additional cost factor, in so far as one medical organisation has already stated that it will seek a fundamental review of fees, if the percentage of the population covered goes beyond 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Secondly, before any major increase in the percentage of the population covered is brought about, I must have discussions with the professions concerned and reach agreement with them. This would be normal industrial relations practice, apart from anything else. I do not think the Opposition took sufficient account of these two major constraints, when they put forward the motion in this House recently to increase the percentage of the population covered by medical cards from 35 per cent to about 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The House can rest assured that I am acutely aware of the hardship caused by medical expenses on some families not now covered by medical cards.  These include, in particular, these families just outside the present income guidelines and those who suffer from a high incidence of ill-health.  As I said, I will continue to improve the guidelines and take other steps to eliminate hardship due to medical expenses. Our record in the past two <Col N="63" /> years has indicated my concern in this area and I will continue to bring about improvements as rapidly as resources allow.</P>
    <P>My efforts in this direction have not been confined to improving, in real terms, the guidelines for eligibility to medical cards.  From April 1st last, I extended the list of long-term illnesses for which drugs and medicines will be available free of charge.  The list now includes acute leukemia, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy, in addition to those included before that date.  The effect of this decision will be to reduce considerably the burden of medical expenses on those who suffer from these illnesses.  In all, I expect that an additional 5,000 people will benefit from this decision.</P>
    <P>In a further attempt to reduce the cost of medical expenses for those who most need help.  I decided to retain the base figure for recoupment of the cost of drugs and medicines to those in insured employment and in the middle-income group.  The figure remains at £4 per month per family. All expenses for drugs and medicines in excess of that figure, in respect of a calendar month, will still be recouped to the families concerned.  The figure of £4 per month was set in 1972 and some would hold that the figure should have been increased in line with inflation. In an attempt to further ease the burden of medical expenses, however, I decided not to make any change.</P>
    <P>In January last, I sought a supplementary estimate in the House to enable me to provide substantial financial and other assistance to the victims of the thalidomide drug.  I am pleased to say that the House approved that estimate.  It enabled me to provide those children with a monthly allowance for life, equal to the allowance they will get from the German fund. In addition, I was able to give each child a capital sum equal to four times the German fund capital awards.  The cost of implementing these decisions will amount to an estimated £414,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>I also announced, at that time, <Col N="64" /> that I intended that the National Rehabilitation Board would provide a continuing assessment service for these children and ensure that they were provided with a wide range of special services and facilities, recommended by the Irish Thalidomide Medical Board.  I am pleased to say that the National Rehabilitation Board has begun to perform this task.  The decisions which I took in relation to these children have been welcomed by their parents and by the House.  I am pleased that this issue of social and moral concern has been resolved to the satisfaction of all those concerned.</P>
    <P>These are some of the practical steps I have taken to improve our community health care services in the recent past.  They constitute part of a significant trend towards the improvement of our health services overall.  Many other facets of our primary health care programme are also being developed in the current year.  The public health nursing service is improving annually, as are the full range of existing, public medical examinations, vaccination programmes and screening tests.  I do not need to elaborate on these today.</P>
    <P>An area which is still causing me concern, however, is the provision of dental and ophthalmic services for those with full eligibility.  I have commented before that I am far from satisfied with the extent of availability of these services to those entitled to them.</P>
    <P>While I cannot, at this stage, indicate what can be done, I will have the matter reviewed with a view to bringing about improvements, where practicable.  I am conscious, however, that the cost of bringing about real improvements will be significant, and that has got to be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to our community welfare programmes.  As Deputies are aware from their experience in their local communities, the development of our social work, meals-on-wheels, and home help services is going ahead.  It is too early in the year yet to indicate the rate of growth we can expect in these services during 1975.  My objective is to <Col N="65" /> achieve whatever growth is possible in the current economic climate and to maintain it at a level which will allow for rapid development in a more favourable economic period.  I am confident this will be achieved.</P>
    <P>The delivery of community welfare services depends, and rightly so, on close collaboration between the statutory and voluntary agencies involved. This collaboration has improved significantly during recent years and will become much more marked in the future, if present trends continue.  The need for close co-operation is obvious.  While statutory agencies should and do retain overall responsibility for providing welfare services in our community, it has been recognised elsewhere that this responsibility can best be met by utilising extensively the human resources available, on a voluntary basis, in each community.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of the State doing the job on the cheap.  It is rather a recognition of the fact that voluntary agencies can supply services and a concern which statutory bodies cannot expect to match.  I am actively working to improve and develop this collaboration and sharing of resources between the statutory and voluntary sides of our social services system.  It makes good sense to do so and, I have no doubt, it will pay major dividends in the future.</P>
    <P>The National Social Service Council plays a major and increasing role at present in developing the voluntary side of our social services system.  It has performed very valuable work in this field since its establishment in 1971, particularly in encouraging the formation of social service councils and in the provision of information and advice to individual voluntary agencies.  In recognition of the work it has performed and in expectation of the increasingly vital role I expect it to perform in the future, I was pleased to accede to the views of the council concerning the structure of the council itself.</P>
    <P>They proposed that membership of the council be extended from 25 to 29 members and that the base of representation <Col N="66" /> be broadened by, in particular, including representatives of the voluntary councils themselves on a regional basis.  I found these proposals to be acceptable and the new council has now been constituted on the revised basis.</P>
    <P>Because of the high esteem in which I hold the National Social Service Council, I was pleased to give them responsibility for implementing the Government's decision to provide assistance to local community information centres.  The council is now acting as the central agency to encourage the setting up of information centres, to set standards for registration, and to provide information, training and financial support to local staffs.  Since the beginning of this year it has been selecting centres which will immediately qualify for Government support and has been preparing itself to carry out this new role extensively in the future.</P>
    <P>The council hopes to be able to announce, in June, the first 20 or so centres which will qualify for support. This will, I hope, constitute only the beginning of the creation of a national network of information centres in this country.  In providing Government financial support for these centres, we will be meeting a real and growing need to improve methods of conveying information to the citizen about his rights and entitlements under increasingly complex legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of thanking the National Social Service Council for taking on this major new task, on behalf of the Government. I have no doubt that, under its guidance, the development of this aspect of social policy is secured.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on two other matters before concluding my remarks on our community care programme. The first concerns the increases in health allowances which became applicable from April 1st last. As the House is aware, the Minister for Finance, in his budget statement of 15th January last, indicated that all rates of social insurance and assistance payments, together with associated health allowances, would be <Col N="67" /> increased by from 21 per cent to 25 per cent.  The health allowances concerned are the disabled persons maintenance allowance, the infectious diseases maintenance allowance and the blind welfare allowance.  The individual increases are shown in the statistical statement which has been given to Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the additional expenditure resulting from these increases, in the period April to December, 1975, will be in the order of £1,616,000.  In addition, it is envisaged that the allowances will be reviewed again in October next, with a view to keeping them in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The second point I wished to mention, in concluding this section of my remarks, concerns the point I made earlier, that it is not possible to divide our community care programme clearly into separate programmes, dealing with primary health care and with welfare.  The need for both clearly exists, but they should not be seen in isolation from each other. Each programme should complement the other, in providing for the health and welfare of families in our community.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that I am trying to arrange an administrative merger between the two.  I am trying to bring into operation what are called community care teams, comprising a wide-range of health and welfare personnel, working together in a planned and organised way for the betterment of local communities.  I hope that the directors of these teams will be appointed shortly and that the work of putting into operation the generic team approach, which I have mentioned, will follow rapidly.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish a discussion document on this general issue of concern shortly, and look forward to receiving a wide range of views on it.</P>
    <P>Before finishing, I would like to comment on two other matters which do not fit neatly into any of the three health programmes I have been discussing. The first concerns the need for health education.  In January last I <Col N="68" /> made an order concerning the Health Education Bureau.  The function of the bureau as set out in the order includes:</P>
    <P>Advising on aspects of Health Education which should have priority at national level, drawing up and implementing programmes with the co-operation of Statutory and Voluntary bodies engaged in Health Education, maintaining contact and giving financial assistance to these voluntary bodies and helping them in implementing their local programmes, promoting and conducting research, acting as a national centre of expertise and promoting greater concern for medical health education generally in the community.</P>
    <P>I consider the setting up of the bureau a very important step in our preventive medicine programme.  As many of you are aware, among the main causes of death in modern times are heart disease, cancer including lung cancer and alcoholism.  All these diseases are preventable.  The unnecessary deaths and suffering caused by them can be avoided provided if one is aware of the causes and takes normal health precautions.  The task of creating awareness of the benefits of good positive health is by no means easy, but it is now an essential part of our health services.</P>
    <P>The bureau itself was set up in February last and has shown an urgent appreciation of the task ahead of it. Its frequent meetings and deliberations show its competence to tackle these problems.  Already a number of pilot schemes have been devised and are being put into operation.  It has also commenced the assessment of the work engaged in by voluntary organisations. I hope to make funds available in the next year to enable it to further the efforts of these organisations.</P>
    <P>I intend to set up in the near future an advisory council representative of these voluntary organisations to help both the bureau and myself in determining priority areas.  The preliminary work in setting up this council is well under way.  By means of these health education programmes it is expected to create a climate which will correct much of the present behaviour and attitudes which lead to ill health.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="69" /> The second matter to which I wish to refer is the seminar which was held last week in Waterford.  It had seemed to me for some time that it would be a good idea to seek some action to develop the processes of communication within the health services as a whole.  From my own point of view, I had for some time felt that much benefit could be derived from an occasion where I could, over a period of a a few days, meet many people involved in the health services, hear their views and discuss with them in an informal way the problems which were presented to them.  It was this thinking which led to the organisation of the Waterford seminar.  Specifically, it arose at a discussion which I had last February with some members of the Medico-Social Research Board.</P>
    <P>The development of this idea led to my issuing invitations to organisations involved in the health services which led to about 100 people participating in the seminar.  The participants included representatives of my Department and the Departments of Finance and the Public Service, the health boards, the voluntary hospitals, the National Health Council, Comhairle na nOspidéal, the Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education, the National Social Service Council, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, the Medico-Social Research Board, the Medical Research Council, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and several professional organisations concerned with the health services.  In choosing what bodies might make nominations, I had to make a selection.  There are many other bodies both official and otherwise concerned with the health services, and if all were to have been invited, the total number participating would have become too large and amorphous.  Hence, I had to be selective and could not extend invitations to many groups that had approached me about this.  I regretted this but felt that it was inevitable.</P>
    <P>The letters of invitation to the various bodies summarised the objective of the seminar as being:</P>
    <P>to obtain a preliminary overall view of the state of the services, to direct <Col N="70" /> attention to the major problems which beset them and to identify the key issues requiring further investigation and attention.</P>
    <P>I did not expect any sudden, magical solutions to the problems which beset me as Minister for Health from the activities of the seminar and told the participants so.  What I did hope for, as well as creating opportunities for the participants to communicate among themselves, was that important issues in each branch of the services would be pinpointed in the report on the seminar's proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am told that some of the participants approached the exercise rather diffidently but, as the seminar proceeded, it became clear that its objective in providing for communications within the disparate groups involved was being achieved.  What struck me most about the proceedings was the lack of acrimony between different groups, and the restraint in the pushing of vested interests.  Specifically, the question of pay for individual groups did not come up for discussion at all.</P>
    <P>Most of the work of the seminar was done in groups dealing with the four broad topics of community services, hospital services, organisation and personnel.  There were 12 of these groups and, during the seminar, I found it possible to sit in and hear the discussions in most of them.  In the final part of the seminar, reports from the work of these groups were presented. Deputies will have seen some of the conclusions reached in the media reports on the seminar.  Very many valuable suggestions were made. Not all of these are, of course, new, but this is the first time we had an opportunity for a very representative group to list the matters which will have to be considered in further thought on health policy, and in the determining of priorities in developing the services in the future.</P>
    <P>I think I can say, too, that there was a fairly general recognition at the seminar that impossible demands for resources for the health services could not be made and that development must be in accordance with a rational plan and related to the economic <Col N="71" /> resources available.  Many of those present were representing specific interests in the services and I think it was a good thing that they had the opportunity to see that there were several other representatives of other specific interests putting forward claims for priority in development.  As far as I was concerned, and my Department, it was of great advantage to have these reports presented.</P>
    <P>I intend that the basic documentation for this seminar and the reports which were presented at the end of it will be put together into a publication which I will have circulated to each Member of the House.  I hope the Members will find the material which will be contained in this as useful and as interesting as I did.</P>
    <P>Attendance at this seminar involved much hard work for many people. Those who came contributed much within a tight timescale and many of the participants worked late to produce the reports which were presented finally to the entire group.  The meeting was I think, an unique experiment in communication in a complicated field of public activity.  I think that my gratitude, and the gratitude of the House, should be offered to the many who participated in it.</P>
    <P>There were literally dozens of very useful recommendations made from the groups who participated in the seminar. I do not intend to list all these or to discuss them.  I intend that all the suggestions will be analysed and that the work of this seminar will greatly influence that of my Department and my own decisions in the future.  I would mention, however, a few of the important trains of thought that were developed.</P>
    <P>First, within the services, there was repeated emphasis on the need to develop community medical and welfare services as against services in institutions.  This is not, of course, entirely a new idea and has been the basis of much planning in the past but it was most welcome to have suggestions from the seminar on the implementation of this planning.  There was support also within the seminar <Col N="72" /> for the more rational development of the hospital services and the wide recognition of the need to look at the working of the hospital system to ensure that the vast resources put into it were being used efficiently and satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>On the personnel side, the most notable point made was that the use of auxiliary staff should be developed where this is practicable.  This was raised particularly in relation to the dental services and it was interesting that there was general support for a change in the law which would allow ancillary staff to perform some of the less specialised aspects of the work of the dentist.  I intend to look into this.</P>
    <P>On the organisation of the services, no dramatic recommendations came forth for a change in the health board system but it was clearly brought forth that a hard look must now be taken at the regional hospital boards, which were recognised as not fulfilling the coordinating role for which they were set up.  This, again, is something which we will have to look at now.</P>
    <P>Another interesting suggestion on organisation related to the functions of the Department of Health <i>vis-á-vis</i> those of the Department of Social Welfare. It was proposed that the scope of the health services should be extended into the field of income maintenance except in so far as benefits not related to health conditions were concerned. This is an interesting suggestion which might, however, present some practical difficulties.  However, I do intend to look into it in my capacity both as Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>To conclude in relation to the seminar, I think it was a well worthwhile exercise.  It certainly was from my point of view and I hope that, when Deputies get the report on the seminar, they will find this a useful contribution to the work of the House in the health field.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if even the most ardent admirer of the Minister could regard his Estimate speech as other than pedestrian and uninspiring. In his whole speech the Minister <Col N="73" /> could not announce one single significant new development.  The whole tone of his speech is apologetic and it can be summed up best by this particular quotation from it:</P>
      <P>No matter what financial yardstick is used, therefore, our health services are seen to be expanding in a real and sustained way.  If the international and national economic climates had been more favourable in the current year, our achievements, since taking office, would have been even more marked.</P>
      <P>That is the clearest possible admission by the Minister of the fact that in this current year he is not in a position to put forward a single, proposal for the improvement and the development of our health services.</P>
      <P>The Minister had to put together an Estimate speech but in order to do so he resorted to reciting a list of minor developments, all of which we knew about already and for most of which this Government had taken full credit.  It is very refreshing and encouraging for us all to know that the Minister proposes to increase the membership of the National Social Service Council from 25 to 29 members. That merits inclusion in any Estimates speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister felt compelled to tell us again that he had been generous to the thalidomide children.  In this House we have already dealt fully with the arrangements made by the Minister for these unfortunate children.  We have given him full credit for his generous provisions. Apparently he feels he has to refer back to that tragic incident again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has told us once more&mdash;and this is perhaps more outrageous than anything else in the Estimate speech&mdash;of the increases in the health allowances the Minister for Finance announced in the budget last January.  These have been trotted out again.  We have been told that they amounted to £1.6 million. Then, finally, as if the speech were not of sufficient mediocrity, he spent seven pages telling us about the seminar in Waterford.  That seminar was first used, as I described it at the <Col N="74" /> time, as a parliamentary tactic to divert attention from the fact that he was turning down our motion on the extension of eligibility for medical cards.  The seminar in Waterford was fully reported in the newspapers.  Indeed, it earned a fulsome and somewhat misleading leader in one of our national newspapers.  But there are seven pages of the Minister's Estimate speech devoted not to analysing and assessing for our benefit any of the proposals or conclusions reached in Waterford, but merely thanking all those who came along.  It was very like the chairman at the end of the dinner, thanking the hotel, management and staff for providing an excellent meal.</P>
    <P>While on the question of the Waterford seminar, I do not wish to take from its importance, it represents a significant development in the administration of our health services and it is widely welcomed, and justifiably so.  I hope that ultimately we will get the papers and the reports and be able to study them in detail.  It seemed to me that, as a seminar, it was concerned with the administration of the health services and that a far more useful seminar could be held on the development of our health services, on analysing where we are going and trying to identify the trends, trying to set objectives, rather than devoting itself to discussing, to a large extent the trivia of the administration of these health services.</P>
    <P>I confess to finding the Minister's Estimate speech disappointing.  To a large extent, it is a procession of trivia, a listing of matters with which we are already fairly familiar.  Surely it would have been appropriate for the Minister at this stage, to have announced the new hospital development programme. This is sufficiently urgent.  In his speech the Minister contented himself with saying that he had spent 18 months considering it and that very soon he was going to announce it.  He went on to tell us how useful it would be and how important it would be, when he would announce it.  I suggest to him that the House and the people who are interested in the health services could reasonably and confidently have expected <Col N="75" /> that he would have actually announced the programme in this Estimate speech.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons why the Minister's speech was of such a mediocre and disappointing nature.  The first is that the Minister for Health&mdash; no matter how well-meaning he may be&mdash;is totally and completely submerged by the financial disaster into which he and his colleagues have plunged this country.  I have been looking at the latest Exchequer returns. They show that the situation in the Exchequer, as between receipts and expenditure is, already, £82 million worse than it was for the corresponding period last year, eighty-two million pounds worse, with only just over four months of the year having passed.</P>
    <P>The simple situation is that the Minister for Health has no room for manoeuvre; he has no scope to put forward any proposals for improvements or developments, because the money simply is not there.  That seems to me to be the message which emerged from this famous Waterford seminar. The Minister, in effect, said to the worthy people assembled there: &ldquo;Please discuss the health services in detail.  Come forward with any ideas you like, but you must understand that there is no money with which to do anything&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have seen also a copy of a letter which was issued by the Minister's Department to the health boards some time in March.  I have seen fairly draconian missives issued from the Department of Finance in my time but this letter issued by the Department of Health to the health boards is the most carefully worded exhortation to economy I have ever seen.  It spells out, line by line, all the things the health boards must not or cannot do if there is any prospect of their costing money.  The sad situation is that the Minister for Health, in proposing this Estimate to the House, is quite incapable of announcing any single proposal involving expenditure of any sort.</P>
    <P>In considering this Estimate, we should address ourselves to a number <Col N="76" /> of basic questions, some of them concerned with the present and immediate future, some of them looking forward into the longer term.  The first question we must ask is in regard to the amount of the Estimate.  Is the Minister providing enough moneys to ensure the existing structure is able to function adequately during the current year? Are these moneys being efficiently administered?  Are the services we are providing the right ones or should there be any significant or important diversion from one particular heading to another?</P>
    <P>Looking further ahead still we must ask ourselves the sort of questions with which the seminar in Waterford should have been dealing.  Where exactly are we heading in the development of our health services?  Are we going in the right direction?  Are we pursuing the right objectives?  Are we adopting the right priorities?  If we continue to proceed along the lines we are following at present, is there any hope that, we will ever arrive at a satisfactory structure of health services capable of catering adequately and satisfactorily for our entire community?</P>
    <P>To strive constantly to improve the health, physical and mental, of all its citizens is an essential aim of any enlightened society.  That involves not just extending, and perfecting the existing structure of services but also seeking out and uncovering areas of hardship and suffering which up to then had been neglected or, perhaps, even unknown.  How are we progressing in that regard?  That is the sort of question to which I would have hoped the Minister would have addressed himself in his Estimate speech.  Those are the sort of questions which I would think relevant for him to deal with in putting his annual Estimate before the House, instead of blandly informing us that he proposes to increase the membership of the National Service Council from 25 to 29 members.</P>
    <P>I said there were two reasons why the Minister's speech is disappointing and discouraging.  The second is that it is a mistake to have the same man as Minister for Social Welfare and Minister for Health.  I do not say this by <Col N="77" /> way of criticism of the Minister but I think health is a sufficiently important area of public administration to have one person in charge of it&mdash;someone whose sole responsibility and whose driving ambition are constantly and persistently to improve our health services both in their quality and in their extent.  I believe that as long as the Minister has the dual mandate of Social Welfare and Health he cannot give to this vitally important area of health the purposeful, dedicated attention it demands in a modern community. I think the Minister's first love and main preoccupation is Social Welfare&mdash;perhaps if any of us were in this position we would have the same preference&mdash;but I think it reflects on the quality of the administration of our health services.</P>
    <P>In order to form any satisfactory conclusion about the amount which is provided for our health services in this year's Estimate, £177 million, it is not enough just to look at that figure in isolation.  It is necessary to go back over recent years and try to study the trends that have been emerging and the lines along which expenditures have been developing.  I have sought to establish a kind of comparative picture for the six-year period which includes the current year and the previous five years.  I have done so in order to try to fit this year's figure into some composite picture and see what the trends are and what the tendencies in expenditure are.  In order to do that one has to contend with a number of difficulties.  There are a number of factors which make valid comparisons over the last five or six years very difficult indeed.  First of all, there is the unprecedented rate of inflation in recent times.  Then there is the factor, which must be taken into account, of the change in the ratio of the expenditures which are borne by the local authorities on the one hand and the Central Exchequer on the other.  Then there is this peculiar system of accounting which the Department of Health operate and which takes opening and closing balances into account in arriving at the net Estimate for a particular year.  In order to arrive at the net Estimate, as published in the <Col N="78" /> Book of Estimates, appropriations-in-aid are deducted and they, of course, have changed very significantly in recent years.  They have been swollen by the addition of the receipts from the health contribution schemes and, more recently, by the receipts which are coming in from the European Community.</P>
    <P>All in all, it is difficult to get an exact basis of comparison over the years.  I think the Minister will agree that the figure in the Book of Estimates, given as the net Health Estimate for the particular year, is pretty meaningless for comparison purposes. I have taken out three principal elements in health expenditure and have sought to adjust them in a way that would make comparisons valid as between one year and another.  First of all, I had to discount the different figures for inflation.  In that regard I took the Central Bank figures for inflation&mdash;in 1970, 8.4 per cent, 1971, 9 per cent, 1972, 8 per cent, 1973, 11.3 per cent and 1974, 17.1 per cent.  The projected figure for 1975 by the Central Bank is 25 per cent.  I also had to make an adjustment for the nine-month period, which occurred during 1974, when we changed from the basis of the financial year April to March to the calendar year.</P>
    <P>I believe the significant amounts of expenditure are those included under subheads G and H&mdash;not the figures given in the Estimate itself because these are subject to different sorts of calculations but the figures given for the subheads as set out in the detailed section of the Estimate.  Subheads G and H cover the hospital services, general medical services and other services.  In effect, they represent the bulk of our expenditure on health and they represent more accurately than the Estimate itself the growth in gross expenditure because they, in effect, account for the expenditure by the health boards.</P>
    <P>These figures in actual money terms have increased from £55 million in 1970-1971 to £190 million in 1975.  Those figures adjusted for inflation increased by 77.4 per cent between 1970/71 and 1975.  In real <Col N="79" /> terms, between 1970 and 1975, our expenditure on health services went up by 77 per cent, whereas, in money terms it went up by 350 per cent.  It is important that we keep this element of inflation in mind in comparing the expenditure year by year. Over that six-year period there has, in fact, only been an increase of 77 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>The question we must ask ourselves is whether the 77 per cent increase represents better services in extent or quality for the people or whether there is included in it some element of paying an increased cost for the same services.  This is an area to which we must devote a great deal of attention in the future.  The Minister referred to this but his reference to it was not very encouraging.  He said:</P>
    <P>Preliminary work is being carried out at present on a review of health service financing.  This will continue throughout this year, with a view to exploring in depth whether we can make some beneficial changes in our financing arrangements.  There is no obvious answer at this time, but as a responsible Government, we have an obligation to explore the question thoroughly and this we intend to do.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear what the Minister has in mind there.  One possible interpretation is that the Government are exploring additional ways of raising from the public the money necessary to finance our health services.  If that is so, we would all be very interested to learn in what particular way the Government propose to do that.  Does that herald some new additional taxation on the general public or does it envisage some new type of charge specifically related to those benefiting from the health services?  I would hope that it meant something completely different.  If it did, it would be in line with our thinking on the health services.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the figure which I have given of an increase of 77 per cent over six years represents positive improvement in services, either in <Col N="80" /> quality or extent.  Therefore, there is a very real need for research into the cost of the health services.  That task can only be carried out by some specialised body, whose sole job will be to carry out continuing on-going research into health costs with a view to seeing how the best possible value can be got for the money which is being expended.  This is becoming increasingly important.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if any nation will ever be able to provide liberally for all the things it would like to do in the area of health.  That being so, it is vitally necessary for a country like ours to get the best possible value out of the money we spend.  This can only be done if we carry out a constant, rigorous effective programme of research into our health costs.  It is particularly important now when we have eight health boards involved in this expenditure.  It is important that their performance in regard to cost-benefit be compared constantly and that any lessons which are learned by one board and any benefits which can be procured in this cost benefit sphere should be immediately transmitted to all the other boards.</P>
    <P>Last month, as the Minister mentioned, we put down a Private Members' motion asking the Government to extend the general medical service to a considerably increased sector of the population.  We did so because we regard that extension as something which is urgently and vitally necessary. We believe that it is along that line improvements in our health services should be followed.  It fits in with our general concept of moving medicine, in so far as we possibly can, out of the institutions and into the community. Our thinking envisages that the local health centre will play an increasingly important part in the whole structure of the health services.  In that way the health services will become integrated into the local community and, correspondingly, there will be a reduction in the necessity for hospital admissions. Our motion sought to make the issue of medical cards automatic in the case of persons over 65 years, widows and persons suffering from long-term illnesses and also families whose net <Col N="81" /> income did not exceed £40 per month, after certain deductions were made.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw fit to ask the Dáil to reject that motion out of hand.  He was not prepared to accept it in principle and possibly to postpone its operation.  He was not prepared to amend it.  He was not prepared to make some amendment to our motion which would go some of the way towards meeting it.  In effect, all he could do in dealing with the motion in the House was to say that it would cost £15 million to put it into effect and he had not got that amount of money.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate our demand for some significant raising of these medical card eligibility limits.  Inflation keeps galloping on.  I have already indicated the Central Bank project a rate of 25 per cent for this year and this rate of inflation is resulting in many hard-pressed families, who should have medical cards, being denied them.  The Eastern Health Board laid down their guidelines for the issue of medical cards on the 1st January of this year.  If the Central Bank's estimate of inflation is correct, by now an inflation of 10 per cent has already taken place.  If, for no other reason than that, these income limits for medical card eligibility should be revised upwards.</P>
    <P>It is our approach to health policy that the extension of the general medical service should have top priority.  We recognise that there are many other desirable developments, many other improvements, many other things that need to be done.  But we believe that to provide the greatest possible benefit for the greatest number of people can only be done by an extension of the general medical service.  We regard that as something which should be afforded top priority, something which should have first command on any resources which are available and something which is urgently and vitally necessary at this time.  That is in keeping with our general approach.  We favour a fundamental change in the approach to the administration of the health services. We believe, and the Minister paid some lip service to this, that the emphasis in <Col N="82" /> future should be on community medicine, on the provision of medical aid, medical care, in the local community to the greatest possible extent that that can be done.  That leads ultimately to a reduction in the need for hospital admissions.  It seems to us that that makes good economic sense.  It is also something which is desirable on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  In so far as you can possibly do so you provide medical assistance and health services for the people in their own community and preferably in their own homes.  That is where we would like to see the emphasis put in future.</P>
    <P>I criticised the Minister already for not announcing the general hospital development programme.  That is one of the major developments which are needed at this stage in our health services.  There are vital reasons for a planned, rational, national hospital building programme.  I hope the Minister will not delay very much longer in coming forward with that programme. At Question Time week after week, it is disclosed that in practically every part of the country existing hospitals of all sorts are over-crowded. Overcrowding is really the norm rather than the exception.</P>
    <P>This is something which is of vital political and economic significance.  We need a great deal of additional new hospital accommodation.  The resources available to us for the provision of that hospital accommodation are necessarily limited and will always be limited. There must be a rational plan.  There must be an element of duplication or overlapping and the plans of the different regions must be co-ordinated at national level by the Minister.  A very long term comprehensive programme and a co-ordinated national programme are called for.  I hope that, through the Minister, all the latest modern techniques will be brought to bear on this programme.</P>
    <P>I remember some years ago when the regional colleges of technology were being planned a group of experts were brought together, a team, by the Department of Education and they set out to achieve standardisation in the building of the regional colleges <Col N="83" /> throughout the country.  Perhaps the problem is not exactly the same in so far as hospitals are concerned but there is scope for some similar type of approach on this occasion if we are to do a good deal of hospital building, extending over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  The basis of it must be properly planned, then the manner in which it is done should be co-ordinated.  I strongly recommend to the Minister that he look back at what was done in the case of the building of the colleges of technology.</P>
    <P>I know there was much political controversy at the time about it and certain unfounded allegations were made about the team which was put together on that occasion but significant economies were achieved through standardisation.  I suggest that in this new hospital building programme something of a similar nature be instituted by the Department. The old traditional methods of building will not suffice on this occasion.  I do not mean the actual building techniques but the whole way in which these buildings are planned and the way they are brought to building stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned, and I think rightly so, the very real need there is for improvement in the dental and the opthalamic services.  I believe, in particular, there is an urgent need for extension of the dental services.  I had the experience recently of a mother writing to me who said her husband was eligible for free dental service but that she was not.  Furthermore, she pointed out that in order to write the letter to me she had to borrow his glasses because she was not entitled to free glasses either.  That may be an over-dramatisation of the situation but I think there is a germ of realism in that incident.  One of the areas in which improvement is urgently needed is that of eligibility for dental treatment.  I think there is a need for a shift of emphasis, a change from corrective dentistry to reparative dentistry just as in medicine we must try to draw more attention to preventive medicine.  The same sort of situation <Col N="84" /> applies in the dental field.  It is regrettable that some of the trouble in this area emanates from the poor state of relations which exists between the dental profession and the Minister's Department.  I believe there is scope and need for a new far-reaching approach in this whole area of the dental services.</P>
    <P>I understand that at the Waterford seminar very considerable emphasis was laid on the need for a massive and sweeping improvement in our whole approach to the mentally handicapped in our community.  The Minister referred to the report of the working party which was established to consider the training and employment of the handicapped.  There are certain aspects of that report with which I would not be very happy.  I doubt the validity of certain conclusions they come to and certain suggestions they make.  But, whether or not we accept the report in all its aspects I do not think, and I understand this was very clearly brought out in the seminar in Waterford, that a considerably extended programme in the whole area of the treatment of the mentally handicapped is urgently necessary. The position is that there are large numbers of persons in our mental institutions who should not be there at all but who should be in properly equipped mentally handicapped centres.  There are a number of institutions which are, at the moment, coping with mentally handicapped children.  When these children come to adult age, there is nowhere for them to go except into the institutions. There is a very urgent demand for positive, concrete action in this whole area.  I am not in any way criticising the Minister in this regard because everyone accepts that this is one area in which we have failed to make any significant progress up to present.  The time has now come when there must be a comprehensive approach to the whole problem of the provision of training, education and other facilities for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>One question to which we will have to give increasing attention is the success or otherwise of the regional boards.  I think a reasonably balanced <Col N="85" /> judgement would be that they have been quite successful.  As an administrative device, the regional board has been a success.  I think all of us in this House who have experience of the operation of the health services at ground level would agree that since the coming into operation of the regional boards there has been a very considerable improvement.  There has been a change of atmosphere and emphasis and an overall improvement. That is the encouraging side of the picture.</P>
    <P>Criticisms are made of the boards and of the manner in which they operate.  I think there is a need for some sort of evaluation of their performance. I have already mentioned it is important that we examine and research their financial performance and compare the results achieved one with the other.  We must also have a look at their general structure, the composition of the bureaucracy which they have created and their effectiveness and efficiency.  If the experiment of devolving so much power down to these boards has been successful in the board outline, is there a case for devolving some power further down still?  As the services which we will be providing increase and are extended is there a danger that the boards, even though they have been regionalised, even though the services have been regionalised into eight separate compartments, as it were, that these, in time, will become unregional? Should we now be looking ahead at some further devolution down to a lower level still?  I believe the suggestions in the McKinsey Report in so far as these boards are concerned should be adopted.</P>
    <P>There is a unanswerable case for giving the boards full budgetary powers.  I do not think we can ever regard them as being in a position to totally discharge their responsibilities until they have these full budgetary powers.  That is the next important practical step that can be taken in so far as these boards are concerned.  There is also a case for a considerable amount of in-service training.  These boards will in future be inaugurating <Col N="86" /> and initiating more and more programmes. One of the most important factors in any of these areas&mdash;community care or any of the allied areas&mdash; is the quality of the manager of the programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to formulate any positive policy in relation to the continued expansion of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>I am greatful for the opportunity to bring this very important motion before the House.  Fishing should be almost as important to us as agriculture. It should be our second largest industry. Unfortunately, we have to say that our investment in fishing must be the lowest in Europe although our potential is probably one of the highest. In this debate while we can look at the progress made by countries like Norway and Denmark it would be unfair to make direct comparisons for a number of reasons.  First, most of the reasons would be historical.  Going back on history we know that when the Act of Union was introduced Britain so geared the finances of this country that there was very little investment here and she tried to plan and regulate emigration to suit her own interests.  While we here have enjoyed so-called freedom for a period of years, we must admit that we have not had economic freedom and that this hampered investment in many fields.  Fishing like many other industries suffered as a result of this. There was no real development until the Sixties when An Bord Iascaigh Mhara reorganised and restructured and from there on we had planned development, so to speak.  This resulted in a larger amount of money being made available to buy suitable boats for the fishermen.  We also had improvements in harbour facilities and grants made available for the handling of fish and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early stages we concentrated <Col N="87" /> on 50-foot boats with a direct drive engine where no reduction gear was used and where the towing power of the boat for certain types of fishing such as trawling was entirely limited. Looking back on the past ten years, while we did provide an excellent hull and while the design of the boats was satisfactory in every way, we have come a very long way in relation to boat-building and the type of boat which is now being handled by our fishermen.  Also, our fishermen have improved a great deal in the knowledge of the various techniques necessary to man this type of boat.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara must again get a certain amount of credit for providing courses for fishermen and for assisting them in their training to operate the type of boats which they now have.</P>
    <P>The investment in the other sectors of the industry was also increased. The IDA and in some instances Gaeltarra Éireann and the board gave grants for co-operatives to provide cold storage and other facilities at the landing points.  In our harbour development plan a number of ports were selected for special attention.  In that nine or ten years the fishing industry has expanded considerably and the incomes have increased.  Up to recently we have seen fishermen enjoying a certain degree of prosperity as a result of this planned development.  At the same time we would have to admit that because of our geographic position not enough has been done and that we should have had a far higher investment in this important industry down through the years.  I hope to come to that point later.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate thing at the moment is that the prosperity which was being enjoyed has shown a marked decline.  This is due to decreases in catches, to out-dated marketing structures and to increased operational costs.  These matters have been mentioned in the Dáil in recent weeks and have also been given a good airing through the Irish fishermen's organisation.  It is true to say that at present the fishermen are <Col N="88" /> really going through one of the worst and leanest periods they have experienced over the past few years.  Fishermen have their boats tied up even though the weather is most suitable. Because of bad prices on the market, because of small catches, they find it almost impossible to decide to go to sea.  They are overhauling their vessels, painting their boats and examining their engines at a time when they should be out fishing.</P>
    <P>The most urgent need is to take a look at our marketing structures.  I agree that the present situation cannot improve very much until better facilities are provided at most harbours.  By better facilities I mean cold storage facilities, and so on.  When the fisherman is seen to get 5p, 6p and 7p for popular varieties of fish such as cod, whiting and haddock, and when the retailer is seen to get prices in excess of 50p for the same varieties, the matter explains itself.  This is one area in which it is very necessary to do something positive.</P>
    <P>The position in most ports is that the fishermen land their fish and send it off by CIE, or other means of transport, to the Dublin market.  They have no control whatsoever over what happens to the fish from there on. The Dublin market is controlled by wholesale merchants who are also retail merchants and who call themselves auctioneers, although I understand that they are not auctioneers in the true sense of the word, except that they operate on a traditional basis and they conduct the sales in the Dublin market on behalf of the fishermen.  A great deal of fish which arrives in the Dublin market never goes into auction.  It is taken away by these people to their own shops and retailed there.  The fishermen are charged 7½ per cent for the auctioning of fish which never goes up for auction.</P>
    <P>In the early sixties a survey was carried out by an American group on the fishing industry as a whole here, and one of the items they mentioned specifically in their report was the marketing system with special reference to the Dublin market.  They suggested that a State auctioneer <Col N="89" /> should be employed in the market to auction the fish on behalf of the fishermen.  This is necessary and it would help considerably if some arrangement of this kind could be made.  I was in the Dublin market on a number of occasions and, frankly, I just did not know what was happening there.  Apart from the manner in which the fish is presented for auction, or not presented for auction as the case might be, the whole set up there is revolting.  If people saw the way fish was handled in the Dublin market it would put them off eating fish forever.  It is thrown around and badly handled in general. It is time we did something not alone to protect the interests of the fishermen but also to ensure that the handling and presentation of fish are improved immensely.</P>
    <P>This is the time of year for white fishing and most of the boats around the coasts engage in this type of fishing during these months.  The nature of the fishing itself means that they have to tow a trawl for many hours and they use a great deal of oil.  This explains the reason for the anxiety on the part of fishermen in relation to prices, and so on.  Their oil costs have increased by about 300 per cent.  It really does not pay to tow a trawl for a number of hours and then find that markets are depressed and that prices for white fish are bad.</P>
    <P>I should say in fairness that because of the large number of boats engaged in this type of fishing, more fish is going into the market and because of this prices are depressed.</P>
    <P>Another serious situation arises because our larger boats are concentrating on the grounds fished by the smaller boats in the past.  It is true to say that they have not gone out in the deeper water, that they have been more or less scraping the rocks that were being used by the smaller boats. This means that these small bays are now being cleaned out very quickly. They have greater power and they have a bigger span of net and the smaller inshore boat, the boat of 50 feet or less, finds itself in an impossible position because of this.  I am sure that the fishermen themselves realise what <Col N="90" /> is happening and that they will have to do something positive about it.</P>
    <P>Overall, we can say that the position at the moment is not at all satisfactory. When we see the recent fumbling and indecision of the Government in relation to fishing and in relation to the manner in which moneys were not made available, and then at a later date were made available, one can say quite honestly that they do not seem to be taking their responsibility too seriously in relation to this very important industry.  This is why the fishermen found it necessary, for the first time ever, to take to the streets. I believe that when they came to the Government and to the Parliamentary Secretary with their complaints, their demands were very reasonable.</P>
    <P>One of the things they asked for was an overall plan for the industry. I do not see anything wrong with this. I would agree wholeheartedly that it is a great necessity to have an overall plan for the industry.  To date, our concentration has been on an inshore fleet. From the boat-building side, we can say that we have reached phase 1 in the development of our industry.  At this stage we have possibly almost reached our maximum in relation to boat-building for an inshore fleet.  We now have to take Phase 2, the building of a middle-water fleet, or a fleet that would stay out for long periods and fish farther away from home.  This is something that must receive very serious consideration from the Government. Later on I hope to be able to develop a number of reasons as to why I see this type of development as necessary.</P>
    <P>Running parallel with this building of larger boats, we must plan harbour development.  If we build larger boats I can see very few of our traditional harbours, as they are at the moment, being in a position to hold these boats or to provide the facilities that will be necessary for the larger type boat. For instance, Killybegs harbour, one can say, is overcrowded already, and the same thing can be said of Howth, and of Castletownbere.  Therefore, in talking about expanding the fleet, the possibility of opening up new harbours will also have to be decided.  Places <Col N="91" /> on the west coast, such as Innislyre near Westport, Ballyglass&mdash;which is about to develop&mdash;should be developed in order to make sure the boats are catered for in every possible way.</P>
    <P>It will also be necessary to provide extra cold-storage arrangements to ensure that the fishermen will be able to have every facility when arriving in port.  In this respect, the question of maintenance of engines and gear will have to be looked at very seriously to ensure that there will be no loss of time.  Too often one hears of fishermen being held up for a long period because grants for certain types of engine or other gear are not available. It is necessary to ensure that all these facilities are available for fishermen at ports.</P>
    <P>Education is another very important aspect of the industry which will have to be examined.  As I stated previously, it is true to say that the fishermen and skippers have availed themselves of the courses provided by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara down the years. It is necessary to extend these courses to help skippers and crew members to keep abreast of modern developments. Crew members would also have to be trained.  In the larger craft, it would be necessary to have specialist treatment or special knowledge in relation to particular jobs in order to have efficient crews and the efficient handling of boats and gear, and therefore it would be necessary to have the crewmen educated in the same way as skippers.</P>
    <P>In an operation of this kind there can be no time for trial and error. The three are combined, greater catching power, more harbour facilities and increased handling and other facilities necessary at shore level.  They are all tied up.</P>
    <P>We will have to look at the school we have at Greencastle to ensure that it has the staff and equipment to help with the courses I mentioned.  I should like to quote from the recent Press release in relation to one of the courses at this school.  It says:</P>
    <P>As in previous years courses are now being organised by the Department <Col N="92" /> of Agriculture and Fisheries to train groups of experienced fishermen so as to enable them to qualify as skippers of fishing vessels. The courses, lasting about ten to 12 weeks, are scheduled to be held in the National Fishery School. Greencastle, commencing on Monday, 3rd March, 1975.  The subjects will include seamanship, navigation and the running and maintenance of marine engines.</P>
    <P>That is an admirable development but it is necessary to broaden the scope of the courses for fishermen and skippers.  In this development it would be necessary to have new training centres, possibly one on the west coast, one in the south and one in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Educational programmes will have to be designed to cover all aspects of the industry.  At present the courses provided deal with the catching of fish only but, to my knowledge, we do not provide much help for people in the processing and handling of fish. Our educational system at all levels would need to be looked at.  We are in no way conscious of marine life and our schools, primary, post-primary and third level, should concentrate more on all aspects of marine life.</P>
    <P>To give an example of how backward we are in this respect I should like to refer to an experience of mine. A group of people in my area decided to rear oysters.  They found, after a short period, that the oyster beds were covered with moss and the oysters were dying.  At that time we had the services of a Frenchman, who was managing the fishing co-operative for us, and they asked him for advice on this matter.  He said the remedy was simple.  It involved throwing a few bags of winkles on the beds and the winkles would eat the moss.  This, of course, solved the problem.  I should have known this as a teacher in a primary school on the west coast but it was the first time I had heard about it.  It is an indication of how far behind we are in minor matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, too, to provide more money for marine biology.  A number <Col N="93" /> of dedicated people in Galway University have been involved in this down the years but they have been severely handicapped by lack of finance, a suitable boat and other ancillary equipment which would help them in their work.  In the new curriculum in the national schools we should have greater concentration on fishing. Teachers and pupils should be encouraged to carry out projects which would help focus more attention on fishing in general.</P>
    <P>I have spoken a good deal about the extension of our fleet and the provision of more catching power but we must ensure that the inshore fisherman, the traditional fisherman with the small boat, has his rights protected. He must get the protection of the State in many ways.  It would be necessary to bring in some regulations which would mean that the larger boats would have to fish outside a certain limit.</P>
    <P>There is confidence in the industry because fishermen are prepared to provide or invest a great deal of money in the purchase of boats and gear.  Apart from bigger boats, the inshore people are prepared to invest considerable sums also.  The whole area of fishing is sorely in need of special attention.  A crash programme is necessary in order to get it off the ground.</P>
    <P>We need to increase our catching power, press to expand our fishery limits, try to increase the number of boats on fishery protection, improve the marketing structures, provide suitable handling and cold storage facilities, and help with the maintenance of engines and other gear by having spare parts available.  We must educate our young fishermen, and the public in general, as to the developments of and the advantages to be gained from this industry.  This is necessary because an investment in this industry can improve our economy.</P>
    <P>With proper planning in five or six years our gross national product from fishing could reach over £100 million. This is a target of which we should not be afraid.  Another very important <Col N="94" /> aspect which should be borne in mind at present is that the Treaty of Accession to the EEC comes up for renewal in 1983.  Unless we can prove that we are able to exploit our waters in full we will find ourselves in an impossible position.  Whatever Government is in office at the time will certainly have no arguments to put forward unless we can prove that we are able to exploit our fishing waters to the full.  This is possibly the most important reason for having a plan prepared at this time to increase our catching power and leave us in the position where we could prove to the other member states that we can exploit our waters to the full.  In that way we would not have to seek charity from these people when we have to debate this matter with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>In the motion put down by the Opposition they accuse us of having no positive policy in relation to the continued expansion of the fishing industry.  Like Deputy Gallagher, I come from one of the western counties and am very involved in the fishing industry on my doorstep. I also represent our largest fishing port, Killybegs.  It has given me much pleasure over the last two years to go into that port each month. I see Deputy Gallagher laughing.  Perhaps he was there recently and saw for himself the tremendous improvement the people of Killybegs have achieved under the National Coalition Government.  Not alone is there a new look about Killybegs but the fishermen there also realise the new opportunities offered them by the Government.  There is an air of confidence about the whole town at present.  It is the fastest growing town in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to compare the progress made by the National Coalition Government over the last two years with that of the last four years of the Fianna Fáil administration.  Let us take, for example, the town of Killybegs. In 1973 this Government provided grants of £122,000.  In 1974 they allocated grants of £247,000.  For the first three months of 1975 they allocated grants of £126,000, making a total for the last two-and-a-half years <Col N="95" /> of £495,000 for one town alone in County Donegal.  Surely that is confidence in the fishing industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us take another town further up the west coast of Donegal&mdash; Burtonport&mdash;which ranks as approximately the seventh largest of the fishing towns in Ireland.  In 1972-1973 Burtonport got £68,000; in 1973-1974 it got £48,000 and in 1974-1975 it received £40,000.  That was a massive £156,000 granted to that village in the last two-and-a-half years.  I quoted these facts so that they will be on the record to show the progress made and how earnestly we are taking the fishing industry at present.  Admittedly, we are not happy with the fishing industry. The Parliamentary Secretary is not happy with the fishing industry; he wants to do more and more and that is the reason that he is spending such an amount of money.</P>
    <P>In a fast-changing industry such as fishing at present we cannot do enough.  Those facts alone prove that we have done more in the last two-and-a-half years than the previous Government did in their 16 years of office.</P>
    <P>As well as representing Killybegs and Burtonport, a sizeable part of my constituency is in the Gaeltacht. The Gaeltacht grants for slipways and piers in 1974 amounted to £8,878.  I, like Deputy Gallagher, know how small is the Gaeltacht area of the west coast.  He knows that £8,878 is a massive injection to our in-shore fishermen. Not alone have we spent money on small piers but also on some large projects.  Let me quote examples from my own constituency of Donegal.  In relation to Magheraroarty, a £62,000 grant has just been sanctioned by the Department of the Gaeltacht. Work on the pier there is due to start on the 1st June next.  Let me remind the Opposition that we believe in backing up our confidence with our money.</P>
    <P>I want to come to the national view of the fishing industry.  Again, I shall quote a few figures.  I want to remind the Opposition that two-and-a-half <Col N="96" /> years ago their fishing budget was £4,150,000.  In the current financial year we are spending £7,940,000 on fishing which shows an increase of £3,790,000.</P>
    <P>We appreciate new ideas and new thinking.  Surely when we quote figures like this facts speak louder than words.  I listened to Deputy Gallagher very carefully.  I know he is a man of high integrity.  I was very surprised that he did not, perhaps, put forward some of the new ideas he has on the fishing industry.  He spoke about matters that we have heard spoken about for the last two years in this House.  Let me also remind the Fianna Fáil Party that in the last four years in which they were in office, in one year alone, they handed back 66 per cent of the grants that were given to the Fisheries Branch because they could not find the places, the time and the workmen on which to spend these moneys.  The second year they sent back 47 per cent, the third year 48 per cent and the fourth 40 per cent.  In other words, the difference between the Opposition and the Government is that we believe in spending the money we allocate to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Opposition, when in power, believed in promising the people that the money was going to be spent.  Then they turned and gave a large percentage of it back to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned with the fishing industry.  I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary say time and time again that we believe in using our raw materials.  Of course, fish is one of our major raw materials.  Surely the greatest proof is the number of fishermen now applying for new boats.  Let me again remind the people living in the Gaeltacht that the Department of the Gaeltacht can allow grants on a loan of up to £4,000.  They can apply to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  All they are expected to pay is a 5 per cent deposit on their new boats.  If the boat in respect of which they are applying is a reasonably small one costing £100,000 the Department of the Gaeltacht will give 80 per cent of that £100,000.  Of course, this applies only if they live in the Gaeltacht areas.</P>

      <P>The grant is an added incentive to people living in Gaeltacht areas.  Hardly a week passes without three or four fishermen coming to me looking for new boats because of the confidence they have in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My time is limited.  The point I want to get across is that, instead of bluffing the people for 16 years, we have been in office for the last two-and-a-half years and we have shown the fishermen we are determined to put the fishing industry on a new foundation.  It will take time to change; it will take time to develop our fishing industry the way we want it developed.  We admit it is a fast changing industry.  We admit that there are new techniques coming up every day.  We admit that the people now are looking for newer and larger boats.  We admit that we have to look at the fish farming and the oyster farming operations.  All this takes time but this National Coalition Government over the last two-and-a-half years can be proud of their record. <Col N="98" /> We can leave the industry in the capable hands of the Parliamentary Secretary. As the fishermen themselves are aware, if they have problems, he is willing to speak to them and help them to solve any problems they may have.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  I fully support it.  If the Government were serious about expanding the fishing industry and developing it to its maximum they should set out to do a number of things in a stated policy.  They should set out, first of all, to increase the catching power of fishermen.  They should improve considerably the harbours, piers and landing facilities around the coast as well as providing more and better cold storage facilities and more processing stations ashore.</P>
      <P>I see no reason in this day and age why these things cannot be done, particularly now with all the money available to this country from the EEC funds.  The Government should set out on a proper plan of campaign to provide better marketing facilities for our fishermen at home as well as abroad.  The Government, through either the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, should be continuously improving fishing techniques and should be in continuous consultation with fishermen with a view to putting these improved techniques into operation. The Government should also set about seriously improving the boat-building industry by providing more and better grant facilities particularly for the small boat builders, as well as expanding substantially the existing boatyards instead of just maintaining them as they were a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should promote rather than discourage co-operation among fishermen.  The Government should give substantial grants to fishermen's co-operatives and, indeed, to the National Organisation of Fishermen. We have to remember and bear in mind the increased unemployment which would result at this crucial stage in our evolution should proper action not be taken.  The Government should take cognisance of <Col N="99" /> the fact that the fishing industry is a very important industry as far as the economy of the country is concerned and that its potential has not yet been seen, nor nearly seen.  The Government should ensure that the importation of fish, both tinned and otherwise, should be cut out entirely and arrangements should be made to make us a nation which can at least supply all our own needs as far as fish is concerned.</P>
    <P>I shall set out now how these objectives could be achieved.  The Government should encourage bigger, better and heavier landing but, concomitant with these, we must have the requisite facilities.  We must have the harbours and piers properly developed to take larger boats.  As well as that, we should encourage the fishermen by way of increased grant facilities to purchase and man the larger trawlers which fish further out to sea and make sure that the catches are landed on our shores.  Before this can be done the landing facilities must, of course, be there.  There should also be proper landing facilities for the smaller boats around the coast, particularly along the western and south western seaboard. We must remember that there are numerous small piers and harbours around the west and south-west ideally suited for landings from smaller boats.  In the old days when there was a big population along the western seaboard and that population depended mainly on fishing as a livelihood these were maintained in good condition.  It behoves the Government now to make sure that these small piers and harbours are restored at least to the condition in which they were in the past.  If this were done it would certainly be a big boost to local employment and to local incomes; it would also encourage more young people to take up fishing as a livelihood.  Many of these young people seeing their fathers and brothers fishing would themselves be encouraged to take up fishing as a career.  Many of them would ultimately, I am certain, be manning larger trawlers of all descriptions fishing way out into deep sea.</P>
    <P>There was great excitement when we heard about the oil and gas off <Col N="100" /> Kinsale and off other parts of Ireland. The potential, as far as minerals is concerned, is nothing in comparison with the vast potential as far as our fishing industry is concerned. Now is the time for the Government to inject the necessary capital into the fishing industry to make sure it is expanded rapidly.  It is clear that the fishermen have confidence in the future of the fishing industry now, provided they get the necessary backing from the Government.  But, it seems to me that the fishermen have not got confidence in this Government to back them to the extent necessary to enable them to increase the number of boats fishing, to increase the landings and to increase the number of men employed on the fishing boats.  I believe the vast majority of fishermen are convinced that this urban-biased and mainly urban-based Government have no overall Government plan for the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Many of our harbours and piers require development.  Development schemes were going ahead fairly well during the period of the previous Administration but, in Kerry and west Cork there appears to be almost a full stop as far as the development of piers and harbours is concerned.  I reminded the Parliamentary Secretary in this House before of a number of piers and harbours along the western coast and particularly along Kerry and west Cork which required urgent repair and improvement works in the interest of the safety of the fishermen, if nothing else.  I referred him to particular piers and harbours where even the very minimum of public lighting was not provided.  I referred him to piers and harbours which were almost destroyed by storms in the past two years and which his Department have made very little effort, if any, to have restored.  I know of one small pier off which, last September, I saw 18 boats fishing.  The landing facilities were atrocious and most dangerous.  I saw a lorry being reversed down the pier with half of the outside right wheels hanging over the pier because it was so narrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I drew the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to this matter on a few occasions and very little has happened.  I believe the Government should at this stage in the history of the country and having regard to the terrible state of the economy at the moment, be making an all-out effort to provide proper cold storage facilities for fish, particularly at the major fishing harbours.  There are very limited storage facilities available in some areas.  Now is the time, in the interest of providing employment for people in industry based on fishing, to set up more processing stations along our coasts.  If the Government were serious about reducing the unemployment figure of 103,000 one way in which it could be reduced somewhat would be by providing the industries where the raw materials are available and where the labour force is available.  I believe everyone will agree with me.  We have the raw materials, we have the labour and we have the skill as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  These are vital factors in reducing the unemployment rate along our coastline.  All we want at the moment is the will and the money from the Government to provide better landing facilities and more processing stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also bear in mind that the ratio of employment as between the number of person engaged in fishing and the number of persons engaged in processing offshore is 6:1.  This is pretty high.  I would appeal to the Parliamentray Secretary to take some positive steps towards the provision of better cold storage facilities and more processing facilities for our fish.  It is certainly not something to boast about in this day and age that about 60 per cent of our fish is exported in a raw state.  I would equate this with exporting cattle on the hoof.  The nation and the economy is not availing <Col N="102" /> of the fishing industry to say the very least.</P>
    <P>Fishing, if it were properly harnessed, could be the second largest industry in the country.  At the moment it comes after agriculture and manufacturing and tourism.  If properly handled it could be our second largest industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry got the biggest blow it ever got when the Government slashed the Estimate for Fisheries in the Book of Estimates for this year.  It was a terrible blow and it showed a complete lack of confidence in the industry on the part of the Government.  The Minister for Finance tried to make some sort of recovery on behalf of the Government afterwards by announcing an additional £1.4 million in the budget to maintain the same level of employment in boatyards but this was not nearly enough.  It meant that the Government had not got the same amount of money to spend this year on the repair and improvement of piers and harbours, and provision of processing industries as they had in previous years.</P>
    <P>Each maritime county should set up a county committee of fisheries.  The first such committee was set up in County Kerry and it is working fairly successfully although I would like to see it expanded further.  It is very important that such committees be fully representative of all the fishing interests, from the smallest lobster fishermen up.</P>
    <P>There is no substitute on any committee for men with a practical knowledge of the industry.  The Parliamentary Secretary should direct each county along our coastline to set up a fishery committee.  He should set out the structure for such a committee. It reflects the frustration of the fishermen in this country and the chaos in which the fishing industry finds itself that for the first time ever the fishermen found it necessary to march to Leinster House to protest against the manner in which they were being treated by the Government.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the sacrifices and the loss of finance that fishermen have suffered.  It is for each country within the EEC to initiate <Col N="103" /> various schemes.  I am surprised that the Government have not initiated a scheme for the provision of a special grant for our fishing industry, especially having regard to the fact that they cannot out of their resources provide the necessary capital for the industry to expand at a time when it is prepared to expand and particularly when we know the extent of the catches off our shores.  The money is not available in this country as a direct result of the Government's mismangement of our financial affairs. They should be more concerned about the Law of the Sea Conference and ensure that the rights of our fishermen are protected.  Not only our fishermen but our people as a whole are concerned with the issue of fishery protection.</P>
    <P>I urge the fishermen to organise themselves now as never before to ensure that the Government do not rest on their oars at this stage and that they will do everything possible to get more finance for this industry. We must remember that in Europe there is a demand for fish.  It is a pity that the industry here has been neglected.  The benefits would be multiple&mdash;increased exports from entirely native resources, added value in processing the resources for exports, substituting for our meat diet and the freeing of further quantities of beef for export.  It would also mean increased incomes and employment especially in the depressed western and south-western areas.</P>
    <P>The amount being expended in fisheries by the Government this year may look all right in percentage terms but the question remains as to whether it is enough.  I do not believe it is.  The last budget produced an estimate for 1975 of £4 million odd while the previous nine-month expenditure was £3.4 million.  Therefore, the figure for this year shows a drop as between 1974 and 1975 with no allowance for inflation.  It was only following protests by the Fianna Fáil Party and by the fishermen that the Minister for Finance at the eleventh hour came in and in the budget allowed an extra £1.4 million in order to maintain <Col N="104" /> the same level of employment in the boatyards this year as last year.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind the fact that the cost of boats has doubled in the last 18 months and that the cost of carrying out any harbour works or any improvements to piers or slipways has also increased during that time.  If the Government were serious in maintaining the same level of progress as was being maintained under Fianna Fáil, at least four to five times as much money should be made available now for fisheries as was being made available a few years ago.  This is something which we will not allow the Parliamentary Secretary nor the Government to get away with.</P>
    <P>The fishermen ask why the Government do not increase the amount of money available.  Any rapid increase in the amount of money would have the effect of enlarging the national annual catch at a time when the industry is badly under-capitalised.</P>
    <P>I am firmly convinced that this Government have failed completely to realise that in a very short time the fishing industry could be the second largest industry and that it could ultimately become our greatest industry. The Government have failed to realise the vast potential for employment arising from the injection of the necessary capital into this industry. They have failed to realise what part this industry could play in reducing the unprecedented numbers unemployed. They have not got the will, the courage, the unity of purpose nor the capacity to tackle in a realistic manner the expansion of this industry and to take advantage of all that it involves for the nation.  Because of their mishandling of our economy they should go to the EEC and initiate some scheme as any member nation is entitled to do.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to get the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to go to the EEC right away and initiate some scheme or some fund from which the Government could draw the money necessary to give the boost to the fishing industry which is badly required at the moment in the interest of the fishing industry, in the interest <Col N="105" /> of the unemployed, in the interest of creating more employment, and in the interest of the economy generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine, listening to the Opposition, that the Government have done nothing to boost this very important industry.  I have listened to the litany of gloom and doom coming from the last speaker and one would think that he is not aware of the Government's efforts to improve the fishing industry when, in fact, the Government have practically doubled the investment made by the previous Government during their term of office.</P>
      <P>The previous Government did very little to ensure there was adequate protection for our fishermen.  I am fully aware of this particularly in regard to the west coast.  The Government have ensured that an additional fishery protection vessel will be purchased.  They are making arrangements for proper air force cover for our fishermen so that they can reap the harvest from our seas to which they are entitled.  The Attorney General did his utmost when he attended the Law of the Sea Conference in Geneva.  That adjourned conference will be resumed and we can anticipate that he will reflect the Government's interest in the fishing industry. While we cannot make our own unilateral arrangements in regard to the extension of the fishing limits to 50 miles, we can rely on the Government and on the Attorney General to ensure that our fishermen get as much scope to fish as can be given to them. We do not want to act alone.  We recognise that it is in the best interests of the country that we should have arrangements with other States.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of the Government's policy which has been overlooked by the Opposition is that loans are now available for the purchase of boats at an interest rate of 4 per cent.  In a time of world-wide inflation, which we must all attempt to overcome, the Government have been generous in holding that interest rate at 4 per cent. We do not expect appreciation from the Opposition for this, but these are facts which must be recorded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They can avail of these terms.  We must remember what has been done in the poorer areas and the opportunities which have been given to our fishermen by providing proper harbours where there are big intakes of fish.  I refer specifically to the allocation made by the Minister for the Gaeltacht for harbour improvements in the Gaeltacht areas.  That investment in improving harbours in the Galway area is appreciated fully by the fisherment who utilise those harbours.</P>
      <P>Young fishermen who are anxious to avail of loans can get information from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  We are now organising county development teams who will promote the fishing industry and encourage young people to participate.  About a month ago in Clare such a body was formed and at the seminar, which was attended by the IAOS and representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the whole field was fully covered.  It was agreed by the fishermen that they would prefer to see some development of the smaller harbours in order to encourage fishermen to progress from small boats to larger vessels as their finances improve.</P>
      <P>I would like to see more investment and I hope the Minister for Finance will be able to give the necessary injection to enable smaller piers to be erected and existing piers to be improved in areas where the people show an interest in the industry.  I do not say this because it is the popular thing to talk about investment in areas, but because where there is a demand from the people who fish, and where the youth in an area show a determination and an interest in the sea, it is vital that help should be given.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a particular interest in this and he should get the finances which would permit this necessary development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the west coast of Clare there has been investment in one particular harbour.  It is not as satisfactory as some fishermen would wish it to be. They would like to see that pier <Col N="107" /> raised.  I cannot see why the wishes of fishermen should be ignored.  They use the piers.  They were brought up in the area and it is vital to have a proper line of communication established between the representatives of the Department and the fishing industry. A very good hearing should be given to fishermen who know what they want.  I refer to this because the local fishermen are not happy with the pier provided in this area on the west coast of Clare.  They want it raised.</P>
    <P>In Dunbeg, where we have had meetings, we found that an investment of £100,000 is necessary to provide a small harbour.  We agree that all marine development is expensive but this outlay seems to be entirely out of proportion with the accommodation required by the fishermen. I should like to express my concern, on behalf of the fishermen in this area, that before the next budget provision will be made for some development. There is a tradition of fishing in the area.  People who emigrated to earn money have bought pretty expensive boats and without adequate protection in winter for those boats it is disastrous to own them.</P>
    <P>For years An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have been looking after the marketing of our catches very successfully.  We know that recently the price of fish has not been as good as we would have liked it to be.  We would still like to say that Bord Iascaigh Mhara are doing a good job, but I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary, even at this stage, that it would be advisable to renew the campaign we have had in the past to eat more fish.  They have been pretty successful and we could certainly use our schools, vocational, secondary and national in this matter.  They are the right areas in which to lay the groundwork for advising people on this ideal food.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of fishing in respect of which there could possibly be improvement is in relation particularly to the dangers of pollution which have hit the headlines over the past year.  Pollution has not affected the <Col N="108" /> west coast so much, but it has had its effects along the County Cork coast, and it could occur any place. It is vital that there is an adequate protection system where there are faults in harbours, so that you can have a remedy.  Recently, I noticed that a particular petroleum company intended to invest a substantial amount of money in seeing that there is proper protection for the tankers to ensure that spillages will not occur again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil attitude on this matter is that the Bill, as it now stands, proposes that the pay-related benefit for the extended three-month period be reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  During the weekend I discussed the section with my colleagues and we discovered that ten was in fact 25 per cent of 40.  The figure ten is 25 per cent of 40.  What the Coalition intend doing in relation to this section, is to reduce the social welfare pay-related benefit by 25 per cent for the extended three-month period.</P>
      <P>We have no hesitation in stating that this is not a new experience in relation to the Coalition Government.  They reduced entitlements in the past and I am sure this is in the tradition of the reduction of these entitlements.  At the same time, in Opposition, we are charged with the responsibility of being responsible, and we understand that the present economic condition of the country is such that there is very little money stirring, and least of all is it stirring from the coffers of the national Exchequer.  On that basis, we would have been very wary about putting down an amendment which, in the economic condition of the country, would necessitate the Government of the day&mdash;no matter what Government &mdash;paying more money out in the circumstances I have just described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of his introductory speech, the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a very wordy brief it was&mdash; patted around the main issue and pointed out that the Bill he was introducing was a major social advance and a major social thinking.  We pursued the matter and said it was not, that it was a recognition that the employment situation was at probably <Col N="110" /> one of its worst levels since 1942, that in reality, the Bill indicated that the position was going to become worse in relation to the unemployment situation. We asked the Parliamentary Secretary why he was reducing under this section&mdash;section 3 (b), I do not even have to refer to the Bill: it is enshrined in my memory and I hope it will be enshrined in the minds of the Government forever and ever&mdash;of the 1975 Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Bill, the amounts payable to those persons in receipt of social welfare pay-related benefits from 40 per cent to 30 per cent, a 25 per cent reduction.</P>
    <P>We then asked the Parliamentary Secretary why he would not explain why the Government were bringing about this massive reduction in the social welfare pay-related benefit entitlement. Again, we did not receive any answer.  So we pursued it in the normal fashion of any debating chamber and then discovered&mdash;still not committing ourselves as to whether we would vote for or against the section before us at that time&mdash;that the Parliamentary Secretary in fact had £7 million available to him in the social welfare pay-related fund, and regardless of the fact that he had the £7 million available to him, he still intended reducing the amount of the social welfare pay-related benefit in the extended three-month period, from 40 per cent to 30 per cent, which is effectively, mathematically, by any mathematics and by any juxtaposition of figures, a real reduction of 25 per cent.  That is what they are proposing to do in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle, an extremely worthy individual who has, at all times, been very good in Opposition in the context of his dispensation or interpretation of the rules of the House, decided against an amendment proposed by me, that the amount be increased from 30 to 40 per cent to keep it in line with section 4 of the original Bill&mdash;the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act of 1973.  The Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, in section 4 says:</P>
    <P>The weekly rate of pay-related benefit payable to a person at any time shall be an amount equal to <Col N="111" /> forty per cent of the part (if any) of his reckonable weekly earnings for the relevant income tax year that exceeds £14 but does not exceed such limit as stands prescribed for the time being subject to such conditions as may be prescribed to restrict by reference to those earnings the total amount of benefit payable under the Acts to the person in respect of any week.</P>
    <P>As is known, the prescribed amounts now stand at 40 per cent, until the Coalition intended reducing it to 30 per cent.  The reckonable earnings are on the figures of £14 to £50 and as the law stands the reckonable earnings are assessed at 40 per cent.  What is proposed in this Bill is that section 4 of the founding Act relative to social welfare pay-related benefits is intended to be reduced by 25 per cent, from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>We patiently went through our reasons with the Parliamentary Secretary last week as to why we considered that the figure of 30 per cent, as prescribed in the Bill, is open to question.  We asked him to give us a reason why he would not reduce the figure by such an amount.  We gave the reasons why we thought section 4 of the original Act should be continued and the 40 per cent remain.  We stated that after six months on the social welfare pay-related benefit people would be experiencing more hardship and anxiety and, instead of having their entitlements, they should be allowed to continue on consistently with the amount of their original entitlement, namely, 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Apart from any other considerations, with inflation running at something in the region of 25 to 30 per cent, after a six-month period the purchasing power of the pay-related benefit would be reduced by the amount of the inflationary increase.  On the reckoning of exports inflation is now running at 30 per cent.  This means that the purchasing power of whatever pay-related benefits they may be obtaining would in fact, be reduced by 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why we have <Col N="112" /> been querying the Parliamentary Secretary on this and why this side of the House continue to press the Parliamentary Secretary for an adequate answer.  We have discussed it among ourselves over the weekend, inside and outside the House.  Some people mentioned that it happened before in Coalition times.  However, we said we had a responsibility to the nation. Naturally, we want this Government out and we make no bones about that although the Minister for Justice might call us &ldquo;subversives&rdquo;.  That is his latest but that is a matter for himself.  We are a democratically elected party and we want the Government out but we want the county to continue apace so that if and when the next election comes the Fianna Fáil Party will be in a position to at least make something out of the wreckage and recreate.</P>
    <P>The situation is that we have a responsibility in the present economic climate.  We find now that, in fact, the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Minister for Social Welfare, have £7 million available which we did not know about when this Bill was introduced. I would not mind if it was income taxation in the ordinary way but the social welfare pay-related benefit fund, as we understand it, is made up of contributions from workers and employers.  It is a separate fund from that of the accumulation of finance which go into the Exchequer to fund the running of the country.  We understand that there is a kitty of £7 million there. The Parliamentary Secretary has expressed concern and we believe he is a concerned person.</P>
    <P>My amendment has been ruled out of order because of a very hair-line thin technicality.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle is going to hold me up again but I do not like engaging in badinage with him because we have great respect for him.  Nevertheless, it is of concern to us that this amendment was ruled out of order.  I assume the matter cannot be brought into order in the technical sense. However, we believe that this section 4 of the Social Welfare (Pay-Related Benefit) Act, 1973, contains a figure <Col N="113" /> we want contained in this Bill, the figure of 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the position is that the Ceann Comhairle ruled me out of order, and it appears that the amendment proposed by this side of the House is no longer in order.  We consider this to be most unfortunate, not from our own point of view as public representatives but from the point of view of the people affected. If the amendment was acceptable to the House we feel that if it was put to the Government they could not refuse it, particularly with a fund of £7 million available to them.  We are not asking that this money be taken from the Exchequer which obviously is empty anyway.  There is no money left, the cupboard is bare in current political jargon and cliché but it expresses what we feel should be expressed.</P>
    <P>The cupboard is not bare in relation to the social welfare pay-related benefit fund.  Quite the contrary, there is a substantial amount of money available to the Parliamentary Secretary. That fund is made up of moneys paid by employers and employees and the very people who are now out of work, the people who paid into this particular fund, and would be only too delighted to continue to pay into it but cannot because they are unemployed, should be the recipients of some of the moneys.  That does not appear to be in line with Coalition thinking in these circumstances.  We are extremely disappointed about this.  The amendment proposed in my name is apparently out of order on a very meagre and rather mean technicality. However, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had nothing to do with that and we understand that.  I know the Ceann Comhairle had nothing to do with it either.</P>

      <P>I am not going back. Quite the contrary, I do not want to go back on what has already been stated but if there is £7 million available why are the Government not prepared to increase the payments?  The Government are not prepared to face reality; why under present circumstances people have been living for the past six months on social welfare, pay-related benefits and other benefits are not entitled to this.  We want to make it clear that we consider there is a fund available to the Government; we assume there is a fund available to the Government.  They may have spent the money on other areas of national endeavour for all we know.  The Parliamentary Secretary says there are £7 million there.  We have no doubt that the £7 million was collected.  We have no doubt about that and we are not making any case <Col N="115" /> about that.  Having regard to the fact that this is a Bill in terms of disposing of £1.8 million, that leaves a balance of over £5 million.  We assume that that £5 million was specifically in the pay-related benefit fund.  I would appreciate some form of reply from the Parliamentary Secretary in view of our continued requests for his reasoning of the reduction from 40 per cent under section 4 of the 1973 Bill to 30 per cent under this Bill and effectively reducing the amount of social welfare pay-related benefit by 25 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews rightly pointed out, we are against a reduction in social welfare benefits. This section of the Bill is an indication of the socialistic thinking which leaves a lot to be done to update the thinking of some of the people who are implementing the socialist approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must first ask ourselves why the figure of 40 per cent was arrived at.  Was it considered an adequate amount or was it considered too much?  Apparently the Parliamentary Secretary considers the 40 per cent too great a figure.  He now indicates the introduction of a lesser amount for an extended period.  After substantial investigation when it was considered that this particular level was desirable why do the Government now intend to reduce the benefit for an extended period?  It is a serious situation because, when we look at the scheme, we see it is not a question of money.  As Deputy Andrews pointed out the money is available.  It is a question of Government policy in relation to social welfare benefits.  Is this the thin end of the wedge?  Will other social welfare benefits be tapered off in the same manner?  Will we have this reduction in other areas, particularly when finance is available?  In the other areas, where finance was not available, there were prolonged discussions with various Ministers in the putting off from day to day of one decision or another because of lack of finance.  The money is available in this instance.  Therefore, the Parliamentary Secretary must indicate whether he considers 40 per cent was <Col N="116" /> too great an amount for the workers. We feel this is a necessary limit.  As Deputy Andrews pointed out, with the increased cost of living, one would have thought that the whole question would be up-dated.  We thought the workers would be compensated somewhat for the upward spiral in prices and in the cost of living in relation to any benefits that would be introduced in this House.  Rather than there being a reduction, one would have expected an increase on the 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing the Bill, indicated that there will be a reduction.  He must answer why he considers the 40 per cent was too great and why he intends tapering that off to 30 per cent with money in the kitty.  Is it the policy of the Government to reduce all social welfare benefits?  Will this be a precedent allowing the Government to reduce other social welfare benefits?  Any reduction in social welfare benefits at present is completely undesirable.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the vicious increase that has been unloaded on to the unemployed in the not too distant past.  In the last few days here we dealt with such vicious increases.  It is the people who are unable to find employment who have to carry that burden.  It is not their fault that they are unemployed. They are given the additional few days at a reduced rate.  Particularly when there was money in the till one would have thought there should have been an increase rather than a decrease.</P>
    <P>It is a sorry state of affairs that legislation is brought into the House threatening to reduce social welfare benefits.  It is an attack on the social welfare system, an attack to reduce social welfare benefits.  If the money was not available I could understand the Parliamentary Secretary coming into the House and indicating that funds were not available and that there was a limitation on what one could do with the funds that might be available and that for such reasons he would have to pare down to meet the situation.  But that is not the situation at present.  The money is in the till.  The Parliamentary <Col N="117" /> Secretary must clearly state why he and the Government are attempting to attack the social welfare code and reduce benefits.  Is it the thin end of the wedge?  Will it establish a precedent that can be referred to in later discussions?  Will other social welfare benefits be on a sliding scale such as this one?  Is that the idea?  Or is it a way of saying that the workers had too much in 40 per cent?  Those are the questions that should be answered.  Is the Minister of the opinion that the workers had too much in 40 per cent pay-related benefit?  Is he of the opinion that it is a good thing to so reduce the benefits as a matter of policy?  Will this be the approach of the Government to other social welfare benefits?</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the people who are unable to obtain employment will think out this situation in depth when they see the attack being made on the whole social welfare code. It is the first time in this House that I can remember this happening.  I understand that on previous occasions, as Deputy Andrews pointed out, that there was a similar attack made and social welfare benefits were reduced by other Governments.</P>
    <P>We have, once again, the age old attack on the weaker sections of the community.  About the same time it was indicated that it was not the duty of a Government to find work for people.  Now the moneys and benefits existing are not being made available to them.  It is their money by right. Why should the Government hold on to the finances of the workers?  They have put that money there over a period to protect themselves from this type of climate, from an area of full employment to that of unemployment in which one has a variety of commitments to meet.  Was not that the very basis of social welfare benefits &mdash;that one would be able to meet one's commitments even in time of unemployment?  Does the Parliamentary Secretary now think the 40 per cent limit would give the unemployed worker the necessary means of meeting his commitments?  If he believes that, why reduce the standing of the man who is unemployed at present? <Col N="118" /> Or does he feel the unemployed will accept anything the Government offer?  It is their own money and why should they not receive it?  Why should the benefits not be made available across the board, as suggested by Deputy Andrews, or even increased to meet the upward spiral?</P>
    <P>We have reached the stage here where social conscience and social priorities have certainly felt the draught when we see this type of victimisation against unfortunate workers.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary really think that anyone who has the interest of the unemployed at heart would vote for a reduction in their spending power at this particular moment?</P>
    <P>What we want to ensure is that as far as possible the moneys available will ensure that the spending power of the unemployed will be such as will meet their commitments.  We were often told by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Health and Social Welfare about this scheme of pay-related benefit, the wonderful benefits made available to workers. This was a scheme we introduced.  We spelled out all the problems.  We stressed the necessity of ensuring that people would have some comfort during a period of unemployment in knowing their commitments in regard to house purchase and so on could be met as a result of these additions.  Now we are told that it is the Government's policy to reduce social welfare benefits. This is the first occasion on which I have heard a Parliamentary Secretary or, indeed, a Minister come into this House and suggest a reduction in benefits.  The Government ought to be ashamed of themselves at this period with the workers' own money in the till.  They are not asking the Government to give them anything. They are asking only for what they put in to meet this adverse situation. Does the Parliamentary Secretary visualise the unemployment problem continuing for many years to come? Is he making provision by reducing these payments to meet this adverse period?  Will there be a further reduction in the rate as time goes on?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> We want the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate if he thinks the 40 per cent was too great?  If he does not, then there should be an across the board 40 per cent at least.  On the other hand, perhaps he could explain the reason for the reduction if the scheme was designed to meet the present unemployment situation and enable a worker unemployed to meet commitments.  Does he believe now that the worker should be cast aside, that the Government should retain his money while he is unable to meet these commitments because he has this reduction?  That is a very serious situation.  It is an appalling situation to think that any Government would betray the unemployed in this manner when money is available.  It is a betrayal of these people, some of whom have supported them, some of whom believed they were the champions of the workers and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now, with moneys available, they are telling the workers that they cannot have their own money, that the Government are going to keep it.</P>
      <P>We demand equality right across the board of 40 per cent.  Nothing less will be acceptable to us.  As a matter of fact, much more should be given when the money is available.  Because of the present upward spiral in the cost of living the unemployed should get some addition to compensate for these increases.  The average cost to a family of the two increased charges, the ESB and CIE, would be approximately £3.40 per household per week and we are asking the unemployed to bear a substantial portion of this cost. The Government ought to be ashamed of themselves for betraying the workers like this and holding on to their money in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming in at a <Col N="120" /> late stage.  A complaint was made that we were trying to hold up the progress of this Bill through the House. There is nothing further from the truth.  The reason for this somewhat lengthy debate is, of course, well known to everybody in the House.  It took the best part of an hour-and-a-half to get from the Parliamentary Secretary the total amount to the credit of the pay-related benefit fund. Eventually a figure of £7 million was given.  I do not know even at this stage if that figure is correct or not.  I have a feeling that the Parliamentary Secretary should say to us tonight that there is so much money, £X million or whatever it is, in the pay-related benefit fund as of today's date.  However, whether it is £7 million, £6 million or £5 million the position we are in now is that, because we were so anxious to give the Parliamentary Secretary this Bill on the last day it was discussed here, we find ourselves in difficulties where an amendment is concerned.  Had the Bill taken an ordinary course of going through Second Stage, the Committee Stage being left over for a day or two, the impasse in which we find ourselves at the moment would not have arisen. The Chair is correct in ruling, even though it is a very technical point, that an amendment cannot be put down on Committee Stage once the particular section has been put.  That leaves us no alternative and no option but to oppose, and oppose as fully as we can and to the greatest extent possible, this particular section of the Bill amending section 4 of the original Pay-Related Benefit Bill.  This was the section that provided that an unemployed person would be paid 40 per cent of his earnings over and above £14, between £14 and £15 weekly, as pay-related benefit.  This section amends that section and all we can do is opose the section and try to have it withdrawn.  Everybody who is interested in the fate of the unemployed, and I am sure most Deputies are, will support us in trying to get rid of this section.  I should like now to appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to withdraw the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no axe to grind at all.  With <Col N="121" /> genuine sincerity, I think that would be the proper thing to do.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were free to do so, I am sure that is what he would do.  I have a feeling he is up against his colleagues in the Cabinet. This particular Cabinet are in such severe financial difficulties at present they cannot allow the Parliamentary Secretary in charge of social welfare to continue paying this pay-related benefit at 40 per cent.  As somebody said, it is the employees' own money. It is the money of the unemployed and of their colleagues who are lucky enough to be employed.  If that is exactly the position the employee pays three pence per week on his total income, wages, salary, call it what you like.  On paper the employer is supposed to pay two pence.  As the Parliamentary Secretary and everybody else knows, every penny paid out by an employer, whether an industrialist, a businessman or a farmer is earned by the workers. That is where it comes from.</P>
    <P>The three pence per week per pound paid by workers comes from the workers' own pockets and seeing that there is £7 million to credit in the fund&mdash;at least that is what we believe from what the Parliamentary Secretary told us the last night&mdash;I feel this is not the time to reduce the payment from 40 to 30 per cent.  It is the workers' own money and it should as long as the fund is in credit&mdash; certainly it seems to be very much in credit at the moment&mdash;be paid out to the workers who are unfortunate enough to become unemployed.  If we follow the reasoning of the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, then the fund has increased over the past three or four months despite the fact that unemployment has been at or above the 100,000 level for all that period.</P>
    <P>If the fund increases when there is massive unemployment, it can be accepted that it will continue to remain in credit.  If it has increased, as the Parliamentary Secretary seems to admit, by over £2 million in the past three or four months, then in view of the circumstances I think it can be accepted that the fund will remain very much in credit for a <Col N="122" /> long period.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to do the right thing on this occasion and give to the unemployed what they are entitled to and have paid for.  It is their money.  I feel the Parliamentary Secretary will do the right thing by them. He has been very outspoken with certain people who made statements in the Press that the unemployed were drawing too much and so on.  I agree fully with him.  Here he has the opportunity to see that the unemployed will continue to draw something near to what they were getting while employed. I, therefore, appeal to him to withdraw this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be no other speakers interested in this legislation either by way of attendance or contribution.  I was glad to hear Deputy Browne outline in great detail the sequence of events which led to certain allegations being made by the Parliamentary Secretary in this House last week in relation to this Bill.</P>
      <P>First of all, to put the record straight, this measure was obviously expedited as the result of a question by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on social welfare, Deputy Andrews, the week before its introduction.  But for that question this Bill would obviously have been hatched longer in the Department of Social Welfare.  It was clear to many people for a long time that the measure was necessary.  We accepted the Bill last week and supported it.  We are now dealing with section 3.  It is hard to understand the Parliamentary Secretary's or his Minister's thinking on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have legislation originally introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government. A figure of 40 per cent was set. The Parliamentary Secretary has seen fit to reduce this to 30 per cent.  One would not only have expected him for many reasons to keep the figure at 40 per cent but, in fact, to increase it. He will probably smile and ask: &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; It is obvious to anyone why he should have kept it at a minimum of 40 per cent.  We are given to understand that inflation is running at the rate of 25 to 30 per cent per annum, completely uncontrolled by the Government. <Col N="123" /> If that be so, coupled with the fact that we are talking about a basic wage almost two years old on which the pay-related benefit is assessed, it is very hard to understand a member of the Labour Party, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, introducing this measure and reducing the contribution going into the unemployed person's household.</P>
    <P>If the fund was not adequately financed, that might be one of the reasons why the Parliamentary Secretary decided to go light on that aspect of it, but we are told that the financial backing of the fund is more than adequate.  When a new fund is established it is very understandable that on one side or the other there is a question of targets not being in accordance with what was budgeted for. The Parliamentary Secretary seemed utterly confused last week as to what the figure was, but we have reason to understand that there is approximately £7 million in the fund.  There should be £7 million&mdash;perhaps, this is the kernel of the problem&mdash;in the fund if some of his colleagues have not already pilfered it.  Maybe the Minister for Finance has pilfered some of the fund to use elsewhere.  We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that this Bill will cost £1.8 million. On that calculation, I assume that it will be only £.6 million extra if the 40 per cent is allowed stand.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne made the case that the fund was growing, that this was the employees' own money and their colleagues' money.  All we are asking the Parliamentary Secretary to do is to go ahead with his extension of the period but to make sure that the pay-related benefit is paid at a similar rate to what was the practice in the first six months of unemployment.  One would have thought that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he wanted to cheesepare or cut back, would have thought of the few points I have made here.  It is also interesting that he did not look at the £14 and perhaps reduce it a little in order to help to meet the inflation in the intervening period.  This he did not do.  I appreciate <Col N="124" /> the Parliamentary Secretary's interest in the weaker sections of our community.  I think it is a genuine one.  I have no doubt that he fought at Cabinet level and that he abhors this particular section just as much as we do but he has been told by his colleagues that they are only giving him this as a concession because they have used the funds in other Departments and probably are cushioning themselves for the obvious trouble that is presently within the Cabinet which may precipitate a general election.  This is obviously one of the reasons why he has been let off with this.  As I said earlier it would probably have been flying around the place for a much longer period but for the question posed by Deputy Andrews on the Thursday before it was introduced.  This obviously expedited the circulation of this Bill.  The 10 per cent cut-back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is obviously a situation that has arisen in a Government that have run out of finance. If the Parliamentary Secretary's figures are correct out of a huge fund of approximately £7 million surplus this £.6 million of the employees' own money is being refused by a Labour Member of this Government to the people that he and his colleagues at one time purported to represent in this House.  It is a hard situation to accept.  One would have thought that some of his colleagues would have been in here and not paying lip service to the plight of the unemployed <Col N="125" /> people.  We have pointed out that other measures could have been taken to ensure that people would be kept at work.  This Bill is being introduced, and we welcome it, but we certainly do not agree with the cut-back on the rate of pay-related benefit even in the short term.  If there is any suggestion at this stage that it may be more long-term then I think this Parliamentary Secretary has been sent in by his Government as the spearhead of an attack on the weaker sections of our community.  The figures on unemployment are relevant to the introduction of this Bill and this section of the Bill.  The figures have been frightening us.  They have been frightening us for a long time now. Section 3 refers to the cut-back of 25 per cent in the pay-related benefits being paid out to the 103,500 unemployed at the present time.  No measures were taken by the Government to correct the situation.  In fact no measures are being taken to correct a worsening situation.  The Government are taking £.6 million of the money that belongs to the working people, to the people who are at present working and their colleagues who are unfortunate enough, because of mismanagement by this Government, to be now unemployed.  The Government are now denying them that miserable £.6 million of their own money out of a fund which the Parliamentary Secretary believes to be in the region of £7 million.  I fully support our spokesman in opposing this section of the Bill.  We want the section as introduced by Fianna Fáil giving people 40 per cent at a time when they are far more in need of it than at the beginning of their unemployment period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>One must associate the action of the Government in this Bill with two other recent happenings. One is the Taoiseach's speech a week or so ago on saving the economy.  He warned the country of dire happenings if certain changes were not made. He was not all that explicit or specific but one got the message that something is looming.  Then we had the Minister for Labour who came along with a very gloomy speech and <Col N="126" /> warned again about what might happen. We may ask the Parliamentary Secretary in all seriousness whether he has heard anything about these things, because in this Bill we find a cut-back.  No matter how it is dressed up in the phraseology of the Bill the stark fact remains that there is a cut-back. The Parliamentary Secretary in his brief says very nicely that the extension of this scheme will mean an addition of up to £10.80 a week in unemployment benefit during the extended period, that a worker who is either ill or unemployed can look forward to a much higher payment. One can readily appreciate the way the Government because of the state of the economy must try to save in every possible way.  One can certainly not applaud them for choosing this Bill to be the beginning of the road on the way to the hairshirt policy which is to replace the distribution of the largesse from the Government with which, when they started off, they were so prodigal in every way and now they have to pay for it.  In the world in which we live there are a great many problems and they have to be faced.  I do not think the Government should pick out the weakest section of all in order to point the way to what is going to happen and apply this 10 per cent cut-back&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate it is 25 per cent but so that I cannot be accused of being biased I am using the wording which is here.  I accept Deputy Collins's figure but I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that even if it is only a 10 per cent cut-back it is wrong.  If there is to be a policy of retrenchment and hairshirt living the Government should admit their mistakes, come in a contrite spirit and say to the people: &ldquo;Our policy has failed, we are sorry; our economists advised us wrongly; the economy is in trouble.&rdquo;  The people, will not welcome these words, but at least they say: &ldquo;Do not start cribbing at the weaker section of the community.  Take some of the fat cash from those who can afford it but <Col N="127" /> do not pick the man or the woman who is drawing pay-related benefit.&rdquo; The Bill was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government and provision was made for extension.  As I said last week, if Fianna Fáil were in power I doubt if this extension would be necessary.  We would have handled the economic problems in a much better way.  I support Deputy Seán Browne in asking that this section be repealed.  If the Government must economise they should do so at the expense of some other section that can bear it better than the sick and the unemployed.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary clarify the effect of that?  On the face of it it would appear the effect is that anybody who commences receiving pay-related benefit after the passing of this Act will be confined to the 40 per cent, not merely those who are on the extended period.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify that and, if what I suggest is wrong, would he explain why?</P>

      <P>This is an increase of £10.80 per week.  This is the effect of the Bill and this is what the people who will benefit by the passing of the Bill will enjoy and will recognise.  The co-ordinated distortion, the co-ordinated attempt to say that we are reducing the benefits payable under the social welfare schemes, the use of such phrases as: &ldquo;This is the thin edge of the wedge, this is now the policy of the Government&rdquo; is childish.  It is worse than childish.  Although they do not realise it, they are insulting the intelligence of the ordinary people.</P>

This is not beneficial to the House, and quite seriously, I do not think it is beneficial to the Fianna Fáil Party. If Deputies really sat down and thought about it, they would be capable occasionally of coming up with some constructive contribution on a Bill or measure before this House.  I honestly believe that they are capable of that, if they would only sit down and give a little thought to it, instead of trying to confuse the people.  They know what it is about. They have to know what it is all about.</P>

They did not pay out a halfpenny under the Bill and they did not fix the regulations. In reply to issues raised during the past hour there is no doubt that 40 per cent would never have been paid but for the change of Government. Deputy Meaney, who was very outspoken, was far more honest in his contribution than many other Deputies, who had not got the political guts to say what they thought, who ran a little bit in this direction, got politically frightened, and then ran back and went in that direction. We have seen this, not only in relation to this Bill, but in relation to capital gains and wealth tax.</P>

      <P>Under another Bill, the social welfare unemployment and disability benefits are paid for a 12-month period at flat rate.  The logic of this would appear to be that Fianna Fáil do not mind if a man is 12 months unemployed or sick as long as he only has flat rate but if for three-quarters of that period, nine months of that period, he is able to get pay-related benefit then they have some objection.  I do not understand the logic of that.

The objection only comes when there is eligibility for nine months out of the 12 months at pay-related benefit.

This is a different tune to the one we heard last week from Fianna Fáil speakers; very different.  We here have responsibility for administering the pay-related scheme.  We have responsibility for ensuring that people who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed or ill for prolonged periods are cushioned against the worst economic repercussions of that.  We intend to live up to that responsibility and we are doing it in this Bill.  It will be recognised by those people who will benefit by the <Col N="139" /> provisions of this Bill which give an increase of up to £10.80 per week, extends the period of eligibility by 50 per cent, a further three months.

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I want to make is in the nature of a point of order, if I may with respect, Sir.  Perhaps I may request that care is taken that we have absolutely every word of what the Parliamentary Secretary said recorded, not sub-edited. It is an important precedent for the working of the House.  I make that as a point of order for reasons I hope to develop on another occasion.  This section is very simple.  In a political effort the Parliamentary Secretary will not admit one simple fact and say it straight which would have disposed of this debate on this section.  What is involved in this section is this: there is 40 per cent being given for a period; there is an extended period after that. The Parliamentary Secretary, of course, wants to get credit for that extended period and we will give him credit for it.  But, for the extended period&mdash;and this is what he jibs at and will not say&mdash;for the extended period the amount is being reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  That is the kernel.  We are anxious to give him credit for what is done.  But it is a legitimate question from the Opposition to ask why, in giving the extended period, it is necessary to reduce the figure from 40 per cent to 30 per cent for that extended period. There can be two reasons for doing that.  One could be a policy reason. If it is, it should be so stated.  The other could be a financial reason.  If it is, then the financial situation should be laid before the House in order that we can make an intelligent assessment of it.  Therefore, what I am putting to the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="142" /> is this: we accept what he has said as far as he has gone, that is, apart from all the statements that have no reference to the section; we accept that the first period is at 40 per cent; that there is an extended period, for which we give him full credit, but it is a legitimate, clear and simple question to ask him why is it necessary to reduce the payment over the extended period to 30 per cent?</P>
      <P>At the risk of repetition, I say that this can be for one of two reasons as far as we can see.  Either there is a policy reason, and there can be&mdash;I can think of a number of reasons&mdash; but if that is the reason let the Parliamentary Secretary state it and we can debate that.  If it is not a policy reason, the only other reason I think of is that it is a financial reason and, if it is, we should be able equally to debate that.  I intervened here because I happen to have some responsibility in this regard.  We want to know what the financial position is.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House, like the Parliamentary Secretary did, but I want to know what the financial position is.  What funds are there? We had a great deal of discussion the last night about how many millions there were and we were referred to the Book of Estimates, I tried to dig out the figures from that but one could not get a clear picture.  Deputy Colley pointed out the fallacy in the statements the Parliamentary Secretary made in regard to the Book of Estimates and finally, we finished up with a figure of £7 million.  We still do not know what funds are available. How can anyone intelligently judge whether the Parliamentary Secretary's section is right or whether Deputy Andrews' amendment is right if we do not have the facts and the numerical information to arrive at an intelligent judgment?  That is my submission. I am purposely avoiding anything very controversial but it is impossible to get the information from the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is the kernel of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking for myself, I freely give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for extending the period.  The only thing I regret, as he regrets it, is that the <Col N="143" /> unemployment situation makes this necessary.  The implication in this section is that that situation is expected to continue.  I would be out of order were I to pursue the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks on our record, or anything else, because we are dealing here with a problem and with a figure of 103,000 unemployed and this section does not envisage an improvement in that position.  We should ask ourselves what should be done in this situation but it will be another day's work to deal with the problem of unemployment.  The situation, being as bad as it is, we should have the information to deal with the matter intelligently.  Here the Parliamentary Secretary is extending the period but we are giving only 30 per cent as against 40 per cent for the extended period.  He has consistently jibbed at that point in all his repetitions and that is one of the reasons why I asked to have this on the record, unedited of course.  Why can we not have the figures?  If it is a policy reason, that is different but let us have that and we will discuss it.  If it is a financial reason, why can we not have the figures?</P>
    <P>A suggestion has been made.  Deputies in Opposition will make suggestions about possibilities because that is what an Opposition is for.  If funds have, so to speak, been transferred from one source to another&mdash;I am not going to go into all the points made about who paid the money or whether they were contributory or State funds&mdash;or if funds are being adjusted, and I am here purposely avoiding using provocative words or words that could be misinterpreted&mdash;these funds which Deputy Andrews and others mentioned&mdash;then that also is a matter for the House and the House should be told.  I have heard it suggested that possibly the Parliamentary Secretary's dilemma is caused by the fact that it is not so much that the funds are not available but that only a certain amount of funds are being made available to him for this purpose.  If that is so, why can we not be told?</P>
    <P>The net point is that there is a reduction to 30 per cent on the extended <Col N="144" /> period and we have no statement or coherent reasons given by the Parliamentary Secretary to enable us to have a coherent debate and, if the debate has become disordered, as it has, this is the reason why.  Is it asking too much to ask for the reasons for this so that one can debate the section on its merits as is normally done on Committee Stage?  We have had more of a Second Stage debate on this.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the Public Accounts Committee. It is interesting that he raises it.  I would like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that the arrears have been caught up on in the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;it will take the year, of course, before the accounts come up unless there are deliberate delays in publishing the Appropriation Accounts for this year and when these accounts are being examined it will be interesting for members of that committee to note that here is something calling for a very thorough investigation of the social insurance fund.  The Parliamentary Secretary should not be too sure that it is not a matter for the Public Accounts Committee.  I may not be on that committee when the time comes but I would like to recommend to the particular committee that will be there that the Parliamentary Secretary's Estimate, the expenditure under this Bill and all the financial matters that have come up in this debate, should be very thoroughly gone into by the Public Accounts Committee at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>I really do not.  I think it was something that should not have been said by a man holding the position of chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. Whether the accounts of the Department of Social Welfare come before that committee tonight, tomorrow or next year there is no fear that I will not be able fully to account for them. I regret that this has not always been the position regarding accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed this section at very considerable length.  The Opposition <Col N="146" /> seem to feel, because they have no responsibility, that they can suggest all sorts of improvements in schemes without having any regard for the possible effect this might have on the viability of a particular scheme.  We feel that this scheme, as outlined in this section of the Bill, is undoubtedly an extension of the social welfare system, that it will bring very considerable benefits to the people who are in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit.  We feel that it will be clearly recognised as not only a progressive measure but one that is taken with a sense of responsibility for the administration of this fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer back briefly to the discussion which took place on the introduction of the present scheme, which was based on a Fianna Fáil Act.  I might add, in relation to that Act, that it was stated by the then Minister for Social Welfare that the terms of the Act would be brought into operation in April, 1974.  It was necessary to have the matter properly examined before it was possible to bring it in and, therefore, any suggestion that the introduction of the terms of the Act were delayed by this party is untrue.  As I said, we find in the debate on the original Bill that the Minister stated that the time for the introduction of <Col N="147" /> the terms of the Act would be April, 1974.  It happened that when April, 1974 came the Coalition Government were in office rather than Fianna Fáil.  They simply brought into operation the terms of a Bill which was brought through both Houses of the Oireachtas by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>However, on the debate in relation to the introduction of the scheme, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary at that time what he estimated would be the total intake from the contributions from both the employer and the employee.  He informed me at the time that it would be about £12 million per annum.  I asked what would the outgoings be and he said that they had estimated these at about £10 million per annum.  I queried the need for the extra £2 million and I was told that as this was a new scheme it was not possible to have very definite information in relation to the income and the outgoings and that, therefore, it was advisable to estimate a higher level of income than outgoings. I accepted this as being reasonable enough at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time in January of this year I asked a question as to what the income from the contributions was and what the outgoings were.  I was informed that the income was approximately £8 million and that the outgoings, which included the administration expenses, was something less than £3 million.  I thought that £5 million of a surplus was hardly justified. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he intended either reducing the level of the contributions from the employer and the employee or increasing the benefits.  He told me that nine months was too short a time to consider properly the operation of the Act and that he would need at least 12 months and at the end of that time this whole matter would be reviewed. Part of the reason why I regarded the surplus as being exceptionally high was because at the time unemployment was at a very high level and if, as I felt, the surplus was roughly £5 million at a time when unemployment was at a high level, <Col N="148" /> then quite obviously at a time when it was at a reasonable level the scheme would be a bonanza in so far as the Government were concerned. However, I accepted that we could wait until the end of the 12 months so that the Parliamentary Secretary could review the whole scheme and see how he could relate the contributions to the outgoings in a more reasonable way.</P>
    <P>I suppose, as a result of this review, he decided that he would bring this Bill before the House.  It is reasonable to query again the extent to which the income is greater than the outgoings. He informed us when introducing the Bill that the cost of the extension for three months would be approximately £1.8 million.  After quite a considerable effort on our part we found that at present the surplus of income over expenditure at the moment is about £7 million.  If the cost of the extension of three months is £1.8 million, this still leaves a surplus of £5.2 million in the fund.</P>
    <P>At a time when unemployment is at such an exceptionally high level there is this large surplus in the fund and we are questioning the reduction of the benefit from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  It is reasonable that the Opposition should query this matter.  We are not asking the Government or the Exchequer to contribute that extra 10 per cent.  We are simply asking that the money in the fund at present, and which was contributed by the employers and the employees, with no contribution from the State, should be disbursed now at a time when prices are rising so rapidly.  It should be given to those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed or to be ill. This money does not belong to the State; it is money which belongs to the people who contributed it.</P>
    <P>We are making a very reasonable request.  It is that the 40 per cent level should be available not only to those who are unemployed or ill for the first six months but also to those who will get the benefit of the extended period of three months.  We accept it is a worthwhile thing and a good thing that the scheme should be extended for this extra three months.  At the <Col N="149" /> same time, we regret the reason for its necessity.  Basically, the reason is the exceptionally high level of unemployment which appears to be still on the increase.  What we would have liked to have seen here, and I am sure what those who are unemployed would have liked to have seen, would be a Bill or a number of Bills which would provide more employment for those unfortunate enough to be unemployed at present.  The vast majority of those who are unemployed, while naturally enough they welcome any extension of their benefits while they are unemployed, are not anxious to be unemployed.  Most of them are anxious to have jobs.  As things are at present, with frightening inflation, with the Government making no effort whatsoever to curb inflation, inflation which is depressing our markets, and unless the Government do something about it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It will continue to increase the number of unemployed, quite obviously there is a need for this extension of the pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>As I said in my Second Reading speech, I am afraid we are reaching the stage where we will need&mdash; whether we call it pay-related benefit or not&mdash;quite a considerable increase in social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the point I was making: the money which is in this fund belongs to those who contributed. We are not asking the Government to make extra money available but simply that they should make available the money in this fund which, as I say, was contributed by both employers and employees to help the employees when they became ill or became unemployed, that the Government should make at least part of this money available by increasing the percentage to the level which is available for the six months period, that is, 40 per cent.  As other members of the Opposition pointed out, this is a reasonable request.  It is vitally necessary that we do everything we can to help out those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed <Col N="150" /> or ill.  I would point out that the Parliamentary Secretary has not at any time answered the point put forward by this side of the House in relation to this matter.  He has not explained why the amount available was reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  He cannot argue that the money is not available because from the figures we managed to extract from him it is clear that the money is there.  He cannot argue that prices are being controlled and that there is no need for this extra 10 per cent.  As Deputy Andrews pointed out, there has been a 25 per cent increase in prices.  If we got a reasonable answer from the Parliamentary Secretary this debate could have concluded some time ago.  Unfortunately, we have not been able to get this information, so we are justified in coming to the conclusion that the £5 million which is supposed to be in the fund has, quite possibly, been used up elsewhere.  We have not been told that.  We have not been told why this extra money is not being made available. We have not heard any arguments as to the reasons why the figure has been reduced from 40 per cent to 30 per cent.  We again request the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider this matter and make available the extra 10 per cent.  If he were to do this he would be doing a very worthwhile job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we conclude &mdash;unless the Parliamentary Secretary has anything more to say&mdash;I wish to say that this debate was distinguished by a number of matters, mainly the absence of Government contributors to the debate and the lack of attendance of any reasonable number of Government Deputies in the Dáil Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, who was replying on behalf of the Government, did not face up to the very reasonable questions put to him by the Opposition.  We were asking the Parliamentary Secretary to justify to us&mdash;it is a normal, democratic type of question and one would expect a normal answer&mdash;the reduction from 40 to 30 per cent of the extended <Col N="151" /> three-months' period.  Even at this late stage, we would ask him to tell us why he is doing it because, as Deputy Faulkner and indeed I, have said on numerous occasions there was a £7 million social welfare pay-related fund available.  It is utterly incomprehensible to listen to the reasons the Parliamentary Secretary has been putting forward.  At the same time he does not deal with the specific point about the reduction of the figure by 25 per cent.  We have been here from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday last and now we are here again until 9.45 p.m. still trying to get the information from the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Parliamentary Secretary is suggesting that, in some way, the Opposition are holding this matter up.  That is not true; the Opposition are not holding up the Bill or in any way obstructing its passage.  The Opposition are entitled to reasonable answers to reasonable questions.  The reasonable question in particular relates to the reduction in the figures on the extended three-month period.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not the good grace, even at this late stage, to answer that question and he states that we are obstructing this Bill. Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Parliamentary Secretary might equally suggest that in some way we are interfering with the entitlement of individuals because this Bill is not being given a sufficiently quick passage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> Our next amendment takes care of that suggestion in the sense that we have put a retrospective element into the proposed amendment, the amendment which the Chair has seen fit to allow stand.  However, it seems to be futile to continue the debate.  We have done our best in the reasonable time we have taken with reasonable debate from this side of the House.  That is not to suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary has not introduced an air of reasonableness at times.  Certainly, he has, but he has not given a reasonable answer to the reasonable question from the Opposition in regard to the 25 per cent reduction in the extended three-month period.  Certainly, he has said that he has increased the eligibility by about 50 per cent.  Of course, three months is 50 per cent of six months, but it is merely a piece of figure juggling which does not bear examination.  The reality of the position is that the three months may be a pay-related benefit period before it extends the period for another three months.  The Parliamentary Secretary must remember that Fianna Fáil introduced the original pay-related benefit in 1973 as an insurance.  The reason this Bill is being introduced is because of the very, very bad unemployment situation.  If, as the Parliamentary Secretary says, this is an extension of the Government social welfare programme, God help them and God save Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where incapacity for work or unemployment is continuous a person shall be retrospectively entitled to pay-related benefit from the end of the 159 days up to the commencement of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment on the basis of what the Parliamentary Secretary said in relation to the Opposition.  On Wednesday the Parliamentary Secretary stated that the Opposition in some way were attempting to obstruct this Bill.  The amendment was really put down arising out of the suggestion at column 2014 of the Official Report of 14th May, 1975.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: If this Bill is not passed tonight&mdash;it has to go to the Seanad&mdash;the only people who will suffer are the people we heard Fianna Fáil express concern about.</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: Why not put in a retrospective clause?</P>
      <P>Mr. Cluskey: This is a relatively small Bill with five sections, one of which would appear to be contentious. I do not believe it actually is, but if Fianna Fáil want to give that impression, fair enough, let them give it.  It has been debated at considerable length.  If they want to challenge it, they should challenge it and have a vote.  I do not object to that.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary then stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> They should be honourable about it.  If they want to oppose the passage of the Bill they should do so honourably.  They know what the consequences are of delaying the passage of this Bill.  They know who will pay the price if it is delayed, the recipients.</P>
    <P>Now I do not pretend to be a draftsman.  This amendment in my name may have all the defects of the neophyte draftsman and a beginner in the particular context of tabling amendments to Bills.  It may be loosely worded or it may have other defects which are not apparent to me, arising out of my inexperience in matters of this kind.  However, the intention is there, as expressed by the Opposition when they were speaking on Wednesday night last.  The suggestion made by the Parliamentary Secretary is that if the Opposition continued to express a point of view on the Bill, those people who would be the direct beneficiaries as a result of the passing would be in some way hurt.  Then the Parliamentary Secretary should have brought the Bill in sooner, and he would have got it through quicker.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary to us on this side of the House that the Bill suddenly emerged, arising out of a Parliamentary Question by me on Thursday week last.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question asking if it was the intention of the Government to extend the pay-related benefits.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave a very curt answer, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The following day, with all the attendant bruhaha and publicity which this Government are notorious for, the Government Information Service got to work and produced a Bill.  It appeared in various news items on radio and television and in the daily newspapers, as if it had not been mentioned in the Dáil on the previous day, as if it was new news.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary produced that Bill as a direct result of my question&mdash;no doubt they had the Bill already in stock and had it ready to bring to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just trying to explain the reason for the amendment. If the Parliamentary Secretary is sincere in what he says about the urgency of this Bill, he should have brought it in sooner.  The Opposition would not then have to be giving retrospective effect to it.  However, it is not my intention to hold up the Bill or to have it said that we are in any way obstructing its passage.  The Parliamentary Secretary can accept the amendment or, alternatively, he can reject it.  If he rejects it, he can explain why he is so doing.</P>
      <P>I should also like to add that effectively what I was very concerned about was the amount in the amendment which was disallowed and apparently properly so, according to my respected colleague, Deputy Browne&mdash;having regard to the Rules of Order of the House.  The amendment before us now was, more or less, dependent on whether the Parliamentary Secretary would accept the amendment which was disallowed in seeking an increase from 30 per cent to 40 per cent at section 3 (b) of the Bill.  I should like to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say regarding the amendment before him.  Indeed, he might have nothing to say: he might find it totally unacceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>To be quite honest, I am somewhat amazed to hear Deputy Andrews describe the way the Bill came into being.  I accept the point that in Opposition it is difficult to frame amendments; I accept that fully.  Indeed, having spent a considerable number of years in Opposition, I do appreciate it and genuinely sympathise with Deputies who are faced on some occasions with particularly complicated Bills, where they have to frame amendments in somewhat legalistic language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other tactless statement expressed by Deputy Andrews I find somewhat extraordinary.  Deputy Andrews was an office holder in the previous administration, and to <Col N="157" /> suggest that a parliamentary question&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the interests of fair debate, on a point of order, it is an utter piece of grotesqueness to suggest that I made that point.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I suggested that as a result of my parliamentary question a Bill which was on the stocks had suddenly emerged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a previous officeholder, the Deputy knows that there is a very strict procedure that takes a considerable length of time before a Bill reaches the point of circulation. Regarding the amendment, I did say last week&mdash;the Deputy quoted me&mdash; that delay in passing this Bill could result in depriving some beneficiaries from enjoying its terms.  That is true of any legislation.  There is no legislation that at the time of its coming into operation did not deprive somebody, who had they come in a week, a month or a year earlier, would have benefited.  However, in this Bill&mdash; Deputies can examine it and I am sure have done so&mdash;we have made arrangements for a transitional period.  Under its terms, anyone who is at present unemployed or ill, and who has exhausted his eligibility for pay-related benefit in a six-month period, but who is still drawing a flat rate benefit under the 12-months stipulation, will be enabled to come back under the provisions of this new Bill, so I am glad to say that the effects of the delay in the passage of this Bill have been minimised to a very great extent by this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is true that if there was to be a continued attempt to delay the passage of the Bill, some people would <Col N="158" /> undoubtedly be affected.  The Bill in its provisions ensures that any person who is unemployed or ill, and who has exhausted his eligibility for six months, who is still eligible to draw unemployment benefit under the 12-months stipulation, can, in fact, come back in under pay-related benefit for a period altogether not exceeding 315 days. There is no need for retrospection in this Bill because of this provision but there still is a need for a sense of urgency in the passing of it.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that the Parliamentary Secretary is still on this question of the delaying of this Bill.

We were and we would have finished it last Thursday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the change of attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary and the change in his argument because in the discussion on the previous night he charged us with deliberately holding up the Bill.  He stated that this would have very serious consequences for those who would be entitled to benefit under the Bill. Tonight he has changed that to pointing out that, apart from, perhaps, a very small number, nobody will be affected but even if a small number will be affected this problem can be overcome by the acceptance of our amendment which is very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that we were holding up the Bill on the last occasion, his reference was to the discussion on section 3.  The Opposition legitimately carried on a discussion over a period because the matter concerned was of considerable importance.  I am not <Col N="159" /> going to go back over that debate but the difference to those who will be in receipt of benefit under this Bill is considerable. We felt that the change should be made because the money available in the fund was contributed by the employer and the employee.</P>
    <P>We did not want to hold up the Bill but we wanted to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government the need to make the best arrangements for those who will benefit under the Bill.  Even if a small number of people will lose out because the Bill has not passed through this House Deputy Andrews' amendment would overcome the difficulties and the problem the Parliamentary Secretary expressed concern about the last day.  If the Parliamentary Secretary feels that the amendment is too wide-ranging&mdash;Deputy Andrews said he does not purport to be a parliamentary draftsman&mdash;perhaps he will agree to amend the Bill in the Seanad.  If anybody may lose out in justice something should be done for him but, at the same time, we were entitled to discuss at length section 3 which is a section of vital importance.</P>

      <P>This is a technical matter which the Department should look at but, nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary has the opportunity of redrafting.  The fact that this is a provision to provide for retrospection only gives him all the more opportunity for perfecting this Bill.  I should like to reinforce the suggestion from this side of the House that the Parliamentary Secretary accept this amendment in principle. Naturally, it should be adjusted to fit into the technical context of the Bill. I am taken a little bit aback because I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to make a great point about the delaying of the Bill last Wednesday but I may have misunderstood him as I was not paying much attention to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether or not a retrospective provision of this nature can hardly do any great harm and, if as the Parliamentary Secretary said that only relatively few people will be affected, it cannot involve much expense <Col N="160" /> either.  The Parliamentary Secretary, when Deputy Browne mentioned the circumstances of offering to take this Bill last Thursday, said that we should realise that changes in the Order of Business could not be done quickly.  I have just heard of a change in the Order of Business for tomorrow. I understand that what was ordered for tomorrow has now been changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the point.  The point I was making was that this Bill was in the House at 10.30 on Wednesday morning and it went through the day, with the exception of an hour for Question Time and one-and-a-half hours for Private Members' Business, and the difficulty to which Deputy Browne referred only arose after 10 o'clock on Wednesday night. There was a clear policy of obstruction of the passage of this Bill by Fianna Fáil Fáil right through Wednesday.</P>

      <P>I object to this.  Is there any reason why the Opposition should put up with this sort of abuse? Is there any way the Government can hope to receive co-operation from the Opposition if they are abused on a minute-by-minute basis?  We are not obstructing the Bill.</P>

      <P>I was in possession but I gave way to the Parliamentary Secretary to make his point. I merely point out that the Order of Business can be changed here today. Let us get to the bones of this.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept the spirit of this amendment and adjust it in the Seanad, if necessary, as Deputy Faulkner suggested?  That is a very reasonable thing to do.  It is something we should do and we are entitled to urge this on the Parliamentary Secretary taking into account allowances for the technicalities involved. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the spirit of the amendment, make the adjustment and if there is a time factor involved he has the other House in which to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to quote from column 2014 of the Official Report of 14th May, 1975, where Deputy Cluskey said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> I made a mistake.  I corrected it.  I apologised to the House.  Now that it is being used against me.  If those are the tactics Fianna Fáil want to employ, fair enough.  I have no objection if they want to employ those tactics.  If they want to oppose the Bill, they should do so honourably and openly.  There is no retrospection in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We pressed the Parliamentary Secretary on that point on the last occasion this Bill was before the House and we were informed that there was no retrospection in the Bill.  I had my suspicions, having regard to my experience that there was in fact a retrospective element in this section. Now we discover that the Parliamentary Secretary states that the effect of section 4 will be, to use and quote his own words, to &ldquo;minimise to a very great extent&rdquo; the position that we wish abolished altogether.  We do not want any individual or group of individuals to suffer because this Bill has not gone through the House as expeditiously as was anticipated by the Government Parties.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the amendment.  In the drafting of it I was humble enough to mention, in the first instance, that I may have some doubts about the purity of the drafting and the legislative worth of the draft, if uplifted and presented in the Bill. But nobody has challenged the actual drafting itself so after all the drafting may be quite good, may be technically pure and have no defects.  Consequently, there is no reason why my draft should not stand.  However, between now and tomorrow the Parliamentary Secretary may get some additional information which may not be available to him at the moment.  That is fair enough.  But, in the meantime, we should give the Parliamentary Secretary sufficient time to mull over the Fianna Fáil amendment.  By way of support of what Deputy Faulkner said, and indeed as was suggested by Deputy Browne in the first instance, the Parliamentary Secretary should accept the spirit of the amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;and I say this with great respect&mdash;might <Col N="162" /> agree to accept the spirit of the amendment, even in the Seanad.  It is a reasonable amendment.  In addition, the Parliamentary Secretary might tell us how many people&mdash;by virtue of his non-acceptance of our amendment&mdash; will suffer hardship as a result of the length of time this debate has taken. There is no evidence of how many people will suffer as a result of the Parliamentary Secretary's charges against the Opposition.  His charge is that the Opposition are, in some way, obstructing the Bill.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  If he thinks we are obstructing it, our amendment will take care of that problem.  It is a very clear amendment. It provides for retrospection from the commencement of the Bill with which we are dealing.  It brings in those people who, on the Parliamentary Secretary's own words, may be outside the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We would be very anxious to help the Parliamentary Secretary if he could undertake or give some sort of smoke signal to the Opposition that he would be prepared to consider the matter in the Seanad.  We would place an amendment in the Seanad in whatever terms the Parliamentary Secretary would wish, or he could bring in his own amendment, as the case may be.  We would be only too glad to cooperate with him in that respect.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say it is a reasonable amendment.  It takes care of the very problem which the Parliamentary Secretary envisages as of 10.15 this evening.  His attitude may change tomorrow and he may have a different interpretation of the section.  He may come into the House and say effectively the section covers all sections of the community and nobody is excluded from the effects of the section. If the Parliamentary Secretary states that, that nobody will suffer hardship as a direct result of the section, as it now stands, I will undertake to withdraw my amendment and accept his word.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 21st May, 1975.</P>
