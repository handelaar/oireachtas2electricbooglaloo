    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The application of Dublin Corporation to borrow such amounts as might be required by them, up to a maximum of £2.5 million, by means of temporary overdraft <Col N="502" /> during the six months up to 31st December next, was sanctioned by me on 27th June last.  In common with other local authorities the corporation use temporary overdraft facilities from time to time during the year as fluctuations in their cash flow require.  I understand that the costs of any overdraft availed of by the corporation during the year are likely to be offset by interest accruing on foot of periodic credit balances on their accounts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of a growing practice of putting cars that have been declared write-offs by insurance companies back on the roads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that, in a case where a vehicle has been damaged and the insurance company concerned does not consider the cost of repairs to be an economic proposition for them but accepts instead that the vehicle can be treated as a write-off, that the vehicle may in fact subsequently be repaired and put back into use.  I have no grounds for concluding that in any such case the repaired vehicle is unfit for use or that such a practice results in a significant road safety problem.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that there are various provisions in the Road Traffic Acts and the regulations made under them, which enable the Garda to deal with vehicles which are, or are suspected to be, unfit.  These include sections 11, 20, 53 and 54 of the 1961 Act, as amended by the 1968 Act.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, there is nothing to prevent the insurer undertaking the insurance of the repaired vehicle from satisfying himself as to its condition. Indeed, I understand that generally insurers require evidence as to the condition of older vehicles before insuring them or renewing their cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha have been and, with the co-operation of the National Road Safety Association and my Department, are conducting a programme <Col N="505" /> of voluntary inspection of vehicles which, apart from its advisory effects in, for instance, convincing the public of the value of vehicle fitness, provides a useful base of information on which my Department may assess various possibilities in relation to a scheme of inspection and testing of motor vehicles.  This assessment is proceeding at present and will take due account of all relevant issues, including that of the type of vehicles mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in order for an insurance company to declare a car as a write-off for insurance compensation purposes the car must be in a very bad condition? In view of that, is the Minister serious when he says that when some of these cars are put back on the road he does not consider there is any cause for worry from his point of view?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister gave a long reply but that was what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in the event of repairs to the car costing more than its insurance value, the insurance company suggest a write-off. This may happen although the car may not be in very bad condition. However insurance companies usually carry out very stringent inquiries in regard to such cars before reinsuring them.  Indeed, the Garda have been on the alert in their respective areas for such vehicles to ensure that they are not put back on the road in an unsatisfactory condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister considering any question of compulsory examination of cars in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been under consideration for a long time. The cost of such an operation would be very high, as was recognised by my predecessors who suggested&mdash;and I have not deviated from their suggestion&mdash;that if we had available the type of money which would enable us to carry out this sort of operation <Col N="506" /> there are other more beneficial ways in which that money could be spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore the Minister is not considering it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider introducing a scheme similar to one in operation in England whereby a certificate of road-worthiness is issued in respect of each car? This would help the insurance companies in reaching decisions on whether to continue cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the insurance companies require any help. They are doing this job quite well themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the necessity to make provision for priority services such as housing and sanitary services and the phasing out of the cost to ratepayers of the health and housing subsidies it is not possible to increase the grants for local improvement schemes, to make any new grant allocations under the amenity grant scheme or to provide <Col N="507" /> funds to local authorities for relief schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not showing a complete lack of interest in providing employment opportunities for our people?  Is he not aware that the present unemployment figure is 104,500 and that this is increasing daily?  In these circumstances would he not reconsider his decision and make available extra money to local authorities by way of amenity grants so that they may provide extra employment in every county?  This course of action was taken during the term of office of the Minister's predecessor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in my capacity as Minister for Local Government, I were giving to local authorities the miserly sums made available to them by my predecessor I might consider finding extra money but in view of what this Government have done there is no way in which what Deputy Fitzgerald suggests can be done.</P>

      <P>I understand that in April, 1975, subsequent to the approval of the scheme by my Department and the Galway County Council, the latter proposed a number of changes in regard to sizes of pipes in several sections of the scheme.  On the basis of the revised quotations then obtained by the scheme trustees, the increase in cost would be about £15,900.  This increase has been examined by my Department and, while in relation to the increase in pipe sizes it would not be unreasonable, it is considered necessary to raise with the county council the need for the increased pipe sizes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will consider allowing pre-1968 civil service widows to join the Civil Service Widows Pension Scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Pension benefits for the widows and children of civil servants are provided on the basis of contributions being paid by officers serving on or after 23rd July, 1968, to cover the risk of predeceasing their wives.  Those who had retired or died prior to that date were not covered and paid no contributions.  Accordingly their widows could not benefit under the scheme.  It is, of course, clear that a scheme framed to cover a potential risk would not be appropriate where the contingency had already arisen, due to the husband's death.</P>
      <P>A special scheme was provided on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis as from 1st October, 1969, for the widows and children of those who retired or died prior to the introduction of the contributory scheme.  It enables pensions of onehalf of the rate payable under the contributory scheme to be awarded to such widows.  The current annual rate of expenditure on these pensions for the public service, including the civil service, is £2,900,000, so to double the rate would entail an extra annual charge of £2,900,000 on already overburdened Exchequer resources.  This figure does not allow for the possibility of claims from other groups for compensatory increases.</P>
      <P>The question of existing members of the contributory scheme making higher contributions to meet the cost of improving the <i>ex-gratia</i> pensions, was taken up with staff side representatives but no positive reaction was obtained. I should point out, however, that because of the annual pension increases for public service pensioners, the average <i>ex-gratia</i> pension went up by at least 29 per cent this year.  Since the scheme was introduced in 1969, the rates have risen, on average, by approximately 173 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, I am afraid that, in present circumstances, it is not feasible <Col N="519" /> to double the existing rate of pension for pre-1968 civil service widows.</P>

    </P>
    <P>(a)  All instruments to which the Statutory Instruments Acts, 1947 and 1955, primarily apply are included in the numbered S.I. series published by the Stationery Office (column 1).  A small number of the instruments, however, published in this series, are instruments to which the Acts do not primarily apply, i.e. they are required by other statutes to be published in full in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or they have been exempted by the Attorney General from the publication provisions of the Acts.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission make statutory instruments to which the 1947 and 1955 Acts do not primarily apply.  These instruments, which are not included in the above table, number about 500 a year.  They relate to regulations governing competitions and orders declaring certain positions to be excluded.  The making of all such instruments receives wide publicity and copies of the instruments are readily available on application to the commissioners.</P>
    <P>(c)  Orders made by county managers under sections 19 and 21 of the County Management Act, 1940, have been exempted by the Attorney General from the publication and numbering provisions of the Statutory Instruments Acts, 1947 and 1955.  These are very numerous and are not included here since no central record is available of them. A register of such orders must be kept by each county manager.</P>

      <P>I referred in my financial statement of 26th June, 1975, to the marked fall in output in the first half of the year as a result of the world recession and said that there was a very real possibility that the volume of national output this year would, in fact, be lower than in 1974. All the indicators which have since come to hand confirm this view.</P>
      <P>A fall in output is being experienced in many other countries this year.  For EEC members as a whole the fall according to latest information is likely to be about 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, when the world gross national output is falling, it is unlikely that Ireland would be unaffected by this fall.  Some figures might interest the Deputy.  The most recent forecasts indicate that the United States will have a fall of 4 per cent; Italy, 3 to 3½ per cent; Britain, 1 per cent; Germany, 3 to 4 per cent; and France, 2½ per cent.  These forecasts, which are the most recent ones, compare with forecasts given earlier this year. The EEC forecasts this year for projected growth in GNP were as follows: for May, 1974, they forecast plus 3.1 per cent for this year.  In August last year it dropped to 2.8 per cent and in December last year to 2.1 per cent.  In March of this year it was 1½ per cent.  By June it had fallen to minus ½ per cent and by July it had fallen to minus 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that <Col N="524" /> this country's contribution to the EEC budget was assessed on the average GNP for 1970, 1971 and 1972, when the economy was in a buoyant state, he will indicate whether the contribution needs to be revised in the light of the current economic climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This country's contribution to the budget of the European Communities is subject to certain limits based on a percentage share of Community GNP of 0.61 per cent which approximated to our share of that GNP in 1970, the year prior to that of the accession negotiations, and not on the average GNP for the years 1970, 1971 and 1972, as suggested by the Deputy.  The latest relevant figures published by the Statistical Office of the Communities relate to 1973 and these, together with very tentative estimates of the position in 1974 prepared in my Department, suggests that this country's share of Community GNP was not significantly lower in the first and second years of our membership than in 1970.</P>
      <P>I should point out that this figure of 0.61 per cent will not, in fact, be fully applicable for the purpose mentioned until 1978 at the earliest and that in the interval a graduated phasing-in system operates under which our contribution to the Communities' budget in 1975, for example, is reduced to 0.428 per cent.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not consider that the question of seeking a revision of the arrangements governing our contribution to the Communities' budget, which would of course involve a renegotiation of the Treaty of Accession, arises.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my replies to similar questions on 1st July, 1975 and 28th May, 1975.  Apart from the fact that the information requested relates to a later date, the earlier explanation given is still valid.  I might add that the repayment figure of £219 million on the issues side of the Exchequer statement should be set off against the borrowing figure of £198 million, a nett difference of £21 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that one cannot say with certainty what may be the fluctuations in the market.  It is not, therefore, possible at this stage to say what losses may be created as a consequence of exchange movements.  The mere fact that there could be losses today&mdash;if the loan was repaid today&mdash;is no certainty that a loss of a similar kind or that any loss would occur on the date that a loan would be repaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trading activities of roadside traders have been under constant surveillance by the Customs since early 1972.  Since then numerous seizures of both goods and conveyances have been made and prosecutions have been taken and convictions obtained in a large number of cases. Results of recent investigations tend to show that roadside trading in smuggled goods is now on a much reduced scale compared with 1973 and 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>If these people can blatantly admit that they are making that sort of money without paying income tax or turnover tax, indeed <Col N="532" /> selling goods that are not even manufactured in this country&mdash;there is no employment content in them&mdash;would the Minister not agree that he should make a severe crackdown on these people and protect the rights of those who are paying taxes and rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that the Revenue Commissioners are very active on this front. A very large number of prosecutions have already been taken.  Thirty-five convictions have already been obtained. There are further cases still pending.  A quantity of goods has been seized but the indications of late are that most of the goods now being sold are purchased from domestic sources and are then sold on the roadside.  Perhaps the public who gullibly buy there would find out if they investigated that they could get some of these goods at a more competitive price through the normal channels than by purchasing them at the particular locations they do.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as it is possible to do so the Revenue Commissioners ensure that value-added tax is paid by the persons in question.  Some of the traders in question are, as I pointed out on a previous occasion, registered for value-added tax.  Others are not, claiming that their sales are such as exempt them from the obligation to be registered for value-added tax purposes.  But the Revenue Commissioners will continue to maintain and, if necessary, improve their surveillance in this area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if estimates of assessment of PAYE liabilities are now being raised for a period of six or more years; and, if so, why it was not possible to process those cases in respect of the years involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the PAYE system of tax collection employers are statutorily required to register with the Revenue for the purpose of operating the system.  They are also obliged to deduct tax from the emoluments paid to employees and to remit the tax so deducted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Revenue Commissioners have reason to believe that a person has not registered as an employer or <Col N="536" /> that he is liable under the PAYE regulations to deduct and remit tax and has not remitted the tax&mdash;or has remitted insufficient tax&mdash;an estimate may be made on the person of the amount of tax which should have been deducted and remitted.</P>
    <P>Such estimates are normally made as soon as possible after the end of the period to which they relate. Where employers have not registered or where insufficient tax was remitted, the facts may not come to light for some considerable time and estimates in such cases must necessarily cover a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply seems plausible enough, but is he aware that in cases where companies have submitted audited accounts to the Revenue Commissioners as far back as eight years ago, estimates are now being made for PAYE liabilities completely out of the blue and that an onus is being placed on the person receiving these notices to prove that this liability does not arise.

      <P>Of a certain classification, and I pointed out to the Deputy that the classification is based upon those areas where people tend to spend a higher proportion of their <Col N="539" /> disposable income on transport than in other areas.  But once again I would say that if the Opposition would make up their minds it would help the country generally, because this is another case where we have been pressed to increase public expenditure while again and again the complaint opposite is that we are borrowing too much or taxing too much to meet expenditure which they say is not sufficient.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the limited amount of public money that was available for the purpose the services chosen to receive the benefit of the new transport subsidy were the widest-ranging possible in the circumstances, and it is not intended to extend the scope of the subsidy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,007,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Garda Síochána, including pensions, etc; for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force; for the payment of certain witnesses' expenses; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The additional sum is required to meet extra expenditure arising on the Vote which was not foreseen when the original Estimate was being prepared.</P>
      <P>It was not possible to seek the authority of the Dáil for this Supplementary Estimate before the summer recess as it was not clear at that stage what the eventual position was likely to be in regard to expenditure on overtime and so on, or indeed whether there might be savings on other subheads of the Vote which woud offset the extra money required.</P>
      <P>In fact, it was necessary to wait until after the end of September, in order to have the expenditure returns for the first nine months of the year, before an accurate estimate could be framed as to what amount of money would be required for the full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the total extra sum required, £4,623,000 is needed to meet the cost of the extra pay granted to the Garda Síochána by arbitration at the end of 1974 in respect of work done on weekends, on public holidays and at night, including arrears for the year 1974.  £2,666,000 is required to meet the cost of applying to the Garda Síochána the increases in pay under the national wage agreements, which were not provided for in the 1975 Estimate, and £60,000 represents the cost of extra pay to Garda Superintendents granted by the arbitration board.  These sums contain an element in respect of overtime.  An additional <Col N="548" /> £3,000,000 is also needed in respect of overtime over and above the sum of £3,500,000 provided in the original Estimate, which, in turn, was almost £1,500,000 greater than the previous year's provision on a 12 month basis. The pay and allowances for the increase of 125 in the strength of the force authorised by the Government in January, 1975, necessitates a further provision of £250,000.</P>
    <P>The balance of £408,000 is needed for payment to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of the additional cost of telephone and teleprinter services and for the extra sum required for employers' contributions under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    <P>Payments for Garda overtime have been increasing at a very rapid rate in the last two years to such an extent that, by August, 1975, they were running at an annual rate of about £9,000,000.  Even making full allowance for our internal situation, this accelerating growth in the rate of overtime payments required to have the brake applied.  This was done by arranging a selective cut-back in the amount of overtime.  The cut-back introduced is estimated to effect a reduction of about £1,000,000 on this year's payments which will amount to about £8 million.  This reduction is, however, relatively modest when seen in relation to the total cost of Garda services which amount to £52 million. Overtime payments are still running at a very high rate in comparison with previous years.  In this connection the amount paid in overtime in 1972-73 was £2,524,359 as compared with about £8,000,000 in the current year and I cannot recall any unusual worry over the level of policing in that year.</P>
    <P>In implementing the cut-back on overtime the Commissioner was given discretion as to where economies could be effected, with particular reference to securing the safety of the citizen. Although exaggerated accounts of cutbacks in services have appeared from time to time, there has been no diminution in essential Garda services.</P>
    <P>The security situation continues to make heavy demands on Garda resources. Already this year there have been several incidents that have involved <Col N="549" /> the Garda and the Army in large scale security operations for which substantial Garda overtime expenditure was necessary.  The Garda Síochána have deployed large numbers for duty, for example, in providing protection at Portlaoise Prison and in dealing with the attempted break-out of prisoners from the prison in March last, the murder of Garda Reynolds in September and the kidnapping of Dr. Herrema this month.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there was no stint as regards the resources made available in connection with any of these events.  I know there has been widespread admiration for the success which has been attending Garda operations.  Consideration of this whole area raises the important question of the deployment of the existing force and of increasing its strength.  However, it would be premature to take a decision to strengthen the Garda Síochána until the management consultants currently employed to investigate the management of the force have submitted their report.  This report too should be very useful in enabling the authorities to make fresh assessments of many aspects of the Garda including their deployment.</P>
    <P>I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House in the knowledge that all Members would wish to join me in paying tribute to the members of the force for their services and loyalty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the reason for the brevity of the Minister's speech, which is acceptable in the present circumstances.  In the last part of his speech he said there has been widespread admiration for the success that has been attending Garda operations. He particularly refers to the provision of protection for Portlaoise Prison.  In dealing with the attempted break-out of prisoners from that prison last March he mentioned the expeditious manner in which the Garda came into contact with the alleged murderers of Garda Reynolds.  These people have been charged before the court to answer for these crimes which it is alleged they have committed.  Again, the Minister, understandably, makes <Col N="550" /> brief reference to the kidnapping of Dr. Herrema.  We on this side of the House without any equivocation support the methods and the manner in which the Garda are dealing with the delicate and complex situation that now exists and has existed for a number of days past before the eyes of the nation and, indeed, the eyes of the world.  The less said at this time about that situation in our opinion the better.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that this estimate for the Garda Síochána is a supplementary one of £11,700,000 to be granted to defray the charges which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st December, 1975. While the provision of some of the extra moneys could be anticipated it is well to remind those people, for instance in illegal organisations, who are concerned about impressing their will on the State regardless of their rejection by almost the total population of the State, that the people who are actually providing these moneys are the taxpayers.  It is well to remember also that these extra moneys are being provided when the same nation is calling on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis for years past for increased financial aid for education, housing, health, and the social security structure and we have now reached the stage where we are cutting back on the provision of money for the handicapped. As a direct result of these activities being perpetrated in the nation by these illegal organisations and by others these extra moneys have to be found and used to protect the citizens and give effect to law and security in the State.  If the present situation did not exist, these moneys could be used for purposes for which they are so badly needed.</P>
      <P>Civil unrest in any nation at any time is a bad thing and it gives rise to the sort of situation I have described where the socially needy are deprived and so long as the nation is subject to the cancer of civil unrest its progress as a result is virtually nil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is by way of a general comment on the situation with which the Garda have to deal.  Over the years Fianna Fáil have unreservedly supported the Garda Síochána in the discharge <Col N="551" /> of their duties.  Equally, the Government demand and get unreservedly the support of the Garda Síochána.  The fundamental obligation of any Government is to uphold the law and maintain security and we believe that the present Government should not present the upholding of law and maintenance of public order as a special virtue on their part. Fianna Fáil have never been found wanting in doing its duty in difficult times.  They were never found wanting in respect of maintenance of the peace.  It was notorious that at a time when they were in Government they did not have the support of the whole House.  Certainly, they had the support of some elements in the then Opposition but they did not have the support which we as an Opposition give the Government in times of crisis.  This is support we believe any Government are entitled to get to uphold the basic democratic institutions and the freedom of this Dáil.  Any Opposition party within that democratic framework would be accused of hypocrisy and cant if it did not give that support to the Government of the day in a time of crisis and need.  In the course of the by-election, no later than last Sunday, it was interesting to note the remarks of the Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan.  It was he, not we, who raised the issue.  He was answered on our behalf. The Government's attempt to imply during the by-election that they are the only trustworthy upholders of law and security is all the more deplorable in the present circumstances. Mr. Ryan's references to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The reference of the Minister for Finance to: &ldquo;this Government's commitment to law and order...&rdquo; is all the more deplorable in view of the fact that Fianna Fáil have never been found remiss in respect of their duty as they saw it in the context of law and security.  However, when we were doing our <Col N="552" /> duty our governmental heels were being snapped at by certain Members who are silent today.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned a local security force&mdash;the Estimate is for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of the service of the local security force.  I know the Minister does not mean the abortive local security force that was spoken of.  That kite was flown by the Taoiseach who said that these so-called vigilantes would aid the Garda Síochána in the prevention of crime and the maintaining of law and security in local areas.  I should like the Minister to explain the reference to &ldquo;local security force&rdquo; in more detail when replying.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party talked about the setting up of a police authority and the matter was raised in the House by way of parliamentary question some weeks ago.  On that occasion the Minister made specific reference to the possibility of establishing a police authority and I should like him to develop his thinking on the possible role of such an authority in the context of its relationship to the Garda Síochána and the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Garda Síochána in recent times have been receiving the co-operation of the public.  At present they are riding high, and deservedly so, in the esteem of the people.  In my area if one requires the assistance of the Garda Síochána, assuming the telephone is in working order although it is most unlikely to be in working order at present, and one is successful in contacting them they attend to that call within a short time. They are always courteous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the cut-back in overtime and told us that the gardaí were in dispute with him on this account.  He attempted to justify the cut-back in overtime.  I come from a suburban constituency and it has been expressed to me from time to time that there has been a lessening of emphasis on Garda foot patrols.  The presence of a garda at night in an area gives the people there a certain sense of security and it also <Col N="553" /> frightens off would-be criminals.  I know the Minister will tell us that there has been no lessening in the general security situation.  We accept that in the present circumstances there has to be an added emphasis on the national security situation and that the State must be protected at the cost of many worthy schemes against those who would attack the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>It is proper that the State should be so protected and we would support the Minister should he require additional money for this purpose.  Local conditions are causing concern in urban areas.  I am not competent to speak with any authority about rural areas and I have no doubt my colleagues will deal with that aspect of the matter.  In referring to the lack of foot patrols I do not wish it to be taken as a criticism of the Garda Síochána.  In fact, it reflects well on the Garda Síochána when one considers that their presence in a neighbourhood during the hours of darkness is welcomed by the local people. I should like the Minister to comment on that aspect.</P>
    <P>We believe the gardaí are entitled to a salary commensurate with their responsibility.  If in recognition of the responsibility which they carry they are paid extra we would support such an increase.  If we are to have a proper law enforcement agency we will have to pay for that agency.  We believe the gardaí are discharging their functions in the traditional fashion of loyalty to the nation.  We also believe that the circumstances and conditions under which some members of the force have to work are, to say the least, deplorable.  I can think of one such station, Shankill, which is a shame.</P>

      <P>I do not intend spending a great deal of time on this debate because we are constrained by the type of debate it is.  There is one matter I should like to put on the record with a view to returning to it at a later stage, that is, the problem of violence in our community.</P>

As I said, I would like at a later stage&mdash;perhaps when the Minister for Justice is introducing his annual Estimate&mdash;to deal with the whole concept of violence in the community.  It is that type of debate which I believe will help the Garda Síochána discharge their functions better because they have to deal with violence and we, as legislators, have a part to play too.  We could debate the cult of violence and the effects of violent literature, films and action on our young people, bearing in mind that the people engaging in the violent actions, films and literature are generally adults and the young people are following in the tradition of violence handed down to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  This is a very essential and vital Supplementary Estimate.  It is a matter of regret to note that part of it is due to the disturbed internal situation which has existed for the past few years.  It would be well if those people, self-styled army privateers, realised that what they are doing to the ordinary taxpayer and ratepayer is increasing their cost of living and, at the same time, denying the right and validity of the hopes the ordinary men and women placed in the ballot boxes at the last and previous general elections.  These people are not prepared to accept a constitutional Government under any guise.  It is fair to describe them as a bunch of bloody-minded Al Capones. It is about time we put them in their proper place because they are responsible for a great deal of overtime in the Garda and Army as is evident from this Supplementary Estimate.  I did not like to let this opportunity pass without referring to this subject.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the same matters but in milder language. It is about time we said things bluntly and honestly here.  I was glad to hear the Minister refer to the reaction of the public to the good services provided by the Garda.  It is obvious that certain members of the public who were lukewarm about law and order now realise that their security in the future depends on co-operation with the Garda.  In recent times it has become very evident that the public are co-operating more with Garda investigations.  I hope to see an even greater increase in this co-operation in the future.  If this happens the bill to be paid by the Department of Justice will be a great deal less.</P>

      <P>I endorse what has been said by the previous speakers.  I do not consider that anyone is to be complimented for endorsing the manner in which the Garda carry out their duties and the excellence of the service they give.  My only regret is that it costs so much.</P>
      <P>There is an indication in the Minister's speech that the total amount of £7 million is needed to meet the extra pay granted to the Garda Síochána by arbitration at the end of 1974.  The accounting officer and the officers of the Department when estimating for 1975 should have included this sum. It is well known that this increase would be forthcoming and I wonder why provision was not made in the full Estimate.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to extend the debate but I would like to take slight issue with the Minister when he claims that:</P>
      <P>Although exaggerated accounts of cut-backs in services have appeared from time to time, there has been no diminution of essential Garda services.</P>
      <P>At the end of his speech he said that it would be premature to take a decision to strengthen the Garda Síochána until the management consultants currently employed to investigate the management of the force have submitted their report.  My point is that there is a need for extra gardaí now.</P>
      <P>I should hate to appear insular or parochial on this but I can only take guidance from my constituency.  In a certain area of my constituency over the last two years a special Garda patrol operated successfully and vandalism, mugging and violence were completely eradicated from the area. Since the patrol was withdrawn some months ago there have been further incidences of vandalism.  I am giving that example to prove that at least in the constituency I represent what I regard as an essential service has suffered and it can only be corrected if overtime is granted as happened previously or if there are additional gardaí. I cannot accept from the Minister that the position is satisfactory; if I were to do that I would be misleading the Minister and the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Yesterday&mdash;not in anticipation of this short debate&mdash;I had occasion, as happens practically every week, to visit the local Garda station at Finglas.  I was told there that there were regrets that men were not available to patrol the areas I mentioned.  Last week, in response to appeals from the area, I was told that the total available force in the station at Finglas was three men&mdash;for an area greater than any city outside Dublin.  The Minister will realise I cannot accept the proposition that essential services are being catered for.  Certainly they are not being catered for in the Finglas area which I represent.</P>
    <P>There are manifestations of that every day.  Before the summer recess I asked a question in the House and I suggested to the Minister that the information he got from the Commissioner was not correct.  I was told that the incidence of vandalism in the Finglas area had shown a reduction.  That may be so but if it is the case it is because the gardaí are not there to detect it.  It is false and misleading to say vandalism is on the decline; we are only holding off the day that will come much more rapidly on all of us by pretending&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members for their contributions, for their concern for the well-being of the Garda force and for their expressions of concern about the well-being of the country. The two things go hand in hand because the Garda are the guardians of our basic institutions and our basic liberties.  It is good to hear them praised in that context because too often we have unthinking and facile criticism of the gardaí and their activities.  It is good that spokesmen in this House should draw attention to the fact that the gardaí are our protectors, that this is their role.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews raised the question of security and the importance of the gardaí in the security context.  I cannot emphasise that too much.  I do not want to go into detail on it because of the constraints a Supplementary Estimate debate imposes on us but, as it has been raised, I want to thank the Deputy for the unequivocal support which he says is available from Fianna Fáil and which I accept.  On the other hand, I cannot refrain from commenting that he appeared sensitive on this matter but perhaps it might have been my ears deceiving me.</P>

      <P>I think I gave information regarding the cost in a Dáil question some time ago.  It will cost in the region of £46,000.  The management consultants are Messrs. Stokes, Kennedy and Crowley.  They were picked after tender in competition with a number of others skilled in this area.  They were not picked by me or my Department but by a composite surveying body.  They should report in about July, 1976.  Their terms of reference are extremely wide and enable them to investigate all aspects of the management of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>No, they are not examining the idea of a police authority.  The examination of a police authority by me would be premature pending their recommendations. They may recommend altered managerial structures within the force.  I might set up a police authority at this stage that, in its composition and role, might conflict with their ultimate recommendations. I thought it better to wait until the survey was finished.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Local Security Force, these payments are compensation for injuries received by members of that force on duty during what we call the Emergency, the last war.  The payments amount to £640 per annum in the current year.  It is a tiny part of the Estimate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is analogous to a pension; as known in legal circles, it is &ldquo;compo&rdquo;.  Both Deputy Andrews and Deputy Tunney raised a question of Garda presence.  Deputy Andrews raised the matter in the context of foot patrols and their importance.  I agree entirely in regard to the importance of the man on the beat.  It was unfortunate that some years ago this policy while not being discarded completely was downgraded to some extent and the patrols were replaced by mechanically propelled vehicles.  I am glad that for some time past there has been a change in this regard on the part of the Garda authorities and that they are anxious to restore a high level of beat patrols.  This type of patrol is a good deterrent as well as being a consolation to citizens.  However, it is very difficult for the layman to say that any one area is not being <Col N="561" /> patrolled adequately.  Differing areas require differing levels of patrolling, different times of patrolling.  When a Member or anyone else says that patrolling in his area has diminished, his statement may be based on casual observation and this can be inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is not inaccurate. Deputy Tunney has outlined a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with Deputy Andrews' assertion but I shall come to Deputy Tunney's point in a moment.  It is dangerously fallacious to criticise the absence or presence of beat patrols on the basis of casual observation. However, the importance of beat patrols is accepted by me and by the Garda authorities and the patrols are implemented so far as possible and so far as Garda professional assessment deems their presence necessary in any area at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, the statement made by me was not based on casual observation but on hard and fast information I received and which supports in full what Deputy Tunney has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to give me details of any such hard and fast information I shall be glad to give him a detailed reply for the benefit of those who conveyed the information to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I can remember the Minister received representations from me some time ago in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot recall offhand any such representations but the Deputy may renew them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tunney raised a number of questions and took issue with me on a statement in my brief to the effect that there had been no diminution in essential Garda services. He considered that there had been such diminution in his district.  Again, this is entirely a matter for debate. As a concerned public representative, Deputy Tunney would like to see a <Col N="562" /> very high level of police activity in his area.  Ideally, we would all like to see such activity approach almost saturation point so as to ensure that everywhere one goes one sees a man on patrol, but we must balance that desire with the exigencies of the situation as the officers in charge find it.  We must rely on their professional discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cited the case of the Fitzmaurice area.  In that area there was no vandalism during the time of the presence of the special patrol but since the removal of that patrol a month or two ago, there has been a much higher incidence of vandalism. This is factual evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but it is very difficult to present a problem in this area in what I might call scientific, objective terms.  There must be a certain amount of subjectivity. Much depends on how the problem is presented by people intimately or personally affected adversely on a particular day in regard to a certain incident which might be blamed on the lack of patrols.  On the other side of the coin there is the professional police view as to what level of patrolling is necessary.  There is the professional assessment of what is an essential Garda service.  It might well be that there are many desirable Garda services but a distinction must be made between which are desirable and which are essential and priorities must be adjusted accordingly.  I can envisage a situation where a Garda service might come into operation on the grounds that it was essential at the time and was maintained for a number of years but where the requirements that made it essential in the first place might diminish so that after some time it could no longer be regarded as an essential service.  However, the question is a difficult one to decide.  We must leave it to the Garda officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney raised, too, the question why it is not possible to provide for the elements of extra pay and national wage agreements in the ordinary Estimates.  I am advised that in the normal course the amounts £4,623,000 and £2,666,000 would be <Col N="563" /> provided for in Votes sponsored by the Minister for the Public Service and that it is merely because there was the overtime Estimate, which had to be sponsored by me, that all is being put into this Supplementary Estimate as a matter of convenience. On the question of timing, I understand the reason they were not sponsored by the Minister for the Public Service was because the awards were granted towards the end of the year 1974 and had not been accepted by the Government in sufficient time to be included in the annual Estimates. The financial need has not arisen until now in the sense of the need for parliamentary authority for the payments involved.  There is the further point I referred to in my speech of having to let the year go on in order to see some of the savings that may become apparent and for which we might take credit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews mentioned the desirability of Garda salaries being commensurate with the job.  I agree entirely that both salary and working conditions should be commensurate with the job.  In this context it might be of interest to the House to hear some examples of the pay rates for the most numerous ranks.  On completion of training a garda is paid a weekly wage of £45.53.  Normally this would be a man just out of his teens. After 15 years in the ranks he receives a basic salary of £63.50.  On appointment a sergeant is paid at the rate of £65.94 per week.  After three years in the rank he receives £70.54 per week.  As I indicated in the Estimate gardaí are now paid special rates for working unsocial hours such as at nights, at weekends and on public holidays.  This is in addition to anything they may earn by way of overtime.  These figures are very much basic pay scales.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that they are not ungenerous, that society is not ungenerous to the Garda in terms of those pay scales.</P>
    <P>If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will permit me I will refer briefly to the question of Garda buildings.  I share Deputy Andrew's concern that <Col N="564" /> Garda stations throughout the country are not as they should be, that there has been a heritage of old buildings, but they are being tackled on a wide scale.  Improvements are being effected.  There are 70 to 80 minor improvements carried out every year in stations up and down the country.  There are in course of construction at the moment 14 new stations.  Major improvements are in mind for nine other stations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give us a note of the 14 new stations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the particulars.  It is quite possible the station the Deputy mentioned is not included.  Not all stations can be tackled simultaneously but there is a comprehensive programme to improve housing and conditions generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde raised one matter which, I think, bears repetition.  I refer to how important it is that the gardaí should have the full co-operation of all members of the public. That means that people must give to the gardaí information which comes their way, information which will lead to the detection of law breakers and assist the gardaí in their fight against subversion.  This is very important.  I am glad to say there has been a considerable improvement in this regard in recent times and Deputy Esmonde was right when he said there is now public concern about the safety of the State and public awareness of the importance of the Garda force in our society.  That is reflected in the continuous and increasing public co-operation.</P>
      <P>The only other point to which I should like to refer is that raised by Deputy Tunney in connection with his area.  He said the position could only be improved if more gardaí were provided in his area or more overtime paid.  He said I had ruled out any increase in numbers.  I did not do any such thing.  What I said was it would be premature to do anything pending the report of the consultants.  There is a third option, namely, a better deployment of the existing force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> That might make up some of the deficiencies the Deputy says exist in his area.  Whether there can be a better deployment is something that may be apparent from the management survey. Different times may require new methods and new approaches.  It would be premature to make any drastic changes in the numerical strength of the force pending the report of the consultants.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their expressions of goodwill towards the gardaí. I know they reflect the general public feeling and I know the gardaí want to assure the public of their acceptance of the importance of their role in protecting the public and their anxiety to discharge that role as efficiently as possible.  They want the public to know they appreciate the co-operation that has been forthcoming in generous measure in recent times.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day I was dealing with some aspects of the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech.  I indicated that what was required was not increased social welfare benefits but jobs.  Jobs are allimportant. At the moment a small section of the community are paying fairly substantial contributions and we all hope the day is not far distant when we will have a substantial work force all paying contributions.  Unemployment is running over the 100,000 <Col N="566" /> mark.  Daily there are more closures or notices of pending closures.  The outlook is bleak for those who are still lucky enough to be employed. This is where real confidence is required, confidence to ensure the protection of industry and the development of industry so that people will be removed from the dole queues.</P>
      <P>Social welfare evolves over years. Pressures demand the updating of legislation to meet present day requirements and problems in order to meet developing situations.  We are living in a different type of society, a society in which demands and pressures are both greater.  There is a demand for an extension of existing services and the introduction of new services.  Improvements are due not to any benevolence but rather to the declining value of money.  Many sections receiving social welfare at the moment are not getting anything like what they should be getting to meet the increased cost of living.  We are told there has been a .08 or a .8 per cent reduction in the cost of living. A few months ago we were told the subsidies would mean a substantial reduction in the cost of living.  During the election campaign the Government clearly indicated certain things would be done so that we would have full employment and a reduction in the cost of living.  That has not been the experience.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is making every effort, and rightly so, to keep abreast of this difficult situation.  That is his job.  That is his duty.  That is his responsibility.  Over the years many enlightened schemes have been introduced which give relief to people in distress, to the weaker sections of the community.  These people are entitled to consideration when money is available. We must find more money to assist the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out on one occasion that there were 25,000 people living on or below the poverty line.  That figure must have reached more serious proportions by now.  This situation must be tackled. The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he was tackling it with vigour.  I <Col N="567" /> have no doubt that he is making the necessary effort to tackle it.  People are entitled to more money to cope with the tragic circumstances in which they find themselves.  On the other hand, people are abusing the system. This was mentioned by many speakers. The Parliamentary Secretary and indeed the Minister must by now be well aware that there are substantial abuses in various sectors of this system.  People who require more help should get it and people who are abusing the system should be brought to book.  There is no need for me to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that.  He and the Government are well aware of it and must be courageous enough to take action to ensure these abuses are eliminated.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): There is not a Deputy in this House who has not been called upon from time to time by his constituents to get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare with regard to delayed benefits, applications which were not being processed in time and so on.  This Department deals with people who, by and large, have very little means at their disposal.  It is a Department also that must be efficient in its day-to-day operations because people seeking benefit cannot wait until the week after which the benefit became due.  If the benefit does not arrive on, say, the Thursday or Friday, it places people dependent on it in a most unfortunate position over that week-end because many such people live from hand to mouth&mdash;old age pensioners, widows, orphans and unemployed people with large families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not for one moment saying that the officials of the Department are not efficient in any way.  I sympathise with them in their difficult task because they must accept and process applications at very short notice.  I would consider they are doing quite a good job.  However, from time to time public representatives receive <Col N="573" /> complaints from people saying that certain payments have been delayed for some reason, perhaps through postal difficulties, misfiling or some other mistake having been made.  I know such things can happen.  Being in business myself, I know it is possible to misplace documents and so on and we must make certain allowances from time to time.  But I would be inclined to allow more latitude to any other Department.  The reason I say so is that the majority of these people are dependent on their benefit on the day on which it becomes due.  They are waiting to take it home to their wives to buy foodstuffs and other items for the family.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised this Supplementary Estimate in an earlier budget and he said it was bound to follow as a result of increased benefits.  But this Supplementary Estimate has been brought about by lack of Government policy.  I hope I do not stray beyond the bounds of discussion on this measure but it would not be necessary for the Parliamentary Secretary to come into this House and look for this large amount of money for social welfare benefits had other Departments done their jobs effectively.  The Parliamentary Secretary might claim that this is a substantial increase in benefits. This is not true.  You would have to ask the housewife as to what inflation had done with her contribution or the benefits which she received over the past 12 months.  These have been eroded by very large increases in food prices over the past 12 months and it is not true for the Parliamentary Secretary to tell the House that the benefits are substantial. We would not be budgeting for an estimate of this scale if it were not for the number who are in receipt of unemployment benefit today.  I have always held, and I still hold, that social welfare benefits are designed primarily for old age pensioners, widows and orphans, recipients of long-term disability benefit and so on, and I think it is the duty of every citizen to subscribe to that ideal.  I do not believe that it is the right policy&mdash;at least it is not the policy of our party in regard to unemployment <Col N="574" /> benefit&mdash;to sit back, pay unemployment benefit, and think we have done a good job.  That is a bad policy.  It is the duty of everyone in this country, as I have already mentioned, to support the weaker sections of our community, and I have never during my time in this House, criticised the amount of money which we in this party voted year after year when we were in Government.  There was never a budget passed through this House when Fianna Fáil were in Government which did not have provision for substantial increases for every social welfare category, and there is no good in the Parliamentary Secretary claiming that this section of the community was not catered for until such time as the inter-Party Government came into power.  Our social welfare policy down through the years covered all these categories. The conditions under which people are living today have been made far more difficult by the neglect of the Coalition Government who have failed to curb the rising cost of living. That is why we are discussing such a large Estimate.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Social welfare schemes have to be operated from time to time and the various categories of beneficiaries have to be looked at to see who should benefit and who should not benefit.  Deputy Dowling mentioned abuses which have taken place over <Col N="575" /> a number of years.  I do not know what the figures are, and I am not going to follow that course.  Such figures are more readily available to the Parliamentary Secretary than they are to me.  Whether there is a firm foundation for reports of these abuses I do not know, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary, in reviewing the various categories of people getting unemployment benefit, will take this into consideration.</P>
      <P>I am wondering if the Parliamentary Secretary is considering any change as regards the people who will be receiving benefit.  Is it his intention to revise any schemes?  Has he any plans in mind in regard to small farmers' schemes or small farmers' dole?  Maybe he has in mind to make it more difficult for people in rural areas to avail of the dole as they are doing today.  It might be interesting if he revealed this information before the Mayo by-election.  I would like to tell the Parliamentary Secretary now that he has under active consideration the question of putting several people in the west of Ireland outside the dole limit.  If this is the idea he has in mind we should know about it now; I do not want to see it coming in in five or six months' time.  If he has any such plans in mind in regard to other categories of unemployment benefit recipients, we should know about that now also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot of talk about the Minister extending the pay-related scheme.  It was when Fianna Fáil were in power that this scheme was first thought about.  All the Minister for Social Welfare had to do was to implement our idea.  At present the contribution accruing to the Department of Social Welfare is 2 per cent from employers and 1 per cent from employees.  I am sorry to say that the Department of Social Welfare did not establish a proper fund for this scheme.  This scheme was designed for pay-related benefit only and the funds accruing to it should be kept specifically for that purpose.  The Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary have refused <Col N="576" /> on several occasions to reveal exactly the state of the pay-related fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): As I understand it the pay-related scheme was brought into being as a result of negotiations with employers and employees through the Department of Social Welfare.  That fund should be separated from other schemes in the Department of Social Welfare.  When this scheme was first brought into being the employers were consulted and there were negotiations regarding what percentage contribution should be made.  The employers stated they considered 2 per cent too high.  The Department undertook to review the scheme from time to time and if they considered it was excessive they would take the matter into consideration. During the nine-month financial year of last year the pay-related scheme had a surplus of £7 million.  This year there is every possibility that the scheme will have a surplus of £10 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell the workers of this city that 1 per cent of their salaries is being deducted while the fund has an excess in the region of £17 million?  Will he tell the employers when they are negotiating <Col N="577" /> the next national wage agreement what is happening the 2 per cent which they are subscribing to this fund?  I defy the Parliamentary Secretary to contradict me when I say that this surplus which will amount to £17 million at the end of this year, is being used in other sections of the Department of Social Welfare to shore up other schemes.  I would also like the Parliamentary Secretary to be able to contradict me when I say that he has proposals for small farmers in which he intends to make it far more difficult for them to qualify.  The huge surplus which is accumulating in the pay related scheme will have to be looked at very seriously.  If I were a trade unionist I would have no hesitation in approaching the Minister for Social Welfare and the Parliamentary Secretary to seek a reduction in the contribution.</P>
    <P>There is no means test in relation to this 1 per cent which is deducted from the ordinary workers in this city.  It does not make any difference whether that man has one child, two children or more.  The same amount is deducted from everybody.  I would not criticise deducting this sum of money if it was necessary.  I am not criticising the pay related scheme because people have to get this money to survive today.  I am however criticising the excessive surplus which the Minister is getting and cloaking up the fact that the money is being used for other schemes administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>When the scheme was first introduced the Confederation of Irish Industry got an undertaking from the Minister for Social Welfare at that time that if the contribution was regarded as excessive after 12 months it would be renewed.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary have very conveniently overlooked that factor.  I have not seen the Parliamentary Secretary or any of his Labour Party colleagues approach the Confederation of Irish Industry and say to them: &ldquo;You are paying too much.  We made a mistake in striking the figure of 3 per cent of the total wages&rdquo;.  During the next few months, when wage agreements are being negotiated, the first gesture <Col N="578" /> by the Minister for Social Welfare or the Parliamentary Secretary should be to reduce that contribution.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary expect that up to 140,000 people will be unemployed within the next seven months and that this huge surplus will be required?  I hope he is not reserving the surplus for that.</P>
    <P>A parliamentary question put down about a year ago gave us the figure of £7 million surplus in the fund.  That was for a nine-month period so it is now obvious that over a 12-month period there will be a very large excess in the fund.  A deduction of 3 per cent out of the wage packet of workers in this city is an astronomical sum to go into the Department of Social Welfare. I believe this contributes to the number of people unemployed today, that it has a bearing on costs and on production and is also one of the reasons we lost our exports.  It was a badly thought out plan which resulted in completely overestimating the amount which should be paid into the pay related scheme.  This money has been deducted from wage packets over the last 18 months.  Never during that period did the Minister or the Department of Social Welfare indicate to the employees or the employers that they considered the contribution too high and that especially during these difficult economic times they would reduce the contribution.  Yet they talk about benefits they gave in other sectors of social welfare.  This supplementary estimate would probably be much larger if the accountancy system in the Department of Social Welfare were the sort of system I should like to see there with this fund separated from other contributions going into the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Before moving away from pay-related benefit I should like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary will tell the people who are paying it.  Will he say that the fund is only sufficient to cover the pay-related scheme or will he be honest and say that too much has been contributed over the past one-and-a-half or two years and that he intends to review the scheme?  If so, it would be a genuine gesture but if he is going to continue to evade the real issue he should refer to the records when this scheme was being initiated and an undertaking that was given at that time that it would be reviewed in respect of contributions. He will find this in his files.  This has been brought to my attention by employers who are quite concerned about the contribution and by employees who can ill afford this deduction.  I know some of it is necessary. The pay-related scheme is an <Col N="580" /> excellent idea because it bridges the gap between the time a man becomes unemployed and the time he resumes work again.  Unfortunately, we are now in a situation when there seems to be very little future for those becoming unemployed.  How long can the Parliamentary Secretary continue the pay-related scheme?  As the fund stands, I agree that if he wishes he can certainly extend it every three months for a considerable time but we must consider something more positive than giving pay-related benefit to people who are unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have met several of these people in the past five or six months, young married men and single men and women.  They have told me that the pay-related scheme does not compensate for the loss of a good job.  There is no doubt that no matter what you give a man he would prefer to be employed.  Nothing is so soul-destroying or demoralising for any man as to get up in the morning and think that during the whole day he has nothing to do but pass the time usually around the house, getting in the way of his wife and family.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is under the impression that he has satisfied the wishes of the people who are unemployed in this city and throughout the country, I should like to advise him that he is very far off the mark.  If it is an interim arrangement to tide people over difficult time, it is acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that something more positive will have to be done by the Government generally if we are to get over this very serious situation. These pay-related schemes were initiated and drawn up under the Fianna Fáil Government and they had to be implemented by the present Coalition Government.  I think the Government of the day over-estimated the percentage that should be paid.  If the Parliamentary Secretary were honest and would agree that the fund has been over-subscribed but that due to economic circumstances they had to allocate it to other sections in the Department, we might excuse him.  I doubt very much if he is prepared to say that here.  I hope that he will give some indication as to whether the figures I have given as regards the <Col N="581" /> surplus in the pay-related fund are accurate or not.  I should like to hear his figures.  If they are not in excess of £9 million for the nine months of last year&mdash;that figure was given in the House&mdash;and if at the end of this year they will not be in excess of £10 million, I would like to be contradicted but I doubt if the Pariamentary Secretary is in a position to contradict me when I suggest that he now has in his Department a sum in the region of £17 million fiddled into other sections of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>That is something we should consider seriously.  We would then see how honest the Parliamentary Secretary is with the people.  I have no doubt there is a surplus there.  A lot of people were wondering how long pay-related benefit would keep coming but when one looks at the amount of money accruing, 3 per cent, the thing is obvious.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was endeavouring to illustrate the changing attitudes of the Minister for Finance in relation to the economy generally.  It is something which has baffled most people.  We all know of the television programme &ldquo;The Many Faces of Dick Emery&rdquo;, which is rather amusing.  That actor portrays a man who can rapidly change from one role to another.  The Minister for Finance, who reminds me of him, recently exhorted our people to prepare for the tough times which inevitably lay ahead and asked workers to be careful about claiming any further increases in their wages or incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> However yesterday we had the same Minister in a different role, dispensing largesse all over Ireland and, in particular, to County Mayo.</P>
    <P>We will be receiving £5.9 million from the regional fund for 88 projects. Work has already been carried out on most of these projects or is being carried out.  In the normal course of events they would have qualified for such assistance, but we have not received any indication from the Minister for Finance as to what our regional policy will be.  An old politician's cliché: &ldquo;The mill does not run on water that has passed&rdquo; applies in this context.  We were all interested in getting the advance factories which Fianna Fáil were responsible for erecting and also interested in getting the sewerage and water schemes but we are more interested in what will be done in the future in relation to the underdeveloped regions, particularly Mayo.</P>
    <P>We do not want a recitation of pious hopes from the Minister about what he would like to see happening or what the Government may do because we are tired hearing about matters that are under review. We want to see a blueprint which will spell out in detail what will be done in relation to the less-favoured areas.  There must be fundamental planning which must refer to infrastructure and not simply applying grants to isolated water schemes.  We want a definite policy that will open up access to the west.  We want proper highways and primary roads based on national planning.  We want a plan that will show airways and the development of harbours and the fish processing industry.  It is laughable for the Minister to talk about the establishment of industries on the western seaboard when there are 104,000 unemployed with an addition each week and a forecast that the figure will run up to 140,000.  That figure is a modest estimate.</P>
    <P>This is the frightening situation in which we are seeking to get some hope for the west in relation to regional development. We sold membership of the EEC in those areas based on the hope they would experience such development and this was written into the Treaty of Rome.  We had a right to <Col N="583" /> expect this sort of development and I hope that before the end of the debate a document will be circulated to Members outlining regional policy for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Gaeltacht (Mr. O'Donnell)</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister for Finance dealt comprehensively with the motion before the House, I felt it, since certain questions put by Deputy Colley and Deputy Brennan were directed specifically at me as Minister for the Gaeltacht, appropriate for me to contribute to the debate.  I felt obliged to outline in greater detail the thinking, the philosophy, the aims and objectives behind the recent Government decision setting up the Western Development Board.  As Minister for the Gaeltacht I am responsible for what might be called the most peripheral maritime regions in western Europe and the question of regional development is of great interest to me.  That question is also of vital interest to the people of the Gaeltacht and those living in the west.</P>
      <P>Allowing for the fact that this motion was put down and the debate commenced in a by-election atmosphere I was hopeful that we might have a reasoned and constructive debate on regional development.  Unfortunately, Deputy Colley, for reasons best known to himself, destroyed any possibility of such a debate taking place.  His contribution would be more appropriate to the after-Mass meetings in the West Mayo Constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to spell out the case for the establishment of the Western Development Board.  Since I made the announcement about this new board in Westport Fianna Fáil have displayed a considerable amount of surprise, annoyance and, in some cases, anger. Frankly, the attitude of Fianna Fáil to this concept of a western development board is very difficult to understand, because the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="584" /> when in Government and since going into opposition have lost no opportunity to laud and extol the merits of the two regional agencies which they established when in Government, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>If the idea of establishing a special agency for the mid-western region was correct then, it is still correct today. As a Deputy for that region who has spent 14 years in the Dáil I have on many occasions paid tribute to the work of SFADCo, acknowledged the progress they made in promoting economic and social development of the mid-west region and their tremendous success in the industrial estate at Shannon since they extended their functions to Limerick city and county, north Tipperary and Clare. Everyone is aware of SFADCo's success in promoting tourism and their original concept of castle tours, medieval banquets and so forth.</P>
      <P>In every debate which took place on the Gaeltacht since I had the privilege to be appointed Minister, Fianna Fáil speakers, notably Deputy Faulkner, referred to the fact that &ldquo;We set up Gaeltarra Éireann&rdquo;.  If SFADCo was a good organisation for the mid-western region, and if Gaeltarra Éireann was necessary to promote the development of the Gaeltacht areas, surely there is a cast iron case for a special agency to tackle the appalling economic and social problems to be found in the province of Connacht and County Donegal, problems that are without parallel in any western European country.  I cannot understand the attitude of Fianna Fáil in this respect.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that the case for the establishment of a special agency in Connacht and Donegal is a compelling one.  Anyone who takes even a cursory glance at the official statistical evidence available from the census of population over the past few decades will immediately realise that we in the west are confronted with an appalling and frightening situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the intercensal period 1951 to 1971 there was a net percentage reduction in population of 17.6 in Donegal, <Col N="585" /> 6.9 in Galway, 31.2 in Leitrim, 22.8 in Mayo, 21.4 in Roscommon and 16.9 in Sligo against a net national increase of 0.6 per cent.  More recently the Mayo County Council commissioned a survey into two specific areas. It was known as the Shipman Survey, and was carried out by a gentleman of that name with his associates.  I have the reports for the Erris and the Achill areas.  Time does not permit me to go into detail but the survey in the Achill area alone showed that between 1951 and 1971 there was an annual net drop of 100 people per annum, a reduction of 2,000 in Achill alone in that 20 years.  This has been reflected in more recent years by the fact that six national schools have closed in that area.  Another striking and frightening figure brought out in the survey showed that only one in 20 families there can hope to make a living from the land.  In that period the net loss of population in Achill was 37.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Anybody who drives through the west of Ireland will be aware of this appalling and frightening situation. The time was long overdue when special strategies, policies and action had to be taken to try to tackle this very serious situation.  The Government were satisfied that the approach to SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann, where there are special agencies implementing specific policies tailormade to the economic and social needs of a specific region, was the correct one.  More than that, we look at the position in Europe and find that it is now accepted by all western European Governments that there are two basic prerequisites for a successful regional policy.  Firstly, there must be a comprehesive, co-ordinated and well integrated development strategy. Secondly, and just as important, there must be a special agency charged with overall responsibility for implementing that policy.  I have referred to SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>I have also seen an example of such a board&mdash;the Highlands and Islands Development Board in Scotland, which is a special agency set up to tackle the particular needs of the north of Scotland and the islands.  I <Col N="586" /> am aware, and I am sure Deputy Colley and Deputy Herbert are also aware, of the Casa del Mezzogiorno, a special region in the south of Italy, including Sardinia, which has a special Government agency implementing specific policies tailored towards tackling the economic and social problems of those regions.  I am aware also of the regional council in France and Belgium.  I have here an excellent article published in <i>The Economist</i> of January, 1975, where there was a comprehensive feature and a survey into the regional development policies and strategies of the nine EEC countries. Anybody interested in regional development could not do better than read that article.  Here the theme is of special and comprehensive policies and special agencies to implement those policies.</P>
    <P>Since I had the honour to be appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht, I travelled extensively throughout the Gaeltacht regions.  I think I can justifiably say that I have probably been in every parish and I have certainly been in the seven Gaeltacht offshore islands.  Despite what Deputy Colley said last night, that we were making false claims about the employment generated from the Gaeltacht areas since 1973 when we took office, I have in my possession the latest statistics furnished to me by my Department and Gaeltarra Éireann.  On 31st December, 1972, the end of the last full year of Fianna Fáil Government, 1,864 were full-time employed in the Gaeltacht.  On 30th June, 1975, the last date for which official figures are available, 2,815 people were in full-time employment there, a net increase of 50 per cent.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to enter into an argument with the Deputy who has been making snide remarks and allegations and so forth. I have seen the great work done in Glencolumbcille, the wonderful community development there, embracing agriculture, industry, tourism and craft works under the magnificent guidance of Fr. McDyer backed up <Col N="587" /> by the full support of Roinn na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann. I have seen the wonderful cooperative in Corca Dhuibhne, fully backed by the Department, and the special development agency, Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of the fact that Commissioner Thomson at a seminar in Galway referred to the great development that had taken place on Inis Mór in the Aran Islands.  He said it was the most outstanding example of regional development he had seen in the matter of modern technology in that corner of Ireland, where he had seen electricity being laid on all over the island, water being supplied and small industries being established.  The fruits are being seen of the efforts of my colleague, Deputy Dick Burke, in making available in the island full post-primary educational facilities up to leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>That is the situation right through the Gaeltacht.  It is a wonderful thing to see.  On the other hand, as I have travelled through the areas, I have met deputations from communities, church leaders and lay people from local communities from outside the official Gaeltacht asking that something be done to enable them to generate the same type of community development as in the Gaeltacht communities.  I recall Bangor Erris&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have seen it in Ardrath in County Donegal, but because one half of it is outside the official Gaeltacht and the other half is inside it is a problem.  There is Inis Mór.  There are English speaking islands.  I am conscious of the pleas from many people about the economic and social problems in non-Gaeltacht islands, some of them off Mayo.  They have the same economic and social problems as the Gaeltacht islands. They are in need of medical and other social services.  It is a crying shame in this nation that our island people have been deprived of these for so long.  There is a crying need for them <Col N="588" /> in the non-Gaeltacht parts of Connacht and Donegal.  I have had pleas from individuals seeking this overall comprehensive policy.</P>
      <P>The case, therefore, is clear-cut: the concept of a Western Development Board is a logical one, a practical one and I have no doubt that through it we will be able to generate the economic and social development which will enable the young people attending school in those areas at least to have the choice of finding suitable employment at home that will provide them with a decent standard of living.  I am proud the Government have decided to set up the board and I am particularly proud of the enthusiastic welcome it received on all sides throughout the west following the announcement. There have been all sort of allegations and suggestions by Deputies Colley and Brennan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>What will the board be?  They will be a development agency on the same lines generally brought into being, for the same reasons, as Gaeltarra Éireann, charged with responsibility for implementing a proper development programme for Connacht and Donegal.  As I pointed out in Westport, they will not be an industrial development agency only.  They will have responsibility for promoting overall development in agriculture, industry, tourism, fisheries and the natural resources.  They will work out and co-ordinate the activities of the various State agencies just as SFADCo are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not listening to me.  The Shannon Development Company have responsibility for promoting industrial development and tourism.  The Western Development Board will be concerned with tourism, industrial development, agriculture and fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>SFADCo have no responsibility for fisheries.  One very important qualification here is that the Government very rightly decided to provide a blueprint from the top on which there will be full consultation with the various agencies already working in the field so that the experience of such bodies as SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann will be called on, because as time goes on it will be necessary to design or to devise a board which, as the Taoiseach pointed out in Castlebar, will utilise all the resources of the region, assured of the full co-operation of all the agencies already operating in the region and co-ordinating all their activities into a comprehensive overall development strategy.</P>
      <P>That is what regional development is all about.  Deputies Brennan and Colley asked about the other regions. I said in Westport, and it was widely reported in the media, that the Western Development Board are another milestone on the road towards the formulation of a national regional development strategy.  I said that the problem and the needs of other regions were being looked at by the Government, but the western region now being covered is the one that has the greatest problems.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt the board will be a good one that will be able, through consultation, to generate throughout Connacht and Donegal, in the non-Gaeltacht areas, the same type of dynamic community development that is to be found in Glencolumbcille, Corca Dhuibhne, Cois Fhairrge and other such areas, in north Connemara, Mayo, Donegal and the English speaking off-shore islands.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHerbert" hpid="Mr. Herbert Mr. Herbert">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Herbert</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us realise that the Government has no regional policy.  When we examine the way they distributed our current allocation from the regional fund it is obvious it was allocated for reasons of sheer political expediency.  There was no sign or trace of any regional policy in the allocation.</P>
      <P>Some months ago, through the mechanism of a question on the Adjournment, I attempted to uncover the manner in which the Government intended to spend or use our regional fund allocation.  I had genuine fears that the fund was going to be misspent and used to subvent the Exchequer. I said this could be done easily by a Minister for Finance, by an administrative sleight-of-hand, because of certain provisions of the amended regulations.  I pointed out that all of Ireland was deemed to be an underdeveloped area and that a large portion of the capital budget, especially that dealing with infrastructure, would be considered appropriate expenditure under the fund criteria.  This, coupled with the fact that the Government intended to activate the partial repayment clause of one of the fund regulations, ensured that it would be very easy for a Minister to subsume our fund allocation into the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fears have not been dispelled. On the contrary they are now very real because what I forecast has happened. There is no extra money being spent on regional development.  The money alleged to be spent on the various projects was already earmarked. It is true to say that industrial projects, alleged to be receiving aid from the regional fund, have been asked to acknowledge portion of the money as coming from the regional fund.  What could be more dishonest? I have evidence of this in one specific <Col N="591" /> project in County Monaghan and I can supply more details.</P>
    <P>Why did the Government not publish the amounts given to individual projects or areas, as did all the other member states?  Recently I was furnished with a document at a meeting of the Regional Policy Committee of the European Parliament and I saw that every member state, with the exception of Ireland, published the amount of their allocation to their various regions.  We were the only culprit in this matter.  Italy, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, Denmark and Holland all gave a detailed and comprehensive résumé of how they were going to spend their regional fund allocations and they specifically mentioned the amounts going to each area.  All the Italian regions in the Mezzogiorno have been mentioned and the number of projects, the type of projects, whether infrastructural or industrial, whether there was an agricultural content, have been set out.  There is specific mention of the amount of money allocated to each region.</P>
    <P>For some peculiar reason our Government have withheld this vital information.  Why is it a closely guarded secret?  It is contrary to article 14, paragraph 1, of the fund regulations which states very clearly:</P>
    <P>The investors concerned shall be informed by agreement with the member states in question that part of the aid granted them has been provided by the Community for infrastructure projects.  The member states by agreement with the Commission shall take all necessary steps to ensure that assistance from the fund is given maximum publicity.</P>
    <P>This publicity should go right across the board.  It should not be merely descriptive but it should tell the actual amount of aid given to each individual project or to each individual region.</P>
    <P>To dispel all doubts and ambiguity about the spending of regional aid, I am asking the Government to do as the Italians are doing.  In his contribution the Minister referred to the Casa del Mezzogiorno and he compared <Col N="592" /> his western development board with the Italian board.  He was quite correct in this because the Italians are looking after the development of the depressed regions of the Mezzogiorno. However, there is a very great difference between the two cases because the Italian Government have given all their regional allocation to the Casa del Mezzogiorno.  At this moment the necessary legislation is being discussed in the Italian Senate to enshrine it in legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Government embark on a similar operation here. This would dispel all my fears and suspicions.  It would dispel, too, the fears and suspicions of the people in the underprivileged regions.  Such legislation should be introduced immediately so that it will be available as soon as the new board becomes statutory. The legislation would be simple and would be in keeping with the commitments made by Fianna Fáil to the people in those under-privileged regions during the referendum campaign. We promised that our allocation <i>in toto</i> from the fund would be devoted to these areas so as to correct national imbalances before such time as we would tackle the question of community imbalances.</P>
    <P>Another matter that caused me much anxiety was the decision of the Council of Ministers to reduce by 33? per cent the payments appropriation in the 1976 budget in relation to the regional development fund.  The fund and our allocation were small enough without making it smaller.  The net result of this action will mean that the expenditure of the fund will now be spread over a period of five or six years instead of the original intention, as envisaged at the Paris Summit in December, 1974, of having it spread over a three-year period.  Contrary to the decision taken by the heads of state at that summit, the Council of Ministers have settled for a five-year period.  Our allocation will be eroded greatly by inflation so that in the fifth or sixth year our allocation will be appreciably devalued.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to learn what stand the Minister took at the meeting at which this decision was reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> He may say such meetings are confidential. However, during the past couple of years we have had experience of Ministers rushing to give Press conferences if the outcome of a meeting was in Ireland's favour.  They have hailed such outcomes as being in the nature of personal victories.  But if the outcome was not in our favour we had the spectacle of the Minister concerned blaming the Commission.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is notorious in this respect.  In fact, he has evoked the wrath of Commissioner Lardinois.</P>
    <P>On an Adjournment debate here I asked the Minister whether aid would be given under article 4 paragraph (c) of the fund regulation.  That article refers to investments in infrastructures as embodied in article 3, paragraph 2, of the Council directive on hill and mountain farming and farming in certain less-favoured areas.  The less-favoured areas in question must correspond with or be located within one of the regions covered by article 3 of the regulation.  Paragraph 2 of article 3 of the Council directive states that these areas must have adequate infrastructure, including access roads to farms, electricity and drinking water and, in tourist and recreational areas, facilities for disposal of sewage. It states that if such amenity should be lacking their provision should be envisaged in the near future in public amenity programmes.</P>
    <P>The provision of this type of infrastructure for the disadvantaged areas is permissible under an article of the regional fund regulation.  As reported at column 1863 of the Official Report for May 14th last a question was tabled to the Minister for Transport and Power in relation to huge amounts being requested by the ESB for connections to outlying areas.  The subsidy had been withdrawn and it was stated by Deputy Gallagher that in some instances sums of £1,200 were being demanded by the ESB in respect of connections.</P>
    <P>We were informed that this service would not qualify for a FEOGA grant unless it related to agriculture production, because the installation of electricity <Col N="594" /> for domestic purposes would not be allowed under the FEOGA regulations.  Did the Minister wilfully withhold the information or, perhaps, he was not aware of the fact that under Article 4 (2) of the Regional Fund regulation it is possible to get EEC aid for this type of operation &mdash;the provision of electricity, drinking water and access roads to farm and, in tourist and recreation areas, for the disposal of sewerage.  This was why I was so attracted to this particular article and this was my reason for putting down a question to the Minister for Finance.  Nothing has happened. No application has been made under this article.</P>
    <P>I was in west Mayo for the last few days and I experienced conditions there.  There are literally miles of unsurfaced roads.  The surfacing of these roads is quite outside the resources of the Mayo ratepayers.  People must have proper access.  Deputy Staunton is aware of the conditions and is he also aware that this type of infrastructure can be provided?  Drinking water can be provided?  I have seen people in Mayo hauling buckets of water. I was a member of the European parliamentary committee on regional policy and we fought a very arduous battle to get a realistic allocation of regional aid and we certainly influenced Commissioner Thomson to take a liberal view of our case.  He admitted that himself.  We fought for two-and-a-half years for the under-privileged areas so that certain amenities would be provided for those who live in them.  I was on a road last night which serves quite a big number of houses, on the townland of Ceimagh in the Belmullet peninsula.  It is a road used by tourists for six months of the year. It is also used by fishermen.  I was told that the residents believe most people will be dead before the road is properly surfaced.  This is an appalling state of affairs.  An expenditure of a few thousand pounds out of our allocation of £6 million this year would put things right.  Apparently we cannot afford money for the provision of these basic amenities.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us figures about the increasing population.  I heard last <Col N="595" /> night in Belmullet that emigration is once more raising its ugly head and, if things continue as they are, the flow of people out will become a raging torrent.  A man informed me who came back from England four years ago, having spent 20 years there, that he would not return to Mayo now.</P>
    <P>The Government have no regional policy and no national programme. A programme of regional policy must be submitted to the Commission by 1977.  The programme should now be well advanced.  I understand that Deputy Colley as Minister for Finance requested the RDOs to draw up plans for their various regions so that these could be co-ordinated into a proper regional programme and an overall national policy.  Unfortunately, Deputy Colley moved over to this side of the House and nothing has happened since.  I have been told by officers in certain RDOs that they have programmes drawn up but there is no response from the Government.</P>

I would appeal to the Government to do what the Italian Government are doing at this very moment in respect of their allocation of regional aid.  They are bringing in the appropriate legislation.  We must do the same to ensure that our allocation next year and in the future will be spent in those areas in which it was intended originally the money would be spent, the underdeveloped areas of the western seaboard, Cork and Kerry included. The Minister for the Gaeltacht omitted these two counties from his western development board.  I presume he has taken other measures to cater for these two very needy counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Motion put down by Deputy Colley.  I regret that my time is limited.  The motion deplores the failure of the Government to formulate and implement a regional policy designed to stimulate the growth of the less developed parts of the country. It does not seem altogether fitting that this motion should come from a party who, in the latter years of their administration, were subject to the most intense criticism from sources in addition to political sources, and from vocational interests on the lack of any activity in this field.</P>
      <P>Deputy Herbert spoke of his recent ventures into County Mayo, and the lack of development in County Mayo, with which I agree.  I agree there are many projects which need to be undertaken in that county and, indeed, in other western counties, which are beyond the capacity of the ratepayers. I wonder has it occurred to Deputy Herbert, coming from Limerick, coming from the mid-west region, to reflect on the organisational structures under which, apparently, an entirely different system operates for the economic development of the mid-west region in comparison with that which operates in the western counties, apart from the Gaeltacht areas.  That fundamental difference of administration and the lack of the same degree of autonomy in western regions are to a degree, responsible for the very lack of development to which he was a witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke at length about the EEC allocation.  Let us put it into context. In this year we are talking about, we are talking about a grant of somewhere between £6 million and £8 million which is very small relative to the total budget.  There is no need to make a dog's dinner out of this. It is an important matter.  Exaggerating this question at this time is not very helpful.  Let us give the background to this issue of regional development. Sometimes there is confusion about two aspects when we speak about regional development and regional policy.  Of course, funds are important and money is important <Col N="597" /> because, without money, you cannot get your investment moving and you cannot create wealth or jobs.  Also of great importance so far as any regional policy is concerned, is the issue of organisation and the structure of organisation and the degree to which autonomy rests within a region, or the philosophy of the Government in regard to the centralisation of the State, or this very issue of autonomy.</P>
    <P>We are speaking about this issue of regional development especially as it pertains to the west.  Deputy Colley referred to the less developed regions. We are speaking about a background of disillusionment and imbalance.  If those who have a vocational interest in the subject, apart from wanting to milk whatever political advantage there is in it, look at political decisions and Governmental decisions made in the past 20 years, what do they see?  They see in this mid-west region from which Deputy Herbert came to Mayo and came to Dublin today, a structure under SFADCo which bears no relationship whatever to any other organisational structure for economic development, with the sole exception of the organisation for economic development under Roinn na Gaeltachta, under the direction of the Minister for the Gaeltacht, through Gaeltarra Éireann.</P>
    <P>Let us pay a compliment to the Opposition.  Let us pay a compliment to their decision when in Government. No doubt at that time they were criticised for that decision, as we are being criticised for a certain decision this week.  Let us say with hindsight that it was a good decision.  Why had we to wait ten, 15 or 20 years after that decision to learn certain lessons?  Why could we not stand still at some stage and ask has SFADCo been a success or a failure?  Should we amend it? Should we scrap it?  Should we further develop it?  Should we democratise it a little further?  Instead of that footsie was played, and we had regional development when it was fashionable to be regional engaged in by semi-State bodies and by Government Departments and other Government agencies, all going off at a tangent and all setting up their separate regional <Col N="598" /> structures and their own little bodies of autonomy, entirely unrelated and unco-ordinated with other semi-State bodies or Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We had the setting up of regional development organisations under Fianna Fáil.  What purpose did they serve?  In general terms, in large counties they were two county units. The two county unit for some purposes was too small and for other purposes too big.  They are demanding statutory powers.  If you give statutory powers to an RDO, you tend to weaken the local authority, which is the last thing I want to do as a Deputy on this side of the House. During those years why did we not look at the experience we had in autonomy and decentralisation?  Why did we not take a look at the level of industrial development in the mid-west region, the level of job opportunities, and the level of State investment and learn something.  That lesson was not learned.</P>
    <P>Additionally, if we speak about the Gaeltacht, and an organisation within the Gaeltacht, it seems to me that there is a necessity for a separate policy without question, when we think in terms of national identity, our culture, our aspirations, our past and our history.  When we get into the economic area, we are talking about an entirely different kettle of fish.  For many years speeches have been made about the necessity for a separate economic policy in the less-developed areas of the Gaeltacht, about the merits of autonomy, the merits of decentralisation, the merits of community participation.  If it is necessary in the less developed regions of the Gaeltacht, by definition, if we are speaking in terms of economics, it is equally necessary in the Gaeltacht, or the English speaking areas of the less-developed regions.  Within the very backward regions an imbalance is being created.  For example, in Connemara, without going to Mayo at all, the imbalance is being created through the total neglect of north Connemara because of the craziness of the policies we have inherited in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the islands. What is the explanation of a special <Col N="599" /> policy for Aran and a total lack of concern for the islands of Innisturk and Innisboffin where the Government have not got the statutory function they have in the other islands and where people are equally under-privileged? That is the background to this issue of a western development board.  Unfortunately, I have not got sufficient time to develop these points.</P>
    <P>We have been charged with issuing a blatant political ploy for by-election purposes with the announcement by the Minister for the Gaeltacht of the Government's decision to establish a western development board.  There is a background on record in the Institute of Public Administration about the fact that this is the most centralised country in Europe.  There is a background in a policy document issued by Macra na Feirme four or five years ago suggesting the establishment of a western development board. There is a background in a Fine Gael policy document entitled &ldquo;A Policy for People, March, 1971&rdquo;, in which it is stated quite clearly that such a body should be established and that the other body would be a new body of a similar type to SFADCo whose efforts would be concentrated on the least developed parts of the country in the north-west and north midlands.</P>
    <P>There is a background in that at the Labour Party annual conferences in Galway in 1971 it was stated that the Labour Party would establish a regional development board for the west.  There is a background because of the special interest of the Taoiseach in this project.  He wrote me a letter on 9th July, 1974, as a result of representations made.  He said that in November, 1973, he instigated an investigation into the possibility of having these ideas put into effect.  There is a background for the Minister for the Public Services at a function in Westport in February last where he stated that the Government were considering the establishment of this board. An invitation was accepted by the Minister for the Gaeltacht to a vocational study on regional policy before there was an issue of a by-election in West Mayo.  This background is <Col N="600" /> genuine, vocational, interested and sincere.  For many years when we were in Opposition we shouted &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let me give you a tiny example within the region of Mayo about which we are speaking at present. If we are talking about industrial development within Gaeltacht areas, I shall tell the House of a change of policy made there by the present Minister.  At a meeting we had with Gaeltarra Éireann about four years ago when there was great controversy in Erris about industrial development we were informed by Gaeltarra Éireann that their brief from the then Minister for the Gaeltacht was to apportion industrial grants in Gaeltacht areas proportionate to the deontas.  On a deontas basis Erris was at the bottom of the list of the three major Gaeltachtaí.  That is an example of the lunacy we inherited, a policy which was changed very quickly by the Minister for the Gaeltacht on coming into Government and which has led to an infinitely greater amount of development, buoyancy and hope in that part of Mayo.</P>
    <P>Additionally, there is a background from the people because in the last general election the change was in the west.  I am not complimenting ourselves on that because the politics of the west for years has been one of protests.  It has been a protest vote against the Establishment whether it be Fianna Fáil or a national Coalition. Certainly, if we do not respond to the people who elected us and to whom we said we would attempt to break through the appalling situation of this region and do something about it, we shall go before the electorate.  And rightly they will come and will do to us what they did in the past.  Therefore, there is a mandate from them too.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Colley last evening said there was no indication of the regions, functions, powers or money of this Western Development Board the Government have announced.  It seems to me that the Government had two options in this area.  They could introduce a cast-iron board with authoritative decisions and definitions being made without consultation and, <Col N="601" /> in an arbitrary sense, could have said: &ldquo;This is it.&rdquo;  Alternatively, their only option was to make a broad decision in principle inviting consultation.  They took the latter course which was the wise course and there was not an in-between.  Certainly the cast-iron approach with all the various lobbies coming in to show all of the reasons why they believed the decisions made to be wrong&mdash;could be very wrong.</P>
    <P>There is no question of this board interfering with existing bodies.  The necessity rather exists because of the total lack of co-ordination with regional groups of semi-State bodies, of Government Departments going at tangents and overlapping.  They are merely centralised structures in the sense that they are responsible to their individual bodies in Dublin.  The decision making is done in the capital city.  There is not the degree of decision making or autonomy within the province which we seek.  If there is no merit in what we are saying, why should we laud what is happening in the mid-west or in Gaeltarra Éireann? Would it not be logical to scrap SFADCo, scrap Gaeltarra Éireann because that is the logical conclusion? If there is merit in what has been happening in SFADCo and in Gaeltarra Éireann, then there is merit in developing this board along the lines which are sensible, rational and reasonable.</P>
    <P>There are simple examples of why it is necessary.  We saw one such example with the development of Ballyglass harbour in North Mayo. We saw money voted by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to build a harbour but no commitment was made by that Department to build the road.  Yet it was an entirely separate agency which was involved in the road, Mayo County Council, which did not have the resources within it to fund a road for that specific purpose, and so we had a terrible mess.  But if one has a body within the province responsible directly to a Cabinet Minister, in the sense that Gaeltarra Éireann is at present responsible to the Minister for the Gaeltacht, then that simply could not have happened because there would have been co-ordinated planning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> In so far as what this board might or might not do, I should like to reassure people who think that it would take over existing functions to a substantial degree.  My judgment is that that is not what is required.  I do not see it as being a board that will scrap the functions of the IDA in the regions or those of Bord Fáilte.  As a Deputy interested in this, rather would I see it as a board presided over by a Cabinet Minister containing representatives of the regional directors of such semi-State bodies, county managers and county councils, with an interlocking, co-ordinating and planning function being carried out by such a board in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, with the Industrial Development Authority, BIM and other bodies.</P>
    <P>We have got to get away from the farce with which we have been living&mdash; the farce of the islands, the farce of the non-Gaeltacht areas, the dishonesty in Irish life at present where there are villages on the fringe of Gaeltachtaí craving to be put into the Gaeltachtaí when, of course, they should not because they do not speak Irish.  The answer is to have a policy which would mean such Gaeltacht districts could put the same type of show on the road which we are witnessing in the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence my concluding remarks by complimenting Deputy Staunton on making some reference to regional policy in this debate, to what has happened in the past and trying to apply it to the present.  It is not a compliment I can pay either to the Minister for Finance or to the Minister for the Gaeltacht who were the other two speakers on <Col N="603" /> the Government side.  They studiously avoided the whole question of regional policy and for reasons which are quite understandable.  I hope to come to the points made by Deputy Staunton who is, in my view, on the right lines except that he is unaware of certain developments that took place.</P>
      <P>The first speaker on the Government side was the Minister for Finance.  We had from him what can fairly be described as a blustering, cross-roads, by-election speech.  Of course, we had the usual abuse we get from the Minister for Finance, the usual switching of statistics.  In one breath he was speaking about the number of jobs and, in the next breath, about the moneys spent on job creation without reference to inflation.  Wherever the figures seemed to suit him he used them, switching them around mercilessly but we are used to that from him.  What we did not hear from the Minister for Finance was any reference to regional policy or the attitude of the Government to it.  Not once did the Minister for Finance, when speaking yesterday and not once today did the Minister for the Gaeltacht, when speaking, use the words &ldquo;growth centres&rdquo;.  Not once did they indicate the Government's attitude on this basic question of any regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Gaeltacht complained that I had not, by my speech, induced reasoned debate on this matter.  I want to remind the Minister for the Gaeltacht that I examined briefly, in the short time available, the major recommendation of the Buchanan Report and what happened after that.  Of course, all of that boiled down to a general attitude of Government in regard to this proposition of growth centres. There was not one word from the two Ministers who spoke on that topic. This motion deplores the failure of the Government to formulate and implement a regional policy.  The omission of the two Ministers concerned to advert in any way to a national, regional policy is of itself sufficient justification for putting down this motion and voting for it because, if any confirmation were needed of the <Col N="604" /> fact that this Government have no regional policy, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Gaeltacht gave us that confirmation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the fact that we were working towards a comprehensive, national, regional development policy and that the Western Development Board was another milestone on that road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. This was the point with which Deputy Staunton was dealing.  I drew attention yesterday by quoting from the relevant documents to what happened. I drew attention to the fact that in 1969 the then Fianna Fáil Government decided on a policy of regionalising the administration of the IDA. They also announced a policy of setting up regional groups to co-ordinate the activities not only of the IDA but of the local authorities and of tourism bodies and others in the different regions. That policy was implemented. At the time that was being done in this House I said, and was questioned by Members of the Government then on this side of the House, that I regarded the SFADCo model as the one to work towards, that that is what I wanted to see happening in the other regions which we had designated, the nine regions, and that I envisaged in due course, when we had experience of these operating in the different regions, the setting up of companies such as SFADCo in each of the regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are nine SFADCos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, for each region. Now what do we get today?  The spelling out to a slight extent of the by-election announcement of the Western Development Board, but what is that? That is putting the clock back to 1969. That is announcing with a big flourish that the Government are now setting up what we set up years ago.  The only difference I can see is that the region is different.  As I understand it from what the Minister for the Gaeltacht said, it is the province of Connacht plus Donegal and excluding the Gaeltacht areas.  That, as a region, is not <Col N="605" /> one of the nine regions we announced. That is perfectly legitimate if the Government want to do that.  But is it not reasonable to expect that if they had a regional policy in relation to this region they are now designating they would say, &ldquo;We are not adhering to the regions previously operated for the following reasons: (a) (b) (c).&rdquo;? People could then weigh up whether that was a good or a bad decision.  No reason has been given for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a logical unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will not deny that no reason has been given by him or the Minister for Finance, inside or outside this House, for that region.  I am not saying there is not a good reason; I am saying it was not given.  It is just one of the aspects of the reasons that should have been given and it was not.  The Government were asked to explain what would be the role, for instance, of the IDA regional offices, of the county development teams and the local authorities in relation to this proposed development board.  The Minister said yesterday in this debate, that the role of the Western Development Board would be &ldquo;in substitution for this multitude of overlapping bodies&rdquo;, and the Minister for the Gaeltacht nodded his head and agreed when he said it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister for Finance was asked questions today such as I asked last night, and he said something similar to what the Minister for the Gaeltacht said tonight. Anybody who was listening to him will have heard the Minister for the Gaeltacht talk about the functions of the IDA, of tourism functions and so on, and I asked him was he saying that these were going to be vested in this Western Development Board.  The Minister will recall this.  I asked, &ldquo;Is it going to be the same as SFADCo?&rdquo; and he said, &ldquo;Yes, it is, except SFADCo have fisheries&rdquo;.  When I had got that information the Minister suddenly remembered that that was a rather dangerous statement to make and he went back to what the Minister <Col N="606" /> for Finance was saying today and said, &ldquo;Of course, we are going to engage in widespread consultation&rdquo;. Either you are going to engage in widespread consultation and you do not know what is going to happen, or you have made up your mind as to what is going to happen, one or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, you have made a decision or you have not made a decision because, of course, you are going to engage in widespread consultation. But you cannot have it both ways because if what is involved is co-ordination of these activities you are putting the clock back to 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government were to say now: &ldquo;We feel that the organisation set up in the past in the various regions should now be developed into something like SFADCo in their particular regions and that the regions should have changed&rdquo;, and were to give reasons for their various decisions, I certainly would not quarrel with that as a policy.  I might disagree with the reasons given or I might not&mdash;I might agree with thought it could be improved.  But them&mdash;but it would indicate determination by the Government to have a regional policy, to develop what is there and to improve it if they that is not what we have got.  It is very significant that neither of the Ministers in the debate have referred to what has happened in the past or used the words &ldquo;growth centres&rdquo;.  The only one who attempted to go even near this question of the continuity and development of what was there already and how it should be changed was Deputy Staunton, but Deputy Staunton cannot deny that if you look at what has been announced as a Western Development Board, and if it is not going to interfere with the activities of the IDA in the region or the tourism body in the region or the local authority, then it is going to co-ordinate.  May I refer the House <Col N="607" /> to the Government's statement setting up the groups, which was issued on 19th May, 1969:</P>
      <P>The main function of these groups will be to co-ordinate the programmes for regional development in each region.</P>
      <P>That was 1969, and it was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done, but if it is not being done properly and if it is necessary to give legislative power in certain areas to those groups, well and good; let us argue about it.  The whole dishonesty of this proposal, announced in anticipation of the by-election is that the Government cannot tell us, even when closely questioned, what the board is going to do in relation to these various bodies such as the IDA regional office, such as the county development team, such as the local tourism organisation.  When they cannot tell us what is going to happen about that, when they cannot tell us whether any money is going to be given to it or, if it is, whether that is going to come from any of these bodies&mdash;and that is what emerges from the parliamentary question replied to by the Minister for Finance today to Deputy Hugh Gibbons&mdash;when they cannot say any of these things, is it not quite clear that no thought whatever has been given to this, that it is purely a gimmick to pretend that something great will be done for the west?  We know the value of that kind of an approach, one that has no regard for regional policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one wants confirmation of the fact that there is no regional policy with this Government, one has only to look at what they have been doing in regard to the EEC fund.  Because it is small that is all the more reason why it should be concentrated to operate effectively.  It has been spread throughout the whole country and there is some notion that because the whole country is accepted for EEC purposes as eligible under the regional fund, all the money should be <Col N="608" /> spent there.  There is no obligation whatever to do that, and there is a risk, if we do it, that countries which are contributing substantially to the EEC will refuse to do it if they see that money being spent in areas which are not by any means deprived compared with some other areas of this country.  We find that this money, which is supposed to be allocated and given publicity as coming from the EEC, is being allocated in respect of one project which, as Deputy Joe Brennan mentioned last night, was carried out in Donegal seven years ago, and this is now part of the allocation of the EEC Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>This is reducing the whole thing to a farce and any benefit that could have been got for this country from the EEC Regional Fund is being dissipated and thrown away because again the Minister for Finance is simply snaffling it for the Exchequer.  He used very accusatory tones last night but he did not specifically say what was wrong with what was said on this side of the House.  If money is, as he said, being allocated on top of the ordinary allocations in respect of the amount received from the EEC fund, how much is the ordinary allocation? Who is going to know what is the ordinary allocation and what is the additional one?  Nobody could possibly know that except the Minister for Finance looking into his own heart, and I am afraid that I and many other people do not have sufficient confidence in the Minister to accept that the ordinary allocations of the fund are going to be augmented to the amount of the EEC Regional Fund so received.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the manner in which the Government have approached the EEC Regional Fund, from the announcement we have had for the by-election, the utter disregard for any basic national regional policy, from the total silence on the Government side in regard to the vital question of the Government's attitude to growth centres, from the action of the Government in opening up the small dwellings programme to Dublin so that the incentive is the same in one part of the country as in <Col N="609" /> another that there is no regional policy under this Government.  Dáil Éireann would do very well to deplore the failure of the Government to produce a regional policy and to implement <Col N="610" /> it and so benefit the poorer areas of this country and in particular the west of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every Deputy is realising more and more the complication of our system of administration of social welfare payments.  I am referring to the case of a person who has been employed for a number of years.  He becomes ill and sends in a certificate claiming benefit.  Next he is informed by the Department that because the employer has not submitted his insurance cards for the previous year his benefit cannot be paid. Or it may be due to some mistake the doctor made in completing the certificate and, as always, it is the person who should be receiving benefit who is victimised.  This may result in delay for two, three, four or five weeks while the Department are investigating the claim.  As a result, the claimant is humbled into the position that he has to go to the local home assistance officer for home assistance.  Then when he gets his national health benefit the problem arises that the home assistance has to be paid back.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why, since we have such efficient officials in the Department and down the country, the offices in the various towns could not be used for some sort of what is now commonly referred to as a fire brigade service whereby they could issue a voucher pending investigation of the claim, a somewhat similar situation to that which would arise regarding home assistance.  If a person submits a claim and there is some technical hitch, due to late submission of cards or due to the certificate not being received in the Department, the claimant is without his money.  Why what I have suggested has not been done in the Department of Social Welfare is beyond me, because generally in 95 per cent of the cases following investigation the claim is honoured. The Parliamentary Secretary may say that possibly the Department could pay out money under this system to people who should not receive it because they had not sufficient contributions or had never submitted a certificate.  But I think it better, particularly in regard to social welfare, that the person should receive the benefit even though the Department might lose 4 per cent or 5 per cent over a period of years.  I am sure every Deputy will agree that each week much of his constituency work involves ringing the Department of Social Welfare to find out why some benefit has not been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Added to this complication we have pay-related benefits.  The worker has to get his reference number and the income tax office must certify his total taxable earnings in the previous year.  This takes three or four weeks. It amazes me when I see cases of people who had worked a full year <Col N="613" /> being certified by the tax office as having earned only £900.  I have heard of cases where an employer certified a worker's gross earnings as being £1,850 but the return from the income tax office was £950.  I do not know whose fault it is.  I do not think it should be based on income tax returns.  I cannot see why the employer's certificate should not be sufficient.  If the Department were to get suspicious of an employer they could verify the figures through the inspector of taxes rather than have the employee kept waiting and probably being victimised through the present complicated machinery. All social welfare recipients should be able to get their money more quickly and thus not be subjected to the hardship caused by delays. Some time ago there was a suggestion&mdash;I do not know if it has been implemented&mdash;that where the employer has not sent in a worker's cards the worker should be paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a desirable development.  We come now to the real crunch point.  Nobody, not even the Parliamentary Secretary, is aware of the worry there is today as to how social welfare payments will be financed. When the Parliamentary Secretary notified the recent increases, there was no money coming into the Current Account.  In other words, we are now borrowing certain sums from Arabia, America or perhaps Europe, to pay social welfare benefits.  If we were to borrow money from the Arabs or anybody else with which to build houses, it is a capital investment: people go into the houses and pay rents and rates and this money will pay off the loan to the State who in turn will pay off their creditors.  But where money is borrowed to pay <Col N="614" /> social welfare benefits it is gone&mdash; there is no income from it except, possibly, through VAT.</P>
      <P>This is a very serious situation when one realises that the total borrowing of the State is costing £400 million to fund.  What will happen next year? We will have borrowed sufficient money to pay social welfare benefits for the present year only and will have to borrow again next year to keep up the payments, and with inflation increasing, further increases will have to be given next year in benefits.  How will that money be repaid? Will the taxpayer in three or four years be asked to pay 10 per cent or 15 per cent more?</P>
      <P>Another point that has come up often for debate at political organisation meetings is income tax on pensions. I know the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me that old age and widows' pensions are not subject to income tax.  If a widow has £634 of a tax-free allowance and she has a widow's pension of £500, her tax-free allowance is a net £134.  I was speaking to a woman last weekend whose pension per month from the husband's employment is £18.  She had the widow's pension as well and because of that she had to pay £2 per week income tax.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will agree this should not happen.  Her contributory pension is based on the lifetime employment of her husband who had paid income tax on his earnings and social welfare contributions.  Why should she have to pay income tax again on her pension? Technically such an income is not taxable, but taking account of the tax-free allowance such a person has to pay £2 per week.  That is tragic for a person with such a small income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of publicity has been given in the past couple of years to increases in social welfare benefits since the Coalition took office.  Against such increases we must put a 28 per cent inflation rate and we then find that the net living standard of such people has decreased by 8 per cent since February, 1973.  In other words, increases given have not offset the costof-living increase.  The £1 increase given is worth only 75p because of <Col N="615" /> inflation.  Therefore, social welfare recipients are not any better off than in 1973.  They are worse off. The Parliamentary Secretary must have a chat with the Minister for Finance about this if there is a January budget because widows with young families and single old age pensioners are worse off today than they were in 1973 due to the very high cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>One feels that if we all followed the example of the Good Samaritan such exercises as Social Welfare Acts might not be necessary.  But I am afraid that will not happen in our time or for a long time after.  I should like to join with the Parliamentary Secretary and the other Deputies in paying a tribute to the staff of the Department because they get through so much work and documentation with so few mistakes.  From time to time I see some of those mistakes, and I cannot understand how they are so few. One must pay a tribute to the staff when one realises the amount of papers which pass through the Department, that practically all books and forms have to be changed from one year to another, and on this occasion changed for a second time, and the colossal amount of work demanding attention to detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to unemployment assistance or, as it is known, the dole, in view of the fact that there was some controversy about this recently. It is my opinion that but for unemployment assistance the population in the west would be fewer than it is.  This subsidy to the small farmers has helped keep them over the years.  It has been criticised from time to time and one must agree with some of this criticism. It is unfortunate that it was labelled &ldquo;unemployment assistance&rdquo;.  It is now being realised that it could have been given another name.  It could be labelled a subsidy to tide the small farmers over the period until they become big farmers.  It is true to say that every small farmer who hopes to continue to make his living on the land has a big farmer inside him trying to get out.  He is always looking for extra land and hopes that some day he will <Col N="616" /> get enough to take him out of the category of the small farmer so he can call himself a big farmer.  For this reason much of the talk heard and the emotion spent on the small farmer is misplaced.  I am sure it is not the intention of any Deputy to perpetuate the small farmer, particularly the man living on the small income.  It is alleged that he is getting money for doing nothing.  This aspect was considered in the past and the system of estimating means was changed so that it became more compatible with the productive capacity of the man who hoped to draw social welfare assistance.  This was a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, let us consider the amount of money this State pays to big farmers&mdash;dairy farmers and beef producers.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and now the EEC fund, pay a great deal of money to keep those people on their land and provide a living for them.  These people have sufficient land and resources to provide an adequate living for themselves and their families without having recourse to the finances of the State. Of course they are giving extra production to the State and this is of economic benefit.  But this is where I criticise unemployment assistance.  It has not been tied up in such a way that it could be used to increase the productive capacity of the people to whom it is payable.  As I mentioned, an effort was made in this direction in the past but it probably was not carried far enough.</P>
    <P>There are people who because of illness or age have not the capacity to produce off the land they own.  The number of people drawing unemployment assistance should be examined and the people given unemployment or sickness benefit.  As has been mentioned in this House several times, this is not a new idea.  But the Department of Social Welfare did not get around to it, perhaps because the amount of work involved and the system there at the moment is acceptable enough.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned criticism of the present increases in social welfare.  It was also alleged that some people are getting more on social welfare than they would earn.  This is probably a fault <Col N="617" /> in the system, but it appears to arise as a result of the pay-related system. In view of the fact that this will continue for 12 months only even if the unfortunate man gets more than he earns he will need it when his pay-related benefit runs out.  Therefore, I do not think we can complain too much about that.</P>
    <P>It is also alleged that many people drawing unemployment benefit are working or are able to work.  This brings up the question of the definition of &ldquo;ability to work&rdquo;.  We can all see the exaggerated case of the man with one arm who, if he gets suitable employment, can earn an acceptable rate. On the other hand a man who appears to be in good health may be drawing unemployment benefit and be unable to work.</P>
    <P>A man has a right to employment. It is well to put on record that a former Minister for Industry and Commerce years ago made the statement that there was no obligation on a Government to provide work for anybody.  Fianna Fáil did away with this fable when they came to power. As I said, a man is entitled to work but is he also entitled to work for which he has been trained and at which he may have spent 25 years or more; or must he be still labelled as employable even though he has to pursue a totally different type of work?  Cognisance is taken of this in the present thinking by virtue of retraining, but there is not retraining for everybody in this class.  It could be argued that a man is not alone entitled to work but is entitled to work for which he has been trained.  This is a certain justification for him to draw unemployment benefit, even though there may be other work available for which he was not trained or which is not congenial to him.  I have no doubt some people hold a completely different view on this.</P>
    <P>The problem of disability benefit, which involves the element of sickness, also arises.  In spite of all the criticism, I would say that the abuses constitute about 1 per cent or 2 per cent.  In my experience most men work if they are able and in my area I know of men who are working who <Col N="618" /> should not be working.  There are quite a few who would be on disability benefit but the difference between the amount of benefit and the wage they can earn gives them a drive to work even though they are in indifferent health.  Naturally, as the years go by the work is not as congenial to them as it might be.</P>
    <P>Doctors depend on the word of the people they treat.  A patient may complain of pain but it must be realised that pain is a very subjective thing.  One might compare the stoicism of a woman in labour with the anguish of a professional footballer on the field.  Here there is an amazing contrast between the two cases; both are expressing in their own way what they think of pain and how acceptable or unacceptable it is to them.  There are situations where people can work for one, two or three hours and then they must take a rest but this may not be possible when they are in employment. For instance, many workers have to keep working steadily if they are working on conveyor-type work and it would not be possible for them to interrupt their work at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect that the Department of Social Welfare must consider. From time to time I have thought that a local committee which would supervise administration at local level might be of some help to the Department. On the other hand, I gathered from the remarks of the Parliamentary Secretary a few days ago that he was not 100 per cent confident of the ability of old age pension committees to make such decisions.  This was suggested in the past through the Irish Medical Association but I do not know if it was considered by the Minister at that time.  It was suggested that in each area there would be a social committee who would have the obligation of deciding to a large extent regarding a person's eligibility for an old age pension, a medical card, deciding whether they were able to work and various other factors. Probably it would take a lot to change the system now.  The fact that local organisations were abolished, possibly because they were not doing their <Col N="619" /> work, and that managers were appointed might well indicate that at that time we were not mature enough. It is another matter whether we have got more mature in the meantime.  If we are ever to have decentralisation, passing responsibility back to the community, I would suggest that thought to the Parliamentary Secretary and his advisers.</P>
    <P>In his introductory statement the Parliamentary Secretary referred several times to poverty.  I do not know if he really made an effort to define poverty although he made a few attempts.  The more one thinks about it the more difficult it is to define what it means.  Off-hand, I would define poverty as a people's inability to make use of resources, or people who have little or no resources at all.  In my younger days there was a large amount of poverty in that people did not have many resources.  They had small pieces of land but they appeared to live as well as their neighbours, which seemed to be the definition suggested in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement.  People were able to produce crops, milk, eggs and potatoes and they kept going.  Apart from fairly rare cases, there did not seem to be actual want.</P>
    <P>When I look around me and see people I would label as impoverished, often they have resources but they do not seem able to make the proper use of them.  When one goes into a house and sees a television set while other things are neglected, one wonders what definition to put on that. One could go into a house at lunch time and see a large plate of expensive biscuits for five or six children while at the same time those children are not getting the foods they really need.  This is probably poverty so far as the children are concerned and it is due to a failure by the parents to make proper use of their resources.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of the businessman who will go into debt to make more money and very many people are living on borrowed money who show no evidence of poverty. This is an absolute contradiction of what we were told when we were <Col N="620" /> young, that a person who was 6p short at the end of the week was impoverished. It is a very difficult problem to define.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary summarised this matter when he quoted Professor Donnison&mdash;he said it was a matter of education.  If the people I am thinking of had been taught house economics and how to make better use of money when they were in primary or post-primary school many of the situations I have described could have been avoided.  I must admit that there are not that many but they do exist.  There are very few cases of poverty that exist just because the resources are not available to people from the State.  They may not have as much as their neighbours, they may not be able to keep up with the Joneses even though the latter may not be very affluent, but at least they are not hungry.  In the last few years there have been very few hungry people.</P>
    <P>There is the other situation of the man who is ill-cared for, who has a badly kept house, who is obviously anaemic and yet who has a bank account.  It reminds me of the story of a man who sold two cattle for £95 at a fair and who owed a certain amount of money to a shopkeeper. The latter had a great welcome for him when he came into the shop under the impression that he would pay his bill.  He congratulated him on the price he got for the cattle but the farmer told him he came into the shop to borrow £5 as he would like to put an even £100 into his bank account.  That was the farmer's attitude to life and looking after his money.</P>
    <P>The question of social welfare brings up the question of socialism.  There are people who are doctrinaire in this matter.  Listening to them one would get the impression that unless the sick and the unemployed get financial benefits from a system based purely on a socialist philosophy, they are not getting their rights.  This is going too far.  I sometimes wonder whether the £1 I subscribe to the St. Vincent de Paul Society is as acceptable to those who benefit from it as is the £1 I pay in income tax.  There are those who <Col N="621" /> might say that it is not and that organisations such as the society I have mentioned should be abolished, with the State assuming responsibility for the whole area of providing for the needs of people.  However, the more we experience the work of the State and the difficulties involved for the State in these areas, the more we realise the need for those local organisations.</P>
    <P>This State is doing very well.  Successive Governments have endeavoured to increase social welfare benefits as much as possible.  I am old enough to remember a time when the distribution of wealth by way of social welfare payments was not acceptable. Recipients of social welfare in the thirties were sneered at by their neighbours.  I am glad that we have long got away from that sort of thinking and that there is now the acceptance of the responsibility of the State in this area and not only of the State but of the citizen to some extent, although the income tax payer may not always appreciate this when he gets his annual assessment.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that he intends making some provision for the self-employed, particularly in respect of pensions.  This is a very desirable move.  There are many self-employed persons who are making their contribution to the economy but who never seem to be able to take advantage of any benefit from it except when they are unfortunate enough to become ill, in which circumstances they would probably benefit on the medical side.  Also, if they are ill enough to qualify, there is the disabled persons allowance, though there may be a case for increasing these benefits because they are not up to the level of other social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the circumstances in which we live and to our country's productivity and also in view of the fact that the Ministers of Agriculture are meeting in an effort to solve the problem of excess production in the Community, is it not time for the Department to consider the extension of social welfare to take the form of aids other than money?  This has been <Col N="622" /> done in the past.  I refer to the introduction of the free beef scheme.  This was another scheme that was sneered at and one which left its mark on some of our people.  The result of this attitude was that those most in need did not apply for participation in the scheme.  At the time of the US crisis I remember reading that an outstanding economist suggested that the superfluous amount of beef available in that country should be distributed free to those could not afford to buy it.  The EEC have used a similar scheme recently to dispose of a butter &ldquo;mountain&rdquo;.  I do not know whether they have used it to dispose of a beef surplus but the idea is one that we could adopt.</P>
    <P>I was an advocate of our joining the EEC.  My support for membership stemmed mainly from my memories of farmers coming to our shop when I was young and bemoaning the fact that they had not been able to sell their cattle and, consequently, would have no income for some time.  I was led by economists to believe that if we joined the EEC there would be no problem for our beef producers because there was a deficit of this product within the Community.  Unfortunately, these economists have been proved wrong and we have been encountering many difficulties.  The suggestion that Community farmers should produce at a price acceptable to them is wrong.  The only way to deal with a surplus is to increase demand and this is where the consumers come into the picture.  If products are sold at a price that is acceptable there is much more likelihood of there being a demand for them. The Department of Social Welfare could contribute their share by way of the provision of vouchers to the needy. This is something that could be taken up by all the social welfare ministeries within the Community.  This would benefit the farmers in the first place and, secondly, those in receipt of such concessions.</P>
    <P>There are many other remarks I should like to make but since they have been made by other speakers I would not consider it appropriate to take up the time of the House by repeating them.  The Parliamentary <Col N="623" /> Secretary has reminded us that for the first time somebody in his position has come to the House for a second time in the same year offering increased social welfare benefits.  If such increases are necessary it is good that they are being granted, but it is my hope that the economic conditions of the country will improve to such an extent that never again will it be necessary for anybody to seek increases twice in the one year.  In saying that I am not laying the blame on anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We all like to have the opportunity of contributing to a debate on social welfare since this is a Department that has grown to very large proportions down through the years.  It is a Department charged with the responsibility of dealing with the many problems connected with social conditions.  The Department are often subjected to much criticism while on other occasions they are praised highly.  Be that as it may they must continue to work within the social welfare system and to administer that system in line with the calls of this House and of the public in general.</P>
      <P>We all regret having such an enormous number dependent on social assistance and unemployment benefit.  We are reaching a stage where it seems to me a high number of unemployed will be associated with the system.  There are those who argue here and elsewhere that unemployment will be an endemic part of the democratic system.  I hope this will not be the evolution.  Given reasonable health a person is always better employed than unemployed.</P>

    <P>It may well be that those who make these predictions are looking ahead to a time when work will not be deemed to be what it is today and what it was yesterday.  All of us living in a democracy should work in the best interests of that democracy and all of us would regret seeing a stage arrive at which we would have chronic unemployment.  Unemployment is a problem with which democratic parliaments will have to contend and it is a problem these parliaments will have to solve.  It is easy <Col N="624" /> enough to argue philosophically but, once unemployment begins, it is very difficult to reduce it.  This is generally recognised.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said about the western European system it is certainly a system with a social conscience. One hopes that in the context of this system we will be able to find ways and means, as Deputy Dr. Gibbons argued, of shifting surplus foodstuffs in the direction of those in need in such a way as not to create problems of administration or problems of cost.  We must consider relieving poverty with kind as well as with cash.  Surpluses are building up in Europe and so far there seem to be no ways devised of shifting those surpluses. This is something that must be considered in depth with a view to relieving poverty in those areas in which poverty needs to be relieved.</P>
    <P>There is a responsibility on us not to be complacent about our ability to relieve unemployment with cash.  Our resources are not all that large and the Government will have to find ways and means of creating new jobs to relieve the pressure on social welfare. A situation could arise in which the Exchequer would have to come to the aid of the benefits sections as well as carrying the whole assistance range. Great heart-burning was caused in Britain when Lord Beveridge started on his social welfare system.  He found, as we may find here, that in the end the Exchequer may have to carry more of the burden of social welfare than he or his mentors ever foresaw. That could be the evolution here.  We should, therefore, do all we can to create job opportunities and not rely too much on the fact that we can more or less contain and combat poverty with cash.  I suppose one ought to be edified that we can do that but we will not be able to continue forever. Perhaps a mixture of cash and kind would be a better solution.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word now about care of the aged and so on.  This is a side of social welfare that has increased in content in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is also a side wherein we have more voluntary effort than other sections of social welfare.  This is a very good thing.  Regrettably we have an <Col N="625" /> imbalance in our age groups.  We have more older people among us, and more of them becoming more helpless as they grow older.  Quite a number of them are either bachelors or spinsters and some of them live in remote parts of the country.  The efforts which were made at the start, even in a humble way, were well directed by the Department, by the local authorities who also co-operated and by the voluntary workers who gave their time and money to help in perfecting this system of caring for the aged.  The appointment of social workers was a great help.  We have not enough of them.  There should be more social workers in local authority areas to provide leadership in helping to combat poverty in this section of the community. I know from observation and experience, and from having contact with the workers on this aspect of social welfare, that it is paying dividends. For example better care and attention, such as meals-on-wheels providing hot meals, and so on, are creating a better pattern of health.</P>
    <P>One could keep going on with regard to social welfare.  We should also take into consideration what these social workers could do for the unemployed. Even though social welfare payments are higher than ever before, poverty can arise in the homes of the unemployed, or in the case of the person drawing unemployment assistance or sickness benefit.  Whatever it arises from, we should provide social workers to advise people in this unfortunate position.  The staffs of county councils and local authorities worked on outdoor assistance, as it was called at the time; we call it social assistance now.  I hope we reach the stage when we can call it national assistance.  If one considers all the local authorities engaged in this work, it should be possible to get great help from this sector not merely in dealing with health problems and those which arise from other social conditions, but also the many problems which crop up in family circles.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should consider a system of training for people who work in this capacity. This training, in addition to their <Col N="626" /> experience in dealing with the relief of poverty, would be of great help. We have more voluntary workers involved in the care of the aged than in any other sector.  Regrettably they cannot deal with other problems of a professional kind.  The Department provide the leadership required.  It is regrettable that we have any poverty when we consider the amount of money we spend on leisure and on drink.  We should reduce our expenditure on drink and expend that money on the relief of poverty.  If we did so, we might gain a better reward in the next world, if not in this House or outside it.  We should have sufficient compassion to increase the amount of money available for the relief of poverty.  We should not leave everything to the State.  The State will do its best, but we must supplement State aid by voluntary help, as we are doing in the care of the aged.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the unemployment figure will reduce during the winter. We should be able to make some inroads on that figure in the spring and summer.  We must get the figure down to a reasonable level.  If we do not, there will be a considerable strain on our resources and we will not be able to meet all the demands which will be made on the Exchequer in this regard.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have failed to apply unemployment assistance here as it is applied in an industrial economy, failed to apply it as it should be in a rural area.  I am not blaming the Department or the Minister too much in that respect.  We should be able to apply unemployment assistance to our small farmers in a different manner.  There should be some element of incentive built into this payment.</P>
    <P>I want the House to bear in mind that unemployment assistance was thought up in the first instance for an industrial society and that it was much easier to apply under such conditions than, for example, in a rural community where there are a number of smallholders deemed to be recipients of unemployment assistance.  For example, one could query the first qualification&mdash;that a man was unemployed and genuinely seeking work.  If a small <Col N="627" /> farmer is working on his own holding, trying to keep the land in good condition, and so on, perhaps reinvesting some of his unemployment assistance, he cannot be said to be available for work of another kind.  I merely give that as an example and, perhaps, it is wrong to take it out of context.  We should pay unemployment assistance to a farmer as an incentive to him rather than as his unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter before with other Ministers and discussed it with them in private.  I know that notes were passed between the Departments of Social Welfare, Finance and Agriculture and Fisheries and that a large file was built up on this question of whether or not the system could be changed.  One Department shuffled it off to another, the file grew larger but, in the end, unemployment assistance remained unemployment assistance and was administered as before.  It is administered as if we were an industrial society, it is paid on the assumption that a man is genuinely unemployed when, in fact, he is not.</P>
    <P>Some changes were made.  I know that was done with the object of bettering recipients' positions.  It did better their positions and recognised the fact that John So-and-So in receipt of unemployment assistance was a farmer, that he was not going to be penalised for expanding his small-holding and so on.  Nevertheless, we should have a more clearcut system.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that whole aspect of unemployment assistance in an endeavour to separate those who might be deemed to be industrialised and those who would be purely small-holders. I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his courtesy to me during his term of office, for the way in which he dealt with my correspondence and representations.  If we criticise we hope that criticism will be accepted, some of which may be uninformed but, perhaps, more arising from our practical knowledge of situations. Whatever mistakes we may make, criticism is offered with the best intentions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who listened to the debate on this Supplementary Estimate would have forgiven me had I had delusions of grandeur that I was the Taoiseach because the debate ranged over every conceivable Department and touched occasionally only on social welfare.  That is very much to be regretted.  In a way, perhaps, it is understandable because, obviously, and becoming increasingly more obvious as various Fianna Fáil speakers rise, is the fact that they have no policy on social welfare; they have never given any thought to that whole area.  There were individual contributions made from the benches opposite. For example, there were Deputy Carter and Deputy Dr. Gibbons, although I did not necessarily agree with everything they said.  There were others but at least the two I have mentioned gave the impression of having given some thought to the subject under discussion.  However most of the time was spent trying to drum up support in the Mayo by-election. Regrettably this very serious aspect of our national life, this area of social welfare, was used by Fianna Fáil for that purpose.  Although there were some exceptions, there was no serious approach by Fianna Fáil to this subject.</P>
      <P>One of the things that prompted me to join in a Coalition was the fact that Fianna Fáil, in office over a long period of time, had no policy on social welfare.  Some time ago I was encouraged to hear from Deputy Andrews, their spokesman, and on another occasion from Deputy Jack Lynch, the leader of the party, that they were going to produce a policy on social welfare.  I remarked then that, having been in Government with very few interruptions for over 30 years, one would have expected they would have such a policy.  Even then I said: better late than never.  I ask them now to produce a policy on social welfare, something on which they can all agree, and at least enable us to have an intelligent debate on that area, because serious debate is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most speakers referred to the large <Col N="629" /> number of people we have unemployed. They said that all the money being sought in the Supplementary Estimate by the Department of Social Welfare was to stave off the unemployed because they were a political danger to the Government.  It is very little bother to establish that out of an expenditure of £370 million the total spent on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance is £76 million.  Social welfare is not just about unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>There are many other categories of people in our society who rely on social welfare benefit.  I mentioned that out of approximately 900,000 who would benefit from the increases provided in this Supplementary Estimate 400,000 came into the category of old age pensions.  The Opposition neglected this area and when they see now that there is a serious commitment by this Government to try and rectify that neglect over a long number of years they shy away from all those areas that are not politically productive for them, and say, &ldquo;We will not mention them&rdquo;.  That is the attitude of Fianna Fáil.  Social welfare, as far as Fianna Fáil are concerned, is to be used with great discretion at the moment, very selectively, and as a political stick to win the by-election in Mayo.  Hares were raised here and run across the course here to see would it be possible to stir up some sort of resentment or criticism by comparing the Fianna Fáil record with that of this Government, although, to give them credit for some intelligence, most if not all of them know that that is a very forlorn hope, and after flying the flag, as they were required to do by their Whip, they left it at that.</P>
    <P>However, there were a few things mentioned that need to be set straight. There was reference to the tremendous number of unemployed that we had in this country, as if nobody had ever been unemployed here in Ireland under Fianna Fáil.  We have here a new phenomenon.  We suddenly find ourselves with people who have no work, and the whole implication in all <Col N="630" /> the contributions from Fianna Fáil is that, &ldquo;When we were here no one was unemployed and the land flowed with milk and honey&rdquo;.  Would Fianna Fáil give the Irish people credit for some intelligence?  The numbers unemployed now are approximately 103,000 or 104,000 people, and in 1975 we have experienced what is generally accepted and recognised as one of the worst recessions that has hit the western world since the early thirties. It has been compared with that recession by people who make a study of these things.</P>
    <P>We have 104,000 unemployed.  Of course it is an unacceptable figure. Of course it is a waste of human resources.  Of course these people have a right to work.  But let us get it into perspective.  From 1945 on, right up to last year, when the rest of Europe, the Scandinavian countries, Britain, France and Belgium and also America and Japan were enjoying, if not full employment, next to full employment, we here in this country under a Fianna Fáil Government that ruled this country for over 30 years with a very small break, accepted as normal 6 per cent to 7 per cent unemployed.  That to Fianna Fáil was acceptable, but now we have the bleeding hearts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The main objection I heard from the Fianna Fáil benches was that we were not providing employment, and some Deputies actually said&mdash;Deputy Dowling, for instance&mdash;that we were encouraging people to stay unemployed by trying to give them enough money to provide for themselves and their families during the period that they were unemployed. <Col N="631" /> That seems to be what is sticking in a lot of craws on the Fianna Fáil benches, and it is certainly sticking in Deputy Fitzpatrick's craw as he made very plain in his contribution.  Apparently Deputy Fitzpatrick and some of his colleagues in Fianna Fáil find large numbers of unemployed acceptable if they are thrown into economic misery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but it is not too acceptable under this Administration when a reasonable amount of financial cushioning is provided against that contingency.  However, it is one that I know for a fact is very welcome to the unfortunate people who are unemployed and by their families.</P>
      <P>Another kite that was flown by Deputy Nolan and other Deputies was that with the rate of inflation there had been no benefit to the people on social welfare since 1973 when this Government came into power.  I do not know where he got the figure.  It certainly was not from a Fianna Fáil policy document, because there is not one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nolan said their standard of living had decreased by 8 per cent since 1973.  My word does not have to be taken on this.  It is simple mathematics, a sum that can be done by anybody inside or outside the House.  From the first quarter of 1973 to the third quarter of 1975 the consumer price index went up by 48 per cent and the percentage increase in social welfare was a minimum of 75 per cent.  In children's allowances, which I accept is an exception but a very important one to the recipients, there was an increase of 360 per cent. At the very lowest scale there has been a real increase of 18 per cent. Those figures are there and can be checked.  The Deputies can do sums the same as I can.  Why they think it is useful, politically or otherwise, to the people who are in receipt of social welfare benefits or allowances to totally distort the facts is something <Col N="632" /> I cannot understand.  I do not know how they can possibly think that is useful but apparently they do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews, in his opening remarks, as well as a number of other Fianna Fáil speakers, paid tribute to the efficiency and courtesy of the staff in the Department of Social Welfare. I should like to thank Deputy Andrews and the other speakers who expressed that view because I feel a very deep sense of appreciation for the work that has been undertaken by the staff, sometimes under very great pressure, but always willingly and always with the idea that they were there to serve the public, and if they could do it courteously and efficiently that was the way they wanted to do it.  I am particularly grateful to them for that approach.</P>
    <P>There were a number of issues raised during the course of the discussion, a few of them, as I said, not relevant to the Department of Social Welfare.  However, I will deal with those that were relevant.  I regard Deputy Andrews as a man who has a personal commitment.  Unfortunately, politically he finds himself at a very great disadvantage.  In my opinion he agrees very much with the advances in social welfare that have been made and regrets that the party he supports did not see fit to do this when they had the opportunity.</P>

      <P>I think you will have to wait for a number of elections. Deputy Andrews suggested it might be well to change the name of the Department of Social Welfare to Department of Social Security.  I fully accept and appreciate the motive behind that suggestion but a very large section of our welfare is on the assistance side and social security implies insurance.  We have not got that yet.  A very large amount of expenditure in the social welfare field does not come under the heading of benefit but under the heading of assistance. I hope that in time we shall be able to justify adopting the suggestion made by Deputy Andrews.</P>
      <P>I shall try to give the House some idea of what I was talking about when I said people were contradicting themselves and that one speaker was advocating one course of action while the speaker immediately following advocated a totally different course.

      <P>We had Deputy Dowling and Deputy Fitzpatrick both representing Dublin constituencies and both, one would imagine, would be familiar with the facts regarding social welfare and particularly with certain aspects of the operation of social welfare. However, both of them displayed a lack of knowledge in that area that could only be described as amazing in the case of men representing constituencies of the nature and composition of the constituencies these Deputies represent.</P>

      <P>It is a heritage from the Fianna Fáil administration.  It is disgraceful and Fianna Fáil members ought to be ashamed of themselves for consistently supporting a Government that allowed it to develop and ignored the problem when it was there.  As far as the Members on those benches are concerned&mdash;one can search the records to prove this point&mdash;when they were in office this problem was never mentioned by any of their leading spokesmen. Never had they the guts or the courage to acknowledge the fact that this problem existed in our society because they would have had to accept responsibility for it and in accepting responsibility they would have had to accept the blame that properly attached to them.  This Government will face up to that responsibility and the first step along the road of trying to eradicate this problem is to acknowledge that it exists and not, for purely political reasons, to sweep it under the carpet and hope it will not become a political embarrassment.  The extent of the concern of Fianna Fáil was that once it was not a political embarrassment it was left there and ignored in the hope that it would go away.</P>
      <P>I hope the other members of Fianna Fáil, even at this late stage, have more knowledge of the extent of the problem than Deputy Dowling who represents a constituency like my own in which a number of people in this category live.</P>

      <P>We had Deputy Dowling generalising at great length about wholesale abuses of the social welfare system but when he was asked to be more specific he would not be.  When it was pointed out to him that if he was aware of abuses against the social welfare system it was his duty as a public representative <Col N="640" /> to make the Department aware of them he still shied away; he could only repeat what has been said outside this House by people of the same mentality as he and other Members on those benches.  It has been said by people who are against the proper concept of social welfare, who do not agree with the concept of social welfare but have not the guts to come out and say it; they can only cast aspersions but when they are asked to tell us what they are talking about and give details of the abuses they refuse to say so.</P>
      <P>I have spoken about this on a number of occasions but my remarks have usually been addressed to those who made statements outside the House, people who have been described by the media as leading industrialists and such like.

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick made two cases, one contradicting the other, First, he was very disturbed about the number unemployed.  I welcome this awakening of a social conscience. I have known him for a considerable time and have never heard him express concern previously about this social evil.  He claimed, rightly, that Fianna Fáil had drafted the legislation on the pay-related scheme. Then he implied that the pay-related scheme, as administered by us, was a disincentive to work.  He alleged that <Col N="642" /> there was some kind of fiddling going on in the Department of Social Welfare because we were applying the legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I said, there were not many points raised in the debate which were relevant to the Department of Social Welfare.  We welcomed some of the contributions made.  Deputy H.

      <i>Purpose of Draft Scheme Entitled Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation (Amendment) (No. 5) Scheme, 1975.</i>
    </P>
    <P>This draft scheme amends the Superannuation Scheme for Bord na Móna Regular Works employees as follows:</P>
    <P>(1)  Regulation 23: The amendment to this regulation provides that existing members of the scheme, including seasonal members and employees, who could not attain membership of the scheme because they were over 55 years of age at a particular time be allowed to contribute for service rendered from the 14th March, 1963 onwards as follows:</P>
    <P>(a)  Existing members employed on a continuous wholetime basis would be allowed to contribute for all or part service rendered immediately prior to date of entry to the scheme i.e. unbroken service.  If for example an employee joined the scheme on the 1st <Col N="545" /> January, 1973 and had unbroken service with the board from the 1st January, 1965 up to the 1st January, 1973 he would now contribute for all or part of the service rendered between the two dates mentioned.</P>
    <P>(b)  Existing seasonal members would be allowed to contribute for all or part service rendered in consecutive years immediately prior to date of entry to the scheme.  If again for example an employee first entered the scheme in the 1974 season and had been employed in seasons 1973, 1972 and 1971 he would now be enabled to contribute for all or part service rendered in these three seasons.</P>
    <P>(c)  Employees (non-members) over 55 years of age would be allowed on entry to the scheme to contribute for all or part service rendered immediately prior to date of entry in the case of continuous wholetime employees or service rendered in consecutive years immediately prior to date of entry to the scheme in the case of seasonal employees.</P>
    <P>Employees would be required to have ten years' service to qualify for pension and retirement benefits and this proposal would enable persons who could not attain membership because they were over 55 at the particular time to contribute in respect of previous years and thereby make up the necessary ten years.  The examples given under (a) and (b) also apply to these categories.</P>
    <P>The total contributions applicable to all the above groups would be determined by the actuary and would include an interest element and the board and the member would contribute equal amounts.  The increased contribution to cover the service involved would be incorporated with the existing contribution and would be payable over the remaining years to date of retirement.</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulation 34: This amendment provides that members who were discharged on grounds of redundancy between the 14th March, 1963 and the 30th August, 1972 and whose contributions (plus interest) had been returned to them and who have since been re-employed, would have the right to refund these contributions <Col N="546" /> (plus interest) to the fund together with a further sum for interest for the intervening period and thereby obtain credit for all past pensionable service. In other words if a member was discharged on redundancy grounds between the dates mentioned and received a refund of contributions (with interest) at the time the draft scheme provides that he may now pay back to the fund the amount refunded to him plus a further sum in respect of interest (to be determined by the actuary) in respect of the intervening period and by so doing he would regain all the pensionable service he had when he was discharged in the first instance.</P>
    <P>(3)  Regulations 27 and 36: The amendments to these regulations are requirements of the Revenue Commissioners and have no material effect on the existing scheme.</P>

      <P>I understand that there are two schools involved.  The Commissioners of Public Works have, at the request of my Department, inspected the works which have been carried out at these schools and I understand that they will send reports on the works and recommendations as to grants very shortly.  As soon as the reports and recommendations have been received my Department will consider sanctioning an appropriate grant in each case.</P>
