    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will consider the setting up of an island authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the comprehensive arrangements already in existence for the conduct of matters relating to islands, it is not considered that there is any necessity to establish an island authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that there are a number of islands where no Irish is spoken and they are not being treated in a similar manner to the Gaeltacht islands?  Even though they have to endure the same hardships they are losing out considerably on grants for various developments in these islands. In view of that would he not think it is necessary to give them some particular consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may not be aware that an inter-departmental committee considered this question.  It commenced work in 1961 and made a number of recommendations. I think it is correct to say that almost all of them were implemented. Some of them were by-passed by subsequent events including the movement of people from some of the islands to the mainland.  In 1962 the functions of this islands committee were transferred to a central development committee.  Since then in consultation <Col N="550" /> with the appropriate Department these recommendations have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that from time to time questions have been put down in this House in relation to ESB power and matters of that kind for these islands, and the reply was that the Minister for Transport and Power had no functions in matters of this kind?  It is necessary to do something quickly before all the people have left these islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Specific questions might fall naturally to be dealt with by a particular Minister.  The general approach was that discussions were undertaken.  I think questionnaires were actually issued to ascertain what families wished to leave islands&mdash;as I say a number of them have left&mdash;and in other cases what arrangements could be made to improve conditions on the islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that a report undertaken and published 13 years ago is a satisfactory report on which to base a decision on conditions appertaining today on the islands referred to in Deputy Gallagher's question and particularly the islands which are not covered by the special grants from Roinn na Gaeltachta?  Would the Taoiseach consider setting up an authority to provide similar facilities for these islands, or would he authorise the Minister for Transport and Power, for instance, to give special assistance for the provision of electricity on the islands&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot debate this matter today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the report was commissioned a long time ago action on it followed at intervals since. The Deputy is probably aware that quite recently some of the population were removed from an island in his own constituency.  This is a continuing process.  With regard to the other matters raised by Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Molloy I will discuss the actual question with the Minister for Transport and Power to see if there is any further action which can be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Application has been made to my Department for the provision of additional accommodation at this school.  As it is a two-teacher school with a relatively small enrolment, the question of its amalgamation with another school to form a larger school unit has to be considered in view of general educational policy relating to the reorganisation of one-and two-teacher schools.  A proposal has, accordingly, been made to the school manager that the school be amalgamated with the neighbouring Coldwood school, in the same parish, when the latter school has been suitably extended.</P>
      <P>I understand that parents of children attending Lisheenkyle school have sought a meeting with the local inspector of national schools and the reverend manager has been informed that, if he so wishes, the inspector will attend such a meeting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>In March of this year notice issued from my Department to 238 unqualified persons who are serving temporarily as teachers in national schools that their employment would be terminated not later than 30th June, 1975, since the number of qualified newly-trained teachers who will be available as from 1st July, 1975, will be sufficient to allow of all teaching posts in national schools being filled by qualified teachers.  It should be understood that each person concerned, being unqualified, was recognised temporarily only until such time as the school manager succeeded in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher and that the circumstances of their being so recognised conferred no right to continued recognition or to future recognition as teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Special summer courses of training have been provided for some years past for qualified untrained teachers, but persons who were not already qualified as untrained teachers were not accepted on these courses, which have now come to an end.  There could be no question of instituting a special course to enable persons not already qualified as national teachers to obtain trained status.  Such persons, however, would be eligible to enter as mature students for the annual competition for admission to the normal course of training as national teacher, provided they satisfied the requirements as to age and standard of education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of those 238 people on whom he served notice had already given devoted service over a 25-year period and that their argument is that it was the application of too strict a rule in relation to the crash course which kept them from doing it?  Is he also aware that some of them worked as principals in one-teacher schools and various managers were extremely pleased to have them? Would he not consider the possibility of introducing a crash course applicable to a number of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a special course for unqualified teachers.  They have the option, if they meet the requirements as to age and standard of education, of applying as mature students for the normal training college examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is a cruel and harsh decision on his part, which will cause untold hardship to the 238 people who gave loyal, faithful and good service to the Irish educational system when there were no others to give that service and that his treatment of them will go down in history as cruel, harsh and unrewarding for the service they have given the nation?  Would the Minister change his attitude and agree on a final crash course this year, allow each of those 238 people to take that course and set a reasonable standard to give them an opportunity <Col N="566" /> either to qualify or not to qualify?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister reconcile his statement that he will have sufficient national teachers available in 1975 with the fact that all national teachers have expressed grave concern at the very high pupil/teacher ratio at the present moment?  This decision, which will now remove 238 teachers from the pool of teaching, is taken at a most inopportune time when the Minister will lose a year's teaching from those with the three years course. Those with three years from now on will get an extension.  Does he not see that this decision, leaving out the fact of how hard it is on the people who have given such devoted service, will aggravate the situation, which has become intolerable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that the improvement in the <Col N="567" /> pupil/teacher ratio in 1973 and 1974 was as a result of the fact that the Fianna Fáil Government brought more students into training in those years to ensure that the pupil/teacher ratio would be improved.

      <P>I will be glad of a reply to my query because the Minister knows perfectly well the reason why those extra students were taken in.  It was to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio.  The Minister has claimed often enough that he has reduced the pupil/ teacher ratio in 1973 and 1974 when he knows perfectly well that he had nothing at all to do with it.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I announced in this House some time ago, a top priority of mine is to make greater provision for disadvantaged children and to ensure that their needs are met to the best of our ability to provide resources.  By disadvantaged children I mean not only children who are suffering from mental or physical handicap but, also, children who are placed at disadvantage through social and environmental circumstances.  I am aware that there exist in certain school districts social and other conditions which give rise to special educational problems.  An action research project has been in progress in the Rutland Street area of <Col N="570" /> Dublin for the past few years with the following purposes:</P>
    <P> (a)  to investigate the factors associated with educational disadvantage and to develop appropriate procedures to counteract it;</P>
    <P>(b)  to evaluate the experience gained with a view to assisting children similarly circumstanced in other areas. </P>
    <P>The research findings from this project will be available very shortly.  I hope to use them as a basis for intervention in schools where there is a high degree of educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>At this point I am not in a position to state precisely what measures will be introduced in schools where priority is warranted, but I will bear the Deputy's suggestion in mind.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the customs and excise duty on beer by £11.128 per standard barrel or the equivalent of 2.81p. on the pint of average gravity. The resultant increase in revenue in the current financial year would amount to approximately £15 million or £17 million in a full year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain.  The Revenue Commissioners usually make an examination of the pattern of consumption and if there is an increase make some allowance for new resolutions but it has always been found that the resolutions to abstain are seldom observed and that revenue continues accordingly to grow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been alleged recently that in certain continental European countries the effect of decreased economic activity has been to reduce the consumption of alcohol but that the effect of the same economic decrease in Britain and in this country has been to increase the consumption of alcohol.  Can the Minister throw any light on that suggestion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The pattern of consumption for several years past has <Col N="593" /> been on the increase and even in years when the percentage increase was greater than is envisaged this year consumption grew rather than diminished.  There could, of course, be a variation in the nature of the alcohol consumed.  There might be a switch from spirits to beer or beer to spirits in certain circumstances but in preparing their figures the Revenue Commissioners assume that the pattern of behaviour will be somewhat similar to previous years and they tend to under-estimate rather than to over-estimate consumption.  If there is an increase in consumption, the revenue will be correspondingly greater.</P>

      <P>The situation there remains fluid.  The general intention is to harmonise the rates but the Community are a long way off doing so. Spirits are the subject of a draft council directive which is still under discussion in the Community.  The aim of this directive is to harmonise the structure of the fiscal duty on spirits on a Community-wide basis but it does not relate to the level of duty. While the Community have harmonisation of the levels of fiscal duty as an objective to be achieved at some date in the future, there is, as yet no firm commitment to this end.  Until such time as there is a commitment, member states are at liberty to vary the fiscal rates in any way they consider to be appropriate to their circumstances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>To add a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The rebate of duty on hard-pressed pipe tobacco shall, as on and from the 16th day of January, 1975, be increased by the sum of £1.236 per lb.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in some difficulty in drafting this amendment because I did not have available the appropriate figures in <Col N="595" /> regard to the rebate on hard-pressed pipe tobacco but the Minister will recall that in the discussion here on budget day it was urged very strongly from this side of the House that, as has been the case on a number of occasions in the past, provision be made for adjustment of the rebate of duty on hard-pressed pipe tobacco.  On that occasion I thought the Minister indicated that he was considering this but he does not appear to have done anything about it.</P>
    <P>The increases in duty on tobacco, as proposed in section 37, like the increase in duty on beer and spirits, is unprecedented.  It is much higher than anything that has ever been applied before.  Consequently, to maintain the rebate on hard-pressed pipe tobacco at its present level is to erode very substantially the position of those whom the rebate was intended to benefit. Consumers of this tobacco are not all old-age pensioners but many of them are and it was on that basis that the rebate was applied and adjusted from time to time.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister would agree that an increase in the rebate is necessary, having regard to the various substantial increases in duty being imposed by this section.  If this amendment does not apply an appropriate increase to the rebate, I should have no objection to hearing the Minister on what the figure should be.  The object of putting down the amendment was to ascertain whether the Minister agreed in principle that the rebate should be increased and that, if he so agreed, the question of the amount of increase should be a matter for discussion.  It is important that the Minister accepts the necessity for increasing the rebate in the context of the huge increase in duty on tobacco that is imposed by this section and that he should accept also that failure to adjust the rebate is eroding seriously the position of those whom the rebate is intended to assist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every time there is an adjustment in the rate of excise duty on cigarettes and tobacco one can be sure that somebody in the Dáil <Col N="596" /> will suck the greatest amount of juice out of hard-pressed pipe tobacco.  In fairness to Deputy Colley, I remember speeches similar to his being made here in the years 1966 to 1969 when the rate of duty was increased but when there was no corresponding increase in the rate of rebate for this commodity.</P>
      <P>The rebate for hard-pressed pipe tobacco&mdash;this is the official title for plug tobacco&mdash;was introduced in the Finance Act, 1940 and its purpose was to reduce the cost of that type of tobacco.  In earlier years the rate of rebate was increased at the same time as the rate of duty was increased but since 1965 there has been no change in the rate of rebate.  Apparently, my predecessors did not consider there was any good case for doing so.  The position is that hard-pressed tobacco is not consumed now by any class in particular and that to provide a new rebate&mdash;the old one is still in existence&mdash;would be granting a concession to people who do not merit any greater support from the Exchequer than is merited by other members of the community.</P>
      <P>The production of plug tobacco forms a large proportion of tobacco manufactured by the three licensed tobacco manufacturers who are in business in a small way.  As the House knows the small manufacturers get another rebate.  It is the rebate on tobacco leaf received by licensed manufacturers.  That is intended to help the small manufacturers and it does, and correspondingly or consequentially, it helps the consumer. The rate of rebate applicable to the first 50,000 lbs. of leaf tobacco received in any one year was increased from £0.225 to £0.45 per lb. It was increased by the Finance Act, 1974, so, as recently as last year we gave an improvement in the rate of rebate for the manufacturers of plug tobacco.  In the circumstances I would not consider that I would be justified in making any further adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the same reasons did not apply today as applied when this rebate was <Col N="597" /> introduced.  I do not see any difference. Hard-pressed plug tobacco is still smoked by people in the old age and lower income groups.  There are not many people in the higher income group who buy a half-quarter of plug tobacco.  This is still the favourite smoke of old people and people in the lower income groups. The Minister has wrong information if he says this does not apply now, because it certainly does.  The old age pensioner has his half-quarter of plug. I appeal to the Minister to consider this amendment very seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way to help such an old age pensioner is by generously increasing the rate of old age pension rather than by fiddling around with the revenue laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to previous occasions on which the duty on tobacco was increased when the rebate was not increased, but the position is not really comparable because the increase he is now imposing is quite unprecedented.  I do not think he will find anything remotely close to the increase in duty which he is proposing now.  To the extent that it is such a large increase, it is eroding the position of those who benefit from the rebate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, to talk about the rebate to the smaller manufacturers is simply clouding the issue.  It is of value to smaller Irish manufacturers of tobacco but it is not of value in any remotely direct way to those who smoke hard-pressed tobacco.  What Deputy Callanan said is correct.  From his observation and from my observation <Col N="598" /> it is true that, by and large, the people who smoke this are usually older people and people who are not well off.  There are exceptions to this but by and large that is true.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is right in saying, as I understood him to say, that it is not one class of the community who now smoke this tobacco, and also that one should not be using the revenue laws to assist people in the poorer sections of the community, logically he should be abolishing the rebate altogether.  He is not doing that.  He is maintaining it as it is.  I suggest the fact that he is maintaining it is clear evidence that he recognises that the sections of the community mainly benefiting from this provision are the poorer and in most cases the older sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I have not got the figures available as to what the cost to the Exchequer would be but I would suggest that stepping up the rebate at least in proportion to the increase in the duty could not be excessively expensive on the Exchequer and would be acknowledging the value of the rebate if it is to have any value at all.  If there is any substance in what the Minister has said, he should be abolishing the rebate.</P>

      <P>This section is to increase the customs duty on imported wine and also the excise duty on Irish wine by £0.562 per gallon.  The resultant increase in revenue is estimated at £900,000 in a full year and £800,000 in the current year.  These figures include the addition of VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, in view of the level of duty now reached on wine, is it still thought advisable to apply the duty to a bottle of wine, irrespective of the value, in other words, that it is not an <i>ad valorem</i> duty?  I can understand that if the duty is at a relatively low level administratively it might not be worthwhile applying on an <i>ad valorem</i> basis but I think it is now reaching a level where it seems, on the face of it, to be unjustifiable, to apply the same amount of duty to a cheap bottle of wine as to a very expensive one.  I assume the reasoning behind this is purely administrative but I will be glad to hear what the Minister has to say on that topic.</P>

      <P>The alcoholic content is not related to price or what the market thinks is a good or a bad wine. <Col N="601" /> The tax is measured by the strength of the wine and not by its fashion, its bouquet, colouring or any of the other items which may well determine what is the price which the market is prepared to pay for a particular wine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Would the Minister agree that we are reaching a situation where the sales of wine are increasing every year?  Indeed, with the different qualities of wine which are sold some scheme will have to be devised where different duties will have to be put on. It is unfair that the same duty, which the Minister is applying here, should apply to the very cheap bottle of wine, selling at 65p to 70p, as to a bottle of champagne selling at probably £7.50. I know, from an administrative point of view, this is probably difficult but I think the Revenue Commissioners will have to find a device, as the sale of wine expands, of charging duty according to the price and the quality of the wine.</P>
      <P>The 10p increase here can be substantial on a very cheap wine but it is an infinitesimal sum when you take into consideration a bottle of champagne or a bottle of some of the very costly wines.  I have seen recently a sale in a shop on Stephen's Green where a bottle of wine was sold in the region of £25 and £30.  Surely there is a justification for more duty to be put on wine of that nature than on the very cheap wine which the average household is only able to buy.  Would the Minister, in the future, try to devise some scheme whereby the duty can be assessed according to the quality and the cost of the wine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the argument the Deputy advances.  There is a difference in the rate of duty chargeable on different kinds of wine although the difference is not as great as the difference in the ordinary retail price.  There is a higher rate of duty on sparkling wines so, therefore, champagne pays a higher rate of duty than still wine.  I accept that the Deputy argues that the difference in price on the bottle, as far as quantity is concerned, may vary as <Col N="602" /> much as £5 and up to £20 for the very rare old wines.</P>
      <P>The rate of duty depends on the alcoholic strength, as I mentioned, not on its quality.  It depends also on whether the wine is a still wine or a sparkling wine, whether it is wine of fresh grapes or other wine or is imported in cask or in bottle.  The vast bulk of imported wine consists of still wine made from fresh grapes of an alcoholic strength not exceeding 42 degrees proof spirit and imported in cask.  I will certainly look at the argument which has been advanced and see if there is a possibility of changing the rules.  From what I have seen of the operation to date, I do not think that it is one which offers any easy solutions.  There is, incidentally, also in this field, a draft Council directive still under discussion in the EEC so maybe that will enforce some arrangement on us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One can see, in the kind of case mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick, that although one is collecting more duty on the VAT on an expensive bottle of wine or an expensive bottle of champagne still at that rate it is not in proportion at all.  The effect of what we are doing in this section is to impose a much greater duty proportionately on the cheaper wines than on the dearer ones.  The Minister has accepted the proposition that that is undesirable.  I think Deputy Fitzpatrick is right to urge him to have a look at the situation and see if a better system can be devised.</P>

Table waters are commonly sold in bottles capable of holding either one-third of a pint or a half-pint and are now on sale at prices up to 15p or 20p.

      <P>The effect of this section is to increase the rate of betting duty from 15 per cent chargeable under section 40 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972, to 20 per cent with effect from 20th January, 1975.  It is estimated that the increase in the yield of betting duty will amount to £1.3 million in the current financial year and virtually the same in a full year.</P>

If what I have been told is correct, it would seem that there is a <Col N="605" /> serious matter involved.  It seems that the Minister's statement on this matter on budget day conveyed that there was going to be an increase in duty, not only in off-course betting but in on-course betting.  Subsequently, as a result of, I understand, strenuous representations not only to the Minister for Finance but to the Taoiseach, the proposed increase in duty in on-course betting was dropped.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are dealing now with the off-course betting.  The other deals with on-course betting which will enable the Racing Board to collect up to 10 per cent, subject to ministerial approval.  The present legislation in that area allows a ceiling of 5 per cent but the new legislation will enable a ceiling of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister has stated it appears that legislation will be introduced to allow an increase in the duty on on-course betting but that it may or may not be implemented. Certainly, it will not operate as from 20th January last as the off-course increased duty does.  It has been put to me that the person who will suffer as a result of this increase is the man who puts on a small bet with a bookmaker off-course.  It has also been put to me that the increase involved is substantial.  I have been told <Col N="606" /> that those who bet on the course very often bet more substantially and heavily and it is clear from what the Minister has said that they will not be dealt with in the same way since the increase in duty does not apply at present.  It has been put to me that they may not be subjected to the increase announced as a possibility in the budget speech.</P>
      <P>I have also been told that those who put on large bets off course are seldom charged the duty they should be charged even at present.  It has been pointed out to me that such people will not put on bets with bookies who charge the increased duty.  I have been told that the effect of this section is to penalise the person who puts on a small bet off course.  If that is so, I do not think it is justified.  The Minister ought to attempt to justify what is happening in this Bill in relation to the enforcement of the duty, if it is to be enforced, on large and small bets and also by comparison with the situation where people are betting on-course. The comparisons add up to a discrimination against the person who puts on small bets off course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister made it clear what is the duty in <Col N="607" /> Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Whether or not the Minister is aware of it, there are certain bookmakers in Belfast who have a large clientele in the Republic of Ireland.  One of the effects of this foolish proposal to increase the tax on off-course betting to the penal rate of 20 per cent has been to increase the clientele of bookmakers in Northern Ireland and Britain.  Because such clients of bookmakers in Northern Ireland and Britain are not resident either in Northern Ireland or in Britain, in practice they do not pay any tax. Therefore, the effect of this penal proposal has been to cause a lot of bets which would have been struck in the Republic, up to now&mdash;presumably duty being payable on some of them at least&mdash;to be struck either in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain. Whether or not duty is paid there is irrelevant so far as our Exchequer is concerned because, even if it is paid in Northern Ireland or in Britain, certainly we do not get any of it.</P>
      <P>I wonder is the Minister aware of the realities of the situation in relation to this type of betting?  Most of the betting which takes place in bookies' offices, over the counter, throughout the country is of very small amounts indeed&mdash;25p or so is probably the average.  In fact, most bookmakers have a rule that they will not take more than approximately £10 anyway from somebody who comes in casually unless it is laid several hours before the race in question because they want to lay it on.  But the arrangements are different for very large punters. There the arrangements are such that, in many cases, they do not pay tax. This may be as a result of their availing of facilities very widely available to them from Belfast or Britain, or for other reasons.  Nonetheless, the sort of man who is in the habit of having £500 or £1,000 on a horse, off the course, in practice, will not usually be paying tax to the Exchequer here, whatever tax he may or may not pay to some other Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the net effect of this is to discriminate against the small <Col N="608" /> punter, the person who is less well-off and who will make small bets only.  It has been forecast&mdash;and I think events will bear it out&mdash;that, as a result of the imposition of this penal rate of tax, which must be the highest in the world on off-course betting, there will be unemployment amongst bookmakers' staffs in the various offices, of which there are a lot throughout the country; also that people who are not licensed bookmakers at all will be encouraged to set themselves up in publichouses and other places as <i>de facto</i> bookmakers prepared to take bets from friends or members of the public generally frequenting such publichouses or other places.  Apart from the loss of revenue caused by unlicensed bookmakers accepting bets from the public at large, there is the other factor which is, if anything, more important; that is, that the punters and the public generally have no protection of any kind if that unofficial or unlicensed bookmaker decides to default in his obligations, because he has never applied to the district court for a certificate, or to the Garda, nor has he ever applied to the Revenue Commissioners for a licence.</P>
    <P>Although it is a little early yet, so far as one can judge, the results forecast appear to have been borne out by subsequent events.  Whether or not the Minister is aware, or whether or not he wants to admit it, I am telling him now that a large proportion of the big bets struck in this country, off the course, are struck with bookmakers outside the Republic with a consequential very heavy loss to our revenue.  A few such bets in any one day would equal, in amount, all the little bets struck all over the country of a few shillings at a time.  It is really the large bets which are important from the Exchequer's point of view.  The Minister would be well advised to take precisely the opposite course to the one he has taken; in other words, to reduce the level of taxation to a reasonable rate, when he would get at least some and, hopefully most, of those bets at present struck outside the jurisdiction and the resultant revenue.  The differential <Col N="609" /> between the British and Northern Ireland rate and the new Republic of Ireland one is so enormous it is perfectly obvious that a high proportion of bets of any size or significance are being struck outside the country for that reason.</P>
    <P>I put it bluntly to the Minister that if he were to reduce considerably the rate of tax on these bets he would reap far more revenue.  Our rate of tax, at 20 per cent, as opposed to the Northern Ireland one of 7½ per cent, is getting on to three times as much. In such circumstances the Minister cannot seriously expect&mdash;whatever about the small bets&mdash;that substantial bets by consistent punters will be struck in this country, with licensed bookmakers, paying 20 per cent taxation on them.  In practice it is not the bigger people with the bigger bets who are penalised in this respect, rather it is the smaller people putting small bets.  Naturally, I have no way of forecasting what will be the revenue from this duty in 1975 but I would venture to think&mdash;even though the rate of tax is increased substantially&mdash;the revenue probably will not show any increase, for the reasons I have indicated.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the section earlier, I understand the Minister referred to his proposal to increase the on-course levy&mdash;which, of course, is not a tax payable to the Exchequer at all but is payable to the Racing Board in relation to horse racing and to Bord na gCon in relation to greyhound racing&mdash;and amend the relevant Act or Acts to allow a levy of 10 per cent to be collected in relation to those.  Unless he proposes to change the rules as to where that levy goes, none of it will go to the Exchequer. I can say to the Minister with some certainty now that if he does force the Racing Board and Bord na gCon to increase their levies to 10 per cent, he will do immeasurable harm to the Irish horse racing and greyhound racing industries.  I understand that both the Racing Board and Bord na gCon have made it clear they do not want such increases, that they would prefer that the existing situation obtained. <Col N="610" /> I do not suppose this arises directly out of the proposals in this section but it is bound up with them to the extent that in his budget speech the Minister indicated his intention to double the levy on on-course betting.  He back-tracked on that afterwards when it was pointed out to him that the Racing Board did not want that and that it would have a disastrous effect on the industry.  It was also pointed out to him that it would probably have the effect of reducing the income of the Racing Board rather than increasing it.  In another measure the Minister is now apparently proposing to allow the levy to be increased to 10 per cent, without making it compulsory.  Provided he leaves it to the discretion of the Racing Board as to whether they want it increased, I suppose there is no great objection to that proposal but if the Minister at a future time wanted to twist the arm of the Racing Board to increase the sum to 10 per cent, I think it would be better if the legislation was not passed.</P>
    <P>In the normal way the revenue from levy of the Racing Board will increase from year to year, even if it is only because of the inflationary factor.  With inflation running at 25 per cent under this Government, in the normal course of events 25 per cent more money will be expended in betting and, on the face of it, there should be a 25 per cent increase in the levy collected by the Racing Board.  It may be that because of the present severe economic conditions people will tend to cut down on their betting and, therefore, the income of the Racing Board will not increase at the same rate as inflation but there does not seem any justification for the proposal to give the Racing Board power to charge 10 per cent and from my information it appears they do not want that power.  I do not think they can make public statements that are critical of the Minister, even though he does not know anything about their difficulties, but it has been privately indicated that the Racing Board do not want this because they realise what damage it could do.</P>
    <P>With regard to the duty that is proposed in this section, in my opinion, and in the opinion of many others, this increase will not increase the <Col N="611" /> amount of duty.  It will drive a still larger number of people to put their bets in Northern Ireland or with unlicensed bookmakers and that is undesirable from the point of view of the Exchequer and from the point of view of the protection of the public.  If anything goes wrong or if there is a dispute in relation to a bet they will not have protection.  They will not be able to go to the Garda or the district court to object to the renewal of a licence, as they can do if they are betting with a <i>bona fide</i> licensed bookmaker in the Republic.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say the licensing system for bookmakers has worked well and the percentage of defaults or disputes that go as far as the courts or the Garda is very small.  The obtaining of a licence by a bookmaker here in nearly all cases is a guarantee that he is a reasonable, honourable and solvent person with whom one can safely do business.  If it is a question of dealing with people outside the jurisdiction or with those who do not have a licence, in the event of a dispute there is no guarantee that the matter can be cleared up to everyone's satisfaction. Of course, in itself a bet is a void transaction and cannot be sued upon in the Courts because, for technical reasons in the law of contract it is regarded as an illegal contract.  Therefore, the only protection the individual punter has is to be able to complain to the Garda or the district court in the event of a default.</P>
    <P>Because of the proposals of the Minister, he has driven much of the substantial betting money out of the country.  As well as losing money to the Exchequer which he could get if he did not impose this penal rate of taxation, he is also putting the ordinary public into the difficult position in that many of them are forced to bet with people outside the jurisdiction or with unlicensed bookmakers within the jurisdiction.  As a result, they have no protection in the event of a dispute.</P>

      <P>I had hoped Fianna Fáil had given up the practice in which they engaged in some months ago of making wild allegations that have no <Col N="612" /> basis.  For a time they improved but Deputy O'Malley's return to the House has seen a return to the same despicable practice.  The facts happen to be against him.  It is another case of the truths being clouded by untruths; it is another instance of reckless allegations being made irrespective of the truth.</P>
      <P>The facts are against Deputy O'Malley.  The estimated increase in revenue of £1.3 million on the basis of what has occurred since January last will be justified and that is what matters. We are concerned with collecting revenue to meet necessary State expenses. Betting is an appropriate activity to charge with a small tax.  All I have done is to increase by one-third the tax of 15 per cent that was deemed to be a fit and proper tax by the people who have been so liberal with their criticisms here today.  What I have done is not unreasonable in the circumstances when it will produce a significant increase in revenue.</P>
      <P>With regard to on-course betting, this has nothing to do with the Finance Act because it does not contribute to the Exchequer.  Contrary to what was alleged by Members opposite, people interested in racing were anxious that the income of the Racing Board would increase so that, among other things, the prizes offered would increase and thus ensure that the best bloodstock in the world would run in Irish races.  It is a matter for the Racing Board to determine the appropriate charge for on-course betting.  The legislation, when it is introduced, will be in the same form as previous legislation.  It will simply provide a permissive ceiling and it will be a matter for the board to ask the Minister to approve whatever rate they consider necessary to meet the best interests of the industry.  Under the law this is the responsibility of the Racing Board.</P>

He said the estimate made, apparently by the revenue, was £1.3 <Col N="613" /> million and he had no reason to believe that money would not be got.

The Chair will recall my pointing out to the Minister that there were very substantial sums of money going out of the country in bets every day.  I know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never had a bet outside this country.  It is regrettable that this should be happening. The Minister in his reply never even referred to this.  He does not care.  He never referred to the difficulty he has created for many people who are now forced to bet either outside the country or with unlicensed bookmakers and the dangers they run in dealing with people who are not subject to the licensing arrangements here and to the supervision of the Garda and the courts here.  None of this was answered.  The Minister could not care less about this any more than about anything else.  I object to this high and mighty tone that is put on by the Minister who alleges that what I or Deputy Colley or anyone else on this side says is untrue and not in accordance with the facts and then gives out a load of patronising rubbish which does not contradict one syllable that was said by anyone who spoke here.  Everything I said earlier stands and is true and now proved to be true because the Minister has not been in a position to contradict one word of it.  He is, therefore, prepared to stand over the situation that large sums of <Col N="614" /> money are going out of the country every day in bets, no duty is being collected by the Exchequer and if people outside the country or unlicensed people inside the country default on those bets the public have no protection.  They have been driven to that situation by the increase in the tax to the figure at which it now stands.</P>
      <P>It is hard to blame someone who wants to back a horse and finds that in order to put a £1 on the horse he must put £1.20 for placing his bet inside the country.  It is particularly galling when in Northern Ireland, even with tax, they only have to pay £1.7½.  It is very questionable if British tax is paid on the bets that go to Northern Ireland.  I do not know what the arrangements there are but it may be that some bookmakers feel they are not obliged to return them because the bets are taken on the telephone from people outside the jurisdiction.  I am not expressing any judgment on that.  Anyway it is totally irrelevant to us whether the British Exchequer or the Northern Ireland Exchequer gets this 7½p on the £1.  What is relevant to us is that we get nothing.</P>
      <P>We are getting nothing on the big bets but the small man who goes in with his 50p or his £1 and bets across the counter has to pay tax.  The big fellow does not.  This is not a matter that interests the Minister.  Apart from the loss to the Exchequer, this is a capital outflow, for the most part in larger bets, which at the end of the year amounts to a sum of some significance, probably quite a few million pounds, which would stay at home if the Minister for Finance did not have such a mental block about all this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to support what Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Colley have said.  I believe the Minister is making a mistake in having too much of a gap between tax in Northern Ireland and tax here.  I know that last year a representative of a company which was sending 3,000 or 4,000 circulars to England drove to Newry to post them.  It was illegal but <Col N="615" /> it was done.  The same thing can happen here.  I am not a gambling man.  Punchestown once a year is my total experience of betting.  However, there are people who go to race meetings practically every week.  It would be very unwise for the big punter at present to place his bets here in SP offices.  If he places a bet of £100 and wins at five to one the tax will be £120.  If he places his bet by telephone in Northern Ireland he will pay roughly £46 tax, a saving of £74.  He would be a very foolish punter if he did not avail of that opportunity and open a credit account with a bookmaker in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not believe this will be a paying proposition.  I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners will benefit by this increase because the big punter will not place his bets with Irish bookmakers. Of course, the small punter who has not the facilities available to him will still place his bets here.  He cannot ring up a Northern Ireland bookmaker to place a five shillings each way bet or a treble.  It would not be accepted.  Therefore, the person who will be hit here is the average working man who has a flutter on a horse every Saturday.  The professional punter will not place his bets with an Irish bookmaker or SP office. He would not stay in business at all if he did so.</P>
      <P>The Minister would be wise to have another look at this because it will encourage a flow of money out of the country.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned the tote.  From the punter's point of view it may be said that, perhaps, they do not require it and would not pass it on but there is the question of whether this would be unfair to the on-course bookmaker.  The bookmakers have to live and they give employment.  This would place the tote in a much more advantageous position than the bookmakers on the course.  We are moving too far away from the amount of tax only a hundred miles away.  The Minister must consider whether this will be a paying proposition or not.</P>

      <P>The case being made by Deputies on this side is a fairly <Col N="616" /> clear one.  On another Bill in this House the Minister saw fit not to apply tax to the bloodstock industry for reasons which he thought best suited to the industry and to the economy in the context of that industry.  In relation to betting tax, there was already in existence a tax which was double that in the northern part of the country but this is being increased now by one-third. In terms of the competition in which we must engage the Minister is placing at a greater disadvantage people in this part of the country who are interested in betting <i>vis-à-vis</i> those in the North.  That is not a wise policy. I am not saying that our rates of tax in every respect should be the same as those in the other part of the country but the ease with which anybody from this part of the country could place bets outside the State and the advantage to them in the event of wins should make it obvious to the Minister that at least he should endeavour to keep the ratio nearer to a competitive level.</P>

      <P>I join with the other Deputies from this side of the House in calling on the Minister to have second thoughts on this measure. I wonder whether it is possible for a Minister for Finance to become so involved in dealing with millions of pounds that he becomes totally out of touch with people such as small punters who on a Saturday afternoon will speculate about 25p on a few horses and then get much pleasure from seeing how they run.  On a 25p bet a punter must now pay 5p tax.  I have talked with some of the people who are affected by this tax and they consider it to be very severe but there is the wider and more important question of the tax resulting in money going out of the country.  Perhaps the Minister is not aware of the pleasure for thousands of people in placing a small bet on a Saturday afternoon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley stated correctly that the effect of the increase as proposed in this section is virtually to bring the duty on off-course betting to three times the rate which applies in the North.  The Minister will recall that on a <Col N="617" /> previous occasion he was very concerned about a differential in duty as between this part of the country and the North, so concerned that he imposed an additional tax of 15p per gallon on petrol.  He will recall how eloquent he was in relation to that topic.  If he believed a word of what he said then, he must be concerned now with the effect of making the differential so great in relation to betting tax and, consequently, he must be concerned with the real danger outlined by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;the loss of a considerable amount of revenue.</P>
      <P>It would be far more appropriate for the Minister to show his concern in regard to this possibility than to react in the very tetchy way he reacted to Deputy O'Malley and without contradicting any of the arguments put forward by the Deputy.  Apart from that aspect, I am very concerned with another aspect to which I adverted earlier, that is the question of how the Minister proposes to justify the imposition of this additional taxation on the punter who places his bet in an SP office as against what he proposes to do in the case of somebody placing a bet on the course.  There is considerable discrimination here.  I adverted to this earlier but the Minister did not attempt to reply to what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, the great bulk of those who bet in SP offices are small punters.  Some of the reasons for this have been adverted to.  The Minister proposes to increase the tax on their bets to 20 per cent.  Presumably, very few of them will have any way of avoiding liability for that tax. Those who bet on the course very often invest substantial amounts but one finds there is no date prescribed for the commencement of any increase in levy on their bets, whereas the man placing his bet in an SP office has been liable for the increased duty since January 20th last.  That is the first point that alerts one to the difference in approach.  Then, one finds that in regard to the on-course betting levy, it will be necessary to introduce new legislation.  We all know how long that is likely to take, especially having regard to the approach of this Government <Col N="618" /> to the whole legislative pro-programme and to the bringing forward of legislation.  Even when this legislation is introduced and passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas the Minister says it will be an enabling measure.  Therefore, we may take it that there is a distinct possibility that there will be no increase in the duty on on-course betting but that if there is an increase it will not operate for a very considerable time &mdash;possibly for at least a year after the date of the coming into operation of the new levy on off-course betting.</P>
    <P>There is considerable discrimination in the way the Minister is approaching one form of betting as against another. It is possible that that difference in approach is justifiable.  I have asked the Minister for any such justification but he has not attempted to offer any.  I am asking him again if he will justify it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There always has been a difference in the treatment of off-course and on-course betting.  A person who goes to the races and pays an admission fee has gone to a considerable amount of inconvenience, whereas off-course betting is arranged more easily.  I gather that is the reason both forms of betting have been treated differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister acknowledges the possibility that there will be no increase at all in the duty on on-course betting while he has applied a quite substantial increase from 20th January on off-course betting.  Does he think the factors he has mentioned as justifiying a difference in approach, justify that difference in approach?</P>

      <P>The financial resolution on the day of the budget brought this off-course duty into operation.  As I said on the day of the budget, legislation is needed to amend the authority which the Racing Board have to fix the levy appropriate to on-course betting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that, in dealing with off-course betting at shop level, he is dealing with the poorer sections of the community. Well-off people can afford to go racing and bet on the tracks.  Even people on social welfare tend to have a little <Col N="619" /> flutter in the offices, and even old age pensioners.  This is victimising the small punter, the less well-off punter, by having a bigger rake-off of taxation at betting shop level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the bigger punters who bet on the course very often do not pay any tax whereas the small punter has no escape?  I am not saying it is right that they should not, but it does happen.</P>

      <P>It strikes me that an argument is being advanced here that because a tiny minority break the law we should not have any laws at all. The practices which the Opposition have spent so much time in advertising might lead people to believe that they were legitimate.  They are serious revenue offences for which people can be brought before the courts, convicted and fined.  Nobody should be under any illusion whatsoever with regard to the seriousness of the activity of the kind which Deputies opposite have been so ready to advertise. If such practices exist, they existed before this year's Finance Bill.  They existed for a variety of reasons not the least of which has been mentioned in this House on other occasions.  I heard the argument <Col N="620" /> advanced in this House that in cases they arose because bookmakers in Ireland would not be in a position to accept some of the bets offered because they were so big.  From time to time people have been found to be engaging in those practices and they have suffered as a consequence by being fined.  Anybody who runs this risk will have no cause whatsoever for complaint if and when caught and deservedly punished.</P>

      <P>Whether we like it or not&mdash;we might say it is a foolish way of spending their money; but they have been at it down through the years and they will continue to do it &mdash;the poorer sections in every town put a few shillings on all the big races.  You do not see wealthy people outside bookies' offices.  They go to the racecourse to do their betting. Some of the poorer sections never see a racecourse and they put on their few shillings each way every week. Apparently there is discrimination between the amount of tax that will be collected from them and the amount of tax collected on the course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann notes with deep concern the figure of 103,407 registered as unemployed on the 11th April, 1975, and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to rectify this unprecedented situation. </P>
      <P>The figure mentioned in the motion must be a cause of great concern for all Irish people.  Not since the days of the last Coalition have we seen our working people facing the plight where so many of them are unemployed and so many others are fearful lest the dreaded words &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; or &ldquo;short time employment&rdquo; face them at a moment's notice.  There is a great lack of confidence appearing on the factory floor, in industry and in offices generally.  We have the danger of further workers joining the huge queues to the congested labour exchanges throughout the country and we also have problems created for many homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is understandable that every able-bodied man and woman would expect to find employment in his or her country. It is incumbent on the Government to ensure that adequate opportunities are provided for our boys and <Col N="623" /> girls from school days onwards, that they are given the opportunity when they marry and buy their homes of having a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The present lack of confidence in the Government is creating serious problems for workers.  They find their standard of living is lower than what they have been accustomed to under sound Fianna Fáil Government.  It is also creating social problems for the man who is anxious to work but is unable to get it.  He would be much happier out at work.  At the moment many young men have to spend their days at home because there are no employment opportunities open to them.  I am sure all Deputies realise the situation because they will have many people calling for them asking for employment for themselves, their wives, sons and daughters.</P>
    <P>I know the other side of the House will say, as was said when Deputy Dowling put down a similar motion some months ago, that we are only creating panic.  The facts of the situation are now obvious to everybody. The situation in November was very serious but it is much worse now. The Government appear to have no concern for those people who are out of work.  The Government are not giving priority to the plight of the people trying to find employment.  Other issues are constantly highlighted.  Very red herrings are produced to try to divert the minds of the people away from the basic problem of unemployment, which is a major economic one.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister for Labour let us know the positive steps which he and his colleagues intend taking to rectify the unemployment situation and restore the confidence that is slipping so quickly from us?  It appears that the Government are standing by waiting for miracles to happen but those things do not happen.  This situation will not go away from us.  It is not good enough for the Minister to stand up and say that outside problems have led to the unemployment situation.  This has been the tune <Col N="624" /> for too long and it cannot continue. We demand action from the Government. The people demand leadership from the Government.</P>
    <P>I believe in the best aspects of socialism.  I do not believe in it because it follows a particular principle or because it makes good reading in a newspaper or sounds well on television. I believe in the socialism that is best suited to meet the needs of the ordinary Irish people.  I believe in equal opportunity for all our people, the right of every boy and girl to have that equal opportunity.  Some of them can grasp it better than others.  If some of them by their hard work, enterprise and initiative, or possibly luck, make a better success than others do, then they, who in turn can help those who have not done quite so well, deserve to be assisted and encouraged by the State.  Instead of the tactics being employed that kill initiative and effort the Government should be telling them that they are providing a social need in the community and providing employment and they want to see that continuing.</P>
    <P>The Government policies are harmful. The Minister for Labour, on his now famous television appearance last week, said that the Government would not hesitate.  I was in a particular establishment when I heard him making that statement and the comment from a person there was: &ldquo;What else have the Government been doing since they were elected but hesitating?&rdquo;  They have been most hesitant in relation to employment.  It is a crying shame for Labour Party Ministers in the Government to have turned their backs on the working people.  I know they have no experience of working with those people because many of them have come through transcontinental universities to this House.  Many of them have little knowledge of the problems at factory floor level, the problems in our fields, in our building sites and in industry in general.  This is a draw-back when a Government faces a serious situation but it is the test of a Minister and a Government.  It is not enough for them to say that the Arabs are to blame or that a problem <Col N="625" /> has arisen because of some other world crisis.  They should face up to the situation no matter what it is and say: &ldquo;This is our responsibility and we will do our best to provide opportunities for our people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A document produced by Mr. Brendan Walsh of the Economic and Social Research Institute on the structure of unemployment here from 1954 to 1972 is interesting.  Mr. Walsh made some interesting points in that document but I wonder what thought was given by the Minister to his comments. It was thought that unemployment was a structural problem but Mr. Walsh explained in great detail why that is no longer true.  He has also shown that our unemployment situation is responsive to general economic measures.  I do not have to spell out what is meant by that.  Unemployment is responsive to general economic measures taken by an Administration capable of taking such measures.  Perhaps the problem is that the present Administration have not shown any capability or ability to inject responsive measures into our economy.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly these problems are regional.  At present they are occupational but in general they respond to general economic measures.  It appears that the Government are relying on the fact that the Fianna Fáil introduced measures of pay-related benefit and redundancy payment are there as a prop or as a shoulder for the people who are unemployed.  These measures were never intended as such. They were meant to cushion people in the changing face of industry.  They were meant to cushion them over a period but were never meant to be the basis for which 103,000 people would have to depend on for their weekly money.</P>
    <P>This is a Government which have come from nowhere, have arrived nowhere and are going nowhere but the country is suffering for that. There is a lack of leadership that is vitally needed.  A White Paper was issued on the economy last year but it did not lay down any positive policies on how to tackle unemployment. Why did the Minister for <Col N="626" /> Labour not make his contribution and show the positive ways the unemployment situation can be tackled?  A meeting of the national partners took place last November and last weekend the Minister for Finance announced that another meeting of them would take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on Friday. What has happened since the November meeting?  What progress has been made and what hopes can the unemployed people expect from next Friday's meeting?  Let us hope for a change to something positive.  The Government are without policy and potential.  It is a hotch-potch of opposing philosophies that range from the pseudo-socialism of the Minister for Labour, the befuddled liberalism of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the careful nice approach of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to the well-proven conservatism of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach presides over the efforts of the Government and I suppose tries to reconcile the warring interests.  How he held the Government together I am not sure but it appears he is using the old adage : &ldquo;See all, hear all, do nothing&rdquo;.  The Minister for Finance personifies the entire gallery of this group of masquerading administrators. On Friday in Killarney he announced the meeting of the national partners and I hope something comes from it. I would favour this type of meeting if I thought the Government were sincere in their approach to doing something positive for the ailing industries, those unemployed and those fearing the loss of their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how effective the Buy Irish Campaign has been.  Before it was announced by the Ministers I spoke in this House of the necessity for the campaign but I have not seen it continued as intensively as I would have liked.  Why?  Is there a lack of sincerity in this effort? Is there a lack of interest by the Ministers?  It is depressing and disappointing when one sees in shops the wide range of textile and leather goods from cheap-cost countries on <Col N="627" /> display while our workers join the dole queues.</P>
    <P>What happened to the inter-departmental manpower committee promised by the Minister for Labour last November?  Has that committee been set up or have any reports been issued?  This information should be made available to the House.  On November 26th last, the Minister for Labour stated that the information on job creation continues to be hopeful. That was at a time when our unemployed was less than it is now.  There are particular areas of concern, for example, the building industry.  No section of Irish industry responds so quickly to the employment situation than the building and construction industry if it was properly handled.  It is tragic to realise that in February almost 6,000 fewer people were employed in the building industry compared with the same month in 1974, despite the statements of the Minister for Local Government.  The unemployed figure last year was 13,861 on 15th February.  The figure this year on the same date was 19,702&mdash;that in an industry that responds faster than any other to the creation of employment in an area.  Worse than that, and I warn the Minister for Labour now, the outlook for that industry in the private housebuilding and heavy construction sectors is not good.  Were the Minister for Industry and Commerce here I am sure he would tell me I was preaching gloom and despondency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien will be afforded his opportunity.  I <Col N="628" /> want to come now to the clothing and textile industries generally.  Last year in this House a number of us put down a motion to the Minister for Industry and Commerce asking him to realise the plight of workers in those industries and to do something about the situation and to use the devices available to him under our Treaty of Accession to the EEC.  As a result of our placing that motion before the House, eight months too late, the Minister for Industry and Commerce went to Brussels with the problem.  He was sent home and told to put his house in order and if there was a problem to do something about it.</P>
      <P>I do not know yet what steps the Minister has taken.  Millions of pounds worth of Korean, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Portuguese products still flood the shops and roads of this country while our workers are made redundant.  We had an example of it last week in my constituency when there was a receiver appointed over a firm which had been more than 200 years in operation.  I refer to Martin Mahoney's of Blarney.  It is interesting to note that this year that firm received no part of the Government order following the pattern of former years and that at a time when that ailing industry was known to everybody to be in need of that type of support and injection.  That is happening in many other areas throughout the country also.  As I said earlier, it is the test of any Government to face up to the situation of the day.  Perhaps I might be permitted to return to the situation in Blarney for a moment and to say that on the 26th of November last in this House I appealed, through the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs present at the time, to the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to go to Blarney before Christmas to alleviate the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know also from the Minister for Labour how he or the Government propose to use the £8 million granted recently from the social fund of the EEC for job creation.  When I say job creation I do not want to be given airy, fairy figures, doubtful, to say the least, that cannot be substantiated <Col N="629" /> or investigated.  I want something positive, something onto which our people can latch with hope for their own and their children's futures.</P>
    <P>I might refer also to the mismanagement of the regional fund.  It could have benefited the west, north west and south west from an industrial point of view had it been used as we believe it should have been.  The Minister made reference earlier to the announcement today by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We welcome that announcement.  It is not before its time but there has been the dragging of feet, the promise of that announcement which, in the opinion of many people, has cost this country dearly.  It appears to me that any decision now being taken by the Government is too late.  It is being taken at a time when there may have been many millions of pounds lost to the economy.  Such action could have been taken much earlier when there might have been the usual follow-up developments.  Forward planning is very necessary in these types of industries but such planning appears to be still-born with the present Administration. Suppliers are asking daily people who have the expertise and for whom all that is necessary is guidance, information and advise to plan and programme such development.  It is tragic the Government are taking so long to lead in this situation.  The spin-off from this type of industry, from an employment point of view, is something we would hope would materialise in the very near future but it is incumbent on the Government of the day to take the necessary steps in time.  The same applies in the mining area of Navan where approximately 5,000 jobs have been held back, because of delayed tactics.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I want to make on figures with regard to unemployment. The Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House on 6th November, 1974, col. 1144 of the Official Report, speaking on the employment policy motion in regard to the unemployment figure said:</P>
      <P>To inflate it for party political purposes is damaging.  One can make comparisons year on year.  February is not comparable with September because there are fluctuations through the year.</P>
      <P>That is a fair enough point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said on that occasion that the unemployment figure in February, 1973 was 75,551.  For the information of the Minister for Industry and Commerce the figure this year was 103,500, almost 30,000 higher.  Yet no sensible moves have been taken by him.  I want to go back and say, as did the Minister for Industry and Commerce, one cannot compare April with February or, indeed, with November. One would expect that following the pattern of many years the April unemployment figure would be much lower than any of the other months I have mentioned.  Unfortunately, the figure mentioned in the motion was with us on the 11th April and, on the 18th April, almost approaching 1st May, we still have more than 102,500 people unemployed.  That is an indictment of the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and of their colleagues in government. I ask them, for goodness sake in the name of the people of Ireland to realise that publicity gimmicks, television appearances, bluff and propaganda are no longer of any use. Our people demand action, action which has not been forthcoming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the European Community news of April 23, 1975 we are told about the social fund move on unemployment. <Col N="631" /> There it is mentioned that such help is aimed at vulnerable Irish industries such as motor assembly, textiles and building.  Of course, moves such as those must be welcomed at any time but why do we have to wait so long?  That is what our people are asking.  Why did not our Minister for Labour, 14 months ago, when serious problems were first noticed in the textile and leather industry, move then or was he enjoying his promotion to Ministerial office too much to be worried about the needs of the ordinary people he once claimed to represent? The many workers employed in those industries will not forget easily the way they have been let down.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, again in his speech in November last on the unemployment situation, placed great faith in what the Confederation of Irish Industry had to say about the situation at the time.  He said it was &ldquo;hopeful&rdquo;.  I wonder what he would call it now?</P>
    <P>In an article dated 25th February, 1975, there is a reference to a committee within the Confederation of Irish Industry dealing with policy regarding small firms and the cash crisis and the struggle for survival of such firms is noted.  These small firms which comprise companies with less than 100 employees form about 85 per cent of our manufacturing business.  They have a serious liquidity problem and there is a danger that there will be more unemployment. Their backs are to the wall but the Government have done nothing positive to help them.  On the contrary, the Government have introduced taxation that will be harmful to them.  The wealth tax does not concern me personally&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair would allow me to develop the point.  The wealth tax does not concern me personally but I am afraid it will concern workers more seriously than any other taxation imposed by any Government.  I am not making a case for wealthy people but a tax <Col N="632" /> based on the assets of a company, irrespective of whether their is profitability within that company, can only have the effect of more unemployment and an even greater lack of confidence. I would ask the Minister to take a long, hard look at the situation. The wealth tax may appease some doctrinaire socialists but I am concerned about the working people and their children and about creating job opportunities for them.</P>
      <P>All of us must be concerned about this.  Even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to show he is not being encouraged by the man whom we know is regarded as his godfather, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. When the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs asks him to do or say something, he should tell him he has his own problems, that he has responsibility for the unemployed.  The Minister should concentrate on the areas that are his concern, on what should be the prior concern of both Government and Opposition, namely the unemployment situation.  The Minister should realise the economy can be set on its feet.  What we need is confidence in ourselves to improve the livelihoods of the people.  This will not be done by introducing ill-advised legislation.</P>
      <P>The document issued by the Confederation of Irish Industry has stated our economy will be responsive to an injection of capital for development purposes.  We should encourage this, even from other places, if it gives us badly needed employment.  The damage caused by the Government will be difficult to undo and future generations will remember some of the names of the people involved and recall what a disaster they were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister for Finance spoke at the IMA Conference in Killarney.  I wonder if there is any significance in the fact that he spoke there.  As usual, he was not original. He repeated something similar to what was said by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer a few days earlier.  He told the Irish people they were living beyond their means.  To whom was he speaking?  Surely he was not speaking to the 103,000 unemployed <Col N="633" /> or to the unfortunate farmers who are still struggling?  Was he referring to the agricultural labourers, to shop assistants or small shopkeepers?  We must be concerned about these people and the Minister for Finance bears a grave responsibility for them.  The words used by Deputy Colley, Deputy Haughey and others in the course of two budgets are coming home to roost&mdash;unfortunately not on the Government but on the people.</P>
    <P>We have an unemployment rate that, on population figures, is twice as high as the British figure.  What solution does the debonair Minister for Labour wish to offer?  Has he any plans or programmes to meet the situation?  He is always promising pie-in-the-sky and telling people to get ready for the upturn in the economy which is just around the corner.  I would ask him, which corner and when will we arrive at it?</P>
    <P>I do not want Members opposite to tell us we are just being critical. I want to be positive in my criticism. Confidence must be restored in industry and on the factory floor.  Our workers are probably the best group of people one could find in any country.  They will respond but they must have confidence in the Government and in the ability of their fellow-workers.  If that leadership is given it will be a step forward.  Even at this late stage the Government should look for positive ways to help, they should inject capital into the economy so that it may grow and expand.  They must help the industries that will give the greatest response from the point of view of employment.</P>
    <P>The situation is so serious that it must be highlighted in this House.  We are not here to scare anybody; we are here to push the Government to do their duty, a duty they have failed to do to date.  Even at this stage I would urge them to get the wheels of industry moving, to get the people back in their employment and restore their spirit, to remove some of the social problems they have created.  Even if this motion serves no other purpose, it will be of value if it prompts the <Col N="634" /> Government to take the necessary action.  I look forward to a positive reply from the Minister, not the usual response we have come to expect across the floor of this House, material that is designed to be circulated through the media and reported on television, gaining undeserved plaudits for the speaker.  I am asking for something positive this time for the Irish worker.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;an Opposition spokesman cannot understand that this is the nature of the problem. If he did so understand, one could have more time for his observations on the inadequacies of present Government policies.  If his case depends on almost denying the nature and the complexity of the problem, it is difficult to see how he can proceed to suggest remedies to meet the situation. I do not think his case would have suffered by admitting the extent of the international recession.  He could still legitimately criticise the Government as any Government would be criticised in a home parliament, in the economic situation we currently face. I accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in our administration in this debate will deny that we face a serious and difficult situation.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister with the employment-creating agencies under his Department will speak and the Minister for Finance, whose policies and budgets have such an effect on the stimulation of demand in the economy, will speak. Neither of those Ministers will deny that we face a serious situation.  They will, of course, have to say, in honesty, as Opposition spokesmen should say, that we and those with whom we trade face the most severe depression that the western world has faced since the second world war and that all our <Col N="635" /> trading partners have been affected by this slow down in world trade.</P>
    <P>Various opinions can be put forward as to why this slow down occurred but the increase in commodity prices has probably been the largest single factor.  Unemployment has risen in all of the countries in that period and take that barometer of the international economic climate, the United States, we see that the rate there is now more than 8 per cent, which is an increase of almost 100 per cent over the level of 1973.  There is no point in pretending that those events have not occurred, that other countries are not adversely affected. We should not pretend that all is within our control in dealing with a situation so serious for all the major economies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the lack of originality in the speech of the Minister for Finance in Killarney. There is not a great deal of original policy making that one can bring in to meet the situation.  The economic situation does not differ greatly from country to country.  In all countries we are seeking to stimulate economic demand without affecting too adversely our balance of payments position. In all countries we are seeking to direct investment into areas which need least in terms of imports.  What the British Chancellor said last week could apply, perhaps, with equal validity to other economies in Europe but it has the more interest for ourselves when we realise that almost 55 per cent of our exports still go to Britain and whatever happens in the British economy has profound implications for the health of our economy. Despite the fact that we will continue to diversify our export outlets, despite the advantage that our membership of the Community gives us in relieving that situation of over-dependence on the British economy, there is no doubt that a very depressing factor on the performance of our whole economy this year resides in the difficult and intractable nature of the problems faced by the British economy which the Chancellor mentioned.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the UK has now <Col N="636" /> reached nearly one million.  One could probably say that the UK have chosen a later period than the US to deal with their problems, that they have at a later date gone into the area of controlling inflation.  The US did this last year and are now coming out of depression. The British appear to be a year later in acting.  This will have a depressing effect on our export performance in that market.  Whatever we do at home, if the demand in the British market is held down by Government action there, obviously since that market absorbs so much of our products it must have a depressing effect on our performance.  Germany has reached two million.  It would make no sense to suggest that our open economy, an economy far more open to outside influences than any of the stronger economies of Europe would not be affected.  Our total international trade is equivalent to 79 per cent of our GNP and it is inevitable that our economic well-being is intimately bound up with the economic well-being of our trading partners.  All our recent history suggests that we are not able to separate ourselves from the effects of international recession when it hits abroad.</P>

      <P>In previous periods of high unemployment in the world we have not escaped and our unemployment figures have proved this.  In addition to this problem of our industry and its exports, in the past year we have witnessed what could be described as almost the collapse of agricultural prices, largely due to the lack of demand in the European market-place though this will now be corrected.  Here we must pay a well-earned compliment to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whose work in Europe in this area has earned the thanks of Irish farmers.</P>

      <P>It is expected that agricultural incomes will increase by 35 per cent during 1975.  This must <Col N="637" /> mean a stimulation in demand in other parts of the economy.  Our exports this year are expected to be up by 24 per cent.  There is then a very hopeful future even this year for agriculture which is bound to have beneficial repercussions on our home industry in the sense that it will create increased demand for our products.</P>

The money put into the building industry by the Minister for Local Government should help in the summer months to effect an improvement in employment there.  Looking at the performance of the British economy, I would say we will not see a major improvement in the employment position for some months yet.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the American economy is on the way up.  The German economy, too, is beginning to improve and that is the general situation around the world at present.  The exception is the British economy which remains in a very serious condition and one that has serious implications for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are measures that can be taken and which are being taken by this Government and I assure Deputy <Col N="638" /> Fitzgerald that there is no lack of sincerity on our part.  Our actions in this area speak louder than words.  In the 1975 estimate, the Government in their efforts to stimulate home demand without affecting adversely our balance of payments situation, allowed for £100 million for house construction.  That represented an increase of about 25 per cent on the April-December, 1974, estimate, calculated on an annual basis.  I can think of nothing that is more beneficial in terms of providing employment without affecting adversely the balance of payments situation than investment in the housing construction industry. That industry has had that vote of confidence from the Government and will continue to have.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>More than half of the extra amount voted for investment in this area has been allowed for local authority dwellings, the output of which is expected to be in the region of 7,500 in 1975.  The capital provision for grants for the erection and reconstruction of houses and for loans from local authorities for house purchase is estimated at £47.5 million. There is an increase also in the capital provision for sanitary and environmental services while the capital provision for education represents a 30 per cent increase on the 1974 estimate, calculated on an annual basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a further increase of 20 per cent in capital expenditure under the Agriculture Vote compared with 1974.  This money is mainly to encourage investment in land, farm buildings and equipment and for expenditure on arterial drainage and so on.  There has been an increase of about 50 per cent in the 1975 estimate provision for industrial capital expenditure compared with 1974 and, again, calculated on an annual basis. The capital expenditure that the Government have made available is incurred in the main by the IDA, SFADCo and Gaeltarra Éireann.  We have made provision also for about £28 million in loan finance for industry under the capital headings. <Col N="639" /> These are examples of the total capital programme of £457 million which was allowed in the 1975 budget and represents an increase of nearly 20 per cent in the capital investment area compared with the 1974-1975 estimate of £384 million.</P>
    <P>This is how the Government have responded to a situation in which the home market is depressed as a result of conditions abroad where, in the main markets of one's trading partners, one finds depression.  Obviously, at home the Government must seek, by their investment capital project, to ensure that during the period of slack, the home economy is kept at work.  We have attempted to do this because we cannot escape fully the effects of these events abroad but where there is a cessation of a market outlet for a product it is obvious that no amount of stimulation at home can keep the people working in the industry concerned.</P>
    <P>The response of Córas Tráchtála to this problem has been to initiate new export outlets.  They have commenced a special action programme to assist exporters experiencing short term difficulties in their main markets. Vigorous marketing drives are under way in 17 countries with a special emphasis on those economies which have the capacity to import Irish goods, notably oil-producing countries, including Nigeria and the Middle East. The initial response is encouraging. The number of different marketing activities in which Córas Tráchtála are engaged is about three times the level of past activities.  This is a healthy response to our present situation. We must seek out new markets but we are doing this at a time when other countries in similar situations to ourselves are doing likewise.  What we fear most is a reaction in other countries which would come under the heading of import control.  Such a situation would be very serious for us and that is why we, in regard to our international obligations of an economic nature, have been at pains to avoid that weapon so far.  It is obvious that if our major trading partners adopt such a course, the consequences <Col N="640" /> here would be very serious.  If, for example, that course were adopted by our British partners in the EEC, we would have many more close-downs. All of the countries experiencing the results of the present recession have a duty to one another to ensure that import controls are not used against competitors so as to save the home employment situation.  Such a common course of action would lead to disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when contributing to this debate, will answer in greater detail the Deputy's charges in that regard but my information is that the action he suggests was not open to us under our Treaty obligation in the Community.  In priming the capital programme, ensuring that there is investment where it counts most and ensuring that we do not simply waste the cash available for current purposes we cushion the worst effects for the unemployed.  We have done that to ensure there is not undue suffering and we are working with our partners in the Community to ensure the possibility of an early economic revival in Europe.  We are using any influence we have to ensure that there is no import control on the part of any of our partners.  Such a situation would not help in bringing about the conditions for international recovery.</P>
      <P>There will be a meeting shortly at European level between Finance and Employment Ministers when we shall be considering what further steps may be taken to ensure that in the financial policies being followed by the various member countries there is co-ordination to permit of our working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in a difficult situation, the Government can say that their response has been the correct one.  It is a response which does not see any advantage in pretending that there are not difficulties but which emphasises there is an element of international recession in the present situation beyond our control and emphasises also that there are steps which we can take at <Col N="641" /> home, steps that we have been taking. For example, the rate of job creation reported by the IDA is projected at 23,000 this year.  That target shows that the employment-creating agencies are at work.  Already I have instanced the new export drive of Coras Tráchtála.</P>

      <P>This evening there was the announcement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of our plans for the exploitation of the national resources that are under the seabed.  This is a further illustration of the determination of the Government to see this crisis through to new employment expansion.  That is our determination.</P>
      <P>This Government have no intention of running from these present difficulties. The people would not thank us if we did not do our duty.  It is our national duty to work our way out of the present recession with the other member countries of the European Community.  We hope very shortly to see a change in the international situation. We will see more jobs being created.  There is the IDA projection. There are new markets being sought by CTT.  There is the development of our mining industry to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has given the all clear today.  There will be new jobs and new skills coming out of these developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to my own responsibility for the training of our manpower, I believe that during this period of slack in our economy we have the time to prepare for the period of upswing.  That is what I have been doing in my own area.  I have been getting the co-operation of my colleagues in Government in spending more money on training.  More money <Col N="642" /> has been spent in that area than ever before.  In this period of difficulty more Irish men and women will be trained to new skills than ever before. More money will be spent from the social fund than ever before for the training of Irish men and women.</P>
    <P>All of this is designed to ensure that, when the markets recover, here at home we will be ready to take off with that recovery.  We should not fall back into an attitude of despair.  There is no reason for despair.  This is a period of preparation and the Government are engaged in that.  We are meeting our major partners next Friday to hear their views on methods of treating our economic sickness.  We will listen to them very carefully. Based on those conversations, we will continue our own work on the preparation of a strategy for economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The outline I have given shows that the Government's response so far has been positive, concrete and realistic. We have invested in the areas which can give us the opportunity of making a recovery at home.  We believe that such a recovery will become more and more evident at the end of this year and the start of next year.  That is our approach to the situation before us.  We have not heard any case from the Opposition.  We are keen to hear what the Opposition's policies are.</P>
    <P>There is no substitute for a policy. No rhetorical charges of lack of sincerity, no vulgar abuse, no bringing in of the names of this Minister or that is a substitute for a policy.  Maybe during this debate we will hear something about policy from the Opposition.  Maybe we will hear an alternative to the things we have been doing.  We would like to hear it spelled out and, so far, it has not been spelled out.  If the Opposition have an ambition to return some day to these benches, we need to hear that policy spelled out clearly.  If there are alternatives to what we have been doing, let us hear them.  If there are not, I would suggest that nobody will be convinced by denunciations or charges of lack of sincerity.</P>
    <P>Every member of this Government is anxious to ride out these difficulties, <Col N="643" /> and anxious to see our employment situation improving.  It will improve with the upswing which must occur in the countries of our trading partners.  With the contribution from the European Social Fund, and with the extra money we are giving in our training programme, we will have the largest number of men and women undergoing retraining this year than ever before.  Even in our present difficulties some industries are showing signs of recovery.  This bodes well for the future.  There are very fast-growing sectors even in this period of difficulty in the areas of pharmaceuticals and electronics.  Quite recently I opened a seminar on electronics.  That is a very fast-growing industry.  These are the industries into which we must put massive investment so that, when the markets abroad improve, they will be able to expand at a very rapid pace indeed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy wondered whether the Government's policy was consistent with the study he mentioned&mdash;the ERSI on employment&mdash;which suggested that employment is responsive to demand for the goods we produce. We have been following along the lines of that study.  We accept that the demand which is lacking at present is mainly at international level.  We accept that until that demand is there once more, people will not be secure in their jobs.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Buy Irish campaign the Minister for Industry and Commerce will take part in this debate and answer for the work of this committee. From my discussions with him I would suggest that the committee has worked well.  I accept that there is a real difficulty.  It was understood during the debate on free trade that the home market could be threatened in conditions of free trade.  Nobody could look with satisfaction at the number of products manufactured abroad which are being bought here. However many strictures we may address to the consumer that he should not do so, increasingly he is going for products which he believes are of better design and better value. We are doing everything possible to <Col N="644" /> ensure that our products are improved in design and that they are good value. The Government will do whatever can be done to ensure that the home market is retained for Irish products.  We will continue our propaganda campaign to this end.  The only safe way of ensuring the retention of the home market is by giving value for money.</P>
    <P>Other Ministers will speak in this debate and deal with their responsibilities. I am giving a general description of the Government's response to the situation.  It is a serious situation. We do not deny that.  We will see it through.  The Government have no intention of running from it.  I want to make that quite clear and other Ministers will make it clear also.  I would prefer to be in Government at a time of difficulty than in a period of ease. When Fianna Fáil were here there were no problems apart from the problems of their own making&mdash;political problems connected with Northern Ireland, and difficulties within their own party on their approach to peace or war in this island.  The difficulties we face are of an economic nature.  We will not shirk our responsibilities.  We will not run from the problems facing us.  We will see them out.  All members of this Cabinet would prefer to be here at this time of difficulty to serve the Irish people. We intend to remain at our posts and ride out the storm.  We will bring the country back to full economic recovery and then we will ask the people for the verdict.</P>

I want to read a section of the famous 14-point plan &mdash;the section dealing with employment&mdash;to remind the Government of the pledge they gave to the people prior to the last general election.  They talked about stopping the price rise and said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragic events in the North have clouded the fact that the economy is in serious trouble <Col N="645" /> because of the indecisiveness of a Government distracted by its own internal difficulties.  The immediate economic aims of the new Government will be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies, reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development.  It is essential to control prices if these important economic aims are to be realised.  The Government will, therefore, take immediate steps to introduce strict price control.  As an earnest of its good faith in regard to the control of prices the Government will remove VAT from foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>The Government will regard the control of price inflation as indispensable to the continuance of the National Wage Agreement.  The two parties are convinced that voluntary wage agreements reached on a national level are the best basis for economic development, stability and growth in jobs.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The two parties recognise that these policy priorities constitute the basis of the legislative programme of the National Coalition Government and that the implementation of these proposals will transform Ireland into a modern progressive society based on social justice.</P>
    <P>In the 14-point plan announced prior to the election we had the promises made by the present National Coalition Government, now often referred to as &ldquo;GOAT&rdquo; the Government of all talents.  I do not like the cumbersome title &ldquo;National Coalition Government&rdquo;. I prefer the Government of all talents, otherwise abbreviated to &ldquo;GOAT&rdquo;.  In the light of the lack of development over the years and the absence of effort to implement the 14-point plan, it is obvious that the Government just lay down and wished for the best but a wishbone is no substitute for a backbone.  One must make a positive approach to problems.  No such positive approach has been made. Possibly the Government have a policy for unemployment and for those who are unable to obtain employment and that policy is &ldquo;Love on the Dole&rdquo;. That would appear to be the only <Col N="646" /> policy they have for the unfortunate people now signing on at the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>Is this what is meant by socialism in the seventies?  Is this what the Labour Party mean by socialism in the seventies? Is that what they meant in the election campaign&mdash;unemployment, rising prices and chaos in family life as a result of the tragedies brought about by unemployment?  Or is it the old Fine Gael policy that it is not the duty of the Government to provide work for the people?  The Government have made no effort to provide work.  The man who said it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the people was a Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>We know now what socialism in the seventies is like.  We realise now that the Fine Gael Party have converted the Labour Party into believing it is not the duty or responsibility of the Government to provide employment.  The Minister wanted to know what policy the Opposition had to solve this problem. On 26th November, 1974, the Minister for Finance was asked if, in view of the OECD recommendation that Ireland should now have a long range strategy for future development, the Government intend to produce such a programme.  In reply he said:</P>
    <P>I indicated in my budget statement of 3rd April last that the Government had decided that it would not be possible to publish a meaningful development programme for the years ahead in the light of the unsettled world situation.  Developments since then have merely added to the uncertainties surrounding the future economic outlook.  The question is, however, under continuing review.</P>
    <P>The Government have no long range plan.  The Taoiseach on one occasion met the captains of industry and he will meet them again next Friday.  A week before he met them he indicated there was no cause whatever for concern. A week later the situation was so bad he had to bring these people together.  We are told now they will be coming together again in the near future to seek a solution to this grave problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="647" /> On 26th November, 1974, the Leader of the Opposition queried the Minister for Finance as to the desirability of the Government putting forward certain economic aims and aspirations based on reasonable assumptions. In reply to that, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>A number of countries comparable to ours, including Denmark, decided recently not to publish economic programmes because of the uncertainties that exist.  When many of the problems now facing the world become more recognisable as to their ultimate implications, then it would be appropriate to issue a plan.</P>
    <P>We know now that the Government have no plan.  That is what the man who holds the purse strings stated on 26th November, 1974.  Without a plan where do we go?  On the 11th of this month we had 103,407 unemployed on the live register; we have 8,131 on short time and approximately 30,000 more unable to obtain employment, people who are not on the live register because they think it would be useless to register, professional people who have lost their employment and other categories of workers.  It will be seen from these figures how very serious the situation is, far more serious than what is indicated by the official statistics.  In all, we have roughly 133,000 unemployed.  This is a very serious situation compared with 12 months ago.  It was 12 months ago the Government should have taken steps to prevent the situation we have today arising.  The Minister for Labour would be well advised when introducing training programmes to introduce a special training scheme to train some Ministers in the methods of coping with the problems that confront us.</P>
    <P>On 19th April last year the number of unemployed was 69,351.  The upward spiral has now reached a level hitherto unknown.  We now ask the Minister for Labour and the Ministers to come to indicate clearly what positive steps they propose taking?  We also ask the Government the questions similar to the one the Minister for <Col N="648" /> Labour put to the Opposition: &ldquo;What plans and policy have the Government for the future?&rdquo;  If they have no plans or policy and indicate that because of the pressures from outside, the Opposition should produce a plan and a policy and they want to hear that then we will have a rethink about the situation.  The Minister has clarified that point.  The Government have no policy and no plans for the future.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the IDA, a very reputable group, who have done wonderful work but the Government have a responsibility.  We know the real problems which confront the country at the moment.  We were told by the Minister tonight that great news was being disclosed to the people by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. We have heard all that before and also the panic announcements.  When motions were put down in the past in relation to unemployment, and the position in the various industries such as the clothing and footwear industries we had panic announcements by the various Ministers.  The public will no longer accept those announcements and the type of speech so often made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to cloud the situation.  His tactics over the past few years are well known to the people and I am sure in the future they will pay no attention to this irresponsible Minister who tends to direct the attention of the House and the public from the real problems facing the nation.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation cannot be attributed to any one problem.  We know there is world recession.  The Minister for Labour gave us the geography lesson which has so often been given by various Ministers when they are asked to explain their failure to produce a plan for the future that might provide guidelines for industry and give a ray of hope to workers who are now in the ever-increasing dole queues.  On 26th November, 1974, reference was made to a number of countries, including Denmark.  The European Communities <i>Newsletter</i> of the 23rd April, 1975, says that according to the most recent figures 5,000,000 people are out of work with percentages of unemployment ranging <Col N="649" /> from less than 1 per cent in Luxembourg to 11.8 per cent in Denmark. Ireland was in second place with 8.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>It appears from this document that we wish to align ourselves with the most destitute type of thinking in relation to political survival and because Denmark decides she will not publish a policy we should not produce one.  The figures given in this document are a clear indication that other member states of the EEC are correcting their economies but we are prepared to wait until Denmark decides that the coast is clear.  The Government should endeavour to arrest the downward trend of the present situation. Whatever success other countries may have had with regard to arresting the unemployment situation no effort is being made by this Government to do something about it.  We have ever-increasing dole queues.  As Deputy Fitzgerald stated we want the Government to put the people back to work.</P>
    <P>Apparently the only place overtime work is available at the moment is in the unemployment exchanges. During the recent Galway by-election I spoke outside a labour exchange and I was told the people inside the exchange were working overtime while thousands stood in the dole queue outside.  Great shame is attached to the Labour Party for supporting the Government in doing nothing about the unemployment situation. If the Minister for Labour, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were in Opposition now they would feel that outside problems bear lightly on home affairs but when they are in Government they feel they bear very very heavily on them.  We all agree that when outside factors have a bearing on unemployment figures, corrective measures have to be taken both inside and outside the country.</P>
    <P>There is a very unpromising outlook for school leavers who in the past had the promise of obtaining employment. What about the thousands of young people about to complete their leaving certificate, who will now have to join the queues at labour exchanges? What will this very vulnerable <Col N="650" /> section of the community think of the Government?  A high proportion of them, who have secondary education, do not want to emigrate to menial jobs.  We will have large scale social unrest from young people, who have no hope of obtaining employment in the future.  The Government made the fundamental mistake of being lulled into the belief that the expanding economy left by Fianna Fáil would continue but they did not realise it was a product of a long period of economic planning.  This is where the Government have fallen down.  They believed that the wishbone was there and all they had to do was to wish for the best.  The long period of economic planning that brought about the expanding economy we left did not continue because the many sections within the Government, Ministers with different outlooks, drifted apart.</P>

      <P>The effect of this section is to increase excise duty chargeable on the issue of gaming licences under section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 by £60 per year and by a proportionate amount where a licence is issued for a shorter period.  The resulting increase in revenue would be approximately £3,500 in the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase in the licence fee by £60 per annum is an increase of 150 per cent which seems to be an inordinate amount.  Subsection (i) of the section states that the section applies to gaming licences issued under section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 and I should like to know if the various charitable pools which are controlled by this Act will be affected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they are not involved. What we are dealing with here is gaming which is carried on in amusement halls and at fun fairs.  The Deputy <Col N="651" /> is talking about lotteries and not gaming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act states:</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners shall, on the application of a person to whom a certificate for a gaming licence has been granted and on payment by him of any excise duty provided for by law, issue to the applicant a licence in such form as they direct which shall be and be expressed to be subject to the conditions attached to the certificate.</P>
      <P>I should like to know under what section of the 1956 Act the licences I have referred to are issued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very distinct difference between gaming and lottery.  Gaming is defined as playing a game, whether of skill or chance or partly of skill and partly of chance, for stakes hazarded by the players.  The Deputy is talking about lotteries which are distinct from gaming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The definitions are contained in section 2 of the 1956 Act, part of which I have referred to. I have already given the definition of gaming and the definition of a lottery is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Lottery&rdquo; includes all competitions for money or money's worth involving guesses or estimates of future events or of past events the results of which are not yet ascertained or not generally known;</P>
      <P>These definitions are quite distinct and are in no way possible of confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with amusement halls where machines are used, where the result is determined by the operation of the machine and <Col N="652" /> not by any skill on the part of the players.  There are those cases where people of exceptional skill might be able to ordain the outcome but that is not the primary factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe bingo is a modern version of pongo.  I forget the difference between the two games but in the seaside resorts near Dublin halls now display the magic word &ldquo;bingo&rdquo; whereas in my boyhood days they displayed the magic word &ldquo;pongo&rdquo;.  In private family circles a game not dissimilar was played with cards and it was called housey-housey. The rules are fundamentally the same whatever sophistication may have been introduced in the meantime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no statutory definitions of those activities and I rely upon the statutory definitions contained in the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 which has stood the test of years.  Deputy Lalor posed the argument that there was some element in this amendment of the law which involved lotteries conducted for charitable <Col N="653" /> purposes and I pointed out that the activity of gaming is quite distinct from that of lottery.  I pointed out that a gaming licence is a licence under section 19 of the 1956 Act and that a lottery licence is issued under section 28 of the 1956 Act.  We are dealing with gaming only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">

      <P>Bingo is a competition for money and money's worth involving guesses or estimates of future events or of past events the results of which are not yet ascertained or not yet generally known.  A person takes a card in anticipation that events shown on that card may occur and subsequently acts are conducted by some other party or parties which determine whether or not the events forecast on the card are fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the machine used at that point in time?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The machine is incidental only to Bingo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear whether or not the machine is incidental only.  Is that the Minister's interpretation of it?  Does the machine not play a very big part in determining the outcome and, as such, could it not be classified as a game rather than a lottery?  I would accept an appliance such as the Sweepstakes drum being classified as a machine. It is twirled around to mix the tickets and eventually somebody dips a hand in and pulls out a raffle ticket.  I wonder does a Bingo machine work on the same principle?  I claim that if it is not worked on that principle it ought to be classified as gaming and not a lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I could not pretend to reach to those extremes of technology in this area nor do I think we are called upon to deal with such elements at this stage.  If technology has advanced faster than the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 it has not thrown up any <Col N="654" /> difficulties on that account.  I am saying that the licences to which this section refers are those which are required under section 19 of the 1956 Act and such licences do not apply to lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are back to the definition of what is a lottery and what is a game.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the 1956 Act. I have quoted them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quoted from the 1956 Act.  Things have changed so much since then.  From my point of view, looking greenly at subsection (1) without going into its detail, my reaction was that it would catch all those other games, Bingo and so on even if one extends it in the way Deputy Murphy has done to the drum turning over at the sweepstakes.  Gaming Instrument is defined in the 1956 Act as:</P>
      <P>any table or instrument of gaming and any coin, card, token or other article used as an instrument or means of gaming;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to what Deputy Murphy has said, as I see it, the blow machine or one of those new developments as far as the chance selection of the ball for Bingo is concerned could come under the heading of a &ldquo;gaming instrument&rdquo;. If in the course of the pursuance of lottery, one finds it necessary to use what could be defined, under the 1956 Act, as a &ldquo;gaming instrument&rdquo; difficulties could arise.  I found myself the other day talking in terms of something being a Bill designed to protect the taxpayer against the Revenue Commissioners and creating a joke here.  Therefore, I can only assume that if there is a loophole&mdash;usually it is the taxpayer but, in this case, it is the excise-duty payer who is caught out&mdash;it could transpire that some member of the Revenue Commissioners, looking at the 1975 Finance Bill, looking again at the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956, could decide some fine day that a simple lottery, where a licence is obtained from the superintendent in the normal course, came under the heading of section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries <Col N="655" /> Act and that that type of licence would have to be obtained and paid for.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that here we have a game which with certain little additions has changed from &ldquo;Housey, Housey&rdquo; to Bingo.  But other things have happened also in relation to the change-over which do involve the use of an instrument or machine which could be defined legally as a &ldquo;gaming instrument&rdquo; and make it necessary for this lottery to become leviable under section 41 of the 1975 Finance Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What is this wonderful machine doing except replacing the human person who used to pick a ball out of a bag and throw it into a box in the centre of a circle which used to be divided, in turn, into a whole lot of small sections which were numbered differently; in other words, whatever would be the process by which numbers were selected for playing of Bingo the fundamental rules which determine the outcome have not changed as between 1956 and 1975. I say, with respect, all that we have power to do in this Bill is to change the duty imposed by the Finance Act, 1956.  Indeed, it could almost be said that we need not have made reference, in section 41, to the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956 because section 17 of the Finance Act, 1956 is the section of the law now being amended.  If there is any room for doubt or argument, such as suggested by Deputies opposite, then that is a matter for the gaming and lotteries legislation and for the Minister for Justice.  I am not passing the buck but I am saying that if any questions of doubt have arisen, then the appropriate Department to deal with the matter is the Department of Justice.  This section seeks to extend the application of the duty imposed by section 17 of the Finance Act, 1956 beyond those instruments to which, until now, it has always been deemed to apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may say, and presumably he is correct in so doing, that this falls within the <Col N="656" /> ambit of another Department and another Minister.  Nevertheless, we must examine the situation and be extremely cautious lest, unwittingly, we bring about some form of development which would change the basic terms of the situation.  The Minister mentioned the machine used in relation to Bingo and said that that machine simply took the place of the human hand, as it were, that perhaps it was a sophisticated type of machine.  I wonder at what stage can it be determined that such machine has become a &ldquo;gaming instrument&rdquo; within the strict interpretation of the law.  That is the point that worries me.  I feel that, perhaps, the Minister made light of the situation in referring to the change-over from the personal touch to a machine.  I can remember, as the Minister might well do, at fairs and amusement arcades, the &ldquo;roll a penny&rdquo; business, where one took the chute and rolled a penny down along it.  If one were lucky enough, one managed to get that penny standing on a space marked twopence or threepence.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Surely we are entitled to know what is being increased.  The Chair has told us the Minister for Finance is not in a position to give a definition.  All of us know how many cases have gone to the High Court and the Supreme Court because of the question of definition.  We are trying to find out what machines these increases will apply to and that is what Deputies Lalor and Murphy have been trying to ascertain for the last 20 minutes. We believe that they could be extended to the machine used in bingo and we are trying to clarify the position.  The definition in any Bill is important and the Chair is more aware than most Deputies that if there is any ambiguity there may be repercussions afterwards.  It has frequently happened that a different definition is given to legislation by the various Departments who may implement it.  The Chair has pointed out that it is a matter for the Minister for Justice but in this case <Col N="658" /> the Minister for Finance is increasing the duty on the machines and we are trying to ascertain the extent.</P>

      <P>May I point out we are not dealing with machines in this section?  We are dealing with licences for places where gaming will take place.  Nothing being done now in any way changes the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  If those definitions are inaccurate to deal with modern circumstances so be it, but this legislation does not, and cannot, amend that Act.  We are dealing with the Finance Bill but if the Deputies opposite are anxious not to see this section or any gaming licence, as distinct from a lottery licence, apply to bingo I would urge them not to argue as they are doing.  If there is merit in their argument, all they will do is to stimulate the grey matter of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputies opposite are now suggesting that modern technology has brought certain &ldquo;sports&rdquo;&mdash;I put that word in quotes &mdash;within the ambit of gaming rather than lottery.  As the Chair has pointed out, that matter is not being discussed at this stage and we cannot deal with it in this legislation.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In case there should be any misunderstanding for my reason in <Col N="659" /> mentioning the game of bingo, I would point out it was in case the Revenue Commissioners should try to impose a duty on that game at any time.  I am well aware of the vast amount of money being collected for charity at the bingo sessions.  Schools and community centres have been built on the proceeds of the game and I wanted to be sure this section would not include the apparatus used in bingo.  The Minister for Finance seems to be under the impression that we want to include bingo but our intention is the opposite; we want to ensure the Revenue Commissioners will not tax that game in the future.  That is the reason we mentioned the machine used at bingo.</P>

In common with Deputy Fitzpatrick, I appreciate what has been done by voluntary groups towards the provision of community facilities and I realise that much of the money has come from bingo sessions. Far be it from me to suggest the Revenue Commissioners might include bingo in the gaming category.  I know there are pros and cons about bingo but I like to think the good derived from the game outweighs the evils, even though the evils are many.</P>

This does not refer to any premises; it must be a premises with certain equipment and I am not sure what that equipment is. Whether a gaming licence duty would have to be paid would depend on the equipment.  In other words, what is a gaming machine?  I would still like the Minister to define &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair's last comment seemed rather apt.  It is impossible to deal with section 41 without taking into consideration section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 and what that involves.  It is in this section.  The Minister referred to it and indeed quoted definitions from the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  The Minister has told us that what we are talking about here is a premises. There is a definition of &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in the next section but there is no reference to the word in subsection (2) <Col N="662" /> of this section.  The reference here is to gaming licences and refers to a duty imposed by section 17 of the Finance Act, 1956 on gaming licences.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you have drawn attention to the fact that what we are talking about is duty.  What is being amended here is section 17 of the 1956 Act from which I quote:</P>
      <P>There shall be charged, levied and paid for and upon every gaming licence issued under section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 (No. 2 of 1956), an excise duty at the following rates, that is to say:&mdash;...</P>
      <P>and this is where the quotation is exactly the same.</P>
      <P>... where the period for which the licence is to be issued, as specified in the certificate under the said Act authorising the issue of the licence&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  does not exceed three months, ten pounds;</P>
      <P>(b)  exceeds three months but does not exceed six months, twenty pounds;</P>
      <P>(c)  exceeds six months but does not exceed nine months, thirty pounds;</P>
      <P>(d)  exceeds nine months, forty pounds. </P>
      <P>We are talking here of an increase of 150 per cent in excise duty but nowhere in section 41 of this Bill nor in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1956, nor in section 19 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 is there reference to &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.  Can the Minister say whether the gaming licence we are talking about in this section is one applied for by an individual, by a group or by a company or whether it is a licence dealing with a premises?</P>
      <P>We find in section 42 that &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is defined as an amusement hall or a fun fair.  Why should the Minister continue to insist that what we are talking about in this section is &ldquo;premises&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>In this Bill we are not changing one iota of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  Apparently, the Deputies do not understand the ramifications of a Finance Act.  I have said to them that a Finance Act could not purport to interfere with the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956.  We are dealing with taxation matters here and the amendment we are making is to the Finance Act, 1956.  If the Deputies had done their homework, they would have found that section 14 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 says that gaming carried on at an amusement hall or fun fair shall not be unlawful gaming if carried on in accordance with a licence while section 15 of the same Act says that a district court may grant a certificate authorising the issue of such licence. These two section are related to section 19 which deals with the issue of a licence.  We are seeking to amend here the Finance Act, 1956 which stated what was the duty to be paid on gaming licences.  That is all we have power to do.  Consequently, all the talk that has been indulged in since 7.30 p.m. has nothing to do with the only thing this Bill can do, that is, to change the rates of duty.</P>

In the course of our examination of the Bill we could not see where this reference fitted in and we were afraid that the Minister was inserting it with foresight.  Now we find he was not cunning, using that in the strict sense of the word.  It is irrelevant to the Bill.  We on this side of the House have got this admission from the Minister.

After we teased it out we found there was no need for it.  The Minister said <Col N="667" /> that if it was upsetting and worrying us he would consider bringing in an amendment at a later stage to delete it. After a minute or two the Minister said that if it is still causing us anxiety he will leave it in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We want to know what is the real significance of the subsection.  Are there any grounds for the fears we expressed when we opened the debate on this section of the Bill?  When we examined the Bill we could not see the significance of this subsection.  The Minister should make a decision on his own legislation.  Will he state that he will bring in an amendment to delete section 41 (1) from this Bill? If the Minister can satisfy this side of the House on that point, we may be able to continue with the remaining sections.  I hope a ready answer will be forthcoming from the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.22:</P>
      <P>In page 22, line 15, after &ldquo;play&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a machine in respect of which the player pays a sum not exceeding 1p to play the machine whether by the insertion of a coin or token or in some other way and which, when played by a player once and successfully, entitles that player to a prize not exceeding 5p in value&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment arises in connection with the definition of a machine as a gaming machine.  A machine which pays a dividend of five pence to one penny is so innocuous that it would never be used by somebody of a gambling mentality; it would be used rather by someone looking for shelter at a seaside resort or in some other amusement centre or by someone who wants to punch in an hour or two. The definition specifies:</P>
      <P>... a machine which, when played by a player once and successfully,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> affords that player no more than an opportunity to play again (once or more often) without paying to play shall be deemed not to be a gaming machine.</P>
    <P>The kind of machine covered by the amendment is not such as to be a temptation to a gambler.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the amendment would be to exempt from licence duty gaming machines in respect of which the maximum stake to play is one penny and the maximum prize a player can win is five pence, or its equivalent in value.  The definition of gaming machines is contained in subsection (2) (a) and is so framed as to exclude a considerable number of machines designed wholly or primarily for amusement.  It excludes, for instance, machines which can play successfully and earn the player nothing more than the right to play the same machine again, once or more often, and machines which are so designed that the outcome of the game is not determined by the action of the machine regardless of whether it incorporates a device the player can manipulate to try to enhance his chance of winning a prize. A large proportion of the machines the Deputy seeks to exclude would, therefore, be excluded by that definition, depending on the outcome of the game and partly and wholly on the skill of the player and not wholly or partly on the action of the machine.  I am told that examples of such machines are the &ldquo;pusher&rdquo; machine or &ldquo;penny drop&rdquo; where the skilful position of the coin or token mechanically operated sweeping ram of the machine would cause one or more coins to drop off a ledge into a pay-out shoot.  Acceptance of the amendment would lead to very serious difficulties of control in order to establish the validity of the proprietor's claim that machines have a maximum stake of one penny and a prize of five pence and it would be necessary for the control officer to play each such machine and play it until such time as he wins a prize.  The machine may be labelled as a penny machine but habitués could reasonably <Col N="670" /> know otherwise.  Furthermore, the existence of an exemption in the terms of the amendment would encourage a gradual swing to penny machines in which the odds against winning could be radically loaded against the operator and in favour of the proprietor with an inevitable erosion of the basis of the duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (a) (ii) provides:</P>
      <P>the player pays to play the machine whether by the insertion of a coin or token or in some other way, and</P>
      <P>Clause (iii) provides:</P>
      <P>the outcome of the game is determined by the action of the machine, whether or not provision is made for manipulation of the machine by the player.</P>
      <P>The outcome of the game is determined by the action of the machine whether or not provision is made for the manipulation of it by the player. The Minister brings in only one exemption that is that the prize for a person who plays this machine and is successful is simply a free game. Is this sufficient inducement to a person playing those machines?  We feel we have struck the correct balance. We wish to have exempted the machine which accepts a small stake, the second smallest currency denomination which we have, a 1p, where the successful person could accumulate 5p, that is a gain of 4p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot of people play those machines for pleasure.  The better class amusement arcades in my constituency of Wicklow at weekends, and even at mid-week during the holiday season, are crowded with people who come to them.  They are not gambling arcades. They are amusement arcades.  A proprietor who wants to acquire a licence must have a number of amusements, such as the ghost train and the dodgems, which involve a lot of capital and are classified as amusements. A machine covered by the amendment in the name of Deputy Colley would be better classified as an amusement than as gaming.  The stake does not exceed 1p and the maximum prize, a return of 5p gives a gain of <Col N="671" /> 4p, which could not be classified as a one armed bandit.  We must distinguish between those machines, which give enjoyment to people, and those which are used for gambling.</P>
    <P>The people who use the machines I refer to will probably gain a few pence and they know the maximum amount they are willing to pay out. They regard those machines as a pastime.  It is the function of the House to look after the recreational pastimes of the people and not to clamp down on them entirely.  It may take four games of the machine for a person to win 5p.  He then plays on for a further number of games.  Those machines are far different from the one armed bandit machines into which a capital sum is inserted.  The win gained in those machines can become the stake at various odds.  If the person wins £2.50p that sum can then become the stake for another attempt at the machine at odds of three or four to one.  This, by its snowballing effect is gambling.  This without question is a one armed bandit.  There is no comparison between it and the gaming machine which this side of the House wish to see excluded from duty.</P>
    <P>Many people on fine afternoons prefer to go to amusement arcades, where there are those machines with small stakes, rather than go to the films or race tracks.  They bring their families with them and like to spend their few coppers in their own way. They know they will not get rich and on the law of averages they will lose out but in the course of playing the machine five or six times they will see the machine give back to them 4p or 5p, which they will continue to insert. This will build up until their few coppers have dwindled away and they go back with another 5p and obtain a few more pence.  At the same time their children have the opportunity of making use of the dodgems, ghost trains and the roundabouts.  I have been informed that in order to comply with the terms of the licence it is necessary to have a certain number of these machines in the amusement arcades.  Even though the Minister has put forward plausible reasons why our amendment should not be <Col N="672" /> included, he ought to take cognisance of the fact that many families spend afternoons in the summer at such arcades.  They are not there for the purpose of making money.  They are out to enjoy themselves.  Why deprive them of that enjoyment?  If these machines are not included, the proprietors of such amusement arcades will have them removed from the premises and in so doing will curtail the enjoyment of many people.</P>
    <P>Many people enjoy themselves at the amusement arcades in Bray.  There is not a great deal of cash involved and the people who play the machines are not concerned about winning.  If they were interested in gambling, they would be in attendance at the gambling saloons, premises I do not approve of but which I know exist.  The one armed bandits with the maximum jackpots are bad and they do not give enjoyment to anybody.  I sympathise with those who play these machines solely for the purpose of trying to beat the system and I look forward to the day when we can have good legislation to cater for such forms of gambling.  I look forward to the day when we can extend good community care facilities to those who are addicted to this kind of gambling. However, we should not have the one armed bandits classified in the same bracket as the penny machines which return a mere 4p to the player if he wins.  The Minister has come up with technical reasons why he cannot accept our amendment but a little humanity should prevail.</P>
    <P>There are other ways open to the Minister to check such establishments. For instance he could introduce a system of spot checks.  One way of coping with the problem of the one armed bandits would be to impose heavy duty on those machines.  The machine that gives a small profit and in so doing gives pleasure to holiday-makers should be exempt from such duty.  Subsection (2) of this section states:</P>
    <P>A machine is a gaming machine if&mdash;</P>
    <P> (i)  it is constructed or adapted for gaming, and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> (ii)  the player pays to play the machine whether by the insertion of a coin or token or in some other way, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the outcome of the game is determined by the action of the machine, whether or not provision is made for manipulation of the machine by the player, </P>
    <P>but a machine which, when played by a player once and successfully, affords that player no more than an opportunity to play again (once or more often) without paying to play shall be deemed not to be a gaming machine.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's amendment is:</P>
    <P>After &ldquo;play&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and a machine in respect of which the player pays a sum not exceeding 1p to play the machine whether by the insertion of a coin or token or in some other way and which, when played by a player once and successfully, entitles that player to a prize not exceeding 5p in value.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable amendment and I would ask the Minister to give further thought to its acceptance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The trap into which the Minister is falling in relation to this part of section 42 is that he cannot distinguish between gaming or gambling and amusement.  What the Opposition spokesman on Finance is attempting to do is to preserve the element of amusement.  The previous speaker, Deputy Murphy is concerned, in that in his constituency there are a number of tourist areas in which that type of operation is conducted, for instance, in Bray, Arklow or other areas to which many Dublin people commute on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon.  I have been often in the Bray area and, from time to time, have gone into what could be described as amusement arcades rather than gambling casinos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously Deputy Colley's amendment is unacceptable to the Minister who read out his reasons for non-acceptance rather than articulate his own views in his usual angry fashion. We ask the Minister to accept the <Col N="674" /> amendment, bearing in mind at all times that if we must have slot machines, and obviously they are in existence, there is absolutely no reason why, as in the case of other games coming under the Gaming and Lotteries Act of 1956, they should not be subject to some form of taxation. But what the Minister is doing here is introducing a penal tax on to what can be described only as machines which give amusement.  As we have said, these are not gambling machines in the accepted sense of the word &ldquo;gambling&rdquo;.  For instance, there are organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous.  Certainly any member of that organisation who, having joined breaks away and takes up gambling again, will not go to an amusement arcade in, say, Bray or any other part of the country to amuse himself or gamble.  Quite the contrary.  What that man wants is the hope of a very large stake, the opportunity to play for a large prize. Like alcoholism gambling is an illness or disease.  I do not think we in this House should engage in any form of moral strictures with regard to the disease of gambling.  Organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous do their best for such individuals who cannot contain themselves in the context of gambling.  If we, on this side of the House felt the amendment we propose did anything to exacerbate the gambler who cannot contain himself, or if we saw anything in this section which would increase the anxiety of such individuals, then we would not oppose the section or indeed, introduce such an amendment, which is a reasoned one.</P>
    <P>The outlay involved is a penny, which is the second lowest denomination in our currency today.  I do not see much evidence of the halfpenny. Consequently, the penny can be taken as a real basic currency.  It is not a very glamorous coin.  As a matter of fact, aesthetically, it is a hopeless production and becomes more hopeless in its purchasing power under the Government with inflation and so on.  Therefore, why not let us use the penny for these amusement machines? Is that not as good a usage for the <Col N="675" /> penny as any other?  Even the penny lollipop would cost 1½p under this Government.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to distinguish between gambling and amusement.  I am sure the Minister knows of individual families who commute to these amusement arcades.  They are not gambling casinos.  If we thought the really big time gambling casino was being helped by this amendment then certainly we would not have suggested it.  If it is not the wish of the Government to abolish slot machines we ask the Minister to look upon them, in arcades run by decent people, people who have been in the business of amusement arcades for generations, as machines providing amusement.  Such families have engaged in that form of service to the public and are entitled, we believe, to a modest profit in a free enterprise society.  They are reputable people.  We have received memoranda from a number of organisations, not the least of which has been one from the Amusement Caterers' Association of Ireland.  Government Deputies received the memorandum as did we on this side of the House.  That association are entitled to lobby Deputies. If Deputies accept their views, then they are entitled to articulate them on behalf of those people.  Within that Association there are some 100 amusement caterers.  Now that they see people becoming less and less interested in their form of business, with a consequential diminishing return, they see fit to make representation.  If it is the intention of the Minister to put such people out of business altogether, then he should say so.  If it is not his intention so to do, but to see them as amusement caterers rather than real gamblers, then he should accept Deputy Colley's reasoned amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister was giving reasons to the House for his rejection of this amendment, he said the principal objection was that it would be unworkable.  It is a curious thing that whenever a tax collector or a customs and excise officer is collecting money putting <Col N="676" /> trouble on a member of the public is the least of his worries.  It does not matter how much difficulty, trouble, worry or delay he exercises on the long-suffering public, but if he is asked to do work that might put him to some inconvenience he has the Minister for Finance to stand up in his defence and tell the House the proposal is unworkable.  It is a ridiculous proposition and is a lame excuse for rejecting this amendment which could be made to work.</P>
      <P>Where people run amusement arcades in seaside resorts and in holiday camps, in their application a distinction could be made between machines used for gambling and for amusement purposes.  If this section goes through, the owner or operator of the amusement and/or gambling premises will have to pay a substantial amount.  He will have to pay £50 a year to operate a machine used for amusement only.  It would be quite easy to work out a system whereby a certain number of machines in the licensed premises could be designated as amusement rather than gaming machines and these could be open for examination by the customs and excise at any time.  In other words, the applicant could state that a certain number of the machines were for amusement purposes and that the balance were gaming machines within the meaning of the Act.  If at any time the customs and excise inspector discovered the person contravened the terms of the licence, he could be open to the fines that are laid down in this Bill and in existing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not appear a valid point against the merits or otherwise of this amendment to say it is unworkable because of difficulty in operation on the part of the Revenue Commissioners. We hear this kind of remark too often but there is little mention about the difficulties of the citizen when he is put upon by the customs and excise officer or the tax collector.  As it will cost the owner or operator an enormous amount to operate any kind of machine, consideration should be given to the suggestions made from this side of the House that a distinction can and <Col N="677" /> should be made between the two types of machines.</P>
    <P>I am not saying or implying that amusement machines should be completely exempt from duty.  I am suggesting, if this distinction is made, that the duty payable in respect of amusement machines should not be more than 25 per cent of the duty payable in respect of gaming machines.  It would be easy to operate a quota system and, in view of the fact that the premises would be liable to inspection at any time, contravention of such a quota system would be easily detected.  It would be so easily detected that it would not represent a reasonable gamble on the part of the owner or operator of the amusement arcade.</P>
    <P>We are not suggesting that there should be separate premises set aside for the machines.  If we did so, it might create some difficulties.  I am not an expert on these matters but I am told the machines are in the one premises, as described in the Bill and in the existing Act.  Therefore, all that would be required is that a distinction be made for the purpose of this amendment and that the penalties would be such as to render it silly and stupid on the part of the operator or the owner to try to contravene the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The weight of representations made in relation to these sections of the Bill did not seek a total exemption of any one-armed bandits. Rather did they seek to exclude from the provisions of the Bill machines that were not primarily gaming machines.  We have met certain representations by amendment No.23 in respect of broken or out-of-use machines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be possible but most undesirable to allow any exemption for any one-armed bandits.  The picture of a nice family whiling away an occasional five minutes at weekends working those machines is not the full picture.  It is not uncommon to see people playing two, three or even more machines at the one time, moving up and down the row and putting in pennies as fast as their feet and their <Col N="678" /> hands allow them.  The idea of a family staking 5p and getting 4p return is not the normal picture.</P>
    <P>The truth is that we are not concerned with any puritanical principle in our approach to this Bill.  We are concerned with taxing less essential needs in order to transfer the proceeds to pressing economic and social needs.  I do not think it is wrong that an activity of this kind should be asked to contribute a small share of the profits made on such machines to essential social and economic purposes. There is no question here of stamping out the playing of gaming machines in amusement arcades for small stakes.  The question of whether that is a lawful pursuit is a matter for the Minister for Justice, for dealing with under the Gaming and Lotteries Act, and if there is any question of either stopping that activity altogether or of increasing the stakes, then it is a matter that falls for consideration by the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>We are concerned in the Finance Bill with imposing taxes on different consumptions, different activities, and when we were looking at a range of activities which are less than essential this was one which very properly came up for consideration.  In effect, what we are taxing is the profit made by the proprietors of the machines or by the people on whose premises the machines are operated.  It is taking, through the imposition of a duty per machine, a share of the profits.  Rather than leaving to uncertain collection by means of income tax a proportion of the profits we are applying here a law which is in general operation in other countries where it is considered insufficient to tax merely amusement halls and fun fairs and where it is considered proper that machines themselves should have a specific tax attached to them.  It is desirable that the State should know the number of gaming machines in operation.  It is desirable that the State should have a record of the locations of those machines and should be able to police them.  Mere licensing of premises does not give an adequate account of the number of machines in use.  If the machines themselves have to be <Col N="679" /> licensed, then a proper record can be kept of the number and location of machines.</P>
    <P>To exclude any one-armed bandits from the ambit of the Bill could lead to a situation in which all one-armed bandits would be operated with a stake of 1 penny and they could become very sophisticated machines operating with very great rapidity so if there is to be a measure of public protection as an objective it seems to me that that objective cannot be met at all unless all one-armed bandits are brought within the scope of the duty.</P>
    <P>We received the representations of the Amusement Caterers for whom I have the highest regard knowing many of them for many years personally.  I think we have met their objections substantially by originally excluding those machines on which there is a considerable element of skill or what I might call honest enjoyment on the part of the operator rather than satisfaction of the gambling instinct and we have a further amendment which would not charge to duty machines which are out of order, provided steps are taken to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have shown that the purpose of the legislation is to impose a very small tax on profits earned from machines which are operated as a pastime for non-essential purposes in order that the revenue obtained from such activity can be used to meet pressing economic and social needs.  There would be a serious erosion of that objective if the amendment were to be accepted and I would consider that to be wrong.</P>

      <P>It has been indicated from this side that there is an imbalance here in so far as the Minister proposes to tax all gaming machines at the same rate.  It struck me when Deputy S. Flanagan was speaking that it was rather significant that the Minister is proposing to amend the Finance Act, 1956 and increase the excise duty on all those machines by 150 that we are opposed to increasing this per cent.  Nowhere have we indicated excise duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> We consider the increase in tax to be about twice what it should be.  In relation to what we have been endeavouring to define as a gaming machine, the tax should not be as heavy as is proposed and in relation to the smaller type machine referred to in the amendment, we are claiming that there should be no tax.  In his original reply the Minister told us of the difficulty of stewarding the operation and we have heard also of the difficulty on the part of the Revenue Commissioners but it is extraordinary that in the next amendment there is being created a problem for the Revenue Commissioners at the instigation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to show the significance of a situation in which we, after two years of Coalition Government, are scraping the bottom of the barrel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the greatest respect for the late Deputy Sweetman. I am merely emphasising the extraordinary coincidence in the situation then and now.  Again, we are on a downward trend but we are endeavouring to tax the unfortunate seaside holiday makers.  It is a pity that Deputy Kelly was not here to hear <Col N="682" /> Deputy Andrews on the manner in which his constituents and those in the Dublin area generally go out to Deputy Murphy's constituency and get much pleasure from playing those machines.  If they are lucky, they can win five pence for a penny outlay. I am glad to see that Deputy Timmins is here, too.  There is no harm in calling for a quorum now and then because it appears that there is much going on among the front bench of the Coalition while, unfortunately, no effort is made to bring in the back-benchers.</P>

      <P>It might have been different if the Minister had talked in terms of trying to create varying charges on gaming licences dependent on the robbery element of the one-armed bandits but a fee of £50 is to be asked for in respect of every machine.  Undoubtedly, some of the big operators at the major seaside resorts as well as in Dublin will benefit from this measure because the smaller operator will be put out of business.  From time to time, in the company of my family, I have played those machines and have got much pleasure from so doing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We shall leave Deputy Belton to deal with the larger machines of which he has his own type. There are machines from which it is possible to derive a fair amount of amusement for a 10p or a 20p outlay but if I were an amusement caterer I do not think I would pay £50 simply to licence a machine having regard to the cost of its maintenance and to the overall profit from it.  That is why we consider this amendment to be justified. The greatest defence the Minister has is that he wants money, that the requirements of the country are such <Col N="683" /> that operations of the type in question must be squeezed to the last penny. A small caterer who spends money in procuring a machine which will now be classed as a gaming machine would need to get a tremendous return from it in order to afford a £50 licence.  If a man wishes to buy ten machines, it would be for him to extract the maximum amount possible from the gambler.  If this measure goes through the day of the penny machines will be gone and in their place will be tenpenny or, at least five-penny, ones.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment and, thereby, to let us have some little amusement at seaside resorts and not have the extractors extracting on behalf of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>You were not here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but the Ceann Comhairle was when the Minister replied initially to Deputy Lalor in regard to this amendment.  I leave it to you as a neutral observer to judge who has the better case. When the Minister spoke first on the amendment he gave certain objections to which I shall refer in a moment. Now he emerges as a hypocrite because he has begun to moralise about the social policy of his Government and to tell us that to accept an amendment like this would represent an attack on or the erosion of the social objective of the Government.</P>
      <P>All he has succeeded in doing is letting the cat out of the bag because we know now that he did not mean what he said initially.  This was that acceptance of the amendment would create administrative difficulties.  He does not say anything like that now. Rather, he says that the amendment's acceptance would erode the determination of the Government to achieve their social objective.  I never heard such piffle in my life.  It is obvious that what the Minister said the second time is right.  What he said the first time is demonstrably wrong because it is demonstrated out of his own mouth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did he not say: &ldquo;We do not care whether they are amusement machines or gambling machines.  We <Col N="684" /> are determined to extract every possible ½p of revenue out of their operation. We do not care whether they are used by children for amusement purposes or by others for gambling purposes.  We do not care whether the people who go in there have 3p or 4p to spend on amusement or whether they are people who are prepared to spend a lot of money on the operation of these so-called one-armed bandits.&rdquo; I agree with what the Minister said about the amount of revenue which can accrue if one of these one-armed bandits is placed in a golf club or in other clubs throughout the country. I have seen the figures and I accept the proposition that where a large number of people are using them a substantial profit accrues.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lalor said, we do not object to increasing the levy on their use.  The Minister might have said in the first instance that he was not prepared to listen to us and that he did not care whether the machine was a 1p machine for the amusement of toddlers on a rainy day at a holiday camp or a seaside resort, that he would extract the maximum amount of revenue, and that he would treat them as being exactly the same as the one-armed bandit gambling machine.</P>
    <P>I still submit that what I said earlier was correct.  Unless he is even more &ldquo;broke&rdquo; than we know him to be, and he professes himself to be, he should find it possible to work out a scheme which would exempt these machines from all but minimal excise duty.  There is no practical reason why such a scheme could not be operated. If what he said last is a fact, that he will use his Parliamentary majority to put these machines on the same footing for duty purposes as the one-armed bandits, we must submit to that because we have no other choice but to do so.  The Minister wants to tax the most innocent amusement for toddlers in the same way as he is taxing real gambling and gaming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time Members of the Opposition came down to reality.  The maximum stake permitted under the law in a gaming machine <Col N="685" /> is 2½p.  It is not 5p, or 10p, or any of the other figures mentioned by the Opposition.  The proposal here is that we should exclude all 1p machines. The suggestion is that there are just a small minority of machines played only by toddlers.  I have already said that the legislation as such as will not impose any duty upon an instrument of sport or a machine which passes away the time.  A duty is being imposed&mdash;and most properly imposed&mdash; on all machines where there is that element of gaming.  In reply to what Deputy Flanagan has just said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the law.  The law may be breached and maybe that is the reason why some people do not want the additional supervision which will necessarily be involved when revenue is being collected.  That is the legal position under the Gaming and Lotteries Act.  If there are machines which are using larger stakes they are against the law.  All the machines will not carry an annual charge of £50. There is a special rate for machines which are played only on Sundays and on public holidays catering for the harmless little family trips to the seaside which have been discussed here with such great emotion tonight. If a machine is not used for a period longer than three months in the year the duty will be £12.50.  If it exceeds three months but not six months it becomes £5.  If it exceeds six months but not nine months it will be £27.50 and if it exceeds nine months it will be £50 per machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To return to Deputy Flanagan's angry words, when one is dealing with the Committee Stage of a Bill one does not rise on every section or <Col N="686" /> amendment thereto to explain the philosophy behind the general proposals of the Bill.  There is an explanation in my budget statement where, having dealt with the gaming proposals, I said:</P>
    <P>The imposition of new taxation can normally evoke colourful epithets and violent hyperbole from the unthinking or the selfish.</P>
    <P>Naturally, I exclude present company. I went on:</P>
    <P>I suppose this budget will receive similar response from the same quarters.  It would be well, therefore, to reflect that the new taxation in this budget is designed to transfer funds from the satisfaction of less essential tastes to the education of the young, to maintain and create productive employment in industry and agriculture, to the maintenance of the living standards of the needy, to the provision of essential health services for the sick and housing for the homeless and to the host of other services regarded in any decent society as demanding priority treatment.</P>

      <P>The Minister in his interventions has used the expression on a number of occasions &ldquo;one armed bandits&rdquo;.  This clearly indicates the Minister's own undoubted prejudice.  Deputy Lalor put the matter in perspective and so did Deputy Seán Flanagan when he charged the Minister with hypocrisy.  We are suggesting <Col N="688" /> that the Minister's <i>raison d'etre</i> for the proposed increases here is the transfer of the moneys collected to the social and economic needs of the country and that clearly indicates the bankrupt condition of the country's coffers. The Minister in invidious fashion says that by comparison with other countries we are being let off lightly.  It is about time we stood on our own two feet and did our own thing in our own fashion and ceased comparing what goes on here with what happens in other countries and trying, by comparison, to justify in some way what we have done, are doing or propose to do.  The Minister can be flippant and superficial.  He can get his cheap laugh with his rather literary and historical debating society points about the less well off who attend these seaside resorts and visit these amusement arcades for the purpose of being amused and not for the purpose of gambling.  He should keep in mind the fact that those who run these arcades&mdash;he described a number of them as friends of his own&mdash;are decent people who have been in the amusement catering business for a number of generations.  The Minister now proposes to inflict all sorts of penal taxes on them with the aid of his majority here.</P>
      <P>The Minister has dealt in a very off-hand fashion with the very reasonable contributions made by Deputy Lalor.  On the previous section Deputy Lalor actually got the Minister to admit there was a drafting error. Later the Minister was ungracious enough to suggest that, because of our continued opposition to the section, he would withdraw his earlier concession.  This is a most reprehensible way to deal with the House and the Opposition. Deputy Lalor and Deputy C. Murphy and others took three-quarters of an hour to obtain the particular concession on the previous section and now the Minister threatens us with the withdrawal of the concession. If the Minister goes on behaving in this fashion, we will have no option but to continue expressing our point of view until we succeed in getting the Minister to see reason.</P>

      <P>During one of the Minister's replies he made a couple of points on which I would like to take issue with him.  This side of the House differentiated between different types of gaming machines. The Minister bundled all such machines under the term &ldquo;one-armed bandit&rdquo;.  I tried to be objective in putting both cases on the record and I regret the Minister did not do so.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that it is necessary for the State to have a record of the number of gaming machines in the country.  I agree with that, but I suggest that it is possible by means of a different system of licences to acquire this information and have a licence issued in respect of X number of machines per premises.  The Minister anticipates that this taxation will yield £100,000.  He went on to quote what are laudable aims, as expressed in his budget speech.  A sum of £100,000 would not be sufficient to give every person registered as unemployed £1 a week.</P>

      <P>I am.  I am stating the case as I stated earlier, hoping that the Minister might be more objective in his next response.  He drew up a picture of a person proceeding on a row of those machines, pushing in pennies and pulling levers as quickly as possible.  He said that a number of pennies could be spent in great rapidity.  It is a pity he did not refer to the amendment in the name of Deputy Colley, which states that the maximum return would be 5p.  I regret the Minister does not wish to differentiate between the different types of slot machines.  This side of the House are not a lobby for one-armed bandits, as he implied or as the Parliamentary Secretary perhaps meant to imply on his hit and run attempt.  We presented a reasonable case.  The amendment refers to machines which would have 1p stake and would yield the maximum prize of 5p.  Such machines ought not to be classified with the bad machines, as I described them, of the one-armed bandits which have a multiple jackpot system.  For a stake a jackpot can be won and this jackpot can be gambled continuously by a player if he is successful at various odds.  This is gambling in depth; it is bad.  Surely the Minister realises the huge difference between the machine referred to in the amendment and the machine which is emotionally called the one-armed bandit.  I do not think it would take a lot of revenue away; £100,000 would not go very far in these sad economic days.</P>

      <P>I said I do not have very strong feelings about this amendment and it is a big pity that when the Minister was replying the last time he did not stop when he reached the stage where he had pointed out that the maximum legal bet was 2½p and that what he was doing was refusing to exclude 1p.  He went on in his typical fashion to make a gratuitous attack on me.  He broadened the debate entirely into the realm of philosophy about which he knows nothing and proceeded to philosophise by quoting from his budget speech.  It was the Minister <Col N="693" /> who took this line of action and not the Members on this side.</P>
      <P>I resent the fact that the Minister should use a miserable little speech like this to make a gratuitous personal attack on me.  Of course it is typical of the Minister; he has been doing that all his life.  He did it when he was in Opposition and even in university.  The Minister deserves any treatment he gets from this House for that repeated bad mannered behaviour which was so accurately described by Deputy Andrews as ungracious.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 22, subsection (2), lines 21 to 23, to delete paragraph (c) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  A gaming machine shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to be available for play unless&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied and so certify in writing, that by reason of&mdash;</P>
      <P> (I)  the inaccessibility to the public of the place in which it is stored, or</P>
      <P>(II)  the state in which it is, it cannot be played by the public, and </P>
      <P>(ii)  it remains stored in the place aforesaid or remains in the state aforesaid.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment proposes to delete paragraph (c) of subsection (2) and amendment 24 proposes to do the same.  However, my amendment will substitute a paragraph which describes in what circumstances a gaming machine shall be deemed to be available for play.  A gaming machine shall be deemed to be available for play unless the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied and so certify in writing that by reason of the inaccessibility to the public of the place in which it is stored or the state in which it is it cannot be played by the public and it remains stored in the place or in the state mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 achieves what Deputy Colley hoped to achieve by way of amendment No. 24.  My amendment will ensure that where a gaming machine is broken or where it <Col N="695" /> is surplus to a proprietor's requirement or where a proprietor is not using it during an off-peak season he will not be liable to duty.  This appears to be the fair thing to do, and we are satisfied that the amendment will give the Revenue Commissioners what they must have in enforcing the law, the weapon to ensure that if an exemption is being granted it is not abused.  The particular wording of the amendment will ensure that the Revenue Commissioners' requirements must be met, that is to say that a machine which a proprietor claims to be out of use will, in fact, be out of use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Revenue Commissioners be at every centre where there are machines to certify in writing immediately the machine is out of order?  At what stage will the Revenue Commissioners certify in writing that the machine is not available for play?  Will the Revenue Commissioners be available at all times beside these machines in the centres or will they inspect them periodically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have similar laws to enforce in respect of licensed premises where alcohol is stored.  They visit premises where excise duties are payable from time to time to satisfy themselves that the law is being enforced.  It is therefore necessary to ensure that there are ways of enforcing the law.  If a proprietor has premises to which the public have not got access and in which out-of-use machines are stored then the necessary certificate will be furnished.  Steps can also be taken to put seals on machines to ensure that they will not be played unless and until a duty is paid on them.  These are reasonable steps, and I understand that the amusement caterers accept them as being reasonable.  They welcome them as providing relief for the kind of circumstance which they describe as occurring from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that a machine cannot be certified for a considerable period?  Does it mean <Col N="696" /> that the offence is committed only after the machine is certified?  Does it mean that in the period between the person can be prosecuted?  This whole matter is vague.  As in the case of licensed premises, it means that the Revenue Commissioners will have to visit these centres at frequent intervals. The Minister indicated earlier that the income would amount to approximately £100,000.  Could the Minister indicate now what would be the additional cost of having Revenue Commissioners visit various premises in order to certify from time to time that machines are in an inaccessible place, properly stored or cannot be played by the public?  What would be the cost involved, travelling expenses and so on, and by how much would it reduce the figure of £100,000?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The costs will be minimal because there are only 67 licences for the whole country.  An inspector in any area would have responsibility for his particular area, together with what other responsibilities he may have.  The reality of the situation will be this.  A licence holder will have a licence which covers <i>x</i> number of machines.  If a number of those machines becomes unplayable, the proprietor will be able to replace the broken machines which are kept on premises inaccessible to the public with playable ones.  If, during an off-season period of the year, he wishes to avail of his right to pay a lesser duty for that portion of the year only for which the machines are used, he can remove machines from public access and put them on that part of the premises which is inaccessible to the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>At Question Time today I asked the Minister for Education the following question:</P>
      <P>The number of untrained teachers at present teaching in national schools who have received notice of termination of services from his Department from 30th June next; why this notice was issued at this time; and if he will consider their appeal for a further crash training course to enable many of them to qualify as trained teachers.</P>
      <P>The Minister's reply was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In March of this year notice issued from my Department to 238 unqualified persons who are serving temporarily as teachers in national schools that their employment would be terminated not later than 30th June, 1975 since the number of qualified newly-trained teachers who will be available as from 1st June, 1975, will be sufficient to allow of all teaching posts in national schools <Col N="701" /> being filled by qualified teachers.  It should be understood that each person concerned, being unqualified, was recognised temporarily only until such time as the school manager succeeded in obtaining the services of a qualified teacher and that the circumstances of their being so recognised conferred no right to continued recognition or to future recognition as teacher.</P>
    <P>Special summer courses of training have been provided for some years past for qualified untrained teachers, but persons who were not already qualified as untrained teachers were not accepted on these courses. which have now come to an end.  There could be no question of instituting a special course to enable persons not already qualified as national teachers to obtain trained status.  Such persons, however, would be eligible to enter as mature students for the annual competition for admission to the normal course of training as national teacher, provided they satisfied the requirements as to age and standard of education.</P>
    <P>This sudden withdrawal of recognition was a very harsh decision, especially as many of the people concerned have given long years of devoted service. Quite a considerable number were never in any other employment and they do not know where to turn when their employment is terminated.  Many have proved to have exceptional ability as teachers and this has been recognised by the parents and the teaching staff.  It was only the lack of academic qualifications that prevented such people from becoming trained teachers.  The Minister has said that persons would be eligible to enter as mature students for the annual competition for admission to the training course provided they could satisfy the necessary requirements as to age and standard of education but this is little consolation when many of the people concerned have not the necessary qualifications.</P>
    <P>The lack of necessary qualifications in no way diminishes the ability of these people to teach and the fact that they have spent so many years teaching shows their love for their <Col N="702" /> profession and for the children in their care.  It also shows their dedication to their jobs.  Unfortunately most of these people are not organised.  If they were the Minister would not take the action he now proposes.  Does he think any other group of workers would react to this kind of summary dismissal without protest, or even violent protest?  It is only because the Minister is dealing with unfortunate individuals without any union support that he thinks he can take this action.</P>
    <P>By adopting this course of action the Minister is ensuring that there will not be any improvement in the pupil/teacher ratio next year&mdash;in fact, there will be a severe deterioration in the ratio after June.  He has told us that he proposes to fill the vacancies with the appointment of teachers who come out of training this year.  What he should do with this sizeable group is to fill the normal vacancies with some of the teachers and use the remainder to achieve a much-needed reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>In reply to parliamentary questions in this House, the Minister admitted that there are many classes with more than 50 pupils.  This is disgraceful. It was to create a new situation where there would be much smaller classes that the Government of which I was a member and the former Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner, ensured that more teachers were trained than were needed for normal replacements.  Until this year they were used to reduce the high pupil/ teacher ratio but the present Minister apparently will discontinue that practice. To aggravate the situation, there will be no new teachers coming out of training next year because of the three-year course.  What is the Minister going to do?  It is most unlikely that teachers over 65 will return when they have been kicked out this year.</P>
    <P>The number of teachers in training in the coming years will be much smaller than this year.  This is deliberate policy on the part of the Government. They want totally to reverse the Fianna Fáil policy of reducing the pupil/teacher ratio and this is one of the reasons I raised the matter on the <Col N="703" /> Adjournment.  The Minister for Education has been gloating and boasting about his achievements in the last two years and has told us that he achieved a reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio. He did this because of the legacy left to him by the former Minister for Education, Deputy Faulkner.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have used the 1,100 new teachers this year in a positive attempt to reduce the numbers in classes.  Instead, he has thrown the 238 untrained teachers to the wolves. Even though they have given loyal service, some of them for as long as 25 years, they are now being thrown on the scrap-heap.  The pupils of these people, and the pupils' parents have been so pleased with them that they have resisted many efforts by managers and the Department of Education to remove them.  Those people served education when they were greatly needed and now the Minister for Education is, as from 30th June, throwing them on the scrap-heap.  It is disgraceful.  My purpose in raising this on the Adjournment was to give myself an opportunity of again appealing to the Minister to find a formula for introducing a crash course.  There are two other Deputies anxious to contribute so I would like to give way to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to say that I agree totally with the policy of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation of having only trained teachers serving in the national schools of the country.  I would like to thank the previous Minister for Education for introducing the crash training courses a few years ago for the many untrained teachers throughout the country to enable them to get their qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 238 teachers that the Minister for Education talked about today are untrained teachers who could not avail of those crash courses because in many cases of the age limit imposed. Those teachers are people with long service, a service which has proved efficient and satisfactory to the children's parents, to the managers of the national schools and to the Departmental <Col N="704" /> inspectors.  It can be argued that those teachers are doing the same job as trained teachers.  It has now become a way of life with them, and quite naturally they are distressed at present lest their services should be shelved.</P>
    <P>Let me ask the Minister where do those 238 teachers go now?  They are not like workers in industry who can be retrained.  I wonder if they would qualify for pay-related benefits or redundancy payments.  Do they even qualify for unemployment assistance? One of the conditions to qualify for unemployment assistance is that a person must be available for work, but if the Minister is taking away their only form of work how can those teachers be available for work?  Have the Minister or his Departmental officials studied this matter and, if so, what can they offer to those teachers now that they are faced with the problem of unemployment and do not qualify for any pension after their many years of devoted service to the Irish community?  Is it fair that all of the other untrained teachers had a chance to avail of the crash training courses but that those 238 teachers are being discriminated against?  Let me remind the Minister that the vast majority of those untrained teachers are women and one might ask, with some justification, if it may be for that reason that they are being discriminated against now.</P>
    <P>The Minister said here this afternoon that the reason for his decision was that he had to make room for the 1,100 new teachers coming out of training colleges this summer.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the reason for the increase in the intake of students to those colleges in the last two years was the appalling pupil/ teacher ratio in all our national schools. As a national school teacher myself, I know only too well the problems of teachers when they are faced with large overcrowded classes.  We welcomed the proposal of the previous Minister for Education, Deputy Pádraig Faulkner, to increase the intake of student teachers to ease this overcrowding. Naturally all teachers would welcome any proposal that would alleviate the <Col N="705" /> pressure on pupils.  One way of alleviating this enormous pressure is by reducing class sizes.  How can the Minister say he will reduce the pupil-teacher ratio if he takes away 238 teachers at present employed in our schools?  He is giving lip service to this proposal.  Does the Minister allow for the huge intake of 4-year old pupils in schools next July and the freedom that pupils must have now since the new curriculum was introduced?  How can the Minister reconcile this freedom with the ridiculous pupil-teacher ratio prevailing at the moment?  Teachers at present find they cannot possibly give this freedom of experiment to their pupils when they are faced with huge classes.</P>
    <P>This announcement by the Minister has come at a most inopportune time, a time when teachers were feeling that at last they had a chance of getting the pupil-teacher ratio into proportion, with the extra amount of new teachers available in July.  If the Minister now takes 238 teachers out of service, not to mention the number of teachers on extension who must go as well, the number of teachers available in July will be reduced from 1,100 to 862 teachers.</P>
    <P>In view of those special circumstances would the Minister not reconsider his decision to terminate the employment of those untrained teachers, and would he not be prepared instead to offer them a further crash training course to enable many or all of them to qualify as trained teachers?</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an Teachta Pádraig Ó Leathlobhair sa mhéid atá ráite aige faoin gceist seo agus impim ar an Aire ath-breithníu a dhéanamh ar an scéal.</P>

      <P>I speak here tonight as a Member of this House and as a member of the INTO, and while we are all agreed that it is an excellent idea that we should have enough trained teachers to go around I think we should apply ourselves in a realistic way to this situation.  Our party has pursued this policy and the solution, of course, is that we should stop the entry of further untrained teachers into the teaching ranks&mdash;that will eventually solve the problem&mdash;but I <Col N="706" /> do not agree at all that the Minister should adopt the tactics he is adopting with regard to those untrained teachers who are still in employment.  The solution for those is that we should provide training for them.</P>
      <P>We have many wonderful, dedicated people.  They are untrained people but dedicated for all that, and the many years they have spent in teaching prove their dedication because it surely was not financial considerations that brought them there.  It is wrong of anyone to suggest that they should be thrown out now and discarded. The Minister should realise that one of the subjects that is dynamite in the educational world at present is the pupil-teacher ratio.  It was indeed unfortunate that he did not find it convenient on this occasion to be present at the INTO Congress in Tramore where this was a great bone of contention. If the Minister had attended that congress he would realise that in the two years since he has become Minister the adulation he got at the Wexford Congress when he first appeared on the scene has diminished, that his TAM rating has now diminished very much indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that on that occasion he was in a position to bask in the reflected glory of the solid, sterling work of his predecessor.  He should remember that all over the country parents are worried.  I attended a meeting only this week where people were worried that 56 of their children in the infant class should be herded into one room and given to the care of the teacher and 52 in another class in the same school. The Minister is there creating the need for the remedial teachers he will have later on.  This action of the Minister will aggravate this situation.  He is giving no extension after 65.  He is not allowing English teachers in.  He is throwing out 238 teachers who are now prepared to teach and by doing that he is creating a problem that will take a long time to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To be personal for a moment, I would ask him to reflect on my own position.  I am here and I may be <Col N="707" /> gone tomorrow for all we know.  I had to put a substitute in my place.  I was lucky enough to get a trained teacher for three years.  I gave him what financial considerations I could but he was denied pension right and incremental right and that is a position that could not last indefinitely. Thank God he was made a permanent teacher in the school.  How am I to get a trained teacher?  What trained teacher will come and act as a substitute for me and what incentive does the Minister propose to give?  I have, at the moment, an excellent untrained teacher, a woman whom the pupils and the parents love.  She is a Gaelgeoir ar fheabhas.  I believe it would be a terrible thing if because of a ruling by the Minister I have to tell her: &ldquo;After the last day of June you go and if we want you again we will look for you.  If we can get a trained teacher well and good.  The Minister says there is a sufficient number to go around.  I doubt that, but I hope you will wait on the sideline until we see whether we really need you.&rdquo;  This is a callous action by the Minister We need all the help we can get in our national schools.  Apart from that, there is no point in adding a further 230 people to the thousands already unemployed.  What does the Minister think will happen to those people? Will they be sent to AnCO for training in some other field?  All he need do is establish one further training crash course for them.  This is the solution that should be adopted. Let the Minister put his pride in his pocket and allow people who have proved their dedication to continue teaching.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a crash course has no relevance to a solution of the situation arising on 1st July next.  The action to be taken at that date is related to finding employment for the new teachers from the training colleges.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn spoke of crash courses which were provided up to now.  She is mistaken if she thinks that these were provided for the type of teacher numbered in our 238 of today.  These <Col N="708" /> crash courses were provided for permanent, qualified, if untrained teachers.  There is no valid basis for a crash course for unqualified persons whose services were accepted exceptionally and for limited periods of time.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to follow some of the Deputies in the rather emotive language they used, in their boasting and gloating and talking of casting on the scrap-heap and so on.  As for Deputy Power, perhaps he, as a member of that organisation of teachers, will be glad to know that I have had a message from them recently expressing their gratitude for the fact that for the first time ever they have achieved the position of degrees, having waited more than 100 years for certification as university graduates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was the announcement in Wexford of that change which led to the adulation the Deputy speaks of.  What is in question here is not the recognition of untrained teachers but the granting of full recognition to persons who never qualified in any capacity as national teachers but who have been recognised to be exceptionally and temporarily in posts for which managers failed to get qualified teachers.  The persons concerned were never left in any doubt as to the temporary nature of their appointments.  I should have thought that a number of the speakers opposite who were in the profession would have made reference to that. In all instances the appointments were approved until such time as the school manager succeeded in getting a qualified teacher for the post.  The manager was requested at regular intervals, and always towards the end of each school year, to renew his efforts to get a qualified teacher, and when he reported failure in that regard the recognition of the unqualified teacher was renewed specifically on a temporary basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has been reached this year when the number of newly-trained teachers who will be available at July 1st will be such that qualified <Col N="709" /> teachers will be available for all teaching posts in national schools.  There can be no good reason, therefore, for retaining unqualified teachers.  To do so we would be denying job opportunities to those young people who will have completed their training course this year.</P>
    <P>There are two aspects to the question which I, as the Minister responsible, cannot ignore.  First, it is wrong, when qualified teaching personnel are available, that persons not qualified should be employed as teachers in our schools. Secondly, there is at least an implied commitment on the part of the State to afford reasonable opportunities of employment to persons selected for training on the basis of State examinations.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the unqualified teachers concerned be given an opportunity of qualifying by means of brief crash training courses.  To put it bluntly, this is a suggestion that the standard of qualification for the teaching profession be diluted.  In 1958 it was decided that the recruitment of untrained national teachers, known as junior assistant mistresses, be discontinued. In 1966 it was decided to organise special crash courses to give trained status to qualified untrained teachers who, at that time, were not more than 56 years of age.  These crash courses have been discontinued.  The final group of former untrained teachers will have completed their training in July next.  It must be emphasised that no person who had not qualified as an untrained teacher was accepted on these courses, the objective of which was to establish that the primary teaching profession would consist entirely of trained teachers. There can be no question of giving special facilities to unqualified persons to attain the status of trained teachers.</P>
    <P>We heard from some Deputies opposite about reducing the teacher/ pupil ratio.  While this question has not much relevance to this debate, I would remind the House that there was no improvement in this regard between July, 1969 and July, 1973.  Some improvement was effected in 1973 and again in 1974. <Col N="710" /> Perhaps I might explain in more detail why it has become necessary to discontinue accepting the services of unqualified teachers The number of trainee teachers accepted into our training colleges in 1973&mdash;the last group whose training period is only two years&mdash;was far higher than ever before.  On July 1 this year there will will be 1,100 newly-trained teachers available.  With a normal annual figure of 640 posts arising as a result of retirements, wastage and increases in enrolments, the prospect existed of some 460 of these young people being without opportunities of employment in the profession for which they had been prepared unless special steps were taken to avoid this.  It is easy to see that the problem could be solved by reducing the pupil/teacher ratio and appointing additional special teachers for remedial and other work.  Nobody recognises more than I the desirability of such improvements in our education system at primary level and no one is more conscious or anxious to achieve such improvements.  However, one must be realistic and must acknowledge cold economic facts in an era when an economic crisis is threatening all countries.  In present circumstances it is not possible to reduce further this year the pupil/teacher ratio in primary schools or to create additional teaching posts for remedial or other special work.  As I have said, since becoming Minister I have improved the pupil/ teacher ratio on two occasions and on each occasion I have added to the number of appointments of remedial teachers.  If, this year, we must forego improvements in this direction, it is not because of any lack of will on my part but because of grave financial considerations and because of the heavy demands from other parts of the education system which make this inevitable.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputies opposite.  How, then, do we ensure that newly-trained teachers will have opportunities of employment from the commencement of the coming school year?  There will be the 640 vacancies I have mentioned and in <Col N="711" /> addition there will be the 240 posts filled at present by unqualified persons because of the unavailability up to now of qualified and trained teachers. Also, there will be the posts which, in former years, would be filled by people who had reached retirement age and who, as a concession, have been allowed to continue in the service for one, two or three years.  I regret that the measures which have had to be taken will give rise to disappointment <Col N="712" /> in many instances and even to a degree of hardship in some cases, but the choice for me was clear.  For the reasons which I have given I considered it my duty to take such appropriate action as would allow the newly trained teachers from the colleges of education to take up the employment for which they had been qualified over a previous number of years.</P>
