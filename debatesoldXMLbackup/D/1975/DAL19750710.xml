      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan)</i>: I wish to inform the House that I am standing in for the Minister for Finance who is in the Seanad with another Bill. Perhaps Deputy Colley would repeat very briefly the point he was making?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We were dealing with the Minister's amendment No. 9 and I indicated last night that while the amendment is in response to points made from this side of the House on the Second Stage and is therefore in principle acceptable given the terms of the Bill, nevertheless, I consider the general lines of the Bill as approached in this section to be unsatisfactory and I am suggesting that the amendment will illustrate some of the problems that arise because of the approach in the Bill; but before I develop the matter, I did draw attention last night to what was in effect a drafting query although it may be of some importance, that is, in the amendment in the second line there is a reference to &ldquo;a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company&rdquo;.  There are further references in the amendment to &ldquo;a body corporate&rdquo; but the other references to &ldquo;a body corporate&rdquo; do not incorporate the phrase &ldquo;which is not a private non-trading company&rdquo;. If that phrase is carried through further on by implication, then the matter is all right but, if it is not, I believe the amendment is not achieving what the Minister wants it to achieve.  Perhaps the Minister might give his view on whether he thinks that qualification to the phrase &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; is in fact carried through the amendment?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Just to deal with that one specific point, in the second case to which the Deputy refers it does not matter whether the body corporate is a trading company or a non-trading company. That is the point in it.  In the first case it sets out that the body concerned must not be a non-trading company but the other companies further down may be trading companies or non-trading companies.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister a question in reference to the second reference?  Perhaps I might read the first few lines:</P>
      <P>This section shall not apply to a private non-trading company of which a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company has control...</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the Deputy would stop there.  A private non-trading company is treated as an entity for the purposes of this Bill.  If that private non-trading company is owned by a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company, in other words, if it is owned by a trading company, it is exempt.  We have a situation then where there may be holding companies intervening between the trading company at the apex and the private non-trading company further down. It does not matter whether these intervening companies are trading companies or non-trading companies.  The liability of the private non-trading companies at the bottom will be determined by the status or qualification of the parent company at the apex.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, there is no problem there at all, but if you go on from there, it says:</P>
      <P>and, for the purposes of this subsection, where a body corporate (in this subsection referred to as the first body corporate) has control of a second body corporate...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we could stop there for a moment. The rest of the amendment is going on really to visualise a change of control in that portion of it.  In other words, where a body corporate (in this subsection referred to as the first body corporate) has control of a second body corporate.  If we take the first reference in that, a body corporate in which the control vests, if that body corporate in which the control vests is a non-trading private <Col N="1286" /> company, does that not defeat the object of the exercise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No. If the parent body corporate is a non-trading company then the private non-trading company controlled by that is an entity and will be taxed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the first body corporate is a private non-trading company and it owns or controls another private non-trading company then both of them are in. This section as drafted was intended to capture close family non-trading companies and to defeat avoidance but as a result of representations and further thinking it was considered that the section as drafted captured private non-trading companies that it was not intended to capture.  In other words, it captured holding companies and sometimes there can be more than one subsidiary company intervening between the parent company and the private non-trading company at the bottom.</P>

      <P>There is no double tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Just on the basis of no double tax.  Let me refer the Minister to the definition in subsection (3) of a company.  The definition says a company means &ldquo;a body corporate, wherever incorporated,&rdquo; and then certain conditions are imposed in (a), (b) and (c).  Can the Minister reconcile that with the amendment?  The amendment, as <Col N="1287" /> far as I can see, seeks to designate what I might call a trading company by reference to it as a body corporate which is not a private non-trading company. I wonder whether the definition of &ldquo;company&rdquo; as set out in subsection (3) conforms with the drafting in the amendment.  The reference to the &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; in the amendment would seem to include, by implication at any rate, the reference to companies in subsection (3).  If you marry the amendment with the definition in subsection (3), I wonder are you getting a conflict between what is sought to be done in subsection (3) which, effectively, is to define what is a private non-trading company, and the effort in the amendment to distinguish from that a body corporate, which is not a private non-trading company?  I wonder whether that is successfully achieved. I am not saying there is a contradiction. One would nearly want to see the amendment inserted to judge it accurately. Is the Minister satisfied that there is no contradiction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is necessary to use the words &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; as distinct from &ldquo;company&rdquo; because corporations or companies have different titles all over the world but I am told that &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; captures all of them.  The words &ldquo;body corporate&rdquo; are wide enough to include a company whether it is a Japanese company or a German company or any other company and to grant them the exemption we want to grant them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred last night to the fact that I was afraid this amendment might be providing a major loophole for escape from liability for wealth tax.  If a trader puts his wealth or a great deal of his wealth into a private non-trading company and then so arranges matters that that private non-trading company is controlled by his trading company is he not thereby, on foot <Col N="1288" /> of this amendment, enabled to escape liability for wealth tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> He would be liable on the shares of his trading company.  If the operation increases the wealth of the trading company and enhances the value of the shares, he will pay on the enhanced value of the shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is liable, and if the Minister is right in saying he is liable on the shares, because the trading company as such is not liable, is it not quite clear that the effect of the wealth tax on a trading company is quite substantial and that it is unrealistic to suggest, as has been suggested by the Minister for Finance and I think the Minister for Lands previously, that because there is no wealth tax levied on a trading company it is not going to affect the operations of a trading company?  Does the very point the Minister has just made not illustrate clearly that the wealth tax will affect quite directly and in some cases seriously the operations of trading companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We argued all this out before when I was handling the earlier sections of the Bill.  I have repeated several times that trading companies as such are not subject to wealth tax.  It is conceded that the value of shares in the hands of individuals are liable to wealth tax assuming that the threshold of £70,000 or £100,000 is reached and they are then liable to wealth tax at the rate of 1 per cent but they are exempt from death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the argument I am making and it is the one I stand over.  I do not think there is any substantial hardship imposed by the Wealth Tax Bill.  This present discussion arose out of Deputy Colley's suggestion that the amendment provided machinery for a massive avoidance of wealth tax by the wealthy individual putting all his wealth into a private non-trading company and then giving control of it to his trading company. I said that if a very wealthy individual <Col N="1289" /> did that his little game would not work because he would artificially, according to the Deputy, inflate the value of the shares in the trading company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy said that he was putting his wealth, which was not properly connected with the trading company, into the private non-trading company and then giving control of that private non-trading company to the trading company in order to avoid wealth tax.  I pointed out that that game would not work because he would be inflating the value of the shares in the trading company and he would have to pay tax on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Of course, what the Deputy says is right but what we are doing here is just putting the private non-trading company and the individual in exactly the same position.  The Deputy told me that he will get the threshold against the shares.  That is so.  He said he will not get the threshold in respect of the non-trading company. That is also true but if he had not gone to the trouble of incorporating a non-trading company and kept the assets in his pocket or in some place else in his possession, he would still get the threshold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that the Bill set out to apply wealth tax to a private non-trading company with no threshold and, therefore, to apply wealth tax to the first £ of assets?  Is it not a fact that the effect of this amendment is to enable persons affected&mdash;it is the people about whom we are talking who have to find the money to pay it&mdash;to so overcome that to the extent at least of getting the benefit of thresholds by <Col N="1290" /> placing control of the private non-trading company in a trading company?</P>
      <P>I am not saying that this amendment should not be made.  This amendment is necessary, given the approach to the whole thing in the Bill and particularly in this section.  I fully agree that that is necessary but I am pointing out that one of the consequences is to give a considerable advantage to persons to whom it was not intended to give any advantage when the Bill was introduced.  I suggest the reason this happens is that the whole approach to this matter produces this kind of morass.  In reality the whole approach in the case of a private non-trading company should be to assess the owners of the shares in those companies on the value of their shares as you do in a trading company and to give them the benefit of the thresholds.  I believe that would have to follow.</P>
      <P>This artificial approach to the private non-trading company produces the kind of morass into which we are getting now with this very necessary amendment, given the approach in the Bill.  The Minister has agreed that the consequence of the amendment is to provide a method whereby people who heretofore, as the Bill was presented, would have been liable for wealth tax with no benefit of a threshold, will now in many cases be able to get the benefit of those thresholds which it was not intended to give them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am saying that consequence arises because of what has to be done to treat the genuine case of a trading company that we have put forward here.  Some very large companies operate non-trading companies and investment companies as subsidiaries and it would be quite wrong to treat them as not being entitled to be assessed on the shares with the benefit of the thresholds.  This amendment is necessary given the approach in the section but, nevertheless, the consequence of the whole approach and of this necessary amendment is, as I have stated, to give an opportunity to persons to whom it was not intended to give any benefit of thresholds.  They <Col N="1291" /> are now by this method being given the benefit of applying thresholds and thereby saving a considerable amount of wealth tax which the Minister did not intend them to save.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I believe the Deputy concedes that private non-trading companies are largely tax avoidance instruments and there is not a lot of sympathy for them.  The object of section 6 is not to ignore private non-trading companies as far as wealth tax is concerned, not to treat them as nonexisting unless in certain circumstances where they happen to be genuine bodies corporate which are held as holding companies for the purposes of traders.  The point made by the Deputy is not a realistic one for a number of reasons.  If the individual mentioned by Deputy Colley puts his money or his wealth into a private non-trading company and then hands it over to a trading company, he is immediately putting it at risk.  It goes into the trading company and if the trading company goes down all his personal wealth goes down with it.  It is unlikely he would do that.</P>
      <P>Secondly, if he were a very wealthy man and put all this wealth into the trading company it could have the very undesired effect of converting the trading company into a non-trading company.  If he put enough wealth into it to create a situation where the balance was in favour of the non-trading element rather than the trading element&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The first point made by the Deputy is very serious and it could not be remedied.  Unless he has such faith in a trading company that he regards it as absolutely secure he would be putting his personal wealth at risk by putting it into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have a note here on non-trading companies which might be of help to the Deputy.  The difficulties associated with private non-trading companies in the tax scheme arise out of their nature.  They are by definition closely held companies controlled by five or fewer persons as defined.  Being so tightly held, their promoters have enormous scope as regards the capital formation of the company and its policies generally, all of which affect the shareholders and the values of their interests. They have considerable potential for manipulation which is rendered easy by the small numbers involved and the fact that the parties are usually related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The private non-trading company which is treated as an entity in the Wealth Tax Bill is, in effect, a private investment company, that is, a company whose business consists mainly in the holding of investments and whose income is derived mainly from dividends, interest and rents.  The number of such companies has grown steadily.  Of the 1,017 in existence in 1967, only 193 were incorporated before 1950.  The number is now estimated to be 2,500.  Of the investment companies in existence in 1967, 91 per cent were set up to acquire the assets of individuals or families.  In such companies the assets, while technically <Col N="1293" /> belonging to the companies, remain under the personal control of the individuals or families who thereby secure the continuity of succession and the protection which incorporation gives.  At the same time, the structure and policies of the company can be determined to achieve the best taxation results.  In this latter aim, they have presented extreme difficulties for other taxes.  It is significant that income tax which has been in existence for many years has not finally solved its problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> these companies.</P>
    <P>In the estate duty field, the experience of the British was that they found it necessary to amend their major legislation enacted in 1940 no less than eight times before 1968.  In this country we have found it necessary to make major changes in our private company legislation relating to estate duty which was enacted as recently as 1965.  There can be little doubt, therefore, that the private investment company will be developed as a vehicle for mitigation or avoidance of wealth tax also.  This would have two effects.  It would make the administration of the tax more difficult and increase administrative costs. Both results would not be justified in view of the low effective rates of the tax.  They would also be unfair to other taxpayers who ultimately would have to meet those costs.  It would well nigh cripple the administration at its weakest stage, precisely when the tax is trying to get off the ground. The inevitable result would be that discretionary trusts would be developed in a similar basis because any departure from the entity principle for private non-trading companies would give rise to an irresistible call for its extension to those trusts.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the treatment of private non-trading companies has the merit of extreme simplicity for both the Revenue and the taxpayer.  It is fair all round in that it kills avoidance. Furthermore, it does not affect the very wealthy as they are liable at 1 per cent, whether or not they place their property in an investment company, and it is open to the parties to liquidate the company and have it reconstituted <Col N="1294" /> if necessary in the light of the changed circumstances.  We are aware that many such companies have, in fact, been liquidated.  The company is not the only vehicle for holding property.  At that point let me say that the cost of liquidation, as the Deputy knows, is negligible.  There is no duty payable.</P>
    <P>That having been said, there will be no doubt cases where companies will not be wound up without difficulty and there will be cases where a company is liable at 1 per cent and yet an individual shareholder may not be a wealth tax payer.  It is not considered that this can arise often since the company as such is liable at 50 per cent and is, therefore, unlikely to have a shareholder in a lower income tax bracket, certainly not all its shareholders. Where there are mixed shareholders, some liable to wealth tax and others not, it should not be impossible in the context of a closely held investment company for the parties to make arrangements to share the burden of the tax equitably among themselves.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to know the exact extent of the problem.  This can be ascertained only when the facts come to light.  For that reason there is a very strong case for retaining the position as it is in the Bill.  No great hardship can be caused by the payment of wealth tax for the current valuation date.  Before next year's valuation date arrives, the extent of the problem, if any, will be known and changes can be considered in that light and in the light of the experience of working the tax.</P>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Colley is that the amendment may lead to avoidance.  I do not think that is so, but I do concede that there will from time to time and especially in the early stages be methods of avoidance discovered and, of course, it will be the duty of the Revenue Commissioners to monitor those and keep an eye on them and to close the loopholes for avoidance.  When I last spoke on this measure after Deputy Colley had left the Chamber, I also gave an assurance that in the early years of the operation of this Bill the Revenue Commissioners would also <Col N="1295" /> keep an eye on and monitor the system to see if any hardships were emerging and that they, too, would be rectified.  In the meantime, especially in this year, it is extremely unlikely that any severe hardship can be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not know, I would strongly suspect that the note which the Minister read out to us was written before this amendment was produced because the general tenor of that note was that private non-trading companies really are something to be discouraged and that in so far as one can encourage their liquidation, that is a good thing; but here we have an amendment which merely recognises that there are certain kinds of private non-trading companies which are genuine and must get the same treatment as trading companies.  In effect, that is what the amendment has been saying and thereby recognises the fact that there are private non-trading companies which are genuine and should be treated accordingly.  The Minister will agree that the note from which he read does not appear to recognise that there are any genuine private non-trading companies.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point is that the approach seems to me to be one of saying: &ldquo;We will give no thresholds in the case of private non-trading companies because they are a bad thing and thereby really ultimately get rid of them.&rdquo;  It may be from certain points of view desirable to get rid of private non-trading companies, although one is immediately up against the problem of the genuine one being recognised here, but even if that is to be regarded as a sound objective, I question whether the right way to approach it is to say: &ldquo;If your wealth is in a private non-trading company you will pay wealth tax on the first pound but if it is not and if you hold it personally or through shares in a trading company, we will give you the benefit of the thresholds.&rdquo;  That is the approach in the Bill and I am questioning that approach.  I am pointing out the consequence <Col N="1296" /> of that approach is that the Minister has to bring in an amendment of this kind.  I am also pointing out that bringing in an amendment of this kind is in practice providing one loophole for persons who, as the Bill so provided, were intended not to get any threshold at all and this, I am suggesting, is providing a method by which people in certain circumstances will be able to get themselves the benefit of the threshold.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of the Bill, and this is reinforced by the note the Minister has just read out, was not to give the benefit of thresholds to people whose wealth was in a private non-trading company.  If that approach is valid&mdash;I question whether or not it is&mdash;then it seems to me illogical to bring in an amendment which has the effect of providing just that benefit&mdash;in other words, the benefit of thresholds&mdash;to certain people whose wealth is in a private non-trading company.  I am suggesting that the consequences of this amendment highlight what is basically a wrong approach to the whole method of applying wealth tax to private non-trading companies and I do not think the Minister answered precisely the point I put to him.</P>
    <P>Why not apply wealth tax to private non-trading companies on the basis of the shareholders in proportion to their shares and the value of their shares, giving them the benefit of the threshold?  The Minister may say this device is such that people could juggle around with it so that we cannot get at them.  In answer to that I would say there is now a good deal of experience of private non-trading companies, that the law in relation to death duties has been, as the Minister said, amended a number of times and pretty effectively closes these loopholes and enables the Revenue Commissioners to impute value to property or to people who may have shares in a private non-trading company.  I am suggesting that the use of the existing machinery in order to assess the wealth of individuals holding shares in private non-trading companies would be an effective way of getting assets and <Col N="1297" /> you would then have a consistent approach throughout the Bill.  I am suggesting it is inconsistent, to use the Minister's words, simply to ignore private non-trading companies and, in practice, go out of your way to penalise them by saying they will get no thresholds.  It is inconsistent to do that, and the consequences of that inconsistency are that we get amendments of this kind, necessarily giving the approach, but highlighting the difficulties, if only because the amendment provides a method by which people in certain circumstances with their wealth in private non-trading companies will now be able to get the benefit of the thresholds the Minister said they would not get.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Colley has pointed out, at this point the amendment and the section are merged.  We are not approaching the original approach in the section in such a significant way that it raises the question of principle in approach to the section.  What the Minister read was extremely interesting and very valid. One can understand it as the whole basis to the approach to this section. Incidentally, I would like to express appreciation of the fact that the Minister read out that memorandum.  It is very helpful.  It is a help we do not, unfortunately, often get.  I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation for this help and for other attitudes on the part of the Minister when he does not get on what someone called &ldquo;his high horse&rdquo; in his approach to this legislation, and we would like to respond in turn.  If the Minister will bear with me, the amendment raises the question to which Deputy Colley referred about the whole philosophy of the approach to the section, and I would like to reserve a more detailed discussion on that until we come to the section itself when, I think, it would be more appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment sets me querying as to whether, if you have to go this far, what you are saying is that, as I understand it, if the non-trading company is a subsidiary of a trading company then the exemption arises.  The reasons for that are understandable and personally I believe very justifiable.  As <Col N="1298" /> far as the amendment goes the only objection that can be raised is the objection Deputy Colley raised: in its context it appears to invite an approach to the whole purpose of the section by possibly providing a loophole. My comment is more by way of addition.  Taking it that some such adjustment was necessary, it is realised that there are cases in which the device of the private non-trading company, taking that phrase within the meaning of the section itself, is useful commercially and possibly also socially.  We have to realise that commerce is not wholly equivalent to administration, particularly to revenue administration.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I have been struck, as this code of legislation develops, by the fact that more and more this is impinging on what was traditionally considered to be another area of legislation, namely, the area of company law.  Perhaps I am a little sensitive to this because I happened to be a member of the committee that sat on the last Companies Bill, the Companies Act of 1963.  I make that comment in order to emphasise that there is substance and purpose in the Minister bringing in this amendment.  It has a joint purpose.  Whatever representations were made to inspire this amendment, the Minister and his advisers quite rightly judged on whatever particular cases were adduced to prompt the amendment that the amendment was desirable in a very general context.</P>
    <P>These are aspects which must arise on the amendment for an Opposition which is trying to be reasonable.  The question arises as to whether we should oppose the amendment on the ground that, by so doing, we may emphasise a point or express disapproval of what is being done, for whatever reason, either because it is objected to or because of sufficiency or insufficiency.  This problem arises for us here because we feel this is an appropriate amendment for the Minister to introduce, but we also feel that it has the possible disadvantage of a loophole.  If it covers that type of case, there are other devices that should be covered in an amendment of this nature.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an example of what I mean.  The Minister has <Col N="1299" /> now provided for non-trading companies in the position of subsidiaries. Non-trading companies can be <i>bona fide</i> and properly used for purposes where they would be controlled by a non-corporate group or even by an individual.  I do not cavil at the memorandum the Minister read out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  If this amendment is accepted, would the Minister consider on Report Stage the point I am making?  If it is recognised that in the case of the trading company for <i>bona fide</i> purposes, other than the accumulation of wealth for tax avoidance purposes, because that is where the abuse was and that is where the memorandum comes in, it is necessary to bring in an exception where the control is in a body corporate, should not the principle then be widened <i>bona fide</i> where the control is not necessarily in a corporation&mdash;that is, in an incorporated corporation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to the point I have repeated continuously&mdash;and I am afraid I will go on repeating it until we come to the end of this whole system of legislation.  The problems have arisen and will continue to arise and, in my humble opinion, will only be solved now or in the future by the residual device of providing generally for contingencies and, having given the general guidelines to the Revenue Commissioners, giving the necessary discretion to the Inspector of Taxes to give relief.  I will go as far as the Minister wants to go in safeguarding against provisions which could be enforced against the Revenue Commissioners by law or by action in the courts but I would give that <i>bona fide</i> discretion to the inspector, or other officer, who has to make the decision in the genuine case and who has to decide in the last analysis and on principle whether this is fair or whether it is the intention.  Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs referred to the problem arising there and said he would go a long way to <Col N="1300" /> limit the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in this matter.  Having regard to many other checks and balances, I still continue to adumbrate and emphasise that point.  I thank the Minister for the memorandum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister read out a document which was quite enlightening, so far as I am concerned, with regard to the formation of non-trading companies.  The formation of these companies could have something to do with the avoidance of income tax.  Deputy Colley dealt with genuine non-trading companies.  I cannot see the sense in a trading company forming a non-trading company, but evidently it happens.  I believe that we should have no loopholes and that people in this category should be caught.  I would give no exemptions where they are concerned. Nobody on this side of the House would go out of his way to try to exempt any group of people who have various devices and the necessary experts at their disposal to form this type of company for a particular reason.  We would not have any time for that type of arrangement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley is trying to ensure that there is no hardship and that we are not victimising any section. The Minister brought in this amendment to exclude certain types of non-trading companies that might be victimised. That is quite acceptable.  The Minister has in mind certain non-trading companies who are genuinely operating and who might be subject to wealth tax.  Throughout this Bill we are trying to ensure that genuine cases are not caught.  We have found this in the Capital Gains Tax Bill and we find it in the Wealth Tax Bill and we have put forward genuine cases which we think might be victimised under this section or various other sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance put forward his point of view and mentioned cases where there could be avoidance. We appreciate that but our duty is to point out the cases where innocent people might be victimised. <Col N="1301" /> We did that throughout the Capital Gains Tax Bill and we will do so section by section in this Bill.  Deputy Colley put forward cases this morning where this could happen.  Without this amendment matters could have been worse.  The amendment seeks to exempt genuine cases which would otherwise be brought within the ambit of the section and therefore we welcome it, though Deputy Colley is not altogether satisfied with it.</P>
    <P>I must say I was surprised when I heard the Minister enumerate the large number of non-trading companies in the country.  I am sure there is some device, legal or otherwise, through which avoidance could be achieved.  However, what we are mainly concerned with is that innocent people would not be caught.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> There will be at least two ways, sometimes many more than two, of dealing with this.  The Government think the best way to deal with private non-trading companies is to treat them as entities.  Unless we do that the tax will not work.  When I was dealing with this Bill earlier Deputy de Valera conceded that there is a large number of non-trading companies here and Deputy Fitzpatrick more or less accepts that.  They have mushroomed here in recent years.  As a country <Col N="1302" /> solicitor I cannot clearly understand it, but most tax consultants are inclined to form companies and it would be interesting to know how many limited companies of this kind have been incorporated in this country in the last few years.  I should think thousands and thousands.  I am sure the bulk of them have tax relief. However, that is our approach to private non-trading companies in general but it appeared to us that some genuine holding companies were caught by the section and the amendment, which I think the House is accepting, will exclude genuine non-trading holding subsidiaries which are part of trading companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley began his argument by saying we were leaving a loophole for people.  I think that an individual creating a non-trading company and putting his wealth into it and more or less giving control to the trading company will get away with a lot because he is at least putting his wealth to work in the trading company and exposing it to risk in the trading company.  It is conceivable that he could convert the trading company into a non-trading one.  The amendment serves the purpose for which it was introduced, to give exemptions to genuine companies.  It is not for me to lecture the Opposition as to how the debate should be conducted, and I do not propose to do so, but whether the Opposition like it or not we are working to a timetable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="1303" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 6, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points that should be raised on this section, some being matters of principle and some of detail.  Perhaps it would be better if I dealt with matters of detail first.  There is one matter which I referred to on the Second Stage and perhaps the best thing I could do is to quote what I said then. I quote from the Dáil Official Report of 5th March, 1975, columns 1514 and 1515:</P>
      <P>Under section 6 it appears to me that double wealth tax can arise on the one hand in the case of a private non-trading company, first, on the company itself and, secondly, on the shareholder in respect of the same property.  The same thing can hold true where one company holds a large stake in another company.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister dealt with that in the amendment we have just discussed. I went on:</P>
      <P>In answer to that the Minister may say that there is provision to deal with it in section 21 (2), but I have some doubts as to whether it deals with it.  I should like the Minister to have another look at this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think it does. The other point I was going to quote from, in fact, is a matter of principle which I will raise later.  As I say, I would prefer to get matters of detail out of the way, if possible, first.  The next point I want to raise is in regard to subsection (2).  This is a point which I raised yesterday.  A similar provision occurs in section 5.  I raised this with the Minister for Finance. Briefly, the point is whether or not the effect of subsection (2) is that where there is a limited interest the <Col N="1304" /> treatment will be the same as it is in the case of an individual.  The subsection appears to be saying that but the Minister for Finance yesterday seemed to suggest that it was not doing that.  If it is to be treated in the same way as in the case of an individual then it means that two persons can be liable for wealth tax on the same property at the same time and the Revenue Commissioners have to opt.  That was the position which emerged according to the Minister for Finance&mdash;I am not sure whether it was the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Finance&mdash; in regard to the treatment of the individual, and yesterday, on the similar provision in the previous section, the Minister for Finance said you cannot have two people owning the same property at the one time.  He meant where they were not jointly owning. Of course, I agree with that proposition, but it seemed to me that in fact the Bill was providing in practice for just that contingency, and when I raised it yesterday, after some discussion the Minister for Finance undertook to communicate to me whether the point I was raising was correct or not.  I do not wish to delay the House on this today.  I merely want to draw attention to the fact that the same provision applies here and perhaps that could be included in the communication to me that the Minister for Finance promised yesterday.</P>

Deputy de Valera suggested that considerable discretion should be given to the Revenue Commissioners in the operation of this Bill, and the Bill is drafted throughout in a non-technical way.  We say that &ldquo;share&rdquo; in relation to a company includes any interest whatsoever in the company which is analogous to a share in the company.  I suppose that will enable the Revenue Commissioners to decide that a share includes some other right which gives the same interest or the same power or the same control as a share.  I <Col N="1309" /> think it is a good thing to have it drafted in that manner.</P>

I am suggesting that it is, at the very least, unfortunate that the same approach is not adopted in this and in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I am not necessarily saying that the one in the Capital Gains Tax Bill should be in this, but whichever one is chosen should be invoked when they are represented to be part of an overall package.  In regard to the question of controlled companies I really cannot see why there should be any difference in approach between the wealth tax and the capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that.  The next matter I want to refer to is perhaps more a matter of principle than of technical detailed drafting. The Minister will recall that we spent a considerable time when he was handling the Bill in the House earlier in dealing with the question of on the one hand a disincentive to Irish people to invest and on the other a disincentive to foreign investment. The Minister's approach in regard to foreign investment was that there was no disincentive at all in this Bill.  I said to him at that time that on the particular section on which we were arguing it might not have been totally in order but that I thought it would certainly arise under section 6. That is the section we are on now. The Minister will recall that we are dealing in general with an example in which a United States citizen invested in the setting up of a factory in this country and set up an Irish company for the operation of that factory.  That Irish company would, of course, be a trading company.  I want to suggest to the Minister that not only is it possible but in fact it has happened in a number of cases that where such an Irish company has been set up the shares in that company have been vested in what, in effect, is a private non-trading company and that if that happened under this section, even as amended, with the amendment we dealt with recently, the position will be that the American resident who owned the great bulk of the shares will be liable to wealth tax without any threshold and if that is so that there is a clear disincentive to investment in those circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The answer to that is that we had this discussion when I was handling the earlier sections of this Bill and I told the Deputy that because a trading company is exempt from wealth tax practically all foreign investment would be free of wealth tax.  I would like to take up the example given by Deputy Colley of an American establishing a factory here.  The statistics show that practically all American investment <Col N="1311" /> for the establishment of industries here comes from American trading companies and that they simply establish subsidiaries here.  To that extent what I said is perfectly true.  The profit from the Irish trading company goes in the form of dividends on shares to the American trading company and the latter is not subject to any Irish wealth tax.  They may be subject to whatever tax is payable in the United States.</P>

The answer to that is that industries are rarely established here by foreign individuals.  That is point number one.  Point number two, in cases in which they are, the position has been improved because death duties have gone.  The person who in March last was liable for death duties is not now liable.

I do not think that is true. I think there are cases in which American individuals have the kind of set-up which I have described, although as far as the IDA are concerned, if they were recording that, they would record the name of the American trading company which the particular individual controls.  I do not want to mention individual names but I know that this is so.  Mr. X is the person who owns and effectively controls the American trading company, the Irish trading company and the private non-trading company which I have mentioned.

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in a certain difficulty as to whether to take the line Deputy Colley took and to follow questions of detail or to come straightaway to the principle on the section. I am afraid that the point has come where we have to look at the principle of the section in approaching this matter.  The point which has been uncovered is simply this, that taking the Minister's memorandum first, for which we are grateful, it is quite clear that the approach to this section&mdash;it was a valid approach&mdash;is that the bulk of private non-trading companies had been generated and designed as tax avoidance measures and that this particular device had to be neutralised. It had already raised problems on the income tax code and would possibly drive a coach and four through this Bill if some provision were not made.</P>
      <P>That is commonplace and we are in common sympathy with it, but what has arisen in this debate is the way in which to do this.  The approach to&mdash;I do not wish to use an emotive word and I do not mean it in any such sense&mdash;penalise and so discourage private trading companies as, so to speak, to put them in a limbo is now revealed to be somewhat too sweeping, that valid as this may be from a revenue point of view and having regard to the abuses, it is likely to bring about undesirable commercial consequences and indeed injustice.  For that reason the Minister has already brought in one amendment which, being part of the section now, is still open to discussion. That is the first comment I wish to make in order to put the matter in perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second comment I wish to make, and to join issue with the Minister, <Col N="1318" /> is this: There is a constant appeal&mdash;it has occurred more frequently on this Bill than on the Bill which the Minister for Finance personally piloted through, the Capital Gains Tax Bill, though it has occurred in that too&mdash;to the idea that this will not happen, that this cannot happen. These are two different things&mdash;this will not happen, that this is unlikely to happen.  It is one thing if the answer is this cannot happen, that is fair and that is a valid reason.  I would like formally to record that I do not think it is correct for a Legislature to take chances where injustice or imbalance in equity, or even commercial considerations may take place and be prejudiced, on the plea that the number of times it happened is minimal and that, worse still, somebody takes the attitude that it will not happen.  I would like to join with the Minister on that point once and for all to avoid repetition.  We cannot accept that argument.  We have to approach a Bill on the basis as to what can happen, because what can happen may have happened, and it may be desirable that it should happen, and to prejudice it merely on the ground that it has not happened to date, or is not as likely to happen as other things, is not good enough for a Legislature.</P>
    <P>Having gone thus far with the general argument, let us take Deputy Colley's point.  On the amendment now incorporated in the Bill an exception is made whereby a private non-trading company, which is in effect, a subsidiary of another company, is exempted from the section.  There is no need to go into the actual details and the fine content of the amendments as incorporated.  That statement is sufficient.  The exception is made because it is now recognised that there can be <i>bona fide</i> cases where a manifest injustice could occur by the taxation of a non-trading company as a unit without thresholds.  What Deputy Colley is really doing is, and I think I would support him, pointing out that recognition of the principle here that there can be a non-trading company for <i>bona fide</i> purposes and commercial utility, or maybe social utility, which is not a tax avoidance device and which does not really prejudice the <Col N="1319" /> Revenue in any way.  Once that principle is admitted for the company's control the same situation can arise where the effective control is not a company.</P>
    <P>As I said, this is so complex that we are all at one stage or another in the course of this debate making statements we have to correct and I hope the Minister will not mind when I say that I think he was mistaken for the moment when he thought the amendment covered the cases we are talking about, because it is an inverse relationship Deputy Colley is talking about, the inverse to what is covered by the amendment.  You have an Irish trading company; for some reason or other, the investment is by a non-resident. Various nationalities and possiblities were mentioned.  Indeed, it is important to consider the case of Europe and the Community of which we are a member.  There may be an interest there, whether an individual or a collection of individuals, that may not be covered by the phrases used in the amendment: &ldquo;a body corporate has control&rdquo; is the effective phrase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt?  It is a body corporate which is not a non-trading company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so: where a body corporate which is a non-trading company.  Deputy Colley has slightly telescoped me here because there is one non-corporate possibly and the other non-trading involved in this. It is very difficult to be completely clear in this.  I am postulating an Irish trading company which has come into being or been set up or acquired, or anything else you like, and is under the effective control in whole or in part&mdash;I am widening it to try to capture the general case&mdash;of an individual or group of individuals whether to be regarded as a corporate person or not, using the word person in the legal sense, who are not Irish residents or domiciled.  In other words, it covers the case where Deputy Colley wandered all over the world; he said Americans, Scandinavians and Continentals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have them all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I <Col N="1320" /> have made that much clear&mdash;an Irish trading company, whether acquired or set up, controlled in whole or in part by a foreign individual or group of individuals, corporate or otherwise. I will even go as far as to say it is not even necessary to postulate control.  One could even say a substantial interest in the Irish company. These are the two ends.  You have the Irish company here and you have the other interest over there.  Now consider the case Deputy Colley made where, for commercial, administrative or any other reasons, a private non-trading company is set up as a holding company here&mdash;that is what it amounts to&mdash;for what I will call the foreign interest and, from the Irish point of view, that foreign investing interest. That particular private trading company, as the section stands, comes completely within the scope of the section provided the technical details are complied with, which would be most likely, and the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo; comes within the disabilities of the section.</P>
      <P>The next question arising is: is it not desirable that, in such case, such a private non-trading company should be taken out of the ambit of the section and brought within the ambit of trading companies?  I think that that would be possible.  I wonder have I made that point clear?  It is difficult to be clear.  Does it make sense?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to spare everybody the agony of listening to something that does not make sense.  If it makes sense, I want to say this on the whole approach to the section.  We agree that the section is necessary because the device was so much abused and used for tax avoidance, more abused than used, and the first approach certainly had my sympathy. If this question of opening up the section arises, can I not ask this fundamental question on the section? Is not the purpose of this section to ensure that, where tax is payable or justly payable in equity within the principles of the Bill, that tax should be collected?  What is really of interest <Col N="1321" /> is the financial stake or interest of the Revenue and of the taxable entity?  It is here this section gets into trouble and that is why this amendment had to be brought in.  I can see the difficulty of avoidance in tackling control because if you do not tackle control you can cause difficulty.  The bringing in of the element of control has caused the difficulty here.  That, in turn, might easily bring in elements of double taxation.</P>
      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the wealth concerned is ascertainable, and if they can apportion the wealth, as in the case of trading companies and other companies over the shareholders, should not that principle arise generally?  The only justification, therefore, from the point of view of this Bill, for going after the private non-trading company is because the device makes that procedure very difficult if not impossible. I wonder does that make sense? May I put it this way?  The essential difference between a trading company and a non-trading company and, shall I say, non-trading companies as defined in this section, is that in one case the wealth tax is distributed over the shareholders.  That is possible because the shareholders are easily ascertainable and there is not much scope for juggling to avoid the payment of tax.  Will the Minister accept that I am right in this?  I do not want to develop arguments where this is a fundemental objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Aggregate.  In other words, there are loopholes in this.  If we accept that as being the real kernel of the affair could something not be incorporated in this section giving a general direction to the Revenue Commissioners, coupled with the discretion I have so often advocated, to the effect that where the financial aspect of the matter is clear and satisfactorily accounted for by the Revenue Commissioners, discretion will be given to obviate the manifest type of difficulty or injustice that can arise in cases such as Deputy Colley mentioned and in cases such as the Minister has provided for in his amendment?  That is where I stand on the principle of the section.  I hope my remarks have been helpful rather than obstructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I want to ask some questions here.  After all, when one comes to subsection (3) it is the subsection which causes the bulk of the trouble and I understand it is necessary to give effect to the original intentions of the section.  At the end of that subsection is the acceptance of the principle that I state here, because it is the norm.  The criteria is money, the due collection of tax. Therefore, I ask the Minister to look at it this way.  If in any case of a private, non-trading company&mdash;and I say &ldquo;any case&rdquo; now&mdash;which is in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;I am putting it that way because I am fairly certain that that opinion would correspond to the fact&mdash;not a device or to be adjudged a device to avoid tax, and where it is possible to ascertain the purpose clearly and to satisfy oneself that the tax avoidance abuses are neither there nor was it provided that they should be there, that there should be discretion on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to treat that company as outside the narrow ambit of the provision, in other words, giving the option to the Revenue Commissioners to treat companies in that position as trading or <Col N="1323" /> non-trading as would suit the merits of the case.</P>
    <P>I should now like to ask a couple of detailed points on the section.  I know that constantly I am advocating something here that I could be faulted for in other types of legislation, and in ordinary criminal legislation I would take the opposite view, but in the area of Revenue legislation, having regard to all our experience, at the end of a long debate on the other Bill, being in the middle of this Bill and facing a third Bill, I find myself more than ever reassured in the attitude I am taking to the administration in this.  After all, we are giving powers of all sorts to every Minister, body and everything else in the State without thinking about it, and just because it is taxation, pure and simple, we are carrying on a traditional attitude of regarding the Revenue Commissioners as criminals almost.  We have given powers everywhere, and to semi-State bodies which are not accountable to the House.  I do not wish to say anything more because I would be out of order but the more I see of this, the more I see that in every section of this legislation there is need for two things, the giving of an adequate discretion and then encouragement to the Revenue Commissioners to do the right thing in the best way they can. When I say the Revenue Commissioners, I recognise that it really means the unfortunate individuals who have to make decisions, particularly the inspectors, who have to do this type of work.  The overall control of that should not be difficult.</P>
    <P>There are one or two small questions I would like to ask, having made that point, and I hope the Minister will consider the approach I have made which enlarges on Deputy Colley's point there.  I notice something which occurs twice in the section&mdash;in subsection (1) of paragraph 6 (b) between (ii) and (iii) the word &ldquo;or&rdquo;.  One says:</P>
    <P>(i) the company is incorporated in the State, (ii) the effective centre of management of the company is in the State, or (iii) control of the company is...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> That &ldquo;or&rdquo; there is quite clear; it is between (ii) and (iii), but are we to infer an &ldquo;or&rdquo; between (i) and (ii) ? This is a question of some importance. Should the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; be in there?</P>

      <P>I did not notice it there when we were dealing with it.  The actual set-out here was such that, once at the very end, it made me ask the question.  I have not looked into the matter or researched it and the Minister is quite satisfied that these are the conditions that must be fulfilled for the lot.  A question has arisen as to the definition in section 6 of this Bill and section 35 of the Capital Gains Tax Bill which we have passed.  The Minister need not be alarmed; I am not going to open up the whole question of <i>pari materia</i> again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say to the Minister, as he was not here, that I remarked yesterday that the Minister for Finance appeared to be more inclined <Col N="1325" /> to my point of view on that matter and he introduced an amendment which went very far to help me in my argument but this is not the point here.  I am making a point on consistency because I recognise that in the case of this section the provisions are specific to the section and as I cannot see any case where it would arise outside the section, the argument of <i>pari materia</i> would be academic and speculative and would not have any practical effect.  It is, at the same time, from the point of view of consistency, interesting to note that a &ldquo;controlled company resident&rdquo; means a company resident in the State in which the number of persons holding shares is not more that 50&mdash;that corresponds to paragraph (a) of subsection (3)&mdash; which has not issued any shares as a result of public invitation&mdash;that corresponds to (b) (iii)&mdash;which is under the control of not more than five persons. So that, so far there is consistency between the two.  Furthermore, although control is very much telescoped in paragraph (4) what is in the Bill is wider.</P>
    <P>Then you have the difference between the two in the words &ldquo;whereever incorporated&rdquo;&mdash;paragraph 35 referring merely to &ldquo;company resident in the State&rdquo;.  Of course, one has to take paragraph 36 for capital gains into account for a non-resident company. I am asking whether any difficulty can arise in the case where, for instance, the private non-trading company is incorporated elsewhere and indeed resident elsewhere.  Would that in any way affect the situation?</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any possibility of tax avoidance.  Such ideas as occur do not suggest that any real difficulty arises.  There is the general point, the desirability of the sections being on the one foot.</P>
    <P>That rather involved argument really hangs on the following points. Firstly, we are <i>d'accord</i> in regard to the purpose of the section and what it wants to do.  I did take issue with the Minister in appealing too often to the argument, if there is a difficulty there it is not going to be a practical one.  The Minister may go a little bit <Col N="1326" /> too far there.  I think the Minister is inclined to take refuge.</P>

      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension here.  It is to cover that type of case that if the Minister says a thing is not likely to happen and legislates to exclude, then it may happen, whereas what I am saying is that if you cannot legislate to provide, then leave the Revenue Commissioners the discretion.  However, this would be off at a tangent. I hope the Minister will take what I have said in the friendly spirit in which it was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle is its financial state and the isolation of it and the collection of taxation which is assessed on financial value.  Let us not lose sight of this principle in this taxation measure.  Let us be careful, therefore, when we are dealing with questions of control that commercial considerations, even social considerations, are not prejudiced that, therefore, when there are <i>bona fide</i> purposes for a private non-trading company, that these should be recognised as the Minister has recognised them in the particular case where he has provided for an amendment and I have gone to some length expanding what Deputy Colley said to say that there may be other cases where that may be so.  At the end of that, I am driven to the conclusion that there is only one way of dealing with it, that what he is at is to enforce a wealth tax of 1 per cent and that if the proper persons to be taxed are ascertainable, the discretion in such a matter should be left with the Revenue Commissioners to decide where appropriate whether a non-trading company is there for <i>bona fide</i> purposes and that the conditions <Col N="1327" /> which the Revenue require can be satisfied or to leave the discretion to them to say &ldquo;No, we are not satisfied. We are going to treat it as non-trading&rdquo;. A discretion within that limited area is probably the only answer to a problem of this nature.  If one takes it that way possibly the section could stand subject to details, possibly another amendment on Report, but the amendment might have to be of the general nature I have suggested. I hope I have made myself reasonably clear.  I do not think I can push my argument any further.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Really the point in substance made by Deputy de Valera is that a very wide discretion&mdash;I would even go so far as to say possibly an unacceptable discretion&mdash;should be given to the Revenue Commissioners in any particular case to decide whether or not a non-trading company was a genuine <i>bona fide</i> one that was entitled to be treated as an entity with a threshold or whether it should be treated as an anti-avoidance device.  We should bear in mind here that the amount of tax to be collected in any particular case is relatively small, 1 per cent.  The administration of the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera would be out entirely of proportion to the amount involved.</P>

The Revenue Commissioners would have to investigate each of these companies and most of them would go to appeal.  Certainly the <Col N="1328" /> amount of time and money involved would be out of proportion to the amount of revenue which would come in as a result.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House for long but there are a few other things I wish to say in connection with the economic package introduced by the Minister for Finance some time back.  I said yesterday that I considered that the introduction of subsidies on food in order to show the Government's determination to tackle the problem of inflation was necessary and the right thing to do.  The introduction of the payment of £12 to an employer in respect of each person taken from the live register at the Labour Exchanges and put into constant employment is an imaginative and constructive step. The employment situation and the inflation situation demand certain sacrifices.  The sacrifices that are being asked are small when compared with <Col N="1329" /> the benefits that will accrue if the package works.  Unless there is full co-operation from all sections of our people it will be very difficult for the package to work.</P>
      <P>I believe our people&mdash;trade unionists, employers and professional people &mdash;are prepared to give their co-operation. The workers in particular will be prepared to give their co-operation unless they feel that they and they alone are being asked to carry the whole burden.  Trade union leaders are in the position that they must submit any arrangements they may make to their ordinary members and to representatives of their ordinary members.  Trade union leaders are in a position to discuss with the Government and to ensure, even before this is put to their ordinary members, that the Government intend to control dividends, professional fees, and so on, as well as the wages of the people who are concerned with the national wage agreement.</P>
      <P>Our Minister and our Government must ensure that they bring home to the workers that ordinary workers will not be the only ones asked to forego increases and that increases will not be allowed in dividends.  I am not speaking of profits, which would normally be ploughed back into an industry to make it more viable.  I would like the Government to see that steps are taken to ensure that increases in profits, in professional fees and in other such matters are not allowed unless they coincide with what is allowed to the ordinary worker. If that is made quite clear I feel sure that the trade union movement and its leaders will be prepared to take their share of the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the workers of this country understand that they are not being asked to carry the whole load and that it will be evenly spread over the whole area of our industrial and professional structures they will be ready to do their share and to ensure that the future of their jobs and of their industries is secure.  It is better to have more of our people working even at present wage and salary levels than to have fewer people working at slightly or even greatly increased <Col N="1330" /> amounts of pay and salary.  For that reason I believe our people will accept what the Government are trying to do and accept their part of the package.</P>
    <P>Some industries, even with the economic situation as it is, may be doing very well and may be having reasonable or good profits.  The workers in these industries may feel that the economic situation of other industries has nothing to do with their rights to claim the normal increases they should get. That is fair enough.  If there are such industries&mdash;I am sure there are&mdash; some method should be devised whereby these people employed in those industries, which are making and possibly increasing their profits, will, eventually, get what is their normal due, as the industry is doing well.</P>
    <P>That is why the whole spectrum of a wage agreement is a very hard thing for the trade union movement or anyone else to agree to on a broad basis. If we were dealing with specific industries that could not afford to pay the normal increases under the wage agreement then we would be dealing with something different.  What is being asked by the Minister is that the last phase of the wage agreement should be modified.</P>
    <P>This probably applies to industrialists, who are well able to pay the increases under the wage agreement.  I am sure the workers in these industries will feel that they are being somewhat cheated if they agree to this.  In those circumstances there should be some form of bonus that would accrue to these workers at a later date, perhaps.  If we mean to put our people back to work we must sell our produce.  This means that in our low exporting industries we have very little room for increases in price ranges.  I know two or three industries in my constituency which have been in trouble on the export market. The principal reason was that the British economy was going through a very bad period and consequently, the people of Britain were not buying at the normal rate for that country.</P>
    <P>Fifty per cent of our exports still go to Britain, and when we have the British economy in bad circumstances <Col N="1331" /> naturally it affects many of our export industries to the United Kingdom.  We must try to do everything possible to keep the price of these commodities, which we export not alone to Britain but all over the world, competitive at a price at which they will sell.  It is necessary that no extra costs be put on our industries at this point in time. This also affects the home market.  If there is an increase in wages, naturally most of our industrialists and producers will look for an increase in price.  That, again, causes a rise in prices and that, then, causes a demand for greater income.</P>
    <P>The situation finally reaches the stage where we are priced out of our export markets, where even our own people in the lower income groups, and particularly in the category of social welfare, and, indeed, in many other spheres, cannot afford to buy the goods our industries and our farmers are producing.  In that approach, naturally, there will be a slackness of work and redundancies.  We want to try to produce more efficiently, if possible. This has an effect on management as well as labour.  Management in some industries must bear a lot of the responsibility for the cost of some of our productions which go on the export market.  Production could have been cheaper if it was properly managed.</P>
    <P>We signed a free trade agreement with Britain and we are now approaching the stage of full free trade with Europe.  We did this at a time when our industrialists did not seem to realise that they were approaching such a state.  They did not gear themselves to this.  Many of them built up during the years of protection within the home market and the home market seemed to satisfy them.  They were able then to export their surplus at a figure which was not really economic.  For that reason we went into this free-trade-area agreement without being fully prepared, with our industries not fully alive to the fierce competition we would have to endure in those markets and on the home market.</P>
    <P>This seems to be a situation in which management have something to answer <Col N="1332" /> for.  We must ensure that in relation to the industries that will be subsidised and helped, that will be given grants, the managements and personnel within them are capable of providing the kind of know-how and expertise that is necessary in our modern trading position. Management and workers together have a responsibility in this.  If they accept what the Minister says, and the dire consequences for our society if we do not accept this packet and if this packet does not succeed, other measures will have to be taken, because it is vital, regardless of what society we belong to, that this packet works, that our people are put back into work and that our rate of inflation is reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  Our people now have a duty to consider the jobs of their fellow workers and the jobs of the people who are unemployed.  Our people, in general, whether they are workers in industry, professional people, people who draw dividends or anything else, are the people who must make the small sacrifices asked by the Minister in order to bring us through these times of economic crisis.</P>
    <P>The measures taken in the budget have been worthwhile and will mean a good deal to the lower income groups, old age pensioners and others who buy bread and butter as their principal food.  Good efforts have been made to reduce the cost of living, but it is unfortunate that the introduction of these subsidies coincided, in some instances, with a rise in price. However, most people will understand that the rise in price would have been added on to the old price, were it not for the subsidies.  It is unfortunate that the removal of VAT from electricity charges has also coincided with a rise in the price of electricity, but it would have been an added load if VAT had not been removed.</P>
    <P>By their decisions, the Government have proved that they are trying to reduce inflation.  They have proved by the introduction of the employment premium of £12 per week that they are anxious to encourage employers, industrialists, to take on men who are on the live register.  The <Col N="1333" /> measures the Government have introduced will not be of benefit if there is not full co-operation from all sections of the community.  Together we can overcome our difficulties.  The employment premium incentive of £12 will encourage employers, exporters and industrialists generally to be ready for the upswing which most economists feel will come in 1976.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to Government speakers, one might be led to believe that the Government were performing some extraordinary feat in tackling inflation at the present time when in fact the problem of inflation should have been tackled long ago, by any Government which regarded themselves as responsible.  The speeches made by speakers on the Government side might have had some credibility if they were made in reference to steps taken a year ago. Surely they are not suggesting that it is only now that we are facing a very serious economic situation because of inflation?  This problem has been with us for quite a considerable time and despite all the efforts from this side of the House to impress on the Government the urgency to take firm action, nothing was done until quite recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Coalition Government will be remembered for its total lack of concern for the rising tide of unemployment which has engulfed the country over the past number of years.  We have had, of course, no lack of professions of concern from the Government for the unemployed, but when it came to making decisions which were vital to the economic wellbeing of the country, decisions which in the short-term might be unpopular but which would result in the saving of jobs, then we saw the real weakness of the Government who were determined to ensure that short-term popularity would be theirs even at the expense of the shocking rise in the number of unemployed.  All sorts of excuses were trotted out by the Government for their failure to tackle and curb inflation.  Last summer we were told that there would be an upturn in the economy by the end of 1974. When this did not materialise, we <Col N="1334" /> were told it would come in March, 1975.  Later it was to come in the summer of 1975 and later still it was to come at the end of 1975.  Finally, we are now told that the upturn may come sometime in 1976.</P>
    <P>The irresponsibility and callousness shown&mdash;I cannot use any lesser term &mdash;by the Government as the numbers of unemployed increased by hundreds each week, as redundancies rose and industries closed is unbelievable.  Improved social welfare payment which did not keep pace with rising costs but which appeared, when figures are quoted, to be very large succeeded in keeping the pressures off the Government until recently.  When it became obvious that not only was employment being lost but that the jobs themselves were going out of existence, and would be lost for ever, then public reaction forced the Government to act and bring in the budget package, which in my view is of doubtful quality. The fact is that if it is not successful, then the outlook is very dim indeed.</P>
    <P>Rampant inflation is, and has been for quite some time under this Government, a major problem.  At a time when most countries were controlling it, our inflation rate continued to escalate. This made it more difficult for us to compete on foreign markets and severely damaged our trade on the home market where we had to compete with imports.  It was clear to every responsible person that this could not be allowed to continue, but far from facing up to this problem the Government kept repeating that they could do nothing to control the situation.  The oil crisis had become an almost permanent excuse for lack of action on the part of the Government. The excuse about the oil crisis ignores the fact that other countries in western Europe and also in the United States also experienced this problem.  Nevertheless, they have succeeded in reducing their inflation rate. In the case of Germany, the inflation rate was reduced to six per cent, while our inflation rate was running at 25 per cent or higher.  When the oil excuse was not acceptable any longer, the Government changed their tune and admitted for the first time that <Col N="1335" /> the larger part of the inflationary problem was home-produced and that measures had to be taken if we were to curb the problem.</P>
    <P>My own feeling is that the Coalition Government would never have admitted that inflation was home-produced, had it not been for the fact that there was a national wage agreement in the offing and the Government were hoping that by changing their tune in relation to the source of inflation, they might hope for lower wage demands.  This turnabout by the Government was too abrupt to have any credibility.  The national wage agreement emerged and was loudly applauded by the Government, but in a few short months the Government made the expected about-turn and claimed that the agreement of which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour among others were so loud in their praise, was at the root of the financial problem, that unless something was done, we faced ruin.</P>
    <P>In my view this is leadership of a Coalition variety which is supposed to raise us out of the morass into which failure to make decisions has led us.  This Government have shown clearly that they propose to stagger on to the next election on their short-term popular political decisions, whatever the cost may be in the misery, anxiety and agony for those who lose their employment and who, in many cases, become of age and because of the fact that some jobs are lost forever, are destined to remain on the list of unemployed for the remainder of their lives.  To those, and they are many, who have never before known what it was to be out of work this is a traumatic experience. The really sad aspect of it, in so far as I am concerned and in so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, is that it should never have had to happen.  Prompt action at the right time could have saved these jobs, but members of the Government were more concerned with saving their own political skins for a little longer.</P>
    <P>This failure to control inflation is the basis for the fundamental failure <Col N="1336" /> of the Government.  We discussed a Private Members' Motion last December and when we pointed to certain actions taken by the Italian Government to protect its industry, which was in serious difficulty at that time, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in replying, stated that the Italian Government were placing themselves in a highly dangerous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC and pointed to the severe economic strain under which Italy was labouring, even going so far as to say that the Government had fallen because of its actions.  Six months later, when we were discussing a similar motion here, we were able to point to the fact that Italy had cut its rate of inflation from 24 per cent to 12 per cent.  This had not been an easy task for the Italian Government but they proceeded to take the necessary action while, at the same time, our inflation rate was escalating with this Government, like Micawber's waiting for something to turn up and all the while more and more people were being thrown out of jobs.</P>
    <P>The real problem we faced here was that the Government refused to face up to the fact that unemployment was escalating rapidly.  They took refuge in quoting percentage increases in unemployment figures in other countries and patting themselves on the back when the percentage increases here were not so high as they were in other countries.  The Minister for Local Government, in reply to a supplementary question in which I asked him if he would provide money for intensive labour operations, such as reconstruction and recycling large old buildings, such as was done in Denmark so as to provide work for many of those who were unemployed in the building industry, retorted that unemployment had increased in Denmark by 400 per cent and, later, in a television interview, the Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to a 230 per cent increase in unemployment in Denmark.</P>
    <P>Leaving to one side the discrepancies in these figures, the obvious question to ask is: 400 per cent of what and 230 per cent of what?  Four hundred per cent of one is just a unit, 10 per <Col N="1337" /> cent of 1,000 is 100.  The fact is that the unemployment rate here was very much higher than it was in other countries in any of the figures which are available to us.  We have to take into consideration also the fact that in this country we do not include school leavers as is done in many other countries. This is typical of the attitude of the Coalition.  The motto is simply to find excuses rather than to take action.</P>
    <P>I am personally interested in the footwear industry which is such a large employer in my constituency.  In a Private Members' Motion in December, 1974, and again in June, 1975, I pointed out that due to the exceptional importation of shoes, particularly from low-cost countries and from the Comicon countries, the home industry was in jeopardy and, unless steps were taken at once, the industry would collapse. I do not need to go into the details of the speeches made on those occasions.  They are on the record of the House.  On every occasion I was met by stonewalling resistance on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Parliamentary Secretary to every suggestion I made about invoking certain Articles of the Rome Treaty and of the Treaty of Accession. The invariable answer was that it could not be done, that I was misreading the situation, that the EEC rules and regulations were there and that we could attempt to utilise them only at our peril.</P>
    <P>During the six months which elapsed from December, 1974, in reply to questions and supplementary questions to the Minister for Industry and Commerce the Minister and the Government persisted in their attitude that nothing could be done.  During the same six months, and I want to emphasise this, hundreds of workers were losing their employment in the footwear industry.  Several footwear industries were closing down, some of them never to reopen.  Footwear operatives, who had worked for long years in the industry, were for the first time in their lives swelling the queues at the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>We argued on this side of the House that Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession, which permitted a <Col N="1338" /> country of the EEC to demand protection for an industry which was severely threatened and which could demand this protection up to 1977, should be brought into operation.  The Minister, no later than a few weeks ago, repeated that it could not be brought into operation.  The reference can be found in Volume 282 at columns 168 and 169 of the Official Report.  Lo and behold, two weeks after the Private Members' Motion had been discussed, with the Minister's repeated denial, the Minister for Finance in his budget statement, and later in reply to questions I posed to him here after the budget speech, stated that they were going to Brussels immediately to seek protection for the footwear industry under Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession.  I wonder whether any Minister in the Government knows what another Minister is thinking or what he is doing.  I think it is an absolute scandal that many footwear workers are now unemployed with, in many instances, the employment gone forever, and for no other reason but that the Government were unable to make up their minds about what to do.  They were finally compelled to do exactly what we on this side of the House told them could and should be done many months ago.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the redundancy money, the unemployment benefit and the pay-related benefit which these workers will now get is very poor compensation to them for the loss of their jobs.  The factory in Drogheda to which I referred on the Private Members' Motion has now gone into liquidation with the loss of 170 jobs and it need not have gone into liquidation had the Government done what we advised them to do long ago and which they are now trying to do and, as far as I can see from the reports in the papers and reports on television, without any great success. For obvious reasons, the Commission recognises that they are not really in earnest in what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Last night I listened to a report on Telefís Éireann during a newscast in which it was stated that the Commission in Brussels was now moving to <Col N="1339" /> protect the footwear industry in Ireland. From the earlier part of the news report, I had expected great things and I listened carefully and hopefully to see what facts would emanate from the Commission.  I was shocked to find that all that was involved was that the 10 per cent tariff reduction which took place on 1st July, 1975, on goods entering this country from Britain in accordance with the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement was being replaced by the Commission when the British refused to agree to do so.</P>
    <P>In case anyone should be misled into believing this was of any help to the footwear industry, which is in a critical condition, I have only to state that the position after the Commission reimposed the 10 per cent would be exactly the same as it was up to June 30th, 1975.  We are all aware of the fact that the industry was in severe straits prior to 30th June, and that the footwear factories which closed down and were on short time closed down prior to June 30th.  So while we may be thankful for small mercies, the fact is that what the Commission have done to date is useless.  The fact is that the Commission will do little or nothing while this Government are in power.  They are well aware of the attitude of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They know from Dáil debates on this particular subject and on kindred subjects that they will be under no pressure from him if they do not take any further steps to protect the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>I strongly protest against the attitude of the Government and the Minister in relation to an industry which has grown up over the past 40 years, was developed under a Fianna Fáil Government to the extent it has developed, and has given worth-while and steady employment to so many people in this country and particularly in my constituency.  In my view, full pressure under Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession should be brought to bear on the Commission in Brussels to save at least what is left of the industry and to preserve the skills built up over the years and, not only that, but to give us an opportunity, if there <Col N="1340" /> is still an opportunity, to reopen some of the footwear factories which have gone out of production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had, perhaps, the most dispirited budget debate ever in the history of the Dáil.  I suppose it is not surprising, because the truth is that the Opposition could not oppose the Government's fundamentally sound approach to the serious economic problems facing the State.  The most grievous problems are agreed. They are inflation and unemployment. These are also the most serious problems facing the whole world at present.  Even today in Brussels, while I am speaking, my colleagues, the Finance Minister of Europe are meeting to consider the present economic position in Europe, where the twin problems of unemployment and inflation are recognised as being at the most serious levels since the 1930s. <Col N="1341" /> There is agreement that the situation on the unemployment front is unlikely to improve for some time to come, and may get worse.</P>
      <P>There is also agreement, there and elsewhere among informed people, that the problem of unemployment will be easier to solve if the rate of inflation is brought down.  If any society, including our own, deludes itself into believing it can carry on with a high rate of inflation, it will have to suffer a high rate of unemployment. As we in Government said more than a year ago, there is no point in people in Ireland getting cross with each other because the world situation is now so abominable. No group in our society, whether they are in insecure or secure employment, can obtain any special improvement in their position except at the expense of their fellow workers and their own neighbours in this community.</P>
      <P>In my budget statement on behalf of the Government, we indicated a number of proposals which, if implemented by the Government, would have the effect of reducing the rate of inflation by about four points.  The Government wish to proceed with that programme.  It is clear from the public reaction to the Government's budget that there is a national desire that the Government would succeed in that programme.  There is a national will to accept whatever sacrifices have to be made to bring about that reduction in inflation.  The Government are determined that no sector of our community will be permitted to frustrate the overwhelming national desire to bring about a reduction in the rate of inflation and, consequently, a reduction in the number unemployed which will result if we increase our competitiveness by reducing inflation.</P>
      <P>There is also a public understanding that the cost of Government and the cost of meeting the pay of every person employed in the public interest by Government are rising to levels which our society is not in a position to pay for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation, the Government will have to meet this problem head <Col N="1342" /> on.  It is pointless for any group in our community to demand&mdash;and many people do demand&mdash;that the Government should pay special increases to people in secure employment at the expense of the general body of tax-payers who are the providers of the money for paying them.  Many of the people who provide these pay packets are in insecure employment themselves or have been disemployed or have suffered drops in their incomes because of the economic difficulties facing the country.  If there is not an acceptance by our people of the very obvious facts of economic life then our present difficulties will be multiplied.</P>
    <P>The principal problem we have is to translate the inherent common sense of the individual Irishman into collective wisdom.  It is a challenge for a democratic Government to do this, and this Government have taken up that challenge.  We have been faulted because the Government failed forcibly to administer unpleasant medicine in the budget.  There seems among some people to be a conviction that medicine can be no good unless it tastes unpleasant.  In fact most effective medicines today are quite pleasant to taste.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the Government's proposals which involves any unfair sacrifice, any long-term disadvantage for our people.  The Government are asking for moderation, for reasonableness; they are asking people in protected employment to have regard to the plight of many of their neighbours who are not in such secure employment and who have suffered severely as a result of the world economic recession.  I believe that our community expects that there will be a positive response to the Government's proposals, and we are therefore looking forward to having worth-while meaningful discussions with the social partners so that we may achieve by agreement, what many other countries have achieved by agreement.  We do not want Ireland to be labelled as the one unreasonable country in Europe because of our failure to reach agreement as to how to achieve our own salvation.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the <Col N="1343" /> neighbouring island, subsequent to the introduction of our Government's budgetary measures, the Government there proposed measures, which on the face of it might appear to be even more restrictive than the proposals of this Government.  Let us study the position there.  The position in Britain is that already increases in incomes of 30 and 40 per cent and more have been demanded and given to certain sectors.  The Government there are now proposing that any further increases above 10 per cent will not be granted.  Increases of that magnitude have not been a feature in Ireland in 1975.  So Government measures here do not need to be as restrictive as those that are being imposed in Britain. Their situation has got more out of hand than the Irish situation did before we introduced supplementary budget proposals.  That does not say that there is any room whatsoever for increases beyond what the Government have already suggested and what are suggested in the national wage agreement.  When this agreement was under negotiation, it was not anticipated that the Government would take measures of their own to bring about a reduction in the consumer price index.  The Government are now taking those steps to bring about that reduction and are asking very reasonably in return that there should be an adjustment, and reductions, in income expectations to reflect the reduction in the consumer price index.</P>
    <P>On three occasions in my budget statement I referred to the desirability of excluding as a basis for seeking wage increases that element in the consumer price index which reflected necessary taxation on luxuries.  That was first put to the people in the Government's White Paper last November in &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; and it has been enunciated by me on several occasions since then. On three occasions in my budget statement I made reference to it.</P>
    <P>It is very interesting to note that nobody in the course of the budget debate in this House challenged that proposition.  Surely we must stop <Col N="1344" /> pussyfooting on this point?  Nobody wants to say in public or private that the Government are wrong to say that in times of economic difficulty taxes on luxuries should be excluded from calculation of the consumer price index for wage indexation purposes. The truth is that no reasonable person could so suggest.  Before the previous budget in January, I received deputations from all the social partners and various organisations of one kind or another and I put to them the simple question: &ldquo;If taxation had to be increased to meet necessary Government outlay, should the Government increase income tax or should the Government increase tax on non-essentials?&rdquo;  Every deputation said: &ldquo;Increase the tax on non-essentials.&rdquo; Since then many of the organisations which gave that advice to me and pleaded with the Government to do that, many of the media commentators who said the Government were right to do that, have insisted that total compensation be given in income increases for those taxation increases on luxuries which they regarded as justifiable and necessary in the public interest.  Other countries have excluded such items from their cost-of-living index for wage purposes.  We are still pussyfooting on this.  It is time it stopped.</P>
    <P>Some people want to run away from the unpopularity which they think would be associated with an endorsement of that viewpoint.  It is high time that we as a community had the honesty and the decency to accept taxation on non-essentials without compensatory income increases to pay for the support necessary for the less privileged in our community.  If people are unwilling to meet the tax bill, to meet the taxation on income, if they are unwilling, as some people are, to pay taxation through charges on their capital accumulations, if they are unwilling to pay any other form of tax, how on earth can they expect Government to provide for the less privileged in our community?  It cannot be done.  The sooner that simple fact of life is honestly and decently faced the sooner can we exclude from the consumer price index for wage <Col N="1345" /> increase purposes that element of taxation on luxuries.  I am stressing this once again with complete personal conviction, and also on behalf of the Government, because we are convinced that it is wrong for our society to be seeking total compensation for taxation which is intended to transfer some money from the better-off to the less well-off.  If society seeks total compensation for that, there is no good, from the social or moral point of view, in imposing taxation on luxuries.  People ought to be prepared to accept that it is the decent thing to do and I think most people regard it as the decent thing to do. Until effect is given to that readiness to pay tax on luxuries without compensation, we will continue at budget time to give hypocritical approval to taxation on luxuries and within a matter of weeks will seek total compensation for the alleged sacrifices. We must accept taxes on non-essentials without compensation in the national interest and have regard to the necessitous circumstances in which the less well-off members of our community are forced to exist.</P>
    <P>The Government's measures to reduce living costs by four per cent will not prevent living costs rising, certainly will not prevent the consumer price index rising, for other reasons. The principal ingredient in price rises in Ireland in 1975 is income.  There is no use in anybody blowing off indignantly about that truth.  It happens to be the truth.  Whether people are blameworthy or otherwise, you can leave aside for the moment.  Our inflation this year is attributable to the extent of 80 per cent to income increases. Therefore, if the curbing of inflation is an agreed national goal we must choose the weapon which can most effectively bring about that reduction. That method is curtailment of our own income demands.  It is as simple as that.  Other countries are not going to reduce our rate of inflation for us.  There may be some fall off in the rate of increase of inflation arising out of imported inflation because the prices of imported commodities are not increasing in 1975 at the atrocious rate at which they increased in 1974, <Col N="1346" /> but we have no control over that element in the future any more than we had in the past.  All we can say is that as of 1975 it is not going to be as significant as it was in the past.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have made the point that reductions in the prices of electricity and town gas, due to the zero rating for VAT purposes on electricity and town gas from 1st July, in other words since the introduction of a 12½ per cent subsidy, have been offset by further increases.  The only recent increases in these prices was an increase of 14 per cent on the total of ESB bills.  That 14 per cent increase in ESB bills was due primarily to increased labour costs.  I want to repeat that, because if people are waxing indignant about increased prices they should look to the cause of the increased prices.  If they want to be indignant they must be equally indignant about the cause, because if the result is an inevitable consequence of the cause then it is time we as a community and we individually attacked the cause.  The primary reason for the increase in the price of electricity by 14 per cent was labour costs.  That increase was applied to the May-June billing period, that is, for electricity which was consumed in the May-June period, before the Government's budget measures took effect.  Bills which are being issued at present cover that period, May and June, but any increases that flow as a consequence are pre-budget and not post-budget. The budget concessions will be reflected in future accounts.</P>
    <P>I want to refute the charge that the surcharge of 10 per cent of the standard and higher rates of income tax for 1975-76 is a retrospective charge. This is not so.  The tax liability for 1975-76 is a current liability, and any adjustment of the taxation during the current year is not retrospection.  As the country and the House are well aware, the annual budget, until this year, was introduced in May and taxation proposals which affected income tax were operative from the commencement of the tax year, 6th April.</P>
    <P>Consequently, even though the budget tended to be introduced in May, <Col N="1347" /> it was invariably the following July before the Finance Bill was passed. The July Finance Bill will be on all fours with the experience and practice of previous years.  Until 1975, with the introduction of a January budget, the legislation fixing tax liability for a year was not passed until three months of a tax year had expired.  It was never previously argued that any increase in liability in such circumstances amounted to a retrospective charge.</P>
    <P>The present surcharge will be collected from July onwards.  But for the structure of the income tax system, it might have been expressed as a special surcharge on income arising from 1st July onwards.  Since, however, the surcharge is part and parcel of the income tax code it must be fitted into the existing scheme of income taxation under which tax is charged for the year of assessment in respect of a year's income.  Consequently the addition to the 1975-76 tax liability must be super-imposed on the income tax charge for the year as a whole, which means it is measured by reference to the income for the year.  The tax is expressed as a surcharge for the year but it will be collected from the period of July onwards.</P>
    <P>The point has been made very wrongly that the imposition of the 10 per cent surcharge is inequitable because it has been alleged that it does not take into account the personal circumstances of the taxpayer. Some Deputy asserted that it took no account of whether or not the taxpayer was married or had children or other dependants.  I want to give some figures which will clearly refute that stupid allegation.  If we take any particular level of income and the following families' situations you will find that there is a very distinct difference in the amount of tax that will have to be paid.  I will give, first of all, the income figures, then the tax payable by a single person, then the tax payable by a married person with no children, and then the tax payable by a married person with three children, and finally a married person with five children.  If we take the total income at £2,500, the additional taxation <Col N="1348" /> payable as a result of the 10 per cent surcharge would be: for a single person £13.12; for a married person £1.05; for a married person with three children, nothing, for the married person with five children, nothing.  If we take an income of £3,000, the 10 per cent additional charge will mean additional taxation for the single person of £30.62, a married person £18.55, a married person with three children, nothing, and a married person with five children nothing.  Taking a total income of £5,000 the additional tax payable as a result of the 10 per cent surcharge by a single person would be £101.37, a married person with no children, £88.55, a married person with three children, £64.40, and a married person with five children, £48.30.  These figures entirely refute the allegation that the surcharge does not take into account the different number of dependants of different taxpayers.  May I also point out that these figures assume that a taxpayer has no other allowances or is not entitled to any other tax free deductions? If a taxpayer has, for instance, mortgage obligations, is paying interest on borrowed money or has insurance policies, other allowances would be made and accordingly the tax liability would be less.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fact that the 35 per cent rate of income tax will continue to apply to companies.  He suggested that an individual receiving dividends would pay tax in respect of them at the increased rates of tax whereas if he set up an investment company to receive the dividends the company would be charged the 35 per cent rate only.  Companies were deliberately excluded from the surcharge as a further contribution by the Government to arresting the downward trends in production and employment. In the January budget this year, notwithstanding very severe financial constraints, the Government gave very generous reliefs to companies to assist them in their liquidity problems, and in order to enable them to maintain employment.  These tax concessions to companies are costing about <Col N="1349" /> £16 million this year.  It would clearly have been contrary to the Government's policy as enunciated in January, having given tax concessions to companies, then to increase taxes on companies in June.  That is the reason why the Government very sensibly excluded companies from the surcharge. We are satisfied that this will not encourage people to set up investment companies to avoid the surcharge on their dividend income, since the taking of such a step could attract liability under the wealth tax.  This is a very quick benefit to flow from the Government's wealth tax proposals. It shows the necessity in modern society of having a number of taxes &mdash;particularly of taxing capital as well as income.  Many of the tax avoidance practices in this country in the past were able to operate because we left so many loopholes.  But the loopholes are being closed by the Government and that is one of the principal reasons underlying much of the opposition to the Government's capital taxation proposals.</P>
    <P>Under the wealth tax provisions, those investment companies will be liable at a rate of 1 per cent on their total assets.  Assuming a yield of 10 per cent, this would be equivalent to 10 per cent of income.  Such companies would not receive the benefit of the exemption threshold of £100,000 which applies in the case of a married couple under the wealth tax.  The indications are that rather than such investment companies being formed they are now being liquidated, no doubt in anticipation of the application of these provisions.  It is extremely unlikely that they would be set up now so as to avoid an additional income charge of 3.5 per cent on dividends and incur wealth tax at an effective rate of 10 per cent.  It must also be remembered that where an investment company distributes dividends to its shareholders the surtax would, in any event, be payable on such dividends.  Deputy O'Malley's remarks are in his own tradition of making mischievous and groundless suggestions.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the surcharge will be paid by about a third of the <Col N="1350" /> total number of individual taxpayers. We have no particular pleasure in having to impose this surcharge.  It does not mean that the Government feel that income tax levels are not high enough.  On the contrary, since we entered into Government two-anda-half years' ago we have substantially reduced the burden of income tax.  It is interesting to note that notwithstanding this surcharge in the year 1975-76 many taxpayers will pay on their particular incomes less income tax than they would have had to pay on the same income in 1974-75.  That is as a consequence of the substantial increases in the personal income tax allowances which the Government have given for two years in succession.</P>
    <P>For a single person, assuming that single person has no deductions available to him other than the personal allowance, he will not be liable to the surcharge unless his total income exceeds £2,125.  A married person, without dependants, will not be liable to the surcharge unless his total income exceeds £2,470.  A married person with three children will not be liable to the surcharge unless his total income exceeds £3,160.</P>
    <P>In connection with the reduction in the higher rate of income tax provided by section 11 of the Finance Act, 1975, I remarked in the course of my statement on the Finance Bill that it was necessary, in order to keep the tax charge on people in the top bracket of a level not significantly worse than that operating in Britain.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that it was necessary for two reasons, the first being to avoid the brain drain from Ireland and to encourage the return of many Irish nationals who had gone to work elsewhere.  I also pointed out that the imposition of too heavy a charge on the upper levels of income would have the effect of forcing employers to increase such incomes by very substantial gross amounts in order to provide even a modest net increase.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw people's attention to this very significant fact that notwithstanding that we have been obliged, because of temporary difficulties, <Col N="1351" /> to increase the upper tax rates by the 10 per cent temporary surcharge, the position of most income tax earners in 1975-76 will be dramatically more favourable than it was for them in the year 1973-74.  Indeed, more than in all the years before we came to power, when so little was done for them or anybody else because the personal income tax allowances were left untouched for 11 years and when increased were only increased by derisive amounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will save the Deputy the embarrassment.  Deputies Colley and Haughey suggested, quite wrongly, that as a result of the Government's increased borrowing from commercial banks the private sector would be deprived of much needed credit.  I can only think that they either make that allegation knowing it to be a terminological inexactitude or else they do not bother to read the financial journals or follow what is happening in the banking world.</P>
      <P>All the banks, associated banks, commercial banks and Central Banks, were at pains, for some time past, to point out that the private sector was not availing of the credit that was there to be taken up.  This is a phenomenon in all European countries at present and also in the United States of America.  It is not surprising, when industry is working below capacity&mdash;it is working below capacity in many countries now to the extent of about 30 per cent&mdash;that people are not borrowing for increased investment purposes or to increase capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unlikely that increased borrowing on a significant scale will take place until the present recession is seen to be on the way out.  But without doubt when the recession is <Col N="1352" /> overcome there will be an increased demand for private credit.  It is estimated that the banks will take up about £100 million of Government paper in 1975 in order to maintain their own liquidity ratios in line with the growth in their own resources. This is in accordance with normal practice.  The intervention agency financing of £58 million by the banking system was arranged at the beginning of the year and it was taken into account by the Central Bank in determining its monetary policy.</P>
    <P>Intervention financing is short term. It is a self-liquidating credit of a type normally provided by the banks.  The additional £38 million which is now being sought for this purpose, will not significantly affect the availability to the private sector for credit, particularly at present when the demand of the private sector credit is so slight. The monetary policy guidelines issued by the Central Bank earlier this year envisaged a significant increase in lending to the private sector of the economy, somewhat, indeed, in excess of the overall rate of credit expansion.</P>
    <P>The practical situation at present, however, is that the banks are considerably underlent, due to the lack of demand about which I have been talking.  There is no shortage of credit, and the requirements of the private sector can be met now and can be met if there is a revival in demand. The provision of housing finance by the banks together with a new Government subsidised export credit to industry and intervention finance for agricultural produce, will all help to stimulate economic activity in the private sector and contribute to a recovery in demand and in the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the banks for the responsible way in which they are meeting the difficult circumstances of our economy.  I have read, as we all have, much illinformed criticism of the Irish banking system, but nationalisation of the banking system and the financial institutions is not one of this Government's policies and will not be contemplated by this Government because <Col N="1353" /> the banking system serves this country well.  It is attuned to our needs.  It works in co-operation with the Central Bank.  The Central Bank ensures that the economic objectives of Governments in this country are helped by the operations of the banking system.  The banking system is substantially in private hands but the directors of our banks are as interested in the welfare of the economy of this country as are the Government and any Member of this House, as is any extreme doctrinaire economist of any hue.</P>

      <P>The bankers are interested in investing, to good advantage, the money placed with them by depositors.  They need to make profits to cover not merely their own costs but also to counter the problems experienced with the high rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>The profits which are earned by banks in Ireland are not out of line with the profits earned by banking systems elsewhere.  Some years ago, a report, which was bespoken by an independent authority, not the banks themselves, pointed out that the profitability of Irish banks was somewhat less than existed in many comparable countries.  It is necessary that our banks should be well run, and they are well run.  The authority of the Central Bank is established by law.  It works in consultation with the Department of Finance and the banking system to ensure that the best banking policies and practices are observed. We should be happy that the banking situation in Ireland is so healthy and that the banks are serving the best interests of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are continuous consultations between the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.

These discussions will continue in the future as in the past and the budget proposals and their implications for financial and monetary policies will, of course, be relevant to those discussions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the circumstances under which the President of the Council of Ministers of the European Community may attend a meeting of the Council of Ministers of Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Treaty Establishing a Single Council and a Single Commission of the European Communities done at Brussels on 8th April, 1965 there is only one Council of the European Communities.  That council, however, may, and does, meet in different formations. Thus, for example, when the council meets to discuss such specialised matters as the Community's agricultural policy it is the practice for such council meetings to be attended by Ministers for Agriculture. Similarly when the council wishes to consider financial matters the council meetings are attended by Ministers for Finance.  A particular council meeting may, indeed, also involve the simultaneous attendance of more than one Minister in each national delegation if the agenda is such as to require this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While generally meetings of the council in its various formations take place at different times and on different days, there is, of course, nothing in either the treaties or in the provisional rules of procedure of the council which would prevent them taking place concurrently.  Thus in the Council of the Communities it is, for example, possible to have Ministers for Agriculture considering agricultural matters, while at the same time Ministers for Foreign Affairs are simultaneously, but separately, discussing other Community matters either in the immediate vicinity or elsewhere.  In such circumstances where the taking of a decision by the Foreign Ministers is dependent on the outcome of a prior decision by the Ministers for Agriculture it would be normal, indeed logical, for the Ministers <Col N="1356" /> for Foreign Affairs or one of their number chosen for the task, to attend the meeting of the Ministers for Agriculture so as to be informed of or to discuss with them the state of the deliberations of these latter on the matter in question.  In reply to the Deputy's question, therefore, I would say that there are no hard-and-fast rules governing the circumstance for attendance such as the Deputy has referred to.  Rather, such attendance is governed by practical considerations, by the need to ensure the good order and efficient and speedy functioning of the Community and by the necessity of ensuring at all times that there is cohesion in the work of the council in its different formations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recent occasion which appears to have given rise to the Deputy's question, I should, perhaps, add that following the direct contact thus established on 24th June between the council in its two formations, the matter in respect of which the council in its formation as Ministers for Foreign Affairs had unanimously requested me to attend the council in its formation as Ministers for Agriculture, namely a decision in respect of internal Community agricultural policy which was necessary as a precondition of further progress with the Community's overall Mediterranean approach, was satisfactorily settled later that day, thus clearing the way for a revised mandate for Community negotiations with the Maghreb countries and the full implementation of the EEC-Israel Agreement.  This result was an important achievement of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say in his final phrase that this was the result of the Irish presence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Irish Presidency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry. Accepting what the Minister said in regard to the institution of the council which he so fully outlined, is he aware of the fact that, as reported, the reactions of two of the Agriculture Ministers were not favourable to <Col N="1357" /> the intervention of the Minister as President of the Council at the meeting of the Ministers for Agriculture? Would he like to comment on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The reactions of three of the Ministers for Agriculture reflected an unfavourable view of the action of the Council of Foreign Ministers in regard to the initiation of Mediterranean policy. None of their remarks was directed towards my presence at the council, but these natural and spontaneous reactions did not prevent the council on mature reflection from taking the necessary action and enabling us, therefore, jointly to move ahead with the Mediterranean policy.  The Deputy should not in cases like this be unduly misled by newspaper reports necessarily filed from Brussels before the conclusion of the events which they relate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that not being as close to events as he has been for some considerable time past, I must rely on newspaper reports.  Could I ask the Minister if, in fact, any notice has been given to the Ministers for Agriculture in advance of the intention of the Minister as President to attend or was any request made by the Council of Foreign Ministers for the facility of attending and, if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think the Deputy misunderstands the close and informal relationship which exists between the council in its different formations. In fact, during the preliminary discussions at our meeting of Foreign Ministers, this question arose and all the members present requested that I should adjourn the meeting and go downstairs to a meeting of the Ministers for Agriculture and explain the importance we attached to a favourable concrete decision on this matter, so that the Ministers for Agriculture would understand the reasons for our concern about this matter.  I naturally followed the instructions given to me unanimously by my council and attended the other meeting as rapidly as possible with a view to getting back to continue the meeting of our own council which <Col N="1358" /> stood adjourned during this, but this is normal informal procedure in cases like this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  The Deputy does not understand the relations between the councils and any reports that any Minister criticised my intervention are factually incorrect, directed against the Ministers for Foreign Affairs for launching on policies the price of which, they said, had to be paid by them, showing, I thought, a certain misunderstanding of the nature of Cabinet responsibility, both domestically and collectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the proven record in inter-community relations and the development of the community <Col N="1359" /> of Ballymurphy <i>in situ</i> of one of the protagonists in the dispute in that area which was widely reported, would the Minister not think of dropping a word into an influential ear or two in the hope that this dispute which has an effect on the community might be settled?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that as the Arab-Israeli disputes were known to the Minister, he might know about this dispute in this country.  As I am not allowed to use the names of people not in the House, may I ask the Minister if he is aware of a dispute in Ballymurphy which is disrupting efforts at inter-community development, community development and co-operative development in that part of the city of Belfast?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My difficulty is that the Deputy is unable to specify what he is talking about and I, therefore, find it difficult to reply.  If the Deputy is specific, I shall reply.  There are all kinds of problems and all kinds of areas in Northern Ireland and I cannot answer a question in generalised terms.

      <P>The fishing vessels of Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Netherlands and Spain are permitted under statutory order to fish for specified species of fish in certain defined areas in the six to 12-mile belt of the exclusive fishery limits of the State. <Col N="1364" /> These orders were made pursuant to the London Fisheries Convention, 1964 in which it was agreed that contracting parties might extend their exclusive fisheries to 12 miles subject <i>inter alia</i> to rights in the six to 12-mile belt in favour of those who had traditionally fished those areas.  In addition, under the terms of this country's accession to the European Economic Community fishing boats registered in member States may fish in the six to 12-mile belt of the exclusive fishery limits of the State for (i) all species of fish in the area between Cork Harbour and Carnsore Point, County Wexford and (ii) all species except shellfish in the area between Carnsore Point and Carlingford Lough, County Louth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  Under existing regulations and practice, as they have been in force for many years, it is not possible for the State to provide a kiosk in such an area without a post office, except under the guarantee system from a local authority or other such body, of which I think the Deputy is aware.  I am not fully happy about the existing regulations and practice about the provision of kiosks <Col N="1366" /> in rural areas.  I have the question under study at the moment of whether certain changes can be made in this practice leading to economies in the public service and, I would hope also, to greater possibility of satisfaction for the people in rural areas.</P>

My Department are anxious to be fair both to people in rural areas and, of course, to those urban areas where, in rapidly expanding suburbs, the provision of kiosks is a matter of concern and also, of course, a costly matter because of the vandalism question. I am looking very carefully at the whole thing and I am very anxious to consider representations from Deputies.  If they can show me they have reason to believe the rural areas are discriminated against in any way in this area, I will certainly check it.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  The position at Tullamore, where there are 147 applicants on the waiting list, is that there are 1,100 lines in the automatic exchange.  Because of congestion, 200 are unlikely to become available until an auxilary exchange of 1,000 lines is brought into service about mid-1977. Interim relief is being provided by a mobile exchange which is expected to be ready by early 1976 giving 200 extra lines.  Only high priority orders are being met at present because of the small number of terminations available.  It is hoped to clear the 1973 and some of the 1974 orders in the third quarter of 1976 as a result of the interim relief, and to cater for priority demand up to mid-1977.  My Department are concerned about the situation not only in Tullamore but in other areas.</P>

      <P>No, it is not the actual position.  The waiting list is very considerable but at the moment it is tending to round off.  Owing in part to the economic situation, the number of new applications is not increasing, whereas the rate of connections is increasing and has increased and the rate of the increase <Col N="1373" /> is being maintained.  For example, in the two years 1971 and 1972 the total number of connections was 46,000 and in the combined years 1973-74 it was 61,000.  My Department are doing their job in increasing the rate of connections as fast as they can and the tendency will be to bring down the waiting list, which is 40,000 now as against 41,000 at the turn of the year. The reasons for this are not entirely satisfactory in that we would want more people to be applying, but what is satisfactory is the steady stepping up of the connections at the rate of 20 per cent.  My Department have done well in this matter.  The Government have been proved right to provide, in very difficult conditions, increased capital for telephone development. For the benefit of Deputy Timmons who is not here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have had for some time.  The Deputy's supplementary is very important and people will want to know the answer.  In general, it takes about two-and-a-half years before the full effects either of cuts or expansions of capital provision are felt.  We have felt and still are feeling the effects of the capital crux made in 1971 of which I am sure Deputy Haughey did not approve.  We have not yet felt the full effects of the stepping up of capital commitment which began, I must say, to be fair, in 1972 and was continued in 1973 up to the present.  There are bottlenecks of all kinds in connection with both availability of skilled personnel, equipment, and so on.  There are contractors' slippages, and so on. It is a vast programme and the Deputy will be well aware that there are difficulties in putting that through but I personally think that my Department <Col N="1375" /> have a right to be proud of a 20 per cent increase in the rate of connections.  O.K.  It would be better if it was 30 per cent or 40 per cent. We hope we will continue improving it.</P>

The consultants sought information from some 7,000 potential computer users.  They forecast, <i>inter alia</i>, that the number of data transmission units in Ireland would increase over ten-fold between 1972 and 1985.  A committee of the countries concerned intends to have the results of the study reviewed and the material brought up to date periodically.</P>

I agreed to take soundings to find out as far as I can what the wishes of the people are in this matter, and especially the wishes of the people in the singlechannel area who are most affected. I propose to do that during the summer and I hope to be able to report more fully to the Dáil in this matter in the contest of the Broadcasting Bill.</P>

        <i>Cavan)</i>: Before we disposed of the amendments to section 6 and we were dealing with the section, which is the one which taxes private non-trading companies, it was accepted by the House that, generally speaking, private non-trading companies are devices for tax avoidance. I believe the House also accepted, <Col N="1391" /> again generally speaking, that it was proper to treat them, as they are being treated by section 6.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I got the impression that that was generally accepted.  This type of non-trading private company has mushroomed over the years.  For example, before 1950 there were less than 200 such companies registered in the country and now the number has increased to approximately 2,500.  It was, however, conceded in the course of the debate that there are some genuine <i>bona fide</i> non-trading private companies which are used by trading companies as holding companies and that sort of thing.  I conceded that the section as drafted did not provide for them but was so embracing that it included them but the amendment which I moved, and which the House accepted, excludes from the provisions of the section private non-trading companies which are controlled, either directly or as part of a series, by bodies corporate which are trading companies.</P>
      <P>I submit to the House that that excluded any problem that the section had created.  In the course of the discussion Deputy Colley drew attention to the fact that a foreign person or persons might establish an industry here and hold shares in that industry, that such a person or persons might then form a private non-trading company to hold those shares and that in such an event the private non-trading company would be taxed as an entity and would not have any threshold.  That was substantially the point made by Deputy Colley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe this point has any practical effect because the vast majority of the foreign companies that are established here are established by foreign bodies corporate and the shares are held by these foreign bodies corporate and the question <Col N="1392" /> would not arise.  I pointed out that in regard to the United States of America the publication of the Industrial Development Authority shows that out of approximately 120 companies established in this country by United States concerns practically all of them are held by United States companies and, therefore, the problem mentioned by Deputy Colley would not arise.</P>
    <P>I am speaking of approximate figures but out of the 120 companies there is one about which there is some doubt as to whether it is a body corporate or an individual.  That shows, as far as the United States is concerned, that there is no problem.  If shares are held here by individuals the position has improved substantially in regard to them with the abolition of death duties.</P>
    <P>In regard to European countries it may be that some companies or industries, which are established here by European interests, may be held by individuals but the problem there will cease to be a problem in most cases with the relief of double taxation. Deputy de Valera put forward the point that each of these private non-trading companies should be taken on its merits.  Somebody put forward the point that non-trading companies owned by foreign individuals should be exempt.  If we were to do that we would be rightly accused of discrimination against Irish interests and we could not, and would not, do that.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy de Valera made the case that each private non-trading company should be looked at by the Revenue Commissioners on its merits and investigated and vetted with a view to seeing if it should be treated as an entity or if it should have certain exemptions and privileges which we are not too clear about.  I put forward the case that that is simply not practical because it would entail a vast amount of work.  These companies are mushrooming, as I have shown, and <Col N="1393" /> would be likely to continue to do so if they were encouraged in this way.  The Revenue Commissioners would then have to deal with each one of them and there would be endless work and time involved and for the low rate of tax involved it would not be practical. That was the case put forward in ease of the individual, so to speak.  Deputy Colley also put forward the case that it might lead to avoidance by people putting their wealth into a private non-trading company and then giving control of that private non-trading company to a trading company and in that way they would be exempt from wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would achieve the thresholds anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The individuals would achieve the threshold.  If they were very wealthy people it would not matter because they would already be paying the tax, but I do not think that that is likely, first of all, because they would be putting personal wealth into the trading company and would be putting it at risk.  I do not think that is likely to happen in view of what I said earlier, that they could convert their trading company into a private non-trading company.  There are more than two ways of doing this.  My advisers have gone into it very fully and the method provided for in the section as amended seems to me to be the only workable and practical way of operating this wealth tax in regard to the private non-trading companies.  I am quite satisfied that that is so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley and others have a duty to look at it and come up with another view, with another suggestion, but I am satisfied that the method provided for in the section as amended is the only workable way.  I concede, too, that as time goes on, there can be teething troubles, that some hardships may appear, some loopholes may appear, but there is at least one Finance Bill introduced every year and as has been the practice in the past, these hardships and loopholes in the measure can be corrected as required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some significance <Col N="1394" /> that the Minister again referred to the fact that the great bulk of the private non-trading companies affected by this generally are taken to be the ones that have been set up with the purpose of tax avoidance.  He also said that the great bulk of investment in this country, industrial investment from the United States, was in the form he described &ldquo;held by a trading company in the United States and therefore would not be affected&rdquo;. I think it significant for the reason that as Deputy de Valera said before we adjourned, because there is a tendency on the part of the Minister and on the part of the Minister for Finance also when dealing with this legislation and with the capital gains tax legislation to speak in this way, that if there are only a relatively small number of people adversely affected, that is too bad.  I do not think that is good enough.  I think there is an obligation on the Minister when he is introducing legislation of this kind to try to devise a method that will not adversely affect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I did not concede that.  I said that on the overall package if anybody was adversely affected, it would be more than offset taking into consideration the death duties relief, that nobody would be adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. In fact, we propose to demonstrate that there are people who are adversely affected by this who should not be adversely affected.  What I am saying is that in those circumstances there is an obligation on the Minister and on the Government to devise a method by which that adverse affect will not come about.  It is not a sufficient answer to say: &ldquo;Well, it is too bad, but we cannot do anything about it.&rdquo;  There is an obligation on the Government to do something about it. There are different ways of approaching this; none may be absolutely perfect, but at least an effort should be made to do something positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted also that the Minister referred at one stage, when it suited him, to the benefits of double taxation agreements but he did not refer to the <Col N="1395" /> benefits of double taxation agreements when he was talking about the nonliability for death duties in future in the case of the kind of people we were discussing.  In many of those cases, as a result of double taxation agreements, in fact, they were not going to be liable for death duties or if they were, it would be for a very small amount.  Having paid tax in their own countries, they would then be claiming credit in this country, so that the practical effect for these people is as I have outlined.  The fact is that there could be relief which would exceed the rate here, but even where there is not, the amount of death duties for which they would have been liable would certainly be smaller than is implied in the Minister's statement that there is now no liability for death duty.</P>
    <P>However, the real issue involved in this section is different.  Deputy de Valera put forward a very closely reasoned argument and I can go a long way with what he said, but I think he went on a little further than I would be prepared to go.  I want to put it to the Minister that it is wrong in principle to tax private non-trading companies under wealth tax without a threshold.  That approach is wrong. The right approach is to delete section 6 and to delete that portion of section 7 which refers to the shares in a private non-trading company.  We would then have the position in which we would tax each individual on the basis of his or her wealth.  There is only one possible good reason for not doing that&mdash;there are reasons for not doing it, but there is only one possible good reason for not doing it, that is, if it could be shown that to try to do that would enable people to manoeuvre their affairs in a private non-trading company so as to escape liability.</P>
    <P>I want to put it to the Minister the death duty code now contains such provision which could be built into this as to prevent that being done. There is widespread power in that code for the Revenue Commissioners to assume certain values, to impute values to particular individuals and <Col N="1396" /> so on.  We do not accept that it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to assess the value of each individual's shares in such a company, tax them accordingly, like any other individual, giving them the benefit of a threshold.  I suggest that that is the right way to do this and if it is done, it obviates all of the difficulties which can otherwise arise.</P>
    <P>I also want to suggest to the Minister that the original approach to the Bill was to tax all private non-trading companies and give them the benefits of no threshold.  That was the original approach.  Today we passed an amendment which qualifies that in certain limited circumstances, broadly those circumstances being where the private non-trading company is owned by a trading company.  The passing of that amendment is an acknowledgment of the fact that there are some private non-trading companies which should get the relief now being extended to those owned and controlled by a trading company.  I want to put it to the Minister that there are other private non-trading companies entitled to the relief which are not covered by the amendment.  I have before me a copy of a letter addressed to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach which sets out in considerable detail the position in regard to a particular private non-trading company.  It is not necessary to go into all the details, but it is quite clear from this that neither was there any avoidance or evasion of tax nor any attempt to do so and that the operation of the private non-trading company was done and has been done for 20 years, or more, because it was the most convenient and efficient way of handling the property concerned on behalf of members of the family&mdash;I think six in number.</P>
    <P>Under this section that private non-trading company is going to be taxed for wealth tax with no threshold. There has been a suggestion that it is easy enough to get over this by taking the property out of the private non-trading company.  I do not purport to stand over the precise details stated in this letter in that regard but, for the purpose of indicating the problems foreseen in this area, I tell the <Col N="1397" /> Minister the writer of the letter says that to transfer the assets to each of the individual shareholders would mean the transfer of the property by deed of assignment which would entail about £13,000 in legal costs and stamp duties and to transfer the stock exchange security would, perhaps, cost another £500.  Add to this the cost of liquidating the company and there is needless expenditure of approximately £14,000 plus at least one year's wealth tax of £2,500, or a total of £16,500 imposed on a family who, in justice and equity, should not have to pay anything at all.  There is a further element in so far as the transfer of the stock exchange security at present would entail a capital loss of about £10,000.  This loss could not be offset against capital gains which might be made by individual members of the family on a subsequent disposal of the same securities and, therefore, it will be seen that to divest the company of its assets is going to cost in the region of £25,000 to £26,000.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, the writer of this letter comes up with a suggestion not very dissimilar from that put forward by Deputy de Valera.  What is suggested is as follows:</P>
    <P>It should be possible to put in a clause to the effect that where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the shareholding structure reflects the true beneficial ownership of the equity and that the object of the company is not to evade tax liability, that they (the Revenue Commissioners) may issue an exemption certificate to the company and the wealth tax be levied on the respective shareholders by reference to their aggregate wealth and their individual thresholds.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recognise that is not far from the solution suggested by Deputy de Valera.  However, I do not go that far because I am not satisfied that the machinery available to the Revenue Commissioners is insufficient to handle the problem involved here. I believe the general approach in the section is producing problems in regard to cases where clearly relief should be given, but is not being given.  I would go further and say that <Col N="1398" /> the mere fact that there is a private non-trading company, which was established inescapably for the purpose of avoidance of tax, is not of itself sufficient to justify the approach in this section which takes away all thresholds and taxes from the first £1 of value of the assets.  I am suggesting that, for reasons of equity and for reasons of avoidance of anomalies, the right approach is to delete the section and the relevant portion of section 7 and treat private non-trading companies in the same way as trading companies: in other words, take each individual and assess him or her on the value of the respective assets and in that way you will avoid a great many of the anomalies that are now clear.  I am quite certain that further anomalies will come to light in due course.</P>
    <P>It is not very satisfactory to say we will see how it works and we will amend, if necessary, in due course. That may be sufficiently satisfactory from the point of view of the Minister and myself, because we are not directly and personally involved in this&mdash;at least the Minister said he was not personally concerned with wealth tax and I know I am not&mdash;but it is not sufficient for either of us to take this lofty attitude and say it can be fixed next year or the year after when the people concerned will be subjected to heavy losses.  I have given an indication of a particular case where they anticipate a loss of £25,000 to £26,000 in one year.  We cannot take a lofty attitude in regard to people like that who are, even on the Minister's own criteria, entitled to relief, and it is merely the structure of the section that prevents their getting it.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the amendment which has been made to the section providing a loophole whereby people, whom the Minister did not intend to have the benefit of thresholds, get it, the Minister can argue, as he did, that this is unlikely to happen.  My belief is that it is quite likely to happen.  It does provide a very convenient way of getting the benefit of the thresholds without suffering the losses that might be involved in liquidating the private <Col N="1399" /> non-trading company.  I want to make it clear that this whole situation should not arise if this matter were approached in the way I have indicated.  But if the Minister is going to maintain the stance that he has on section 6, then I draw his attention to what I consider to be the creation of a loophole.  If he is satisfied with the position so indicated, there is no more I can do.  I am not unduly concerned, once I have drawn attention to it, and in any event it should not and would not arise if the right approach were taken to this section.  I have outlined clearly enough to the Minister what I think the right approach is and why I think it is the right approach.  I have no doubt that the matter could be handled and that the Bill would be far more satisfactory if section 6 were deleted and also section 7 subsection (i) (j).</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is not possible to legislate for every possible case that may arise.  It was seen from the very time these proposals were considered that the private non-trading company would have to be treated as a special case and that was mentioned in the White Paper.  I have made my case and Deputy Colley has made his, but Deputy Colley now really calls a spade a spade because he says the way to deal with it is to delete section 6 and amend section 7 and treat the shares in the private non-trading company as part of the assets of the owners.</P>
      <P>That will not work and it would be utterly impossible to operate wealth tax if we were to do that.  Instead of the 2,500 private non-trading companies we have now we would have infinitely more.  It is conceded that it is impossible to identify them; it is impossible to police them; each family would have their wealth divided up into several non-trading companies.  The result would be that the Revenue Commissioners would be chasing about in a mist trying to sort these things out.</P>

Naturally, I will not identify that letter but it is true to say that an answer was sent to that letter and presumably the answer to that letter is in the hands of the person who gave Deputy Colley the letter.  He attributes a loss.  If there is any percentage of private non-trading companies which would inflict a hardship they can be put into liquidation without any trouble and without very much cost. A loss attributed in that letter to one year of £25,000 falls under the head of stamp duties.

While that may not have been agreed in so many words at the beginning of this debate on the definition <Col N="1402" /> section, it was not seriously disputed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To make it quite clear, the Minister is mistaken in thinking there was any such agreement from this side of the House.  Clearly, to me there is a major distinction from the point of view of the difficulties involved in dealing on the one hand with a discretionary trust and on the other with a private non-trading company. In the case of the discretionary trust you cannot pin down the assets to particular individuals.  In the case of a private non-trading company you can.  The shares are allotted.  An ascertainable proportion of the total assets is credited to particular individuals. It is quite a different problem.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that it is not possible to handle this problem.  The first two or three reasons put forward by the Minister just do not apply to what we were suggesting.  Of course, you cannot apply thresholds to the companies as such and we never suggested that.  I do not accept that it is not possible to police and handle this situation on the lines I suggested. Even if one were to accept that argument from the Minister, there is still the possibility of the suggestion put forward by Deputy de Valera, and also the suggestion put forward in this letter to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Just to refresh the Minister's memory it was to the effect that there be inserted a clause to the effect that, where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the shareholding structure reflects the true beneficial ownership of the equity, and that the object of the company is not to evade tax liability they, the Revenue Commissioners, may issue an exemption certificate to the company and the wealth tax be levied on the respective shareholders by reference to their aggregate wealth and their individual thresholds.  Deputy de Valera did not hear this one before but I am sure he is interested to hear the confirmation of his idea from quite another source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should give very serious consideration to something on these lines if he is <Col N="1403" /> not prepared to adopt the suggestion I put forward.  At least by the acceptance of something like this, he can insure that the genuine case which is not covered in the section can be covered and, since the whole thing is subject to the discretion and control of the Revenue Commissioners, there can be no question of evasion or avoidance involved in it.  I would strongly urge him to consider the insertion of a provision on these lines in order to ensure that the cases he cannot cover in the section as drafted will have some possibility of getting equity and justice under the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was completely unaware of this.  Time did not permit me this morning to think of a suitable formula for insertion.  The formula has been provided there and I would strongly support that plea.  I would ask the Minister also to take into account in that suggestion the element of part&mdash;I used the phrase &ldquo;in whole or in part&rdquo; and what I have said is on the record.  The Minister spoke about family and a single interest but there may also only be a part interest. Having regard to that, the last formula proposed by Deputy Colley seems to me to be unobjectionable and I would urge it on the Minister.</P>
      <P>My final point is short.  I take it that in subsection (3) the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; after paragraph (b) has the same effect as the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; and that when there is the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; all the other prior paragraphs are conjunctive.  The Minister will remember that when I referred to the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; he said it meant that all the paragraphs were alternative.  I take it that when the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; appears in a similar position all the paragraphs are conjunctive. I am referring to the last line of page 8 where</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" />&ldquo;company&rdquo; means a body corporate (wherever incorporated).</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;and&rdquo; occurs at the end of (b), not at the end of (a).  I take it that they are conjunctive in the same way as the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is disjunctive or alternative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9a.</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1), line 23, after &ldquo;used&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;solely&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the earlier part of the section exemption is given in respect of wealth tax in respect of a dwelling house and ancillary lands.  The section goes on to provide as follows:</P>
      <P>In the case of a dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house, part of which is used for the purposes of a trade, business, profession or vocation or is let, this paragraph shall not apply to the part used for those purposes or which is so let.</P>
      <P>What I am proposing is that the exemption provided in the earlier part of the section should not apply to a dwelling house or part of a dwelling house unless the portion that is used for trade, business, profession or vocation or is let be solely used for that purpose.  The reason that I am proposing this is that I think there are quite a number of places in which premises can be partly used for one purpose and partly used for the other. There could be a good deal of confusion and possibly even litigation in determining this.  I am not quite sure what the income tax provisions in this regard are, that is where an allowance is given in respect of expenses where a portion of the dwelling house is used for the purpose of a business, trade or profession but if such allowance is given if it is used solely for this purpose then that would provide a clear-cut distinction.  The main object I have here is to try, as far as possible, to have a clear-cut distinction, to clarify what is to be exempt and what is not. The insertion of the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; would help to clarify that position and, if it would, I imagine the Minister should welcome it for that reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As Deputy Colley says, section 7 (1) exempts a dwelling house from taxable wealth.  It provides that the value of the dwelling house shall not be taken into account in arriving at the <Col N="1408" /> taxable wealth of an individual.  It goes on to say in the proviso that where part of a dwelling house is used for the purposes of trade, business, profession or vocation or is let, this paragraph shall not apply to the part used for those purposes or which is so let.  In other words, the intention of the paragraph, as drafted, is to say that while the dwelling house shall not be reckonable for wealth tax purposes if portion of the dwelling house is let or is used for trade and so on that that part will be valued. Deputy Colley's amendment seeks to say that the part that is used for a trade, profession or business shall be exempt unless it is solely for these purposes.  I am convinced that if I were to accept the amendment and put in that word I would render the section unworkable..  Take, for example, a room that is used as a doctor's surgery or as a solicitor's office for 365 days of the year.  That would not be exempt under the section as it stands, but if I were to accept Deputy Colley's amendment it would be exempt if because the house was crowded during the holiday season a temporary bed was put up and some members of the family slept in it for a few nights.  That is the situation that Deputy Colley's amendment would create.  I do not think it is workable or reasonable.</P>
      <P>We had a suggestion from Deputy de Valera earlier on that the Revenue Commissioners should have a discretion. This is the sort of field where they will have a discretion and will operate on a reasonable basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to seek to bind the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not in a position to do so.  But again in a doctor's house you have a surgery and as sometimes happens in the country anyway you could have a dining-room next to the surgery.  The dining-room could quite frequently be used as a waiting-room.  The Revenue Commissioners will have to make up their minds in regard to that position.  The surgery certainly would not be exempt. <Col N="1409" /> It is a matter on the balance of probability whether the dining-room would be exempt or not.</P>
      <P>In putting this section into the Bill we broke completely new ground and we did not follow any precedents from elsewhere because there were none. There is no exemption given in respect of the dwelling house in any other country.  I am satisfied that if I were to accept the amendment with the word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; written in there, then in virtually every case all the house would be exempt although it might be quite unreasonable to exempt it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points arising from what the Minister said.  The first one is that I fail to see how a discretion can be imported here if it were not for instance in the section we have just passed.  I understand from what the Minister said that this is the first time, but I fail to see how a discretion is imported into it. If that were the answer I would be only too happy to say to the Minister: &ldquo;That solves that.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken the example of a doctor.  I can give perhaps two more pertinent examples of what is involved.  What the Minister has in mind, I take it, is that there is, in effect, a letting or the use of part exclusively as an office or surgery or so on, there is a use&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> If there is a letting there is no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no problem if there is a letting.  I used that word to describe the type of occupation. A doctor's surgery was a good example.  I understand the Minister's point about evasion by a technical compliance with a residential requirement. But what about a barrister?  I was a barrister myself at one time.  His place of work is the Bar Library and, of course, a barrister goes every day to the Bar Library as the office, so to speak, or else he is out on circuit. Normally he holds his consultations in solicitors' offices or in the Library itself.  Very frequently, particularly at night time&mdash;and in the old days it was much more common than it is now&mdash;<Col N="1410" /> legal consultations would be held in the barrister's house.  It would be infrequent, as the Minister will know. As the Minister knows, the type of consultation that involves the client, the general consultation, will normally take place in the Library, in a solicitor's office or out on circuit. There have been what you might call professional consultations.  It used to be very common that the solicitor or maybe brother barristers in the case &mdash;in a case of any size there is a junior and maybe two seniors&mdash;met in one of the counsel's studies.  It could be said that that room was used for professional purposes.</P>
      <P>Secondly, every barrister has his own library, it is the tools of his trade, which are along the walls of his study.  He must have them to hand because often he will be contacted by telephone.  I am pressing this point to show the lengths to which it can go. If this point were to be pressed further it could even apply to the local doctor or solicitor who has a telephone.  I am sure the Minister has had the experience in his private capacity before he became a Minister, of urgent calls at night when he had to give a legal opinion, maybe arrange to draft a will or something like that.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that here is a situation which could or could not be treated in a particular way under this section.  I would be very happy to feel that the Revenue Commissioners had discretion.  If the Minister's answer to that is sure and certain I am happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I finish on the point of taking the work of a barrister as an example, I want to take the point of a scholar.  Let us take the typical academic person, a member of a university staff, who is interested in his subject, although this is becoming less frequent now owing to pressure of accommodation, and the cost of books and periodicals; a man in that category would have a private library and he would do a great deal of his own research in his own house.  How does this come in?  Incidentally, although I am wandering from the point at issue, at a later point in the <Col N="1411" /> section, in connection with books, I will come back to this.</P>
    <P>There are two cases, I know this is the extreme opposite to the one the Minister made.  We have the barrister and I am adding the question of the professional student, the academic person.  There is a borderline between the two.  I am sure that this must have occurred in the income tax code somewhere.  The Minister seemed to be very confident when he mentioned the discretion.  If this discretion is here it would go a good way to mollify us on the amendment.  I am talking only for myself.  I am not committing Deputy Colley.  If it is not so, then a very practical difficulty arises for a number of people. It could even arise for members of the State service in particular applications. I should like to know the Minister's authority for saying that the discretion would be here when it was not in the other section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think a discretion is implied here because it says part of which is used for the purposes of trade, business or profession.  That is not defined.  If it is not defined it is something that the Revenue Commissioners will have to decide on the merits of each case.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy de Valera about the barrister's study, some barristers' studies, which I have been in, could be properly regarded as not falling within the exemption, as quite properly being places used for a profession.  The walls of the study are, as Deputy de Valera has said, surrounded by bookshelves and the walls are surrounded by bookcases. You have bewigged gentlemen in drawings on the walls and mantelpiece. Generally speaking, it is a room set apart for practically the exclusive use of the barrister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could have a position where some visitor would call on a social visit but somebody else was already in the drawing room, or whatever you like to call it.  The person would say: &ldquo;I am sorry, I must bring you into the study.  There is somebody in the drawing room.&rdquo;  There the study would be treated as a place which was not ordinarily used for social purposes <Col N="1412" /> or entertaining guests.  On the other hand, there could be a situation where you could be apologising to your wife and family for holding a consultation in their part of the house.  It is a matter of commonsense.  That would be the approach that would be made to it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is a question of what the various parts of the dwelling house are usually used for.  The man who owned the house would know that.  I think the example given is a fairly good one. Ordinarily, somebody who called on a social visit would not be brought into the study if it was habitually used as one and was fitted out with books and decorated with photographs of judges and so on.  On the other hand, clients, solicitors and other barrister colleagues would not normally be brought into the sitting room or drawing room portion of the house.  That is the position. I think the Revenue Commissioners will make up their minds on the merits of each case.  There is not a lot involved in this matter because it would be hard at any rate to value a couple of rooms in a house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister throw any light on the income tax position where an income tax allowance is claimed in respect of portion of the premises?  Is that granted only where it is used solely for the purpose of the business, trade or profession or partly?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can tell the Deputy of a case about which I know where a solicitor had his office, not in his house but adjacent to it and under rating but the larger portion of the building was used as a dwelling house.  The case was made that because the office was so adjacent to the dwelling house, and perhaps a gate had to be left open, it was reasonable to apportion 50 per cent of the rates and rent to the professional portion of the premises and 50 per cent to the other half.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It may be much clearer, but remember we are confining ourselves here to the one acre which would establish significance to the siting as regards a business house. Out-offices and such could be used in the course of a business and also be used for private purposes.  There are many business houses throughout the country which are also private houses. Part of the out-offices are often used for storage and are quite often also used at the same time for private purposes.</P>

      <P>These are the types of complications that may arise and the Revenue Commissioners might decide that this acre was being completely used for a commercial purpose.  I know it does not confine it to this particular section but it may happen later on.  This could have an important bearing in a place like Dublin city where there is discussion about the valuation of a particular acre of land that would be left available, whether it was used for commercial purposes or whether it is used for the private use of the family in that particular house.  I can visualise certain houses in this city where the acre attached&mdash;it would really be a half-acre&mdash;could very well be deemed by the Revenue Commissioners to be used for commercial purposes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9b:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) (b), to delete lines 32 to 34 inclusive and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) furniture, household effects and personal chattels being the normal contents of a dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house, to which paragraph (a) applies having regard to the type and size of such dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The major reason why I put down this amendment is to see if we can get some further clarification on what is, I think, going to be an extremely difficult area of interpretation.</P>
      <P>At present the Bill provides at paragraph (b) of subsection (1) that there shall be exempt from wealth tax &ldquo;the value of furniture and household effects, being the normal contents of a dwelling house or part of a dwelling house, to which paragraph (a) applies&rdquo;. I observed on Second Stage that I thought this particular provision could well lead to many volumes of reports of decided cases in the courts and I asked the Minister for Finance if he could or would clarify his intention as enshrined in the phrase &ldquo;normal contents of a dwelling house&rdquo;.  There are two possible ways at least&mdash;there may be more&mdash;of looking at this.  One is to say that the average standard dwelling house would have a certain amount and kind of normal content and anything over and above that is to be subject to wealth tax.  Another way of approaching it is to say, having regard to the type of house it is and the life style of the occupants, a certain standard and quantity and quality of contents would be appropriate, and whatever is appropriate to that kind of house and life style should be exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not at all clear to me which approach was intended, but I did put <Col N="1418" /> a question to the Minister on the Second Stage and he indicated that what he had in mind was that the normal contents would be judged by reference to the kind of house and life style of the occupants.  Either way the whole concept is extremely difficult, and I do not think it is going to be possible to lay down in any legislation what is going to be covered.  Nevertheless, in so far as we can even give a guideline in the legislation, we should seek to do so.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to write into the Bill the intention which the Minister for Finance indicated in response to a question from me as to what he intended by this particular phrase.  I am not particularly wedded to one approach as against the other. Either will present considerable difficulties but, in view of the fact that the Minister expressed an intention of approaching it in a certain way, I think the Bill ought to reflect that intention, and this amendment is designed to reflect the intention expressed by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> And I do not think it will present any difficulty in interpretation.  It simply says that what is to be exempted is furniture and household effects&mdash;the normal contents of a dwelling house or part of a dwelling house to which paragraph (a) applies and paragraph (a) says:</P>
      <P>a dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house, to which, on the relevant valuation date, an individual is beneficially entitled in possession and which is occupied by him as his only or principal residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There you can have a house within paragraph (a) which could range from a stately mansion to a humble cottage and, of course, you would find different contents in each of them.  If you came to a small three-bedroomed house and found it stacked with valuables <Col N="1419" /> to such an extent that it was abnormally furnished, that it was being used more as a store for furniture than a dwelling house, that would not be normal contents of a house.  If, on the other hand, you go to a stately mansion, you could get many thousands of pounds worth of furniture which would be quite in keeping.  It is not that I mean to make the case that, because it was a stately mansion, it would be proper to exempt thousands of pounds.  The case I am making is that thousands of pounds worth of contents would be normal for such a house whereas, if you had a smaller house and had it used as a store for furniture or valuables, that could not possibly be said to be the normal contents of the house.  That is the way I look at it.  Those are not difficult terms to understand.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The suggested amendment, instead of solving the problems, creates problems. For example, we can, without much difficulty, define it in our minds. When we look at a house we have a good idea as to the furniture and effects.  It is a different matter when we come to personal chattels.  What is a personal chattel?  That is what Deputy Colley wants to write into the Bill:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>furniture, household effects and personal chattels being the normal contents of a dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house, to which paragraph (a) applies having regard <Col N="1420" /> to the type and size of such dwelling house, or part of a dwelling house;.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is a great deal between us but the section, as drafted, is simpler and, for that reason, less likely to lead to confusion or controversy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the amendment was designed to try to indicate in the Bill what the intention was and the Minister for Lands has repeated the intention expressed by the Minister for Finance.  It is difficult to paraphrase, and I do not want to misrepresent the Minister in what he said but, roughly speaking, what he said was that what would be the normal contents of a stately mansion would clearly not be the normal contents of a small house and one should take this into account.  The difficulty is that the section does not say that.  It says:</P>
      <P>furniture and household effects, being the normal contents of a dwelling house&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It does not say &ldquo;the dwelling house&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or part of a dwelling house to which paragraph (a) applies.</P>
      <P>That is why there are two possible ways of approaching this and if the Revenue Commissioners have to decide, or the Appeals Commissioners, or the courts, it seems to me there are at least two broadly different ways they could approach the interpretation of it, one of them being outlined by the Minister, the other one being &ldquo;the normal contents of a dwelling house&rdquo;.  The normal contents of a dwelling house, in many people's view, might be far less than the normal contents of a stately home.  If the courts or the Appeal Commissioners were to take the view that the meaning of this clause was the normal contents of a normal house, then they would not realise that the approach is the approach that the Minister has outlined.</P>

      <P>One can very easily visualise a small house which is loaded to the gutters with valuable antiques&mdash;paintings, silver&mdash;and the owner will of course argue that they are the normal contents of his house. He will have to argue this one a long time.  As I understand from what the Minister said, if he establishes that over a long period he has been interested in these things, and so on, he will succeed in establishing them as the normal contents.  The Minister, of course, I know very well is not so naïve as not to know that many people have for years been accumulating things like this, not because of their interest in them, but as a form of investment and a hedge against inflation. I do not think there is any way we can spell out the answer to this.  I freely concede that.  I do not think it is possible at all.  It seemed to me that the interpretation which I outlined was open and that the amendment would indicate that only the interpretation <Col N="1422" /> the Minister has given to it would be open.  However, it is not a matter for which I would wish to go to the stake. If the Minister is satisfied that the interpretation he has given and the intention he has expressed&mdash;and as the Minister for Finance has expressedis clearly coming through in the wording of this clause, I have no particular wish to push it any further.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 10, subsection (1) (e), lines 45 to 47, to delete subparagraph (ii) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>(ii) under any sponsored superannuation scheme within the meaning of section 235 (9) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or under a trust scheme or part of a trust scheme approved by the Commissioners under section 235 or 235A of that Act.</P>
      <P>The substitution of this new subparagraph widens the exemption of benefits and annuities receivable under the superannuation scheme.  The original subparagraph exempted benefits or annuities which were payable under a superannuation scheme which was approved for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.  Schemes were so approved under section 32 of the Finance Act, 1921, section 34 of the Finance Act, 1958, and sections, 15 and 16 of the Finance Act, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> Representations have been made that it is possible to take the view that an annuity which was payable under a scheme which was not formally approved could be liable to wealth tax.  The fact that it was not so approved could be outside the control of the annuitant.  For example, the annuity could be payable under the terms of a scheme which did not require formal approval, or which was excepted from the scope of the 1958 Finance Act, or with dependence on wheather the annuitant was the employee of a body corporate or otherwise. The number of individuals in receipt of such annuities who would come within the scope of the wealth tax is not known, but it is not likely to be large.  It is considered desirable, however, to extend the scope of the exemption to cover such persons who, for historic or other reasons, were not members of an approved superannuation scheme.</P>

    <P>It is considered desirable to exempt annuities which are payable in respect of children who suffer from the effects of preparations containing thalidomide. The payments made to them on an annual basis are exempt from income tax.  Under the scheme of the Bill these payments would rank as annuities or periodic payments and, being unsecured annuities, the notional sum which if invested in the appropriate Government security would produce the amount of the payments in any particular year, would be regarded as taxable wealth under subsection (3) of the Bill.  As the children involved are all minors, their wealth, including the sum required to produce the annuity, would aggregate with their parents wealth.  The sum total of this amendment is to exempt annual payments payable to the unfortunate thalidomide children.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme in the Bill certain private non-trading companies are taxed as entities which means that the assets of these companies rather than the shares in the companies are liable to tax.  Sometimes investment companies are set up to hold and invest the funds of superannuation schemes. These investment companies would be under the control of the trustees of the superannuation scheme.  They would fall within the definition of a private non-trading company in section 6 and become taxable entities. It is not the intention to tax these entities and they have been excluded from liability by these amendments. Similarly, an investment company may hold part of the funds of a unit trust scheme and be a private non-trading company as it would be under the control of the manager or trustee of the unit trust scheme.  The company would be taxed as an entity and a unit is liable in the hands of the holder thereof.  The purpose is to exempt this company.</P>

The first one is that this amendment illustrates once more the fact that the original approach in section 6 to which we referred is wrong.  Here is another example of a private non-trading company <Col N="1427" /> which will deserve exemption and is now getting it.  We already in an earlier amendment dealt with another kind of private non-trading company which deserved exemption and got it.  It is virtually certain.  In fact, we have illustrated some which are not getting exemption and I am quite certain others will come to light which should get exemption and are not getting it.  That is the first comment I want to make on that.</P>
      <P>In addition, am I to understand that the effect of this amendment will be to exempt completely from the liability wealth tax property comprised in either superannuation scheme funds or unit trusts which comply with the terms of the amendment? Will they be totally exempt from wealth tax?</P>

I am not objecting at all &mdash;I want to make it clear&mdash;to the exemption being provided under this amendment, but if such should be amended surely from the point of view of the economy in general it is at least as important to exempt productive assets generally?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have the details here and I will give them to the Deputy.  Certain unit trust schemes were set up, notably by the Bank of Ireland to deal exclusively in Government securities and securities of certain semi-State bodies. If these securities were in the beneficial ownership of persons who were neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State they would be exempt from taxation here.  If such foreign persons owned the units they would not be beneficially entitled to the securities as such and would not therefore be eligible for exemption. To encourage foreign investment in this type of security, section 60 of the Finance Act, 1973, exempted the units of this type of scheme from death duties.  The units would not be liable to capital gains tax under the proposed Capital Gains Tax Bill.  It is, therefore, proposed to exempt these units from wealth tax also.  The proposed amendment does this by extending the meaning of &ldquo;security&rdquo; in paragraph (h) of subsection (1) to include a unit of a unit trust to which section 60 of the Finance Act, 1973, applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  Under section 16 &ldquo;unit trust scheme&rdquo; means a unit trust scheme registered in a register established by the Unit Trust Act, 1972, whose deed expressing the trusts of the scheme <Col N="1430" /> restricts the property subject to those trusts to securities, and &ldquo;securities&rdquo; means securities issued with the condition that they be exempt from taxation when in the beneficial ownership of persons neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  As regards securities of certain European bodies, section 92 of the Finance Act, 1973, applies to any stock or other form of security issued in the State by the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Investment Bank.  That section gave these securities the same status from a taxation point of view as securities issued in the State under the authority of the Minister for Finance.  The proposed amendment grants exemption from wealth tax in respect of these European securities when in the beneficial ownership of persons who are neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.</P>

    <P>The amendment provides for the exemption of gardens which are of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest.  To qualify for exemption <Col N="1431" /> the gardens must be situate in the State and must be open to the public or to recognised bodies or associations of persons.  The conditions for exemption are similar to those which apply in the case of artistic objects.  In order to qualify for exemption the gardens do not necessarily have to be ancillary to a house or residence.  The gardens in question are comparatively few in number but they attract tourists, provide amenities for the public and are used by students and others interested in horticulture.  Some have been built up over generations and do not provide profits for their owners. They are usually attached to private residences but are too large to be covered by the exemption of one acre attached to a private dwelling-house.</P>

In fact, we urged it on Second Stage for the reasons the Minister has outlined: there are not many gardens answering this description in the country but in many cases a great deal of time, effort and money over many years, as the Minister said in some cases over generations, has been invested in them and they have no value in terms of money comparable with their value in terms of amenities to the public.  It is quite right to exempt them and it would be quite wrong to include them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am concerned that there are also some houses in the State, and again not very many, which <Col N="1432" /> would answer to a large extent the description that I have given and that the Minister has given in regard to the gardens proposed to be exempted. I do not know how such houses would be valued on the open market. I do not want to mention specific houses but we can all think of some which are of great historic, or in some cases, architectural interest, which are open to the public on a regular basis.  The cost of their maintenance, especially if they have been purchased in recent times, plus the cost of the money invested in them exceeds by a long way any receipts from the admittance of the public. As the Minister will understand, I am speaking of cases where they are not the principal residence or dwelling house of an individual.  In the few cases that I am thinking of they are not the residence or principal residence of individuals.  They have, I believe, a very considerable merit, but to impose wealth tax on their market value, whatever that may be, could well be the last straw that will cause the owners who are already losing money in simply keeping them there, to give up and demolish them.  Such a development would be most unfortunate from every point of view.  I would strongly urge the Minister to apply to such houses the same exemption as is proposed to be applied in the Minister's amendment relative to gardens, subject of course to the fairly rigorous conditions being laid down in the Minister's own amendment in relation to gardens.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In amendment No. 16 I propose to exempt gardens in the State which fulfil two conditions, which briefly are that they are of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, and that reasonable facilities for viewing are available to the public.  The amendment proposes to exempt houses which also meet these conditions.  It is not proposed to extend the exemption to houses for the following reason, and that means I do not propose to accept the Deputy's amendment for these reasons.  The exemption would be academic in the vast majority of cases where the houses are inhabited <Col N="1433" /> because the principal private residence exemption would apply, and the Deputy appreciates that and has said so.</P>
      <P>Of those that are not inhabited the majority must be vacant precisely because they are not habitable.  In such circumstances, the market value would be negligible and as a result so would be tax.  The exemption would be difficult to administer.  For example, a house could be of historic interest merely because some person was born there or lived in it.  Would exemption be granted for that reason alone, even if the house were let in flats or was an office block or had been turned into something else?  If residence were insisted on as a qualification it would be an unnecessary factor in view of the existing private residence exemption.  If, however, residence were not to be a factor, the exemption would extend to castles operating for profit, office blocks which restore or retain, say, Georgian buildings.  In so far as the principal residence exemption would not cover all cases that we are talking about or inhabited houses which are not principal residences or uninhabited houses which are habitable but vacant, there cannot be very many such houses.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the proposal but I consider it would be inadvisable at this early stage of the tax to embark on a wide exemption that would cause considerable and arguably unnecessary administrative problems and possibly avoidance, in the absence of full knowledge of the extent to which exemption would apply or the necessity for it.  It is a question that could be kept in view and considered in a couple of years, by which time relevant facts and figures should be available.</P>
      <P>It occurs to me that if there are such houses that are habitable but vacant if we leave the section as it is people might be encouraged to take up residence in them.  That would be a good thing.  I think my amendment, coupled with exemption for the principal residence, goes as far as it is reasonable to go at this stage.</P>

      <P>I want to put this to the Minister.  First of all, as he agrees, in view of the exemption on the residence basis we are dealing with only a handful of cases.  The suggestion that of that handful of cases we could find included places which had been let in flats or turned into office blocks and which could at the same time meet the conditions that are laid down here in respect of reasonable facilities for viewing being allowed to the members of the public or to recognised bodies or to associations of persons must seem to the Minister a kind of peculiar thing, difficult to visualise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to add in a provision that in the case of houses they have to be let in and throughout the premises, I would be happy with that.  I do not know the facts of this and I did not want to mention any particular place but I think I had better in order to illustrate what I am at.  Perhaps somebody will tell me that it is somebody's private residence but I am not aware of it.  Is Castletown House somebody's private residence?  If it is not, it is certainly open to the public for all sorts of functions that are held there. If it were to be demolished simply because wealth tax was imposed as an annual outgoing based on its market value, I think it would be a very sad thing to happen.  It should not happen for any of the reasons that were in the Minister's brief.</P>
      <P>It is true enough to say, as the Minister said at the end, that it is possible that if the amendment is left as it is it will induce people to go to live in it.  I agree it is a possibility. Unfortunately there is also the possibility, which is perhaps more likely, considering the disadvantages of living in a place like that, that such places will be demolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> We are talking about a very few cases.  They have to meet quite stringent conditions under this amendment. First of all, they have to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners that they are of national, scientific, historic or artistic interest, and secondly reasonable facilities for viewing have to be allowed to members of the public or to recognised bodies or associations of persons.  I want to suggest to the Minister that chances of abuse in this field are very remote, whereas the prospects of irreparable damage being done if wealth tax was applied to such premises are considerable.  The suggestion that some of them are vacant because they are uninhabitable may be true, but cases of that kind are hardly ones that will figure for wealth tax.  If they are uninhabitable and, therefore, vacant we can take it that they are rotting away.  They are not going to be valuable as such whatever about the land on which they stand.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  He is not going to lose anything but he might save something that can never be saved again.  To amend it next year might be too late if the effect of this is to cause such places to be demolished.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (1), after line 31, to add the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" />&ldquo;(k) trees or underwood growing on land in the State and in the same beneficial ownership as the land;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There may have been many representations concerning growing timber.  A plantation takes from 30 to 50 years to mature and during the early years there is no possibility of it showing a profit.  Unlike most other businesses, which can become more productive by changes in production, methods, management, marketing policies <i>et cetera,</i> the forest industry has not many options open to it.  The special problems of plantations are recognised in this amendment which exempts growing timber.  The exemption applies only to plantations in the State.  Both the trees and the land on which they are growing must be in the same ownership.  Normally, of course, this is the position.  To prevent avoidance of tax by means of the exemption the exemption is confined to cases where the timber is owned by the owner of the land.  The woodland itself remains liable to tax.  Apart from the growing timber, its market value is not usually very great and it is entitled to a reduction of 50 per cent over £100,000 whichever is the lesser or 20 per cent under section 10 on the same footing as agricultural property. There were many representations made in regard to this and deputations received.  I feel that the amendment proposed meets the requests made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested on Second Stage an exemption of this kind.  For the various reasons mentioned by the Minister there is a good case for the amendment.  I would, however, appreciate if the Minister would expand a little more on the kind of tax avoidance or evasion which might occur if there was not the restriction that there is in this amendment, that both the land and the timber have to be in the same beneficial ownership.  I wonder about that restriction in the case of, say, some property which is subject to a life interest.  Is there any possibility that the beneficial ownership of the land might be found in the hands of a trustee?  Of course, that would not <Col N="1438" /> be beneficial ownership.  It might not be in the hands of the life tenant.  In the first instance, the question I am asking the Minister is in what way would there be avoidance or evasion if he did not have this restriction that both the land and the timber must be in the same beneficial ownership?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The idea here is to try to ensure that only the owner of the land and the forest, thereby ensuring that the man who planted the trees, or his successors in title, gets the benefit.  That may not be absolutely possible to ensure but we are saying that, in order to qualify for exemption, the taxpayer must own the land and the forest.  Otherwise, a person could buy a forest, put all his money into it and leave it there for a couple of years without buying the land at all.  He would be purely a speculator and he could get exemption from a large amount of wealth tax, in so far as there was any large amount payable, over several years.  It is to try to prevent that sort of thing that we have worded the amendment as it is.</P>

      <P>Could I just add another matter?  At a recent EEC subcommittee meeting in this House we discussed the question of a proposed directive from the EEC which will be making money available for the private sector in relation to afforestation. It would be relevant that the ownership of the land and the forestry be vested in the person who will avail of the EEC money.  I regard the wording of this proposed amendment as being in line and very much compatible with the proposed suggestions under the EEC directive.  Admittedly it is very much in the embryo stage at present but from my own reading of certain drafts of the directives and the various recommendations made in respect of it I believe this amendment would make quite certain that the EEC money went into the hands of people who are afforesting their own land and looking after it.  This is the intention of the directive.</P>

The real difficulty, as I understand it, is that 95 per cent of the planting is done by the Department of Lands, Forestry Division and of the land planted, 90 per cent is held by them.  The picture which has emerged is that any private planting done has been basically done by people who hold the remnants of old estates, old forests and woodlands. Much of it has been done away with rather like these old gardens we were discussing.  The old saying is that you plants trees for your children and grandchildren so it is really a labour of love and pride.</P>

I understand that the definition here, the category which has been described here, is in line with the description given in section 9 of the Finance Act, 1912.  The amendment is in line with general thinking and even with modern thinking with which we will be falling into line.

I had taken a different interpretation from it at the very start, but the Minister in no uncertain fashion pointed out to us that foreign shareholders of a company in this country would be exempt, which I believe is very right.  We must not tax if we want to encourage capital into this country, and if it had been otherwise, I certainly would have criticised it for inhibiting the inflow of capital, which is so important for the development of our economy today. <Col N="1441" /> The Minister did make provision for that, or at least that is his interpretation of section 3.

When we come to Deputy Colley's amendment on this section, we are hoping that the Minister will give the same concessions as he so very rightly gave in section 3 and apply the same concessions to productive assets in this country.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Yes&mdash;trading companies in this country as regards their productive assets.  We are looking for the same concessions for Irish people who have property in this country, shareholders in companies.  Will they get the same kind of concessions, the same as those for trading companies in this country for foreigners?  I believe that we will be discriminating against the average Irish businessman here, but if this amendment is conceded businessmen can compete in even competition with each other and there will be no distinction as regards wealth tax where productive assets are concerned.  If a foreigner is exempt&mdash;let it be a factory, a business or a hotel&mdash;I believe so also should an Irish shareholder or an individual who has productive assets in this country, that we should not make a distinction as regards these two investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would concede the fact that everybody is equal as regards running a business and their capabilities, it will in my opinion take away the disadvantage for an Irish businessman against a foreign businessman. We know that in many types of business the volume of profits is very narrow and in my opinion, it is intolerable <Col N="1442" /> to think that in the case of factories which are competing against one another, one because it is owned by a foreign company should be exempt and the other that is totally owned perhaps by an individual or a shareholder in that particular company should be subject to wealth tax.  We are looking for this concession from the Minister for productive assets such as agriculture and other productive assets.  I think that the Minister having conceded it to the foreign company with the trading company in this country, which he has very rightly done, should also concede it here now to the average Irish businessman.  It would be unfair that we will be exempting foreigners&mdash;we discussed it here yesterday as regards semi-State bodies.  Many of these will be trading companies in their own right and also will semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>As we go through this Bill which I have not delved into yet, there are other bodies which I believe will be exempt such as trade unions.  It boils down to that the people whom we are directing this wealth tax at are people who have lived in this country all their lives, who have given their efforts and their time and invested their money, but simply because they happen to be domiciled in this country, they will certainly get the full lash of whatever wealth tax is levied on them.  I believe it is unfair.  We should not discriminate against any particular type of person or factory.  I can see the psychological effect this will have when a man can say &ldquo;I am exempt from wealth tax because I am a foreign company trading here&rdquo;, and another person who has a business in this country which is individuallyowned will be liable to wealth tax. Before I go any further, I would like to know if the Minister concedes that this is the position as this Bill stands, that foreigners will be exempt and that Irish people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> My view is that the Irish investor with a company in America, and having a trading company here, is exempt from wealth tax.  Furthermore, an individual who has property here is subject to wealth tax.  I believe that this is a wrong principle and Deputy Colley's amendment which would exempt productive assets, should be accepted.  Everyone should be treated equally irrespective of what part of the world he lives in.  We should not have the position that, companies in other parts of the world which have trading companies here are exempt while wealth tax is imposed on the shareholders here by virtue of the fact that they reside here.  If Deputy Colley's amendment is accepted we will be exempting productive assets here.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Again, to quote the amendment put down in the name of Deputy Colley, the amendment is designed to exempt &ldquo;property in the State which is agricultural property or is used directly in the provision of employment in the State and stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State&rdquo;.  The effect of this amendment would be to delete section 2 of the Bill.  Section 2 of the Bill is the section which charges a wealth tax.  I do not accept Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument that section 3 of the Bill, or any section, discriminates as between Irish people and foreigners.  There are only three categories taxed under this Bill &mdash;the individual, the discretionary trust and the private non-trading company.  The trading company is not taxed.  The trading company, whether <Col N="1444" /> the shareholders are foreign shareholders or Irish shareholders is exempt.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes.  The trading company is completely exempt.  It is true that the shareholders are subject to wealth tax on their shares if their holding, together with their other assets, exceeds the thresholds of £70,000, £90,000 and £100,000 provided.  I was reading the other evening of a company which has assets of something like £11 million and has 3,500 shareholders.  Unless all those shareholders are very wealthy people the shares they have in this particular public company would not attract any wealth tax.  I repeat that the trading companies, which are what Deputy Fitzpatrick is speaking about, are exempt.  He says there is discrimination. There is no more discrimination now than there was when death duties were payable.  An Irish shareholder in an Irish trading company, if he died, paid Irish death duties on the value of his shares if his estate was liable.  An American shareholder, who held shares in an American trading company which owned an Irish trading company, and who died, paid no death duties.  It is the very same thing.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No.  It is a completely different argument <Col N="1445" /> dealing with a completely different situation.  I say there is no more discrimination now against Irish people than there was when death duties were payable.  I repeat an Irish shareholder was liable to death duties on his shares, whereas the American shareholder in an American corporation which owned a trading company here was not liable.  That is still the case.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we have, and it has been recognised in this Bill and has been the law for a long time, that foreigners who invested money in certain securities here or placed money on deposit here were exempt and continued to be exempt from income tax and other taxes while Irish people were liable to tax.  There is no difference.  There is no discrimination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with one or two other things in this amendment.  The amendment deals with agricultural land, the special position of agricultural land.  The low return from the big investment has been recognised in the Bill by exempting completely 50 per cent of the value of the agricultural land or £100,000, whichever is the lesser, by exempting every hoof and all livestock on the land and, when it was over the upper threshold, by continuing to give 20 per cent for productive assets.  The special position of agriculture is taken account of and has been adequately provided for.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to correct something I said when dealing with this Bill here before when I said that the IFA were completely satisfied with the Bill.  I did go too far.  I acknowledge that they are still against it in principle.  I followed a precedent or bad example when I spoke after Deputy Crowley, who seemed to be highly indignant that Irish farmers were not marching on the city of Dublin and blocking the roads of Ireland.  He seemed to be attacking the farming community and the farming organisations for not being militant.  I did, I admit, say that the IFA were not doing that because they were satisfied with the Bill, that they did concede that the Government <Col N="1446" /> went a long way towards meeting representations made.</P>
    <P>The amendment goes on to say that agricultural property should be totally exempt.  As I say, all livestock is exempt, 50 per cent of the value of the land or the first £100,000 value is exempt.  The amendment goes on to say that all property used in the provision of employment in the State and shares in trading companies in the State should be exempt.  That would simply do away with the tax altogether. Would Deputy Fitzpatrick go further and say that shares in Irish trading companies should be exempt from income tax?  Because, as Deputies know, they are not exempt.  Would he go further and say that they should always have been exempt from death duties, because they were not?  They were subject to death duty, estate duty, succession duty and legacy duty.</P>
    <P>This is a political amendment put down for a political purpose.  I do not blame the Opposition for putting it down.  I would expect them to put it down, but it is my duty to expose it as something that is not sincerely believed in by them and, indeed, has not seriously been put down.  I could well believe that if we were not operating under a timetable at the present time, we would have all the troops who never read the Bill, who did not know what the Bill was about, again brought in to argue this particular amendment, to make political propaganda, to mislead the public and to terrify the investing public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to argue against this amendment because to do so would entail embarking on a Second Reading speech again.  The mover of the amendment will agree that if the amendment were to be <Col N="1447" /> accepted it would completely negative the proposals in the Bill.  The amendment goes to the very root and foundation of the Bill and rejects the principle of the Bill, which has already been accepted both on Second Stage and in the long and tortuous discussion which we had on section 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being somewhat unfair in suggesting that this is not a serious amendment. It is serious for this reason.  I thought the purpose of this Bill was, as far as taxation is concerned, to tax unproductive wealth, to tax the accumulated, unproductive wealth, wealth that might be broadly described as luxurious wealth, as wealth disproportionately in the hands of certain people.  That is from the taxation point of view.  From the social point of view, the Minister and his colleagues made a great point about the distribution of wealth and, as I understood it, the idea was to effect a broader and a more equitable distribution of wealth.  In both of these things we are <i>ad idem.</i></P>
      <P>Where we have taken a different view from the Minister on this Bill&mdash; and we felt the timing of the whole code possibly was wrong&mdash;is that we feel that moving towards taxing productive wealth is economically and socially undesirable at present.  There is the kernel of the difference between the Minister and ourselves.  What I am objecting to is the Minister's allegation that we are not serious. We are serious.  There is a fundamental distinction here.  There is agreement about the distribution of wealth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be provoked into getting away from the serious business in hand.  Perhaps the Minister does not want us to continue <Col N="1448" /> discussing seriously other parts of this Bill or other legislation.  I object to the allegation that we are not serious, because there is a fundamental point of principle here.  Attach a wealth tax by all means to accumulated, non-productive wealth, which is serving no useful social or economic purpose, but when it comes to productive wealth, wealth employed for productive purposes, in the current economic situation, it is wrong to tax that.</P>
      <P>The essence of this amendment is that in the present economic situation all wealth should be canalised into productive channels.  Obviously there is this difference in approach between ourselves and the Minister.  The amendment refers to property in the State which is agricultural property or is used directly in the provision of employment in the State.  At a time when the unemployment situation is so serious, when there is an urgent need to stimulate economic activity, I do not know why the Minister cavils at the first two lines of the amendment. Agriculture is the mainstay of our whole economy.  The whole nation depends on it.  The Revenue Commissioners derive resources from it.</P>
      <P>When we have the unemployment problem we have, I simply cannot understand why <i>pro tanto,</i> if the Minister will listen to me, we cannot exempt property in the State which is agricultural property or which is used directly in the provision of employment.</P>
      <P>If the amendment were to stop there I cannot see why the Minister will not accept it, in the present economic circumstances, having had the question of wage agreement, having had to take away certain advantages from certain people and taxed more and so on.  In the case of a problematical new tax like this we cannot go that far anyway.  When you come to the second line and stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State, you are in a more secondary position than in the first two lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust the Minister will understand that I am trying to make a reasonable and objective analysis of this.  The essential difference in principle between <Col N="1449" /> our view and his view hinges on the word &ldquo;productive&rdquo;.  Following that, in the case of the amendment and making it directly relevant to the amendment before the House and not diverging into a Second Reading speech, if one were to stop at the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; in the second line, I cannot see why the Minister should cavil at accepting that.</P>
    <P>In the same reasonable attitude, I hope, I then concede that we are going into another line of country when we add &ldquo;and stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State&rdquo;.  It is coming very near the time to the adjournment of the debate and as I have dissected the section, we will come back.  I can understand the Minister focusing on those latter lines and maybe if we approach the Bill in the spirit we have been approaching it, and if the Minister could, for a moment, get away from the political approach he started on, we might be able to get between us a solution of this problem just as we got a solution on other sections.  I would ask the Minister, therefore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the incorrect charge of Deputy Colley that industrial exports would, perhaps, be static.  I want to point out that the OECD have forecast a decline of 2½ per cent in the volume of exports this year.  It must be borne in mind that many major economies are passing through a very difficult stage because of the down-turn in world economic activity and demand.  As a small open economy, we cannot escape being hit by current international recession. The fact remains that our performance is better than the performance of any comparable country.</P>
      <P>This year our balance of payments deficit is expected to be between £150 million and £200 million, which represents a very substantial improvement on a balance of payments deficit of £300 million last year.  It is our intention that this deficit be brought down gradually, and deliberately gradually, because to do it immediately would plunge our people into a greater economic recession than is at present imposed on us because of outside circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested that the balance of payments be held in check because of a down-turn in economic activity at home, but, of course, that is only half the picture.  A large part of the improvement is due to more favourable terms of trade resulting mainly from an easing of import prices.  The down-turn in our economy is a result of world-wide effects.  We would be experiencing a higher growth rate and our imports would be higher <Col N="1451" /> if the decline was not at present so insidious.  However, what Deputy Colley does not mention is that our exports would also have been higher if our customers abroad were not suffering from the same recession as is inflicted upon this country.  Our agricultural exports this year have been growing at a very rapid rate.  For instance, in the first five months of this year in value terms they are 40 per cent higher than last year.  This is making a very major increase to our balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>Most of the allegations made in the course of this debate by the Opposition were wrong.  Yet another of the incorrect ones made was that the current budget deficit, as enunciated by me on 26th June, did not include the costs of social welfare improvements next October.  I do not know what the Opposition are doing.  The performance of this Chamber does not encourage one to have much confidence in them.  The media are saying that&mdash;it is not a partisan assessment of a Government Minister.  They are not even doing their homework.  If they had looked at the budget statement of last January they would have seen where we provided for the October increases in social welfare. We provided more than enough because the result of the Government reduction in the consumer price index by 4 per cent, as a result of the supplementary budget which we are now discussing, will mean that we have provided more than sufficient to meet the October increases in social welfare.</P>
    <P>I referred in my financial statement to two types of saving schemes designed to counteract in some way the effects of inflation.  One of these was an index link scheme of limited applications directed to help our older citizens to provide a small nestegg for contingencies.  I am glad to say that the working out of this scheme is almost completed and subject to the usual requirements of printing and publicity it should be in operation very shortly.</P>
    <P>I also said I was considering a limited scheme of indexation related to the national instalment savings <Col N="1452" /> scheme confined to those prepared to set their savings aside for a minimum fixed period of time.  The formulation of this scheme is somewhat more complicated in that it has to be associated with and synchronised with the existing national instalment saving scheme.  I am nevertheless hopeful that this will be announced and in operation in the very near future.</P>
    <P>I was interested, Sir, that in contrast with many recent debates, including the debate on the January budget, the Opposition were a little more careful on this occasion not to demand further and further public expenditure.  I pointed out in January last that having criticised the size of the deficit and having criticised the amount of the taxation and having criticised every financial rule the Government were following, the Opposition were urging additional expenditure of £120 million.  It is probably due to laziness on their part or indifference or, as I identified earlier, their general lack of zest in this debate, that they did not get down to any particular items in the course of this budget debate.  So I have not been able to put a cost upon their Santa Claus generosity.  They were demanding an increase in the limits of SDA loans both as to the amount of loan advanced and the amount of income to qualify for a loan.  The interesting thing is that having chastised us for the size of the present borrowing requirement, to increase these limits would have increased the borrowing requirement by about another £20 million.  So, as they seek to be generous enough to show how wonderful they are, they are raising once again the problem of the size of the deficit and the amount of borrowing that has to be made.  I would suggest that before we next come to discuss the financial affairs of this country the Opposition would get together and try to achieve some uniform approach to the economic and social problems of our time.</P>
    <P>They also commented upon the lack of infrastructural development, which is one of these wonderful words that mean something to those who are looking for something but do not allow one to measure the cost.  Of <Col N="1453" /> course, people who failed and failed miserably to provide the infrastructural development are not in a position to criticise this Government.  We have quadrupled in two years the amount of money we spent on water supplies, sewerage, roads and services of that kind which are essential to the provision of houses for our people and to industrial development.  As they did not quantify what they were demanding, I am not in a position to put a price on it.  All I can say is that we have stretched resources very considerably in order to provide the immediate needs of our people in the social sector and also to provide employment.</P>
    <P>I was interested to see that one commentator has said that the Government's disposition to pump yet more money into housing was the last resort of an uninspired Minister for Finance.  Of course, I can envy the luxury of being a commentator and I am sure they do not resent my sense of envy.  When every other commentator in our community was advising us to pump money into housing I find it difficult to accept the veracity of that accusation.  What is the simple truth?  The quickest and best way of promoting employment in order to ensure the least effective increase of imports, the most effective way of promoting employment without generating inflation, is to build houses. Ireland has amongst the member states of the EEC and many other European countries the best record for the provision of homes for people. We are the only country in Europe that over the last two years has not alone maintained its housing output but has increased it.  This Government with that record behind them have pumped yet more money into the housing sector.  There are a number of reasons, first of all because we have such an abominable lag to overtake and secondly, because it happens to be one of the most immediate ways in which we can relieve existing unemployment. I know there are other ways in which public money could be spent to generate wealth in the future.  I would like to be spending more money in those sectors but in <Col N="1454" /> our economy&mdash;and our economy is working about 20 per cent below its existing capacity&mdash;obviously no immediate return could be obtained from investing in sectors which at present are operating below capacity. The important thing to do is to provide a stimulus, therefore, in the building industry in such a way as will ensure immediate employment and also relief of very serious social distress. We have provided a very powerful stimulus in the private sector of the building industry which, in this country, is being maintained at a level which, as I said earlier, is not being maintained elsewhere.  Additional finance of over £50 million was announced for private house building, partly from Exchequer resources and partly from the resources of the banking system.</P>
    <P>It is significant that under this Government the banking system which was regarded as being conservative and not interested in social investment and as being unready to provide money for housing has come forward with £40 million for house building.  That is very significant and something that should be remembered by people who are strong critics of both the Government and the banking system.</P>
    <P>There has not been any neglect on the part of this Government of local authority housing.  Early in the year, since our budget in January last, we injected another £7 million into local authority housing.  At present local authorities are stretched to the limit of their physical and administrative capacity.  There is no lack of finance holding up local authority housing. We have had to build up a service which was inadequately provided with staff, skills and planning, and we have built up the output of local authority housing for our needy citizens in a most dramatic way during the period of the greatest economic recession ever experienced by the world.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch suggested that there was no information as to the cost of the subsidies and reduction in VAT. This distressed me because one wonders if the members of the Opposition ever bother to listen when they <Col N="1455" /> are in the House.  Deputy Lynch was in the House since I was speaking on the budget.  Then you wonder whether or not they bother to do their homework outside the House.</P>
    <P>In my financial statement&mdash;page 26 of the stencilled version&mdash;I gave the cost of the subsidies in 1975 at £18.5 million and the VAT reductions at £8.2 million.  It is indicative of the Opposition in Ireland today that the Leader of the Opposition could come into the House and make such a reckless and unfounded accusation, that the Minister for Finance in the name of the Government, had not put a price on the subsidies and the removal of VAT, when he had counted it down to decimal points.  It is no wonder people are disillusioned with the Opposition when such could occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said on television that since the Government took up office there had been a run on National Loan sinking funds and saving certificate rescue funds.  He suggested that this was unprecedented and undesirable.  The first time sinking funds were used for Exchequer financing was in the Fianna Fáil year of 1959-60.  Prior to that it had been the practice to keep sinking fund balances on deposit with Government bankers, who were then the Bank of Ireland, pending use for the purchase of stock on the open market for cancellation. The market, however, became stagnant.  Comparatively large balances accumulated on deposit at a time when the Exchequer was borrowing from <i>inter alia</i> the Bank of Ireland for Exchequer purposes at rates much higher than the deposit rates.  In effect, Ireland was borrowing her own money and paying a high interest rate on it.  I am not prepared to pay a high interest rate for the borrowing of money at home and abroad when there is in the Exchequer coffers money lying idle upon which the Exchequer is receiving less than it would have to pay if it borrowed the money elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I should like any person who criticises the policy of the Government to justify any operation in which the Government of Ireland would fail to <Col N="1456" /> use the money they have immediately available, instead of money which they would otherwise have to borrow at excessive rates of interest.  The rates of interest being charged on money lent today are unprecedently high.  It is clear that the sensible thing to do is to use the resources which are immediately available without having to pay extortionate rates of interest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley referred to the delay in renegotiating the export credit scheme.  All I can say is that he obviously does not know the facts. Work on the revision of the export credit scheme commenced in my Department and in the Department of Industry and Commerce in 1974. Detailed discussions were necessary with individual exporters of capital goods in order to assess their credit requirements.</P>
    <P>In my budget statement last January I announced that details of a revised scheme would be announced shortly. The negotiations with the Central Bank and the other banks were, for reasons beyond the control of the Minister for Finance, very protracted. They involved not merely the particular discussions with individual exporters, but also settlement of the monetary policy for the year.  Our banking system is composed of independent units.  Their agreement is required for any advance which they are asked to make.  Care has also to be taken to observe EEC requirements. We have to make certain that where the Exchequer is involved in the subsidy it is properly administered and that the very best arrangement is made from the point of view of the national economy.</P>
    <P>In fact, for the first time, there will be an Exchequer subsidy for the export credit scheme and it will cost money, like so many other services which people so glibly demand but later are less willing to pay for.  The arrangements came into operation on 1st May.  Only one complaint has been received, and that came from a firm which complained on three occasions when Deputy Colley was Minister for Finance.  I think Deputy Colley formed the view that they were too <Col N="1457" /> ready to make complaints and less ready to look after their own affairs. However, as I say, the one complaint has come from a firm which has previously complained and it is not significant.  Deputy Colley suggested, if I recall his remark correctly, that there was something sinister in the fact that a complaint had been made. He must be consoled to know that it came from the same quarter as was obviously causing some embarrassment to him.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should say that I am not certain if the Deputy, personally, was in office.  I was thinking of his Government and party. Certainly, there were three complaints before I became Minister for Finance and during the lifespan of the last Government.</P>
      <P>I should like to return to the specifics of the budget.  Before I do, by way of introduction, I should like to deal with the comments of Deputy Colley supported by Deputy Lynch and others.  Deputy Colley, if I recall correctly, said that the parties to the national agreement did what the Government asked of them in the White Paper on National Partnership. They suggested that the Government had not played their part.  In the White Paper on National Partnership the context in which the claims for equal adjustments were made should be looked at very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was pointed out that, as a result of the economic recession, which followed in the wake of the oil price increases, the resources available to our people would remain at or about the same level, at best, for some time to come.  As a community, therefore, we could not afford, or even hope, to <Col N="1458" /> improve our living standards.  For this reason, last November the Government urged moderation and restraint in the negotiation of pay settlements since the achievement of disproportionate income increases by some sections of the community could only be at the expense of weaker groups.</P>
    <P>In line with the Government's concern for the disadvantaged sections of the community, a commitment was given in the same White Paper to the protection of living standards through periodic revision of social welfare payments. In order, however, that the effect of such measures should not be nullified, the Government urged, in the White Paper, the better-off sections of the community not to seek pay increases in compensation for any additional tax imposed for the purpose of financing these necessary expenditures. This commitment, to the deprived in the community, was honoured in the budget of last January and will again be honoured in the revision of social welfare increases in October.</P>
    <P>In January last, rates of payment for all social insurance and assistance schemes and related schemes administered by health boards were increased from 21 per cent to 23 per cent.  To meet those increases, and the increases due next October, additional taxation was imposed on less essential items, such as alcohol and tobacco.  In my budget statement in January I called for the exercise of restraint in seeking income increases and stressed the particular importance of refraining from using the increases in the consumer price index due to these new taxes as a basis for further income increases.  My appeals not to use those new taxes on alcohol and tobacco as a basis for further increment increases have been ignored. They have been ignored throughout this debate by the Opposition although, as I pointed out in my early interventions in this debate at lunchtime, no Member of the Opposition has spoken in this debate against what I urge, that is that we as a community should remove as a base for seeking income increases, adjustments in taxation on alcohol and tobacco.  I <Col N="1459" /> have become hoarse urging that.  It was not taken up in the national wage agreement negotiations although it was urged by Government representatives at such negotiations.  Nobody yet has come out in public and denounced my urging that consideration because they know it is well founded and it is the only worthy approach to the matter of incomes or to the necessity which may arise in the future as in the past to impose taxation in order to provide the necessaries of life for the less privileged of our community.  It is a matter that will have to be accepted sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>In March of this year, workers received 10 per cent escalator payment which brought the average pay increase obtained under the 1974 national wage agreement to about 30 per cent in a 12-month period.  That was an increase well in excess of the price rises that took place during the year.  Superimposed on that 1974 agreement were the increases provided for in the 1975 agreement.  The first phase of this agreement included full compensation for the rise of 8 per cent in the consumer price index mid-November, 1974 to mid-February 1975, which included 3 per cent attributable to taxation, and I make no apology about that.</P>
    <P>I pointed out that taxes were going on and what the consequences would be for the consumer price index, but those taxes were necessary to keep this country going; those taxes were necessary to provide jobs; those taxes were necessary to provide the poor in our community with the means by which to live.  Since then people have insisted, as they hypocritically approved the increases on the luxuries, on getting total compensation.  &ldquo;I am a great fellow to make sacrifices on my drink and my smokes, but I will make sure I get compensation for it.&rdquo;  That is the attitude that is operating in Ireland.  That is what has brought the level of income increases here above what is supportable, and it is time that in decency we have the courage to change our attitude in this regard.</P>

      <P>No.  The agreement included full compensation for the rise between November, 1974, and February, 1975.  The next phase is a 5 per cent increase, not a six per cent. The earlier one of 8 per cent includes taxation which was necessary.</P>
      <P>The question has been asked why the Government adhered to the national agreement last April, if the terms were so undesirable economically. Firstly, it was signed by the Government in their capacity as employers.  The Government participated in negotiations of the national agreement because it is an employer, but, it is only one employer of all the employers involved in the Employer-Labour Conference.  At the time, despite the inflationary nature of the settlement which the Government warned about, we supported the view that a national agreement was preferable to a free for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you do it under duress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We considered that a national agreement is preferable to a free for all.  In April of this year, the economic indicators were not as unfavourable as they were in June.  I warned last January&mdash;I was probably the first Minister for Finance in the history of this country to give a warning&mdash;when I introduced one budget, that another budget might be necessary before the end of <Col N="1461" /> the year.  I warned that the economic situation globally and nationally, was so unstable that it was impossible to look into the economic crystal ball and determine what was the correct economic and fiscal policy to follow for 12 months ahead.  It is a reality that not only national governments but international organisations are in precisely the same position today, and have been during the last six months.</P>
      <P>It gives me small comfort to say that amongst the Ministers for Finance of the EEC, I was the most pessimistic last January.  Indeed in the autumn of last year I was the most critical of the failure of the surplus countries like Germany, Holland and the United States of America to reflate their economies.  My advice was brushed aside and even now, in June of 1975, Germany has to admit that the reflationary action which it has taken is not even enough to maintain the German economy at the level at which it operated in 1974.  They are in decline when they were anticipating a growth rate of 2 per cent.  That is some indication of the collapse of the world economic order as we knew it over the last decade.  The most up-todate economic assessments are less favourable than they were in January, or less favourable than they were in April last, and we cannot run away from the reality of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will, I hope, be clear from my opening speech that the crucial factor in the present serious situation is whether there is an adequate response in the Employer-Labour Conference to my request for a revision of the national agreement to match the measures which the Government are taking to wind down inflation.  The Government measures add up to a very substantial package: subsidies for CIE fares, bread, flour, butter, milk, town gas and the removal of VAT from electricity and other fuels, clothes, footwear were assigned to reduce the rise in the Consumer Price Index by 4 percentage points.  In addition, the Government are taking steps to protect and to boost employment by means of the premium employment programme, by adding £27 million to the capital programme and <Col N="1462" /> by encouraging the banks to put £40 million into housing.</P>
    <P>In return, the Government seek appropriate modifications of the third and fourth phases of the national agreement.  As I said on 26th June and repeat, it will not be possible for the Exchequer to meet the cost of the Government's package, as well as the cost of implementing the national agreement for the public sector as it stands at present.  Furthermore, the Government cannot proceed on the lines they have in mind at a time when workers generally are being asked to agree to a scaling down of the standard increases, if particular groups, especially those in secure employment, should insist upon special improvements in pay or conditions. Such improvements can only be secured at the expense of other groups.  We said that last November and it is as true in July, 1975, as it was in November, 1974.</P>
    <P>It would also give rise to serious social and industrial strains.  It would also by adding to costs run directly counter to the aim of slowing down the rate of price increase.  Accordingly, the Government have asked that any modification of the standard increases should be accompanied by an embargo on special increases.  We have expressed the hope that in addition in the national interest the parties would be able to reach quick agreement on this.</P>
    <P>In view of some criticisms that have been made, it is, in the Government's view, essential that there should be no misunderstanding of the Government's position.  What the Government have proposed is that there should be a deep discussion between the parties to the agreement, concerning in particular the third and fourth phases under the agreement.  I stressed on 26th June that it was essential to reach a conclusion in a matter of weeks, and a fortnight has since passed.  In the meantime, the Government felt that it would be inconsistent with their approach to approve further special improvements in pay and conditions in their own direct area in this short period.  If there is, as we hope for, an adequate <Col N="1463" /> response to the Government's proposals, the agreed new arrangements will apply to all workers, whether in the private or the public sector.  If not, the situation to which I specifically referred in my financial statement would arise.</P>
    <P>It has been wrongly suggested that the Government have been discriminating against public service employees. This argument ignores the reality that outside the public sector the question is not whether improvements will be granted on top of the standard increases provided in the national agreement but whether, indeed, the standard increases themselves can be met.  Many firms have pleaded, since the signing of the national agreement, their own inability to pay.  I wish to stress that there has been no unilateral suspension of agreed procedures.  These remain at the disposal of the staff and cover a wider range of matters than the ones I have mentioned.  It is highly probable that the issue of special increases generally will have been disposed of before, in the normal way, the question of giving a special concession to fresh arbitration findings arises.  These, then, were the proposals put before the parties to national agreement.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, there is a wide divergence between the attitude so far of the two sides.  The Executive Council of the ICTU have indicated that they have called a special delegate conference for the 31st July. They are recommending that the third and fourth stages of the national agreement be adjusted to provide an increase of 1 per cent in wages for every 1 per cent of the consumer price index and that such increases, unlike those in the existing agreement, would not be subject to minima or maxima.  They have expressed opposition to any amendment of the provision regarding special increases. On the other hand, the employers, while welcoming the removal of the floor of standard increases, considered that the ceiling of 5 per cent must be maintained.</P>
    <P>They have also stressed the burden which the implementation of equal <Col N="1464" /> pay would place on firms which are already finding great difficulty in surviving. At a time when so many of their members were finding it a severe strain to meet the standard increases of the national agreement, they fully supported the proposal on special increases. Obviously, there is a very wide gap between the parties.  Final decisions have yet to be taken.  Deputies will be aware that I am looking forward to meeting the two sides this weekend.  I have no wish, and I am sure no Member of the House has, to say anything which would in any way endanger the outcome of these very very serious deliberations.</P>
    <P>As far as equal pay is concerned, my colleague, the Minister for Labour, has indicated his willingness to give serious consideration to joint representations from trade unions and employers.  I shall, therefore, simply restate the choices facing us in the present economic difficulty.  We must wind down inflation if we are to protect jobs and ensure reasonable living standards for our people.  The Government package is aimed at slowing down the rise by 4 percentage points and by protecting jobs.  It would be impossible for the Exchequer to find resources to provide that package if they had to meet in full the terms of the national agreement, as they at present stand.  I am sure that in their deliberations over the next few days all concerned will be fully conscious of what is at stake for the community as a whole, and not merely for their own particular interests, in the decisions to be taken. It is a real test for our maturity as a nation.</P>
    <P>We are asking for restraints instead of imposing them because we prefer positive co-operation instead of negative dictation.  We have asked the better-off to pay a little more tax and we have trimmed that burden according to ability to pay and family responsibility. We are reducing the price of basic foods, public transport, electricity, gas, clothes and footwear. That gives relief to everybody.  We have been harsh on nobody.  We trust that the common sense of all will produce co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> Are we too trusting?  Are we wrong to strive for co-operation instead of confrontation?  Are we expecting too much of our modern society which rejects constraint, jeers patience and mocks self-denial?  If the Government's measures to beat inflation are not equalled by income restraints the fault will not lie with those measures but with attitudes and elements in our society.  The most fruitful and expeditious way to economic salvation is to have a right climate of opinion.  We are bending all our energies to create that opinion.  If we fail we will at least have had the satisfaction of trying.  We consider it is better to have failed, having tried, than not have tried at all.</P>
    <P>Do not tell us what we know, because we do not want to hear it, is an attitude which certainly prevails. But no problems of this world are settled by running away from them. We have asked all the people to face them together.  Most people realise the problems and are willing to face them.  The Government will not allow any sectional interest to frustrate that common will in the interest of the common welfare.  If any such interest causes problems the Government will not run away from them, the Government will face them.  The degree to which the people respond to the Government's suggestion for the revision of income expectation will have a strong bearing on whether or not more stringent measures will be necessary. We do not seek more stringent measures.  We seek co-operation and we look forward in confidence to a <Col N="1466" /> continuation of the deliberations which commenced following our budget proposals.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I say, with regret, that it seems that the budget speeches from the Opposition were opposition for opposition's sake.  They offered no assistance, no suggestions whatsoever in regard to our economic difficulties.</P>

      <P>Judging by their contributions in this debate they would do absolutely nothing.  They have done nothing except to accuse and abuse and it is to be hoped that in the difficulties that are immediately ahead they will act with a little more unanimity amongst themselves.  It must be a constant cause of embarrassment to my shadow spokesman opposite to have so many contradicting him.  I merely ask for a reduction in expenditure and a reduction in borrowing and a reduction in taxation for the Opposition to demand more and more expenditure.  When the Opposition have worked out their own economic policies let them come forward.  We will be interested.  The country is now working towards its economic salvation.  It is sad to find in these days the Opposition so wanting in any ideas at all.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Lands may not have heard the Minister for Finance's strictures that we had no suggestions to make.  Before progress was reported I was making a very positive suggestion to the Minister for Finance through the Minister for Lands who is piloting this Bill through on his behalf.  The point was that we were advocating the complete exemption of productive assets because of the reasons I gave.  We are all in agreement that the purpose of the Bill is to tax and, as a taxation measure, to treat equitably unproductive wealth which was accumulating in the hands of individuals or corporate persons in a way in which it would be just to tax them, and, secondly, that there was a good social reason for that policy, namely, the equitable distribution of wealth over the community, points that were made very strongly by the Minister for Finance himself.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the course of the argument with the Minister for Lands on this subsection that there is a considerable divergence of opinion when making that distinction.</P>
      <P>We sought to exempt agricultural property in the State or property used directly in the provision of employment in the State.  I pointed to the present economic position and the present employment position in support of my argument.  I am coming back to that now without undue repetition, I hope.  If that is not accepted as a very positive element of something the Opposition would do within the meaning of the Minister for Finance's strictures when closing his budget contribution, I might reply and say it is probably a much more practical one than some of the measures advocated in the said budget for the purpose of stimulating the economy and increasing the level of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> However, I do not wish to delay the House by a repetition of what I said before progress was reported, but I want the Minister to grasp clearly what I am saying.  On what grounds in the present situation can the Minister or the Government object to exempting agricultural property which is our basic industry and on which we all in the last analysis live, or what objection can he have to encouraging employment by relieving as far as possible the taxation on property that is used directly in the provision of employment within the State?  That passes my comprehension.  Furthermore, if the Minister says we are not serious in that purpose, to say the least of it he himself cannot be serious.</P>
    <P>I will go on now to the question of stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State.  This amendment really contains three related elements which I hope to integrate, namely, the exemption of property which is agricultural property; property which is used directly in the provision of employment in the State, and stocks and shares of a trading company trading within the State.  Take the trading company trading within the State.  In fact, everything within this amendment refers to something within the State.</P>
    <P>A trading company that is trading successfully does two things for the economy.  It is part of the economic activity of the community and as such it is a stimulant and a benefit to economic activity and it is almost certainly a stimulant to the provision of opportunities for employment, and in itself, probably supplies employment as well.  Remember that every unit, whether it is a trading company, a firm of individuals or a partnership or anything else that employs people, when the burden of costs comes upon them in a situation such as we have&mdash; and taxation is a burden of cost&mdash; the inevitable result is restriction in employment, that in seeking to control costs the opportunities for employment tend to be restricted.</P>
    <P>It starts possibly with restrictions of remuneration to workers through overtime and gradually works its way <Col N="1472" /> down to redundancies.  The point that is in this amendment is that in the three categories I have mentioned, although there are reliefs later in the Bill&mdash;I want to mention this so that the Minister will not accuse me of turning a blind eye to the effort to meet this problem&mdash;there is a difference between what he is going to do and the total exemption that we are seeking here in this section.  The very fact that the Minister later has provisions in regard to productive assets and matters of that nature, does give evidence of the recognition by the Minister of the principles I am talking about.  Therefore, if we are <i>ad idem</i> in the principle to even that extent&mdash; first of all, I cannot see how the Minister can accuse us of lack of seriousness and secondly, it comes to a question of how much and how far we should go, and we believe we should go the whole hog on this, and that is the kernel of it.</P>
    <P>The case for the first two items seems to be so clear that I need not press it further.  The question of stocks and shares of a trading company is a different matter.  A trading company is any productive company and particularly includes manufacturing companies and companies with large employment content, and the use of the word &ldquo;trading&rdquo; should not suggest, as it may do to some, that it is merely retail buying and selling or something of that nature.  It embraces the whole activity of trade. It embraces companies of high employment content and companies of the greatest importance for the community's economic activity.  I take it then that, in those cases, although the company's assets are not directly taxed, the wealth tax would be on the shareholders, unless it is a private non-trading company, aggregated with the rest of their wealth.  I take it that the market value of the shares would be the measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister may very easily appeal to that aspect of the case to support his opposition to this amendment. I would urge on him that it is not as simple as that.  First of all, on the question of flotation, supposing that a company is being floated and it is the first issue and allocation of <Col N="1473" /> shares, the very fact that there is a tax attachable to these shares will act as an inhibition on the foundation of that company.  In the same way and as a result of it it will be a brake upon the formation of that company. There are areas in this State where it is desirable that industries which are failing for various reasons should either be revived or reoriented and that the employees in these industries who will otherwise find themselves on the unemployed list should find suitable employment.  One element that helps to cope with that problem which is happening, as we all recognise, and leaving out completely what the causes are, is that if somebody forms a company to commence the new activity, that involves the issue of shares.  There might even be cases where the actual workers in a threatened industry have got together and have tried to form a company.</P>
    <P>In the inflation case, the fact that these shares are going to be in the hands of the shareholders aggregated for wealth tax purposes is a positive disincentive.  Exactly in the same way as in the old days of the issuing of loans by the State a very usual incentive up to very recently was that the loan would be redeemed for the purposes of death duty at par.  That is a good example of a fiscal provision which was designed to attract money to the loan.  In the same way I am suggesting that in so far as flotation is concerned, the attachment of the wealth tax to such shares is a disincentive. But put it the other way round.  Since this amendment is by way of exception and included in the exception, it is better regarded as an incentive to investment of this nature and it is in that positive sense that I would recommend it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say &ldquo;you are talking about flotation companies now.  The bulk of the shares that are involved are already issued and perhaps have changed hands on the Stock Exchange and so forth and are simply financial transactions.&rdquo;  There is substance in that argument but, on the other hand, it must be realised that the bulk of these shares that will be in question and the market value of these shares will be determined by <Col N="1474" /> the quotation on the Stock Exchange and that the value of the shares on the Stock Exchange has rather an important commercial advantage, particularly from the point of view of credit.  The value of the shares on the Stock Exchange closely reflects the trading situation of the company and the balance sheet.  It happens, frequently enough, that when a company is getting into difficulty the index of it is the value of its shares.  So far so good.</P>
    <P>The Minister may still say the only people affected are the shareholders. If he says that he is missing the vital point that in those situations the value of the shares is in effect, a measure of the liquidity of the company and as a measurement thereof is a measurement of the borrowing power of the company.  If, through taxation, there is a tendency to depress the value of the shares one is not promoting industrial activity.</P>
    <P>I concede to the Minister that this factor in the third element of the amendment is relatively remote but it is nevertheless real.  It appears to me, whether it is from the point of view of flotation or from the point of view of quotation that there is a case for the exemption of stocks and shares in an Irish trading company as well as in the case of agricultural activity and activities that are employed directly in the provision of employment.  To cavil at the second part, now I am going to evoke the argument of pratticality that I censured the Minister for on another amendment, but it arises.  The probability is that in all cases of importance the case will be captured not by the last cause alone but by a combination of the second and third factors.  In other words, not only is the amendment desirable in the cases which are likely to occur on the ground that the stocks and shares are in a trading company but also on the ground that in the case of the trading company the property is being used directly for the provision of employment.  In fact, in practice, practically all cases would be covered.</P>
    <P>We are very serious.  We are certainly <i>ad idem</i> on the principle up to a point.  I think the Minister can claim that we are <i>ad idem</i> on everything.  We <Col N="1475" /> are <i>ad idem</i> to the extent that we are agreed about non-productive property, we seem to be agreed, in principle anyway, that productive property requires exemption, but the Minister is only giving a modicum of exemption. We believe that the whole policy should be, in regard to productive assets, total exemption for the reasons we have given.  That completes my argument.</P>
    <P>I conclude with reference to what has been said by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Colley, namely that it is very hard to understand, in the case of productive assets, why there should be a distinction, what amounts to a disablement, I might even say a penalty, but why there should be a distinction between the Irish citizen and somebody outside?  That seems to arise on this, too, and why that distinction should be to the prejudice of our own people.  I leave that as a separate argument, made separately and cogently by my colleagues.  On the general principle I have indicated to the Minister the reason why I think he is unfair to us in suggesting that we are not serious, I hope I have given some reasons why not only are we serious but why, in principle, the course we have advocated from the beginning on this Bill should be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Before we adjourned at tea time the Minister for Lands was speaking about the fact that we were not sincere about this amendment. He mentioned that we only put this amendment forward for a political reason.  He also mentioned that only for the fact that the guillotine has now been introduced we would probably be bringing our troops into the lobbies on this amendment for a political reason.  I can assure the Minister that where I am concerned, whether I am a Deputy or a private citizen, I object to two types of taxes in this country&mdash;one in favour of a foreign company and one that discriminates against myself personally. I object, secondly as a Deputy, in this House because I disagree with the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> The Minister was confusing the issues before tea when he said that this particular type of concession was always there as regards death duties. He mentioned that investments in this country in post offices and banks were exempt from income tax.  There is no comparison between these two types of taxes&mdash;a wealth tax on profit.  Any Deputy in this House, who is aware at all of this emotive type of Bill must be aware of what the reaction will be when certain people in this country realise, due to the way this Bill is drafted that shareholders in foreign companies holding a trading company in this country are exempt from wealth tax and that an Irish shareholder holding a trading company in this country is subject to wealth tax.  That is the net position, whether we like it or not. The Minister should not think for one moment that he can confuse the issue as regards death duties and foreign investments in banks and post offices in this country.  Deputy de Valera has made an excellent case as regards exempting agriculture.  I thoroughly agree with him that it should be exempted. Agriculture and everything in that line should be exempted, but agriculture is exempted for certain types of people.  It is exempt for any foreign company that purchases land. They are not subject to wealth tax. Could the Minister explain to me how they are not exempt?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If the Minister suggests that an Irish or foreign company in this <Col N="1477" /> country buy land and be subject to wealth tax I will accept that from the Minister, but perhaps he will tell me the section under which this is so.</P>
      <P>I am talking about the average Irish individual, who has built up this country let him be in any type of business, manufacturing, the hotel industry, supermarket and so on&mdash; who has invested his money and given his knowledge and expertise to a particular type of business and is fortunate enough to expand it.  As the Bill is drafted, he will be subject to wealth tax, but, if he happened to have been born on the Continent or in America and is a shareholder in a company which has invested in a trading company in this country and purchased a hotel, a supermarket, a licensed premises, a grocery or a drapery shop he would be exempt.  I disagree with the principle that one section of business people should be subject to wealth tax by virtue of the fact that they are domiciled in this country, but I want to make it perfectly clear that I welcome investment by those other people and I do not want to be accused of discouraging foreign investment.</P>
      <P>In a small country like ours it is a bad principle.  We are so closely knit that this will have a psychological effect&mdash;foreign shareholders of a trading company here being exempt from wealth tax.  Many business people are not aware of that yet.  Let us look at the competitive standing of two companies in a manufacturing business. We know only too well that manufacturers are operating on very small profits today, but take a foreign company which has a trading company in this country and which establishes a factory&mdash;let it be in Cork or Dublin or elsewhere&mdash;manufacturing a product. Maybe they have an investment of £2 million in that company&mdash;it is not unusual for a factory today to have such an investment&mdash;and take the opposite situation, an Irish company formed with the same capital of £2 million manufacturing the same kind of product.  Being Irish shareholders, they are subject to wealth tax.  Surely in all equity there is an injustice here to the Irish shareholder or Irish national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> The Minister will tell me that the company is not taxed but I would refute that immediately in case he comes forward with that argument. We know the company is not taxed, but the two or three, eight or ten shareholders, who might have £200 each or £200,000 in this company will be subject to wealth tax.  The other company by virtue of the fact that it is a foreign company is exempt.  I believe that is basically wrong and no one will convince me otherwise.  It will discourage the Irish-formed company.</P>
    <P>We may find ourselves at a stage where people have to think seriously as regards being domiciled in this country.  It is obvious that a managing director who owns 75 per cent of a foreign company can easily reside here for one or two days short of six months and by virtue of the fact that he is not domiciled, he will not be subject to wealth tax.  If there was a considerable amount of money involved, it would be natural for the Irish national, on this level of business, to purchase a house abroad, leave this country, and give up being domiciled here.  He could purchase another house in some other country and keep both houses going for the amount of wealth tax he would pay.  The Minister said this could not happen and is only nonsense, but it can happen.</P>
    <P>Basically what I am against is the principle that one company or individual running a business is subject to wealth tax and another business half a mile down the road is not.  I can see it developing in this city as soon as this Bill comes into operation. I know companies that own business in the city who will be exempt from wealth tax.  We do not have to stretch our imagination too far to know who they are.  I know of other companies engaged in the same business and one will be subject to wealth tax and the other will not.  Surely that is an undesirable climate to create in a country such as ours.  This can happen where hotels are concerned.  There are groups of hotels which are Irishowned, developed by Irish people and expanded down through the years, giving considerable employment.  We do not have to spell out the conditions <Col N="1479" /> of the tourist trade or of hoteliers financially today.  In my opinion.  Irish hoteliers have done a good job and more luck to them, but because they are domiciled here and are Irish shareholders they will be subject to wealth tax.  I know hotels in this city and hotels in other parts of the country which will be exempt. That is undesirable.  It is frustrating for the Irish company who have contributed so much in the past. They now find themselves discriminated against; there is no other way in which I can describe it.  They are being discriminated against because they are Irish.  The same thing will happen in regard to supermarkets.  There are chains of supermarkets that are Irish owned and the Minister knows the narrow profit margins on which they are operating at present.  There are also supermarkets that are foreign owned and they will be exempt because of this provision.  In that type of situation, where a company is operating on a very tight margin against competition from a foreign owned company which is not subject to wealth tax, the logical conclusion is that there will be a takeover by a foreign company.  I could go on and on about situations that will develop in every line of business I know because we have exempted foreign-owned companies.  We fought against this proposal.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done about this Bill.  It is a hopeless Bill.  It never should have come into the House, and talking here until Christmas would not make it right.  The Minister is now creating a situation which will affect the average businessman in a way in which he was never affected before.  The Minister puts forward arguments about death duties, and investment fears where income tax was stopped.  But people did not know about it.  That is the important thing. I can have a business in any part of Dublin and I can meet my friends on social occasions and we can have a discussion on this Wealth Tax Bill.  I will say I am subject to wealth tax because I was born in this country. <Col N="1480" /> My friend will say: &ldquo;That is unfortunate for you.  I am not subject to wealth tax because I have a foreign company which has a trading company in this city and I do not have to pay wealth tax&rdquo;.  Does the Minister think I will accept that?  That is the basic principle to which I object. There are many other parts of the Bill I consider undesirable but, if there is any one section in the Bill that is offensive to an Irish national, it is the particular section that discriminates against him.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister most sincerely to accept Deputy Colley's amendment. Deputy Colley confines the amendment to productive assets and Deputy de Valera has put the case very well that it is non-productive assets we want considered.  I go along with the Minister in regard to non-productive assets.  The thinking behind the drafting of this Wealth Tax Bill was to distribute non-productive assets and to encourage people either to dispose of them or, as the Bill will do now, take a certain amount from them. Non-productive assets are bad for a country and we should encourage people to change them into productive assets, even if they have to dispose of them.  Non-productive assets in other fields should certainly be taxed also because they contribute very little to the economic expansion of a country.  Deputy de Valera put that case very, very clearly and I accept it. Wealth of this kind is of no great benefit to the country and is of no great benefit to employment.</P>
    <P>We should concern ourselves with productive assets.  They are a different thing altogether.  We want to get productive assets moving.  We know how difficult it is to promote industry.  We know that the unemployment figure is still rising.  The Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Labour have been making efforts to improve the situation but they have not been very successful.  If anyone tells me that the Wealth Tax Bill is an incentive for people to invest in productive assets he will not succeed in convincing me for one moment.</P>
    <P>At this particular time in our economy, when we are struggling to get <Col N="1481" /> people back to work, we should be encouraging people to invest.  We should be encouraging foreigners to come here and establish industries here.  If people have funds abroad they should bring them back and invest them here.  That is the line we should be pursuing.  This would be a positive approach.  This is the worst economic crisis we ever had.  The Minister for Finance brought in a budget designed to tackle inflation and help the economy generally.  This had to be done, but I do not agree that the budget will be successful.  I hope it will, but I doubt it very much.</P>
    <P>We must decide on how we can get the economy moving again.  We must reduce our rate of inflation.  We must reduce our unit costs and improve our exports.  We must be more efficient in our methods and, above all, we must create a climate favourable to industrial development.  Industrial development is the one thing that will save our country.  We know a considerable number of people will leave the land. The Minister is getting the opportunity to make some gesture towards relieving the present economic situation. The Minister for Finance decided to meet the trade unions and the employers about the economic crisis.  This was no easy job.  We know only too well the problems facing our economy. There are problems of rising prices, of raw materials and their effect in the costs of production.  It is very difficult for companies to keep afloat at all.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why this Bill should have been brought before this House at this time.  Does the Minister think it will encourage any businessman to come here when he reads in the paper that we are forcing a Wealth Tax Bill through this House as a matter of urgency, that it must be through by the 30th July?</P>
    <P>Ask any business man what that will contribute to his factory or to solving his problems.  Will this Wealth Tax Bill, or this section in which we are trying to exempt him reduce his labour costs?  Will it reduce his unit costs and make him more competitive? Will it contribute to efficiency within his factory?  Of course the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  It will have entirely <Col N="1482" /> the opposite effect.  It will add to his unit cost.  Whether we like it or not, people will have to pay this wealth tax out of their net profits or they will have to sell off part of their assets.  I cannot see how anyone can pay a wealth tax exempt by those two devices.</P>
    <P>Take a man making £X,000 in his trading profits.  We only know too well what our trading profits are today when all expenses have been met. Taking the thresholds and everything else into consideration&mdash;I know perfectly well what the thresholds are&mdash; the remaining wealth tax has to be paid out of net profit.  If a man is making £8,000, £10,000 or £5,000, this wealth tax must be paid out of his net profit.  If it is not paid out of the net profit, the Minister might tell me later on where the money is to come from.  You have to sell off part of the asset.  You do not have to stretch your imagination to see that is just not possible.  If the Minister's idea of distributing wealth is to cut down the asset bit by bit to pay the wealth tax, I do not think that will be very advantageous to the economic situation of this country.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that this wealth tax will be paid out of net profits and, in some way or other, it will be passed on to the customer, whether the Minister likes it or not.  It will be passed on to the unit costs in the manufacturing business and it will go right down to the consumer.  That is the situation when you levy a wealth tax on productive assets operating on a close margin.  I have pointed out already that manufacturing companies are operating on a very tight margin at the moment.  Many companies are barely keeping their heads above water.  One of the Minister's intentions was to try to overcome this problem as regards unit costs and to reduce unit costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept Deputy Colley's amendment, and exempt agricultural property and productive assets from this wealth tax.  Apart from the principle involved, which I object to more than anything else, the fact that it is being applied to a manufacturing company operating on a tight margin is bound to have a detrimental <Col N="1483" /> effect.  It will push up the costings of that company.  No one on any side of the House will persuade me that it will not push up the costings of a company.  People will say: &ldquo;That company is not taxed; it is only the shareholders&rdquo;.  The shareholders require a return on their investment. The manager of that company will tell them the following year when the final accounts are produced: &ldquo;We have to reduce the dividend because a certain amount of wealth tax has to be paid&rdquo;. The shareholders will tell that manager or managing director to do something about it very quickly.  He will increase the unit costs to bring back the same dividend.  The Minister had to go out of his way to exempt foreign capital.  If we fail to get an inflow of foreign capital we will never rectify our unemployment problem.  If there is any hope of rectifying it, it is through the inflow of foreign capital. We are completely uncapitalised.  The Minister had to do that.  He had no choice.  We welcome the fact that foreign capital is exempt but we want productive assets in the hands of Irish shareholders exempt.  They are entitled to that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most crucial amendment which has been or could be put down to this Bill.  If accepted it would, I believe, make the wealth tax generally acceptable to most people.  If rejected it will not only confirm those who object to the whole idea of the wealth tax in their objection, but it will in course of time cause a great deal of unrest as more and more people personally feel the consequences of what is being done in this Bill in the absence of this amendment, not in the sense of how much they will have to pay in wealth tax but in the sense of what it will do to their jobs and their standards of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a great deal of nonsense from Government supporters from time to time about a wealth tax. All sorts of efforts were made to obscure what is really being done in the Wealth Tax Bill.  We had talk about equity, about redistribution of <Col N="1484" /> wealth and other similar catch phrases.  Of course, even the name of the proposed tax, wealth tax, is designed to create a certain climate of envy and make people think that the only people who will be affected by this Bill will be people who are very wealthy.  Of course, anybody who has studied the Bill knows this is not true, knows that it will affect every man, woman and child.</P>
    <P>However, apart from those who object in principle to the whole idea of a wealth tax, there are a number of people who take the view that, if one pays tax when one is acquiring property whether by way of income, or inheritance, or gift&mdash;if one pays in that way, whatever way one acquires property&mdash;one should not then be taxed again on top of that as a penalty for saving.  Such people would never accept a wealth tax even if this amendment were accepted.  The bulk of people would accept it, if they were satisfied that the wealth tax was being applied to what, in effect, are described in the Bill as non-productive assets.  I say &ldquo;in effect&rdquo; because section 10 purports to give reliefs in respect of productive assets. In fact the side note says &ldquo;net market value of productive property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is based on section 10 which purports to deal with productive property.  The first part of section 10 deals with agricultural land, with fishing boats and hotels.  I included agricultural land in this amendment because there could in some circumstances be an argument as to whether it is being used directly in the provision of employment in the State. I do not think such an argument can be made in regard to fishing boats or hotels, but if it could I would be prepared to accept an amendment of this amendment so as to include them.</P>
    <P>A later part of section 10 also deals precisely with what is mentioned here, property used directly in the provision of employment.  The same portion of section 10 deals with stocks and shares of a trading company.  I have provided in the amendment in each case that we are relating it to property in the State, whether it is agricultural land, property used directly <Col N="1485" /> in the provision of employment, or to stocks and shares of a trading company. All of them under the terms of the amendment are confined to operations within the State.  The object of the amendment is to exempt from wealth tax productive assets, assets being used productively.  By assets being used productively, of course, we mean assets which, as a result of their use, are creating employment and are a contribution to growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the need for this amendment would be self-evident, given our economic circumstances. I think it is evident to most people except the Government. We have heard from time to time from members of the Government and their supporters of the position regarding forms of wealth tax in other countries, in the EEC for instance. There are, of course, much larger and much richer countries than we are in the EEC which have no such tax.  In the case of those who have, the various taxes differ both in the scope of their application, in their rates and so on, but the real question to ask if one is to make such a comparison is how does our economy compare with theirs?  Will the imposition of a wealth tax on productive assets in our economy help or hinder the growth of our economy, the creation of employment, the maintenance of employment?</P>
    <P>I would suggest that nobody can, with any degree of sincerity or credibility, argue that the application of wealth tax to productive assets can in any way assist our economy, can in any way provide employment except maybe for people in the Revenue Commission or can in any way maintain employment.</P>
    <P>If we find that we have now reached the stage where the Government are going to pay £12 a week to an employer for every job that he creates for somebody who is on the dole&mdash; that is what the Government are proposing&mdash;how can one reconcile that with applying a wealth tax to the same employers, the people who are investing their money?  Let us be clear on that.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed as far <Col N="1486" /> as possible to cover the range of productive assets I have indicated.  I do not care whether they are held in a company, an individual or anything else.  What we are talking about is people investing money in agriculture, manufacturing, distribution or any other form of economic activity which creates employment and contributes to the growth of our economy.  When you get down to it, it is individuals you are talking about.  It is individuals who make the decisions.  It is individuals who own the money.  It is individuals who decide whether they will take the risk to invest it or not.  If those individuals decide they are not going to invest, they are not going to take the risk, our economy plummets down and down.  That is a reality.</P>
    <P>Another reality is that the Government now propose in this Bill to apply to those persons, be they shareholders in companies or not, a wealth tax on the money which they have invested, which they are risking in this way. I must confess I have been unable to understand the thinking behind this. Of course I understand the cheap political effort involved, the politics of envy involved, the effort to try and convince people who do not have very much of this world's goods that &ldquo;there is a crowd of them there who are fat cats, with a whole lot of money, and we are going to take it from them and we are going to give it to you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course I understand that lowclass brand of politics, but I would have thought that the Government would have a little more intelligence than that in the sense that they would not underestimate the intelligence of the Irish people.  Our people know the kind of economy we have, a mixed one, which cannot survive and their jobs cannot survive unless there are people who are prepared to invest their money in productive assets and take risks.  No amount of propaganda will mislead people for very long as to what the reality is.  The Government of course have been making this propaganda effort.  We have heard them talk about redistribution of wealth.  What redistribution of wealth is involved in this, may I ask?  The best <Col N="1487" /> estimate available from the Minister for Finance as to the yield is £1½ million a year.  When pressed he admitted that the redistribution that would take place would be from one member of a family to another.  It will certainly not take place between the rich and the poor.  Of that we can be certain.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose for a moment that there was a real redistribution of wealth involved in it.  Would it not be necessary for any Government with any shared of responsibility before embarking on a task of any kind which would bring about a genuine redistribution of wealth, unlike this one, to measure the other consequences flowing from that proposed tax?  How much measurement did the Government do on the economic consequences of bringing in a wealth tax on the productive assets of this country?  Did they do any?  We know already the damage that has been caused by this proposal and this Bill before it is in operation at all, we cannot measure the degree of damage that has been done, but there must be few who do not have personal knowledge of the damage that has been done as a direct consequence of this proposal.  Let us assume the Bill is in operation and let us assume the wealth tax is to be applied to productive assets, it follows as the night the day that the application of the wealth tax will increase the cost and overheads of business in general, be it manufacturing, distributing or anything else.  There is no escaping this. Whether the yield is small or large, of course, has some relevance in this regard.  If the yield were enormous then the increase in the cost of business would be enormous.  If the yield is relatively small it could be said that the increase in cost would be relatively small.  The question is, can business bear any further increase in cost at the moment?  Secondly, should it be asked to bear increased costs in the present economic climate or should we not take the other approach, which the Government are adopting with the other hand in the budget, saying: &ldquo;Here is £12 per week for every man you employ additionally&rdquo;? <Col N="1488" /> Will this help our economy?</P>
    <P>What will be the consequences if tax of this kind is imposed?  Even if the yield is relatively small the climate which the tax creates when it is applied, as is proposed, to productive assets is one which is totally negative in so far as trying to get our economy moving; it is a climate which inhibits investment because the reality is that people who have enough money to invest will ask themselves if it is worth while if they will be taxed at this rate, particularly when they see no provision for inflation. They anticipate that inflation will continue and the thresholds will automatically be brought down, that even a Government sometime in the future might actively move to bring down the thresholds and increase the rates. All of this is being applied to productive assets.</P>
    <P>I do not have figures available&mdash;it is unlikely that the Minister has either &mdash;which would distinguish between the yield to be got from productive assets, on the one hand, and nonproductive on the other, but I am certain of this, that the great bulk of money which it is expected to obtain from the wealth tax will come from productive assets, from assets which are employed in giving jobs and creating growth in our economy.  The two things we need more than anything else are growth and employment. They go together.</P>
    <P>I have been urging on the Government for a very long time the necessity of taking steps to encourage growth in our economy.  These measures would include tackling inflation and so on.  We know how the Government failed to listen and so the situation got out of hand.  But even the Government have now acknowledged by their employment premium proposals the dire necessity of tackling this problem of unemployment. What kind of coherent policy is this?  What kind of consistency is there if, on the one hand, the Minister for Finance is applying a wealth tax to productive assets on which employment and growth depend and on the other, and at the same time, he is <Col N="1489" /> proposing to give an employment premium in respect of each new job created for the man on the dole?  What kind of nonsense is this?  How much of the employment premium does the Minister hope to get back in wealth tax?  How much of the good which he hopes to do with the employment premium will he do away with by the wealth tax?  Could we have some kind of sensible, coherent approach to the enormous economic problems which the country is facing, the worst economic situation it has faced for a very long time?</P>
    <P>At a time when the Government ought to direct all their efforts to getting our economy moving, to creating employment, we have this kind of nonsense which is designed to make industry less competitive by increasing its costs and at the same time the Government propose to hand out an employment premium to people who will be charged wealth tax, in order to encourage them to give employment. There is no logic, no consistency, no coherence in this approach.  I do not believe the Minister for Lands, who has the unenviable task of trying to justify this approach, with his undoubted skill and ingenuity, will be able to give any reasonable answer to the accusation of total incoherence of the Government's approach in this matter.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect with which Deputy Fitzpatrick dealt at some length.  I want to refer to it briefly because it is very relevant here.  The Minister has claimed consistently that there is no disincentive in the Bill to foreign investment because, he says, in the great bulk of cases they will not be liable to the wealth tax.  How do the Minister for Lands and the Government suggest that they should justify the kind of discrimination involved here and highlighted by Deputy Fitzpatrick in a number of instances.  One being the two hotels standing side by side, one of them subject to a wealth tax because it is owned by Irish citizens, one of them exempt because it is effectively owned by foreigners?  That is just one example.  There are many others <Col N="1490" /> chosen by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  How is it proposed to justify that argument? There is no justification, above all, in our economic circumstances.  Even at the time when Fianna Fáil were leaving office, when our economy was really developing, when unemployment was falling and we were putting an end to emigration, even at that time the relative weakness of our economy compared with our EEC partners would indicate to anyone with one iota of commonsense that the last thing we needed was a wealth tax on productive assets.</P>
    <P>But now, when the situation is so appalling, when in the middle of the year when employment should be at the peak, we have 101,000 unemployed, when our inflation is virtually out of control and when the prospects in the private sector and, as indicated by the Minister for Finance today in concluding the budget speech, the prospects for our economy are as gloomy as they could be&mdash;they are getting worse&mdash;in those circumstances, who would think of putting on a wealth tax on productive assets? There is nothing crazier that can be done.  There can only be one reason for it, duo-politics in the worse sense of that word; playing politics, playing to people's sense of greed.  Thank God, it is a mistaken ploy, it is one which is not working and it will rebound on the Government in a way they thoroughly deserve because our people are sufficiently intelligent to know that their jobs and their standard of living depend on productive assets being invested, made to work and to create growth.  If the Government now propose, as they do in this Bill, in the absence of this amendment we are discussing, to apply wealth tax to those very productive assets, which are creating the jobs and creating the growth, our people know that that is as stupid, as silly and as irresponsible a thing as any Government could do.  Knowing that, if the Government persist in applying wealth tax to productive assets, they will reap the whirlwind and no matter how serious that whirlwind is, a Government which do such a thing deserve everything they get.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As far back as the 12th March last, this House accepted the principle of imposing a wealth tax by a majority and it sent this Bill from the Second Stage Reading to Committee Stage. The principle involved in the Bill, the general advisability of imposing the wealth tax, was discussed at length and the House, by a majority, approved of the principle involved.  The Committee Stage was duly taken up and when we came to section 2, which lends itself to a general discussion, we had another Second Stage debate, which lasted most of 20 hours, on the principle of imposing a wealth tax. The discussion on that section, which involved nothing more or less than the principle of imposing a wealth tax, was discussed over a period of between 18 and 20 hours.  In order to bring that discussion to a conclusion it was necessary to move that the question be put.  The House again endorsed the principle of imposing a wealth tax.</P>
      <P>The Government have found it necessary, in order to get the work of the Dáil done, to operate a time limit.  By a majority, a time table has been imposed and a reasonable time, up to Thursday of next week, has been allocated for Committee Stage work on this Bill.  So far as I am concerned, I am satisfied that the Bill, as it stands, with the amendments which I will introduce and which will be put from the Chair at the appropriate time, are adequate to perfect the Bill before it leaves this House.  However, one would expect that the Opposition would like to go through the Bill. There is ample time.  There is this evening, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next to get through the remaining 20 sections of this Bill, in a Committee Stage manner.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 7, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, there are one or two matters on which I would appreciate clarification.  The Minister knows the section contains an exemption for a &ldquo;dwelling house or part of a dwelling house, to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession and which is occupied by him as his only or principal residence&rdquo; and there is also an exemption in respect of the household effects, the normal contents of the dwelling house.  The point I should like to put to the Minister is this: with a house which is owned by a company, but is wholly owned, in the commonly accepted sense of that phrase, by an individual who is living in the dwelling house, does the Minister think that such exemption should be given both in respect of the dwelling house and the contents of it in those circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that there is no provision and I am wondering whether or not there should be provision for that.  There could be circumstances in which the Minister would find this objectionable but there could also be circumstances in which it would be unreasonable not to allow it.  It seems to me that in a genuine case such would happen.  I would assume, for instance, that if the company concerned were a private non-trading company, the Minister would not be very happy about the position but if, in fact, it were a trading company which owned the dwelling house and the individual who was the owner of the great bulk of the shares in the trading company was living in the dwelling house as its principal or only resident, would the Minister not think that in such circumstances the exemption should be given?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The position is that the company, of course, as I keep saying, is not liable to tax.  The shares are liable to tax if their value exceeds the threshold. The only three persons who are taxable under the Bill are the discretionary trust, the private non-trading company and the individual. If the individual in the case quoted by the Deputy owns all the shares in the company, for all practical purposes, and the company owns the house, and the individual is living in the house, it would be a comparatively simple operation to transfer the house to the individual and then, of course, he would get the threshold and the exemption.</P>

In regard to the question of normal contents, I do not intend to embark &mdash;which one could easily do&mdash;on a series of, I will not say ridiculous examples, but fairly extreme examples of what would or would not be in this. I take it that such a thing as moveable chattels, such as a motor car for instance, which are normally stored in a house would not be part of the normal contents.  In the case of people who have a particular interest in shotguns and special kinds of guns and have a collection, would the Minister say that in certain circumstances those people could have them accepted as part of the normal contents?  It might be a bit ominous for the Revenue Commissioners if they refused to accept that contention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise what I regard as a very serious aspect of this Bill on this portion of the section. First of all, I will put it in general terms to see if the Minister agrees with the proposition I am putting forward.  It is this: we should ensure in so far as it is humanly possible to do it that under this Bill there will be no discrimination either in favour of or against the public sector on the one hand or the private sector on the other.  I mean individuals working in the public sector on the one hand, or an individual or individuals engaged or working in the private sector on the other.  Would he agree with that proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Generally speaking, that is an acceptable proposition, taking everything into consideration; taking all relevant considerations into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I want to do.  Would the Minister also agree that in so far as the private sector is concerned, paragraph (e) sets out to exempt from liability to wealth tax superannuation rights which a person may have established?  I am speaking now of the private sector.  Take a self-employed man who contributes to an insurance scheme to give himself a pension on retirement.  In general, this paragraph is exempting his right to relieve such pension from liability for wealth tax, but I think I am right in saying that the maximum to which a man in that position&mdash;a self-employed person&mdash;can go and get relief from income tax for it is to contribute <Col N="1502" /> a sum not exceeding £1,500 per annum as a premium.  If he wishes, in the scheme to which he is contributing, to make provision for inflation, he cannot under the Revenue Commissioners' regulations get approval for any scheme which makes provision for more than 5 per cent inflation.</P>
      <P>To give an idea of how this works out&mdash;the Minister may be quite familiar with it, but I am not sure whether he is or not&mdash;the Incorporated Law Society would offer to its members a scheme of superannuation. Under that scheme, a solicitor aged 55 years who makes a maximum contribution of £1,500 per annum to provide a lump sum and pension on his own retirement at 65 years of age, will receive at 65 a tax free capital sum of £6,408 and an annuity for life of £2,907.  A solicitor who would be making the same contribution for 20 years&mdash;that is, he starts at the age of 45&mdash;and contributes £1,500 per annum until he is 65, will receive on retirement a tax free lump sum of £7,678 and an annuity for life of £3,481.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if we look at the position of people in the public service the position is quite different. Let me make it clear, as I did before in this House when I referred to this matter, that while the figures I am about to quote relate only to the grades I am talking about, and they are considerably higher than they would be say, in the case of former Ministers, nevertheless the principle involved is the same.  On this basis if we take the present salaries of the Secretary of a Department who is aged 55 and is due to retire in ten years at the age of 65, we find that on retirement he is entitled to a lump sum of one and a half times his highly geared salary, his present salary being approximately £11,000 per annum.  In addition to the lump sum of one and a half times his final year's salary he is entitled to a pension of 50 per cent of his final year's salary.  Between now and retirement, if his salary follows the pattern it has been following in recent years, it will more or less keep pace with inflation.  When he retires <Col N="1503" /> his pension will also be adjusted in line with inflation.  When I say in line with inflation I mean in line with the general level of pay in the public service which now more or less follows that in relation to national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>If we assume an average rate of inflation of 15 per cent per annum over the next ten years&mdash;it may be a generous assumption&mdash;but if we assume that, on retirement his salary would be £44,500 per annum and he would be entitled to a pension of £22,250 at the age of 65.  The capital value on retirement of that person, assuming it is going to keep pace with inflation at an average rate of 15 per cent per annum would be £321,000.  I should emphasise that that capital sum is based on the assumption that the capital sum can be invested to produce a yield equal to a rate of inflation of 15 per cent per annum.  If, in fact, such a yield could not be produced, then the shortfall would, of course, increase the capital sum required.  If for instance, the yield was only 13 per cent per annum as against an average rate of inflation of 15 per cent per annum the capital sum required would be £370,000 and, correspondingly, if the shortfall is greater the capital sum required is greater.  These sums I am quoting are actuarial figures based on the life expectancy of a person in normal health and having regard to his age of retirement, 65.  It is important to understand that no insurer or financial institution would take on such risks.  As I have said, the Revenue Commissioners in the schemes which they approve limit the rate at which provision may be made for inflation to 5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>There is no way in which a private individual either, say, a self-employed professional man or the owner of a business, could make provision for himself which would provide the guarantees which are built into the employment of a person in the public service.  The capital sums I have referred to assume that the investments would earn a gross rate of interest calculated on that rate whereas, of course, the person in the private sector simply <Col N="1504" /> cannot do that because he is taxed on the interest which he gets from the investment. He cannot get the kind of gross yield I have been talking about.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I have no objection whatever to the provision made for retirement and pension in the public service.  In fact, I contributed personally to some extent in the provision of parity for public service pensioners.  It is right that that should be done.  I would like to see and have given a good deal of thought to how it might be achieved, the same kind of parity for outside the public service.  It is an extremely difficult problem.  I want to make it clear that I think it is right and proper that there should be the kind of provision for retirement in the public service that there is.  No objection at all to that. It is not the point with which I am concerned.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned with is that there is not anything like equality of treatment in this section in regard to provision for retirement between those in the public service and those in the private sector.  If one considers the degree of security in the job of the person employed in the public service, this is another factor which must be weighed against the position of the person in the private sector who lacks the same degree of security in his job, who cannot under any circumstances go anywhere near the kind of provision for retirement that is available in the public service and who is limited under the schemes which are mentioned in this section in a way that ensures that the provision for his retirement is far inferior to that of a person in the public service at a comparable level of earnings.</P>
    <P>The implications of this are quite serious because what we are doing in this Bill is imposing a wealth tax which will affect directly in many cases people who are self-employed and depending on the amount they can amass or can invest to provide for their retirement.  I am suggesting that it is unfair and unjust that there should be this grave inequality in treatment between the person in the public service and the person in the private sector.  I am not suggesting <Col N="1505" /> that this is deliberate.  What I am suggesting is that the Minister should not allow this Bill to go through the House containing that inequality. Adequate provision ought to be made taking an overall view of the Bill to go as far as one humanly can&mdash;as I said before one cannot achieve absolute equality&mdash;to try to ensure that the overall impact of the wealth tax will be such that will get reasonable equality between the public and private sector.</P>
    <P>It will, I hope, be obvious to everybody that that capital sum which I quoted in the case of the Secretary of a Department would, of course, be liable to substantial wealth tax given all the thresholds in the Bill.  There has been emotive talk in connection with this Bill about the thresholds being so high that you are only getting at people who have enormous sums of money.  The reality is that people in the public service who are not regarded as wealthy, God knows, in fact because they have these provisions for retirement are the owners of what is the equivalent of very large capital sums which we are proposing, rightly in my view, in this section to exempt from wealth tax.  It is quite right that that should be done. Equally, there ought to be equivalent exemption for those persons in the private sector to enable them to make a reasonably comparable provision for their retirement.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The next thing I want to say is that I am sure the Deputy did not intend to be mischievous when he drew a distinction between the public sector and the private sector because that is not, in fact, what he was doing.  He was drawing a distinction between the employed and the self-employed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy was drawing a distinction between employed and the self-employed. I do not want to start mentioning names of companies but there could be many companies in the State with equally generous pension schemes and they would be exempt under the section.</P>
      <P>Again, Deputy Colley took the example of a secretary of a Department who has been contributing to a superannuation fund for many years, who has been in the same employment from 18 or 20 years of age until his retirement at 65.  He compared that situation with the position of a self-employed person who first enters a superannuation scheme at 55 years of age in the first case he mentioned and 45 years of age in the second case. That is not a reasonable comparison.</P>
      <P>My reading of the Bill is that it exempts the capital value of all superannuation payments.  If Deputy Colley has a grievance it is not one with this particular Bill but a grievance with the income tax code, which limits the amount that can be claimed by way of allowance by a person who is contributing to a superannuation fund or for an annuity.  If Deputy Colley will pardon me for saying so, if he felt that strongly about it, he had an opportunity, when he was Minister for Finance, of amending it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here a storm in a teacup. The argument that Deputy Colley is making would have some validity if the State were providing the superannuation in each case but that is not so.  The State is only contributing to a superannuation fund in one case, that is in respect of its employees. The Bill goes on to say that any superannuation, regardless of amount, is not subject to wealth tax.  If Deputy <Col N="1507" /> Colley has any grievance&mdash;I do not think he has&mdash;it is that the State is too generous to its employees and he specifically stated that he was not making that case.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I accept that.  Then he has no grievance. The State does not put any barrier on the amount of superannuation that anybody else may have, in the private sector or in the self-employed sector.  If the Deputy has any grievance it is in respect of the relief which may be claimed under the income tax code.  That is a matter for another Bill and another day.  He had an opportunity of dealing with that when he was Minister but he did not do it.</P>
      <P>We could have had a better discussion on this matter if Deputy Colley had put down an amendment, not necessarily pluperfect in draftmanship, but one which would indicate the shortcomings, if any, which he saw and his rough suggestions for improvement but he did not do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Minister's point here.  Let us get a number of points straight.  First of all, there is no storm about this matter either in a teacup or anywhere else. The second point is, as Deputy Colley said, that the levels are, as regards the public service, on the quoted figure he gave for the salary of a Secretary of a Department, too low for the job.  That is not the point here.</P>
      <P>There are two points as regards the public service to which Deputy Colley has referred.  It is very difficult to see what form of amendment will do it. The Minister may have a point when he says that it is in another code it has to be done.  First of all, what the Minister is really doing here is exempting the annuity and I presume the lump sum under the word &ldquo;benefit&rdquo;, which is given on retirement on any <i>bona fide</i> pension scheme, whether public or private.  This is what is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is rightly exempting both the lump sum and the annuity. He is exempting it because if he did not do that they would be aggregated <Col N="1508" /> or capitalised.  They would have been capitalised under the Bill.  The first part of Deputy Colley's argument, which is prompted by particular representations, as he said, is that the capital value represented by these annuities and retirement benefits, in the one case, are substantially greater than the other and therefore, there is a greater relief being given, from the point of view of capital sum, in respect of one rather than the other.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a suggestion about mischief and I want to refer to two parts of the Bill.  The Minister knows what I am referring to.  If the benefits are capitalised on one side, then it will be found that what is really being done&mdash;let me get back to the essence of the Bill&mdash; in this exemption is exempting the capital value because this is a capital Bill.  The Bill exempts taxation of the capital represented by the annuity. This would have to be done because if it was an annuity <i>simpliciter</i> under other provisions in the Bill it would be taxable.  The capital value is exempted and this relief is given.  The point, therefore, is that a greater capital sum is being exempted in the one case rather than in the other. That is the first point.  I am not arguing merits, I am only trying to make quite clear what the points are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to certain schemes but there is a great parity in another way between the private and the public sectors.  There are many private schemes&mdash;and this brings me to the second point that is at issue here &mdash;approved of by the Revenue Commissioners which are similar in that they are contributory schemes, and the contributory schemes have certain privileges with regard to income tax.  These schemes may mature over the whole time and when it comes to retirement practically <Col N="1509" /> the same thing happens.  One of the usual things is that either you can have a maximum two-third pension and no lump sum or you can have a lump and a half pension, which is the case Deputy Colley mentioned here. There is often an option.  The capital value gets tied up at this point.  Up to that point those two schemes seem to be the same in essence.  If there was a bit in favour of the public service, like Deputy Colley, I would say all right, but actually it is important that it should be realised that there is this parallelism up to this point.  Is the Minister saying that there are not private schemes operating that way, as I have said?</P>

      <P>I am trying to find the objective facts and I think one will see Deputy Colley's point at the end of it.  There are two schemes, a private scheme and a public scheme.  Up to that point they are the same.  Where the double problem arises&mdash;and frankly I do not know how Deputy Colley could have dealt with it in an amendment because it is a difficult problem of practice; theoretically in another Act one could have, but from the practical point of view I wonder would it be effective&mdash; is that the Revenue Commissioners under schemes under the 1972 Act restrict the inflation provision to 5 per cent, whereas automatically throughout the whole public sector &mdash;it is not that there is a preferential or discriminatory provision given&mdash; but as an automatic result of the gearing of the system, inflation is catered for in one case.  Inflation is catered <Col N="1510" /> for in the public sector and is restricted to the 5 per cent in the private sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it works on both heads.  Where is this argument leading?  Not to a criticism of what is happening in the public sector.  I agree with the Minister that that could be characterised as mischievous. Would the Minister give us credit for a sense of responsibility?  What I am saying is that there is only one way that I can see to compensate practically in this situation.  It is very difficult to work out the mechanics. In cases where the private individual can supplement by saving which otherwise would be capitalised here, which would be wealth because his savings would be capital, perhaps some provision could be found to enable him to achieve parity.  The only way I can see parity achieved&mdash;and it would be a voluntary effort, like voluntary health&mdash;a person could do it or could not do it, but if he could do it why stop him?&mdash;would be if somebody in the private sector could save and accumulate capital.  In so far as a revenue from that capital could be equated to a retirement annuity it would even bring in the age limit and I can see great headaches in forming it. The very fact that we have not put down an amendment gives the Minister a present of the argument that the practicality may be extremely difficult but it does not take away from the merits of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the measure of the capital here, if in the private sector it is found to be impossible, in the same way as the public sector, to provide for the inflationary increase&mdash;taking the capital as a value, that capital representing a supplementary annuity, so to <Col N="1511" /> speak, to an equivalent value would be exempt, then the result we are talking about could be achieved.  I do not know if I am making sense to the Minister.  I would like to be corrected if I am wrong in my facts.</P>
    <P>Even if the Revenue Commissioners were to say in their discretion &ldquo;There is nothing easier than to raise the limit for inflation, say to 15 or 20 per cent&rdquo; that does not solve it in practice because you will not get the practical cover for it.  It solves it in theory but not in practice.  This is why the only relevancy of the capital calculation that Deputy Colley has given is as a measure of the discrepancy in parity.  That can only be made voluntarily but it means a voluntary accumulation of capital.  There, I fear, the Minister would have to take into account not only this Bill but also the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill because obviously you would not want to exempt or accumulate something that was going to pass over.</P>
    <P>Just as in the Capital Gains Tax Bill, could the Minister consider the 65 to 70 person, the capital in the hands of a retired person and some measure to bring parity between the public sector and the private sector, exempting that only in the lifetime of the pensioner and then let that capital revert?  That is the only suggestion I can make to the Minister in regard to it.</P>
    <P>On that particular point, I would like to make it quite clear that, on the figures given to me here and from what I know of business outside, it would be a very wrong and improper impression to take it that the principal executives or administrators in the public sector are overpaid.  By comparison they are not.  They are, in fact, underpaid and there is no question therefore of raising that point. But, on the other hand, I think it is very important for the public sector to be protected in another way.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger of what has recently happened if we do not keep a certain parity.  Look at the impact of the recent budget on the public sector.  Because there was a discrepancy between the outside and the <Col N="1512" /> inside, look at what has happened about PAYE.  I am sorry it had to happen, but it happened because of the inflationary situation and it has had embarrasing effects on large numbers in the public service.  Whenever you have disparities this is likely to happen.  I admit that the problem is a very difficult one to cope with.  Not many will be affected by this wealth tax.  Not many, if any, will have the kind of capital that will attract wealth tax.  Where they are caught there will be certain exemptions.</P>
    <P>I am really talking about higher levels in this.  There is both principle and practice involved.  In the net, I can only suggest that where a pensioner over 65 would have sufficient capital to supply an annuity to keep his pension at the same level as it would have been if he were in the public service, to that extent an exemption of the capital sum concerned might be considered.  That is the only positive suggestion I can make to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is mistaken and I want to make it as clear as I can because he talked about this being a matter for another code. If I were a self-employed person and wanted to make the same provision for my retirement as the member of the public service to whom I referred I would need to have accumulated at the age of 65 £320,000.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I really think that there is no depth or weight in the point made by Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera.  The exemption here is in regard to superannuation and it does not specify the amount and it does not interfere with the threshold that is available afterwards. It simply says that the amount of superannuation a person is entitled to shall not be affected and it does not interfere with the threshold.  It does not say it is not a bonus being given to one person as against another. If it were, then we would be able to agree.  I am somewhat surprised that the Opposition hung on to this point and did not say a word about the exemption of a house because we could be exempting a house and contents in one case, that would be a £100,000 in value, and a house in another case might be worth only £5,000 in value.</P>

You have the very same argument in respect of livestock.  Livestock is exempt.  We do not query the numbers or value of the livestock we are exempting.  We are simply exempting livestock.</P>

This is really the question Deputy Colley is bringing forward.  It has not got a lot to do with the public service, except that the public service is a good measuring rod to look at.  What Deputy Colley is saying is absolutely true where the private individual is concerned, other than the individual who is employed by a firm with superannuation arrangements.

      <P>Deputy Colley brought forward a point actuarily which is very useful to all of us.  It is the impossibility for anyone, other than those of us who happen to be Members of the Dáil, to make provision for retirement on an ordinary basis, allowing for the rather conservative 15 per cent he instanced. When you take this Bill into consideration the difficulties mount up. This has nothing to do with the principle of a wealth tax.  In the inflationary situation today, for anybody other than the employed person in either the private sector or the public sector to make provision for any sort of moderate retirement is a difficult problem anyway, but this compounds the difficulty.  I asked the Minister about this before and I understood that that sort of provision would be dealt with by the Commissioners.  Now I understand that it will not be.  It is a valid question that should be dealt with.</P>

      <P>Might I add something?  Some of us can talk with some experience outside of some of these things.  The Minister, of course, is aware that this problem of providing <Col N="1518" /> pensions is becoming very acute &mdash;the Minister mentioned insurance companies&mdash;and that one of the great problems outside the State's concern is to actually provide for pensions. The Minister mentioned an insurance company.  This situation is changing so rapidly that I fear we are getting very near a position where, except at exorbitant premiums, this will not be available.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be or to appear to be mischievous but it is of great importance to have this parity in the interests of both sides of the ditch, if I may call it that, and recent events have shown this.  There is only one way I can see of doing it. Where a person reaches a commonly agreed age of retirement, one has only to provide in this Bill that annuities&mdash;and an annuity can simply be the annual interest on a capital sum&mdash; of the nature of a pension of a certain level, a parity level, may be preserved. In practice what that would mean would be the exemption from wealth tax of sums up to a certain amount in certain circumstances.  I cannot put the proposition as a mathematical problem any more clearly than that.</P>
      <P>I may be able to make some suggestions later to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that we have to do is to convince the Minister that there is a problem which relates precisely to this Bill.  This section purports to exempt the capital value of superannuation schemes.  I should not say &ldquo;purports&rdquo;.  It does that&mdash;it approves superannuation schemes.  But what it does not do is to exempt from wealth tax the capital value of such provision as a person has to make for his <Col N="1519" /> retirement.  The Minister, I am sure, appreciates the difference.  It is concerned first of all to approve superannuation schemes.  I said there are two distinct categories although the principle is the same.  The most obvious one is the one mentioned by Deputy Brugha, the self-employed person who cannot, because of the nature of his business make provision for it. The premiums required would be such as to cripple his business.  He is one clear-cut category.  Incidentally, in certain kinds of business or professions some people are not able to make adequate provision for their retirement but they sell their business or their profession or whatever it is on retirement. What is happening?  The goodwill is being subjected to the Wealth Tax Bill, which is very often the provision for retirement that such a person has.</P>
    <P>That is the self-employed person. Let us take the person who is employed outside the public service. Some of those people, not so many now, are in the same position as the self-employed.  Many of them have pension schemes.  To the best of my knowledge, in the vast majority of cases the best terms in the pension schemes are related and are restricted by two factors: (1) the 5 per cent limit that the Revenue Commissioners will approve for income tax relief and (2) the non-availability, even if the Revenue Commissioners had no limit, of anything very much more than 5 per cent provision for inflation.</P>
    <P>The basic reason for this is that these pension schemes are dependent on investment funds and therefore are related to the yield from these funds, and the yield from these funds is simply not keeping pace with inflation. The only reason that the public service can get the kind of provision it is getting is that it is refunded out of current expenditure not out of a fund.  That makes the basic difference. That is the point&mdash;it is all out of current expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is simply a half truth to say that this section is treating everybody the same way because it is exempting the capitalised sums of approved superannuation <Col N="1520" /> schemes.  The real question for anybody involved in it is: &ldquo;Can I make provision for my retirement comparable with somebody in the public service?  In order to do so I have to accumulate £X00,000 to make a comparable provision, and if I do I will have the wealth tax applied to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But the person in the comparable position in the public service has available to him, as I demonstrated on actuarial figures, provision for his retirement which is measurable in terms of equal £X00,000.  But he does not pay wealth tax on that.  I think a lot of people who have the benefits of superannuation schemes, and I am not referring only to the public service when I say this, do not realise the capital value and what it amounts to in the case of their superannuation scheme.  They think in terms of a self-employed man who has accumulated a good deal of tax as being a wealthy man as compared with them, where they may well be better off in real terms and indeed in cash terms when you work out the value of what they have.  This section, I submit, is not taking account at all of the realities of the situation as I have outlined them.  The reality of the position for a person on retirement and it is simply no good for the Minister to talk about one house being worth a whole lot more than another and they are all being exempted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The fact is that provision is being made under this section for people in the public service who will have at retirement a sum equivalent to £320,000.  If anybody outside the public service has accumulated such a sum to give equal benefits on retirement he will be subjected to wealth tax.  This is the reality of the situation and there is no way the <Col N="1522" /> Minister can suggest that it is not so or it is not the effect of what is being done.  I know the Minister said that he did not have an opportunity to study the Bill in advance.  I hope that before we resume on this section the Minister will have an opportunity to look at it and will recognise the reality of the problem.</P>
