      <P>The Taoiseach will remember that on 18th December, 1974, the day on which we adjourned when we took all the appropriation accounts and a substantial number of Estimates <i>en bloc</i> without discussion I asked him to consider debating the Finance and Public Services Estimates.  It is now well into the session and I should like to ask the Taoiseach, with reference to the reply he gave me on that occasion, to have those Estimates brought before the House for proper discussion.  The Estimates involved were roughly those Nos. 1-20 on the Order Paper previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained on that occasion, and probably the Deputy knows this now, we have been in communication with the Opposition on this matter.  We are sitting three days each week, including a 12-hour day on Wednesdays.  We made certain suggestions for the dispatch of business but with the exception of an agreement to consider the Law Reform Bill at a special committee we have not adopted the committee system for a Bill although it was recommended in the report of the all-party group under the chairmanship of Deputy O'Malley.  In fact, the only <Col N="780" /> changes of substance in that has been the granting of three hours per week for Private Members' Business.  This is now available throughout the year and it includes financial business, contrary to the previous practice.  I think the Deputy will have to consult with his colleagues and see whether it is possible to work out a more expeditious arrangement for the dispatch of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit this vital point to the Taoiseach?  What is involved here is the matter of expenditure of all the moneys voted in the budget.  Here is the vital question of the application of the taxpayers' money.  Surely that should be a priority matter for public discussion in this House, not only for the benefit of all Deputies but for the benefit of the public who are paying.  I submit that point of view to the Taoiseach. With respect, I do not think it is good enough that it should be relegated either to a committee behind closed doors or to Private Members' time. That suggests we are losing all sense of proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What is suggested is that public business time is absorbed by giving three hours each week to Private Members' Business.  I have pointed out that the all-party committee recommended that certain Bills be transferred to special committees in order to relieve the pressure on the time of the House.  When Estimates were brought forward, the Deputy's leader expressed the view that we were absorbing too much time having Estimates proceeding simultaneously and that we should try to conclude one Estimate before we reached another one.  Unfortunately as far as we are concerned it seems that irrespective of the order in which we produce business it does not satisfy the Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand completely the Taoiseach's point of view, that there are a number of Estimates <Col N="781" /> that do not demand the same attention. I want to focus attention on the importance of the Finance and Public Services group of Estimates because it is here we come up against the whole question of the application of funds collected by taxation.  I suggest that is public business of first-class priority and importance.  I submit this point of view to the Taoiseach, understanding his difficulties and appreciating that other public business such as certain Bills must be considered.  It is a matter of proportion and I would ask the Taoiseach to give it urgent consideration.</P>

      <P>We could very easily have ordered an Estimate such as the one Deputy de Valera described yesterday and, by doing so, I could have released a large number of Government Deputies for other work.  However, we chose to do &ldquo;crunch&rdquo; business which could have resulted in votes&mdash;that were skilfully avoided by the Opposition spokesman.  The Capital Gains Tax Bill proceeded at a snail's pace, but we were doing serious business.  A year ago when we had Estimates during a by-election period we were criticised for &ldquo;wasting the time of the House&rdquo;.  Now we are criticised for not wasting the time of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me the last day I drew attention to the fact that, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy through the years, the people had accepted that they had a responsibility to make payments to the less well-off in our community. It was not until 1964 that the Fine Gael Party decided it was essential that they too should indicate to the public that they were interested in this activity.  They then <Col N="783" /> published the document <i>A Just Society.</i>  I also mentioned that, as a result of Fianna Fáil policy, an industrial base was created from which it was possible to provide financial aid for those people.</P>
      <P>I mentioned that the social welfare code had one glaring gap which, to my mind, must in justice be filled as soon as possible.  I refer to the case of a wife becoming ill.  She must go to bed or to hospital and as a result her husband must leave work to look after the family.  As far as I am aware there is no regulation under the social welfare code which permits payment to him by virtue of the fact that he must stay off work to look after his family.  Many wives are aware that if they stay in bed or go to hospital they will impose financial difficulties on their families which may take some time to get over. Therefore definite payment should be made to the husband for a period of at least six weeks while his wife may be ill at home or in hospital.  I am aware of cases where women who should be in bed are still on their feet and unable to cope with the work facing them.  As a result they develop chronic illnesses which in the long run impose greater expense on the State and on their families.  I raised this with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Labour in the past but it did not get the attention it should.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech also said that a husband now over 67 years of age may have means up to £12 a week and still get the full old age pension of £17.70.  I have no objection to this, but on the other hand a married couple over 67 will get but £17.70 also.  This is an indication of the difference in outlook between the two parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, to payments of social welfare.  Fianna Fáil policy was always to make the necessary payments to people of greatest need.  This is an objective that should face any Minister for Finance in framing his budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget contained no innovation to cover the extension of the <Col N="784" /> health services.  It seemed to indicate that for the foreseeable future no new development will take place.  This is in contradiction to the announcement of the Minister for Health some time ago.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to continue the amenity scheme is one of the greatest indictments against them.  This Coalition when they came to power indicated great interest in community development.  But the one scheme which permitted community development was dropped by them.  This is obviously a mistake and the Minister for Local Government must be aware by now from the pressures of the various county councils through resolutions that it is not acceptable to the public.  There is an obligation on him to see that this situation is changed in the very near future.  That Minister is also responsible for roads.  He has refused to give full cognisance to the situation which exists at the present time where the development of bogs is absolutely necessary.  We put down questions asking him to make money available for the development of roads and drainage of bogs.  He refused to do this.  He stated that the local improvements scheme should be used for this purpose.  Small as this reply was, to me it was one of the biggest disappointments from the Coalition, because the Minister is the only member of the Cabinet with a rural background.  He should be fully aware of the difficulties of getting local improvement schemes off the ground in rural areas.  Those who are interested know that names must be got, a willingness on the part of those involved must be got by signature, and in most cases a contribution must be paid by those involved in these schemes.  There are difficulties in getting all these together.</P>
    <P>As anybody who knows anything about bogs will realise, to do this in practice is impossible, although in theory it is possible.  The owners of bogs use them very little.  For that reason they will not make a contribution for the benefit of the whole country.  People using bogs do so on a yearly basis, taking them one year but maybe not the next.  They too are not interested in making a contribution <Col N="785" /> for this purpose.  Therefore it must be obvious that a special fund should be set up for this purpose.  It was there in the past.  We have gone beyond the era of the ass and the side cleat.  We are now in the era of the tractor.  Therefore the roads will have to carry more weight than in the past.  For this reason it is essential that the Government do something about these roads before it is too late.</P>
    <P>It is not given to ordinary mortals to understand the intricacies of finance and economics.  Nevertheless, in listening to the Minister and subsequently reading his speech, thoughts went through my mind.  One thing that struck me was that he is introducing schemes to encourage people to save. On the other hand, he indicates how important it is to get money out of the public so that demand will be increased and consumer spending will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I draw your attention, Sir, to the disgraceful attendance on the Government benches.  There is a limited attendance here, but we are two to one at least. We should get some Deputies in to hear the debate.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the Minister's speech, the subsequent reading of it and the fact that there was a contradiction in it in that he induced people on the one hand to save money and on the other hand he was anxious to increase demand and consumer spending.  I asked myself: &ldquo;Who contributes more to the economy, the saver or the spender?  Is it the law of diminishing returns that controls both?&rdquo;  I have not seen or read anything about it.  I belong to a generation that was taught to save the pennies and the pounds would take care of themselves.  We were reared on the basis that it was prudent to save and that it was wise to leave something by for the rainy day.  There seems to be an emphasis now on consumer spending. This is helped by lavish advertising so that we seem to be entering a new <Col N="786" /> era.  I wonder if anybody has definite opinions on which attitude would benefit the economy more.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to long term borrowing and said it was not attractive to the foreigner.  He made no reference at all to the native.  What applies to the foreigner must apply to the native, the Irish citizen, who wishes to lend money to the State.  I get the impression that the era of long term loans is finishing.  I would like to hear the Minister develop this thought further.  It seems to be unfair to invite citizens to accept long term loans and when the money is paid back, due to inflation in particular, its purchasing power has decreased substantially. Something should be built into those loans to provide against this contingency and make them more attractive.</P>
      <P>I have often wondered if it is possible to link up the saving scheme with income tax to help the younger people from 19 to about 30 years of age who have paid their income tax.  A time usually comes when they want to build their own houses and they have to seek grants and loans.  Grants are reasonably easy to get except that those people with a certain income are precluded from getting the local government grant.  Many of the people looking for loans find them very hard to get.  There should be some tie up between the income tax younger people pay and making grants and loans available to them.  I can see objections to this but the economists and the Revenue Commissioners should be able to produce something to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council in their document referred to the fact that few statistics are available for 1974.  This is to be expected as statistics are very slow coming from various institutions. One must question how useful statistics are.  I suppose they are absolutely essential as statements of fact but the problem arises when one tries to interpret them.  We see how unreliable they have been for agricultural marketing. Two years ago we were told there would be plenty of outlets in the future for the beef of this country.  However, during the last few months we have been faced with the very opposite.  This <Col N="787" /> is one area where statistics have let us down very badly.</P>
    <P>We have had over the last 12 months different interpretations of the housing figures.  I understand there was something about housing on television last night.  The people who saw this programme were absolutely confused and found it hard to know who was right and who was wrong.  If statistics are so unreliable that people with reasonable intelligence and a certain amount of training cannot draw the proper inference from them there is an obligation to see that this wrong is corrected.  Our lives are being run on figures and we are all becoming numbers.  The interpretation of statistics can be used to the disadvantage of groups and individuals.  I am somewhat annoyed when told that the average number of medical cards in the country is one-third the number of patients and that the income is £5,000, when I know there are quite a number of doctors whose medical card patients total more than 50 per cent and up to two-thirds of the number of patients and that the basic income from those does not come anywhere near £5,000. The situation is such that it has to be supplemented by other payments. Indeed, there are areas where a minimum salary must be offered to doctors to take up the practice of medicine.</P>
    <P>When one tries to get the records straight, even the newspapers fail in their duty to the public because they do not help to present the other side of the story and in that way are helping to compound this misrepresentation of figures.  I am not an expert at figures but to my layman's mind it seems that if things are to be run thus, those people who are supposed to do so should make adequate and clear information available to us.</P>
    <P>This morning's news on the radio stated that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is consulting with the farming community about getting back intervention payments for the producers.  This has been hammered at in this House in the last number of months and we are pleased at its happening at last, but it has come a bit <Col N="788" /> too late when prices are beginning to rise anyway.  People around me would have been happier if this had happened some months ago because it would have meant their incomes would have been much better in the last six months.</P>
    <P>Today also the radio announced that our cattle exports have fallen by 20,000, the indication being that this was caused because shipping facilities were not available.  In the House I proposed by question to get information from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and Transport and Power in regard to shipping facilities for cattle but the Ceann Comhairle ruled the questions out of order on the basis that the Ministers had not responsibility. I understand that I am not entitled to question the Chair's right to do this but I wish to place the responsibility where it should be, in the hands of whichever committee are responsible for Standing Orders.  They should see that questions like that get before the House.  I do not know who is responsible but it is significant that those exporting cattle have indicated this is one reason why they could not get out young cattle.  It is a reflection on our lack of ability to inquire by question on matters of this kind.</P>
    <P>Another matter concerning the Department and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may seem small to anyone living outside rural Ireland.  In the past, seeds were made available to people at reduced cost, certified seeds, each spring.  This scheme was abolished last year and has not been reintroduced this year, an extraordinary decision at a time when the emphasis is on the production of as much stock feed as possible at home.  Our experience in the last few months should endorse this and show that one factor that should have changed the Minister's outlook in regard to the seeds scheme is the need to home produce stock feed.  Last week I put down a question in relation to EEC policy on the development of alternative animal feed which would not have to be imported from outside the EEC.  I understand the EEC have published a lengthy document on this, yet here we are throwing <Col N="789" /> aside one way of implementing this.  It reflects very badly on the Minister and the Department.</P>
    <P>One of our big difficulties has been the continuing need to import energy. It has an enormous effect on our balance of payments.  Reading the publication <i>National Partnership</i>, I was struck by paragraph 60 on page 25:</P>
    <P>Fortunately, notwithstanding the increase in the balance of payments deficit this year, our external reserves have in fact increased since December last.  At the end of September they stood at £460 million, more than £30 million higher than at the end of December.  This points to a strong capital inflow. More than half the inflow was accounted for by borrowing by the Government to finance the public capital programme, and by semi-State bodies for development programmes.</P>
    <P>Unless you have an aunt who died in America you would not describe those circumstances as fortunate.  You would say it was fortunate if she left you sufficient money to cover such a contingency but it is not my interpretation of how you would describe the necessity to borrow such amounts of money. To my mind it is unfortunate that the State is in such a situation that it cannot carry on without borrowing. Borrowing is acceptable as far as companies and individuals who want to develop are concerned, but the use of the word &ldquo;fortunately&rdquo; in this document places an emphasis on this activity which should not be placed on it.</P>
    <P>This brings me to another point.  In his statement the Minister said that any domestic activity that would increase or cause a rise in the balance of payments deficit should be avoided.  This must be accepted, but it follows that any domestic activity that can be taken to help to reduce the balance of payments deficit should be taken.  At risk of repeating myself, I point to the failure of Ministers concerned to develop our bogs, one way whereby we could reduce our import requirements of energy.  It might not make a <Col N="790" /> substantial contribution but it would be something.</P>
    <P>Another area is the use of native coal.  It is well known that in Ireland there are only two coal fields left, the larger being at Arigna.  There are two types of coal, one of which is worked and used for electricity generation. There is as well what is known as crow coal, an inferior coal with high ash content.  I understand there are acres upon acres of it.  In the past this was regarded as uneconomic from the point of view of electricity production but county councils and individuals are now advocating that an effort be made to work and use this coal.  Deputations have gone to the Minister.  We have asked questions, and one of the questions elicited a reply from the Minister for Transport and Power to the effect that it was not economic to burn this high ash content coal in Arigna. This is putting the emphasis in the wrong place.  The Minister for Finance wants to improve the balance of payments, our external assets, and our financial standing throughout the world.  This, if I get the message from the Minister's statement, should be the important consideration just now. Therefore, the Minister for Transport and Power should point out to the ESB that this is what the Government want, the production of energy that will take pressure off the balance of payments. Not alone would this be of help to the country but also to the local rural area which is depending on this industry.</P>
    <P>Talking about the Minister for Transport and Power reminds me that no provision has been made in the budget this year to alleviate the great hardship which faces so many people building new houses who find that the insulation costs them £300, £400 or even £900 in some cases. One had hoped that so much had been said about this in the House from time to time that the Government would have seen its way to deal with this problem in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has announced that he has an agreement with Tara.  He seems very pleased with it and satisfied that he has got ample profit for the country as a result of this deal.  We <Col N="791" /> can only hope he is right.  However, Deputy O'Malley is not so enthusiastic about it, and it must be admitted that any statements Deputy O'Malley makes are usually informed and very well researched.  Nevertheless, everybody hopes the Minister's agreement will bring the results the people want.  Some people outside the House have a different opinion and regard it as most unlikely that the Fianna Fáil Party would go out of its way to prevent the Irish people getting as much as possible from these natural resources in and surrounding the country, and I think it only right to say that their influence will be available in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has a responsibility for prices, and he has not done so well. I am not going to blame him a great deal for that, but I do blame the Government for announcing before the election that they were going to reduce prices and stabilise them. This more than anything else persuaded sufficient of the floating vote to support a coalition Government and bring them to power, and that is one field in which they failed to redeem their promise.  The position of the unfortunate Minister for Industry and Commerce was made a lot worse by an increase of 30 per cent in the price of petrol imposed a few months ago by the Minister for Finance.  He certainly did not help the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  This is an obvious case of broken faith with the public.  We were told that 50 per cent of the inflationary pressure came from outside and 50 per cent from inside, and then at the end of the reel the Minister for Finance put 30 per cent extra on petrol.  Surely the Government cannot shrug off their responsibility for the increase in the cost of living resulting from this increase in the cost of petrol which pervades all our economic activities.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is another difficult section for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Efforts are made to get a Buy Irish campaign off the ground.  One of the saddest reflections on the Irish community, if my reading <Col N="792" /> of the papers is correct, is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to go to Europe to consult with some of the EEC people about this Buy Irish campaign.  This should not be necessary.  The Irish people should be patriotic enough and have sufficient interest in the development of their own country and in helping their fellow workers to buy Irish goods with little or no prompting from the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's sentiments, but I would not like him to misunderstand the position. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not going to Brussels in connection with the Buy Irish campaign, because that is a completely voluntary matter as far as the Irish people are concerned, but he did consult with Brussels on the possibility of restrictions on imports from outside, which is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough, but I am making the point that it should not be necessary for him to do this.  The idea has been implanted in our minds for so long, from the founding of Sinn Féin, that it should have permeated all our teaching and our whole approach to these problems. Until we adopt the right attitude we shall have tremendous difficulty in industry, because no matter what you make, it is immaterial whether it is cheap or dear on the shelf; it has no price until you sell it.  We have very little control over outside markets. The Minister said that Germany and the United States were loosening up their finances with the intention of increasing their trade.  This should help us, but we are unable to influence the situation very much, and for this reason we depend greatly on our home market.  I am not one of those people who advocate buying Irish goods because they are labelled Irish.  There is an obligation on workers and on management to see that the goods they produce are of the highest quality possible and at the cheapest possible price.  It would be most unfair to deceive the spending public in both of those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an area which has never been fully developed.  This is something <Col N="793" /> the Minister for Labour, who does not seem to be as busy as some of the other Ministers, should do.  He is responsible for the labour force. His colleagues, the other Ministers, are the agencies providing work.  He should be hounding those Ministers to provide work for his labour force. For example, he should be pursuing the Minister for Local Government and saying: &ldquo;There is local development to be done down the country in relation to bogs, drains, roads and so on.  We want money.  There are people unemployed down there.&rdquo;  He should be pursuing the Minister for Transport and Power on the same basis. Before the budget some of the economic advisers to the Minister were making a point that one area where jobs could be saved and increased was at this level of local employment, that this had the advantage of little or no import content and that this work could be carried out in areas where unemployment had been rife. There is an obligation on the Minister to do this.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our economic problem due to oil is the fact that the Third World countries have indicated that they, too, may increase the price of their materials.  Taking into consideration the difficulty that we are experiencing because of the increases in oil costs I wonder what would be our economic situation if this were to happen.  I have much sympathy in regard to the Third World countries but when somebody complained to me recently about the oil cost increases I remarked that we would be unlikely to sell our farm produce at cheaper prices in order to help the Arabs or any other Third World countries.</P>
    <P>Viewing this budget and also the policy of the Government during the past 12 months I can say that so far as my constituency is concerned we have not been doing well.  Agriculture is in chaos as a result of the price situation and also because of the failure of the Government to ensure intervention prices for the producers although this is something that is being dealt with now.  The health services seem to be at a standstill. <Col N="794" /> The same can be said in respect of housing.  We cannot understand the figures but we note the inaction and wonder where lies the truth.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I think of the 14-point plan that was offered to the people before the last election and compare it with the Stations of the Cross.  The people are suffering and all they can do is pray and think of what might have been if the Government had fulfilled their promises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall relate my remarks in particular to my own constituency and to the west in general.  In order to make my points I may find it necessary to reiterate some of what was said by the previous speaker.</P>
      <P>The situation in the west is desperate. The people in that part of the country are the ones who are being hit hardest by the crisis that has befallen us, particularly the crisis in the cattle industry.  The people are being obliged to sell their cattle at give-away prices and those who did not find it possible to sell have had an abnormal number of deaths among their herds.  On Sunday last I spoke to a smallholder in a mountain area.  He told me that during the previous week five of his animals had died.  From now on there will be an increase in the number of casualties.  The situation up to now could have been much worse had it not been for the very good weather we have been experiencing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down through the years the people of the west have been promised help of a major kind.  They were told that their areas would be developed, that every effort would be made to bring about economic development by way of employment and so on.  However, they have become tired of promises.  From time to time various suggestions were put forward by the experts in Dublin and in other places but nothing positive has been done to bring to those people the type of help which they need so badly and for which they have waited so long.  I am not directing my remarks specifically at the present Government because this situation has developed down through the years.  Some time ago there was devised a scheme for the <Col N="795" /> industrialisation of the west but after a number of years the subsidies that were being given to encourage industrialists to set up in the west were diverted to the eastern side of the country.</P>
    <P>There must be no further delay in making available the expertise that will result in the development of our western seaboard.  I have been pressing consistently for the development of our fisheries on a major scale.  This is one way of providing much needed help but we seem to be knocking at closed doors and it looks as if there is nobody with the type of forward thinking and expertise that is necessary to develop the vast wealth of our western seaboard.</P>
    <P>In an effort to expand on the points made by the previous speaker I will give figures of what could be done this year alone by way of turf production. If a sum of £500,000 had been provided in the budget, as it should have been, for the development of bog roads and for drainage so as to bring the bogs back to the state of efficiency of the 'forties and 'fifties, it would have been possible to produce an extra two million tons of turf.  This would have a saleable value of £16 million of which about £10 million would go directly in wages and would provide seasonal employment for about 20,000 workers.</P>
    <P>The Government find it necessary to borrow money from outside sources in order to pay for our imports of oil and coal but they are not paying attention to the potential of our bogs. Because of the availability of turfproducing machines, turf production is a relatively simple operation today. There are vast areas of bog available. I have seen the machines operate successfully in Cahirciveen.  The areas of the west coast are adaptable to these machines.  They can produce machine turf which is a very saleable product. I cannot understand why this idea has not been developed.  We are supposed to have experts in Bord na Móna but they are probably so tied up with their own business that they cannot see anything outside of it.</P>
    <P>It should be possible for the Government to set up some organisation <Col N="796" /> to produce this material which is so abundant in the west.  Having regard to the high price of imported fuel, turf could be produced economically and it would be acceptable to our people.  About 12 months ago I was in Ballina.  I had to go around many of the back streets to find out where somebody lived.  To my amazement, in all the big shops, and even in Woolworth's, I saw huge reeks of turf in the back part of their premises. Once we have firms in towns like that prepared to sell native fuel, the bulk of the people will use it.  The coal we are getting is not good and oil is extremely costly.</P>
    <P>I have had oil heating in my own house for a number of years.  I checked during the week and I found that two years ago the cost of oil was about £1.50 a week, with liberal usage and no attempt to contain its use.  The cost this year with restricted usage is over £8 a week.  If turf were available, I and many others like me would utilise that natural asset.  I would ask the Minister to provide money to be injected into the development of bog roads.</P>
    <P>When the local authorities are supplied with funds for local improvement schemes, some councillors are not interested in bog development or turf production and they look for the money for work on the roads in their own areas.  Sums of money will have to be set aside and specifically directed towards turf production when funds are being transmitted to the local authority.  If there is still time, I would ask the Minister to provide money for this purpose.</P>
    <P>This will be of benefit to the nation by way of a saving on imports of fuel. Above all it will provide employment in the area where it is most needed. There could be a saving on the social welfare side because people who are now drawing the dole could be employed. The money provided for local improvement schemes goes almost entirely to machine development and the haulage of materials which have a very low employment ratio.  In bog development there are jobs which have to be done by hand, and there is a high rate of employment.  The employment <Col N="797" /> which could be generated by the production of turf would be well worth the expenditure of any money provided for that purpose.</P>
    <P>At the risk of repeating myself, I again appeal to the Minister to have some money diverted towards bog road and drain development.  I know one man in Cahirciveen who employs 60 middle-aged men who do not fit into the ordinary type of industry.  They are smallholders who are employed for as long as six months.  Great credit is due to that man.  That is a very useful type of exercise.  It helps the nation's economy and it helps the local small-holders.</P>
    <P>The most important long-term development project to save the west is the development of our fishing industry. I have often been told that our fishing industry is developing at a certain percentage.  Admittedly, it has developed by 300 per cent, but that means nothing because it was a development from nothing to a minimal effort.  About 20 years ago, a place in the mountains near my own town was highlighted as one of the fastest developing areas in the country because the population had increased by 24 per cent and the highest rate of increase in any part of the country at that time was 3 per cent.  When I checked, I found that there were only 13 people in the area before that.  A man came home from England with his family. This shows what you can do with figures.  This increase of 24 per cent represented only four people.</P>
    <P>I have asked consistently for the injection of money into Valentia Harbour.  If we had that injection we could show the rest of Ireland what could be done by way of development of our fishing assets.  Time and again I was told that the facilities there were sufficient for the effort being put into fishing there.  How can one operate a harbour properly if one does not have a suitable pier?  The modern fishing boat, capable of going out 200 miles, or more, to sea cannot use the piers along our west coast.  There is need for vision here if we are to develop this very important national resource around our coasts.</P>
    <P>An injection of about £2 million <Col N="798" /> over a number of years is essential at Valentia.  This is one of the finest harbours in Europe but the piers are totally inadequate.  A European who has been in touch with me is prepared to invest £1 million in fish processing if he can get the proper landing facilities.  He is interested in an export production of £20 million and he sees no problem in selling the processed commodity provided the piers are made capable of catering for 200 foot boats, boats which can go out 200 miles to sea.  If he had these facilities, a really worthwhile industry could be developed.</P>
    <P>I have some statistics here from both Denmark and Norway to illustrate the possibilities.  Norway has a population of approximately 3,900,000.  It is something like our own.  Total fish production last year amounted to £328 million, of which £244 million represented exports. Employment is provided on the boats for 35,027 people and a further 20,000 are employed on shore, making a grand total of 55,000 people engaged in Norway in the fishing industry. The season in Norway lasts a little over four months in the year. By and large, we have an all-the-year-round fishing season.  Our exports last year amounted to £15 million, of which more than half was in salmon, shellfish and so on.  Our approach to the vast wealth around our shores is puerile.  Recently we got quite excited over oil which will cost a great deal to develop.  We have vast wealth in the waters around us.  It is so vast that, if one had the proper kind of rake, one could almost rake in this wealth.  We should have an export figure of £500 million in ten or 15 years' time if our harbours are properly developed.</P>
    <P>Norwegian fish sales are made to countries with which we have a heavy imbalance of payments.  They are made to France, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Columbia and The Netherlands.  These are all countries from which we buy more than they buy from us.  We could control these markets.  Is it too much to hope for a body to be set up with the specific task of developing <Col N="799" /> this industry?  Is there anyone with enough vision to reap the vast harvest around our shores for the benefit of the west and the benefit of the nation as a whole?  I do not think we are short of brains and energy and surely, even at Government level at the moment, there is someone with enough vision and ability to insist on the development of this industry.  A separate body on the lines of the Industrial Development Authority to deal with the fishing industry would be the ideal solution.</P>
    <P>A huge amount of money will not be required.  I mentioned this European firm which is interested in investing £1 million in processing.  The firm is prepared to supply the boats and the skippers; all they ask for are the crews.  Outside funds are available. All we need is the expertise to develop the harbours and garner the harvest.  The harbours were constructed 200 or more years ago.  They were quite appropriate in their day but they are no longer suitable to modern needs.  Recently at Valentia some genius came along and built a wall down the middle of the pier there.  I do not know what purpose it is supposed to serve.  The pier should be widened actually to take two or three vehicles abreast when the boats are unloading.  If the building of this wall is an indication of the kind of approach there is to the industry, I do not see much hope for the development of the industry.</P>

We do not have many opportunities here of discussing these matters except on the actual budget and the appropriate Estimate.  I have pinpointed the need to get this type of development.  If I am overstepping, I am sorry.  I would ask you to bear with me.  I am referring mainly to agricultural production.  I <Col N="800" /> am also trying to get in a reference to fisheries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I am trying to get the message across to the Minister for Finance.  I am sorry to have had to cover so wide a field but I have been persistently trying to get this message across.  The west is costing a lot of money by way of dole and other injections.  On the radio this morning an expert stated that it was his opinion that it was unfortunate that such subventions are available because they represent an injection in a dying situation which merely serves to prolong life.  He referred to the fact that there are 90,000 small farmers who have no means of survival. I refer to this to show that these people are there.  They are an energetic people, despite what people may think because of the fact that they are drawing the dole.  The younger men are not interested in drawing the dole and are not prepared to exist on the dole.  Those in the older bracket from 30 upwards may still cling to the old way of life. In the case of the younger men, if there is no work available locally they are prepared to clear out.  That is what we are trying to prevent.  We are trying to keep the people in the west.  If we were to lose the western culture we would have lost everything that our people have fought for. They fought so that everybody would have the right to live in his homeland.  It is my job in this House to direct ministerial attention at all times to the problems that exist in the backward regions of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in these undeveloped areas were able to survive in former days because of remittances from the young people who had gone to America or to Britain.  There is no large-scale emigration to America any more and there is not much hope of their finding employment in Britain, the way things are going there. Therefore it is vitally important to <Col N="801" /> provide means of keeping these young people at home, by developing local resources.</P>
    <P>The expert advice given to farmers has been shown up in recent months in all its nakedness.  The advice has been changed so often that the farmer did not know where he stood.  There was the advice to farmers to carry one cow to the acre.  There is a very energetic farming family that I know who had 100 cows on about 180 acres of land.  They went exclusively into milk production and had a colossal milk cheque.  They found that as a result of the cost of feedingstuffs and fertilisation and the effect of that fertilisation on the land and on the cattle they were in a worse position and they are now reverting to the system of having about 50 cows and using the farmyard compost to fertilise the land.  They find that this is more economic.  When they adopted the system they were advised to adopt they discovered that there was softening of the soil through over-ferilisation and that the land was cut up by the cattle over the winter periods.  This more than offset the increase in the milk cheque.  The people have discovered that the system they were advised to adopt is not suitable.  They find a balanced system of farming more economic.  In this way they can face any crisis that may arise.  The farmers in Kerry are now determined to develop their farms according to their own ideas.  They will not be caught again with the number of cattle they had this winter and which they could not sell in the early stages. There is an improvement now but in the case of many farmers even by next May they will be getting only half the value that they would normally have got.  The cattle will have suffered because of lack of feed over the winter and the farmers will not be able to get the type of money for them that they would have got in other years.</P>
    <P>It has been a crisis year for farmers in our part of the country, mainly dairy farmers.  Milk is a good price. They have lost on cattle.  The small mountain farmers have lost heavily. It is unfortunate that they should have walked into this situation.  It would <Col N="802" /> appear that the future is not bright for them.  One gathers from the rumblings from Europe that most countries are looking to the cheap meat that is available outside.  It looks as if the EEC barriers can be breached.  A report came from Australia recently that cattle had been slaughtered or had been allowed to die because there was not a market for them.  This situation is very tempting to countries who want to get food at low cost.  If there is any way of breaching the regulations they will be likely to do it.</P>
    <P>One of the most important schemes in the west is the development of roads but the kind of development being carried on at the moment is not the correct one.  Colossal sums are being spent on primary roads but in areas such as Cahirciveen and Dingle sufficient money is not being spent on road projects. These are tourist areas and it is necessary to have well-maintained roads.  In the centre of Kerry considerable sums are being expended on road works and provision is also made for the construction of walls.  I realise it is necessary to carry out work on the main roads but instead of constructing elaborate walls stakes might be erected and the money thus saved could be diverted to other roads.  I hope some of the Department's inspectors will come down to County Kerry because when we raised questions about this matter in the council we were told the Department dictate how the money should be used.  Vast sums are used to complete a few hundred yards of road but much more work could be done for the same money on some of the more minor roads.  Many of these roads are in tourist areas and we should not forget that aspect.</P>
    <P>The building trade has been going through a difficult period but their position will deteriorate even further when a further 25 per cent increase is put on timber.  My firm of building suppliers have been notified of this increase.  The grants provided are not in line with present-day costs.  At the moment a person earning £2,300 is excluded from getting a loan.  In country areas people find it difficult to get <Col N="803" /> loans from building societies.  They appear to keep their money in the Dublin area and do not give loans to people in my area.  If we are to keep people in employment this situation must be corrected.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to change the cottage purchase scheme.  During the last week a young man I know was appointed tenant of a new house at a rent of £4.23 per week and he was told he could purchase the house if he paid £11.50 per week over 35 years.  I calculated he would have a total of £16,500 paid by that time and after ten years he would have a further payment of £4 per week for rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what scheme it is and I am not entering into any argument about it.  I am merely pointing out the position as it exists for a young man who earns £36 per week.</P>
      <P>In Kerry we gave £26,000 this year for the provision of fuel for needy people.  However, a peculiar situation has developed because old age pensioners with a contributory pension who have very little more than the noncontributory pensioners are excluded, according to the regulations.  We will need approximately £80,000 per year to meet all the applications.  I would ask the Minister to consider seriously giving us some assistance because we are one of the few counties that made an effort to help the needy in this matter.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to give all the money that is available to areas in the west.  We need vast injections of capital.  We have the energy and the expertise but we need help from Dublin to develop schemes that will give work to our people.  This would give many people on the dole productive employment.  I have ideas of what could be done and would be happy at any time to have a chat with the Minister about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Down the years we had many slogans about saving the west but nothing was done.  If we develop the west it will benefit the whole country. <Col N="804" /> The Minister should try to convince the Government to set up a body along the lines of the IDA to develop the vast fishing wealth in the west.  If this were done the problems of the west would solve themselves.  We can do what was done in Denmark, Norway and other countries.  All we need is the right kind of thinking.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. At the moment there is a by-election going on in the west of Ireland.  I have been knocking on doors and the people have asked me to give the Minister for Finance a message.  They want me to congratulate him on this budget.  I have done that and now I say that he should keep on with the good work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Their contempt for our democratic procedures, their total indifference to the problems facing our people are now physically demonstrated by two very significant developments. For the last 57 minutes, contrary to all the traditions and courtesies of this House, the Opposition Front Bench has been empty.  I drew attention this morning to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy J. Lynch, left the Front Bench empty for a time and when he returned he had the temerity to demand a quorum. Another Fianna Fáil speaker, embarrassed by the absence of the Leader of the Opposition from the Front Bench although he was speaking at the time, became the first ambulant speaker as he moved from a back seat to the front.  Deputy O'Connor was left in the embarrassing position of addressing the House from the back benches with no representative of the Opposition in the Front Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today the Order of Business was arranged to facilitate the Opposition, who desired an 11-hour debate on the budget.  Here we are at this early hour of the day with no other <Col N="805" /> Opposition speaker offering himself. This clearly indicates how shallow is their opposition to this year's budget and how mean their criticism of the Government.  In their heart of hearts they know that the economic difficulties through which we are going at the present time are not due to any lack of action on the Government's part, or attributable to any wrong decisions or erroneous actions on the part of the Government but are due primarily to the economic recession which is afflicting all countries of the world other than the oil producers/exporters.</P>
    <P>The Opposition criticised the Government for failing to expend money on many items, for increasing taxation, which in this year increases by no more than a net of £11.4 million, and for the size of the budget deficit.  I want to show how contradictory the Opposition are in their approach to the budget and how divided and confused they are in economic policy.  This is necessary so that people will understand how Fianna Fáil are failing in their duty as an Opposition.  In the midst of this patent display of total inability and insincerity, Fianna Fáil are saying through their Leader that their aim is to return to their position as the rightful Government of this country. There is arrogance.  Without any cohesion, without any agreement among themselves as to what the right policy should be, they demand that they should be placed by the Irish people as the rightful Government of the country.  So arrogant is the claim that one feels they do not even think the people have any part to play in this matter.  They seem to think that they have a God-given right to rule this country.</P>
    <P>It may be their arrogant dream that they are the rightful Government, but I suggest they do a rethink and become instead a dutiful Opposition and not a careless and indifferent Opposition, which they seemed to be throughout this budget debate, particularly today when they are absent in such vast numbers.  They have broken the traditions of obligation and courtesy in this House by not <Col N="806" /> maintaining the Front Bench.  This is, of course, a reflection of what we saw yesterday where the proceedings were frustrated for hours by a nonsensical series of futile questions which had been answered hours and days beforehand.  This was done for the sake of holding up the business of the House because Fianna Fáil, while pretending to oppose the Government's capital gains tax proposals were not in a position to produce a sufficient number of Deputies in the lobbies to carry any conviction.  They knew that if there was a division yesterday they would have been totally disgraced because their Deputies were not here.  For the second day running they show they are not really serious about parliamentary democracy because they made no effort to attend here.</P>
    <P>As far as possible to do so, I want to quantify honesly, sincerely and, in fairness, conservatively, the demands for additional expenditure which were made by the Opposition during this debate.  Deputy J. Lynch proposed food subsidies to reduce the consumer price index by 5 percentage points. This would add £100 million to the tax bill which would have to be taken from taxpayers or borrowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will excuse me, but I have to leave the House.  I know there are empty benches here but there are also empty benches behind the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely excuse the Deputy.  He is one of the courteous and most sincere Members of the Opposition.  I do not know how he can rest in the party of which he is a member.  We now find ourselves without any Opposition at all.  We have surely reached the bottom of parliamentary democracy when that situation exists.  As I said earlier, it shows the gross insincerity of the Opposition regarding the budgetary problems of this country.  Thanks to the loyal attendance of the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate, they will record this debate and reveal it to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the Deputies opposite do not take the trouble of reading the Official Report next week when it <Col N="807" /> is printed, they will nonetheless see what I am now going to give: a summary of the additional taxation or additional borrowing that would have to be made to meet Fianna Fáil's dreams.  Deputy Lynch, as I said, suggested a reduction of 5 per centage points in the consumer price index through food subsidies which would cost £100 million.  He and Deputy Colley said that the income tax allowances, given on this year's budget, which will cost £15 million to £16 million, were not sufficient. He said they should be increased. This would cost £9½ million.  Deputy Colley suggested that industry should get, not the mere £12 million tax relief which we gave them, but rather £25 million tax relief.  That was not good enough for Deputy Lynch.  He brushed aside Deputy Colley and said Deputy Colley's demand was not sufficient, that what was needed was at least £50 million.  This was not a very sensible suggestion.  Considering that industry does not contribute £50 million in income taxation it would be difficult to see how you could give a £50 million tax relief to those who were not paying £50 million in the first instance.</P>
    <P>Even if Deputy Lynch's extraordinary dream could be achieved, particularly in a year when company profits are down, it would cost another £38 million which would have to be added to taxation or budget deficit.  We should also have provided, according to Deputy Meaney, Deputy O'Connor and others another £1 million for the repair of bog roads.  Suggested further improvements in pensions would add £2½ million.  Providing retraining of married women, demanded by Deputy Lemass, would cost £500,000.  To provide the additional money sought by Fianna Fáil for local improvement schemes would have cost £4 million. Social welfare increases demanded by Deputy Power would require an additional £17 million.  To increase the horticultural oil subsidy would cost an additional £750,000.  To have raised the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act loan and income limits to the points demanded by Deputy R. Burke and <Col N="808" /> others would have cost an additional £25 million.</P>
    <P>An increase of 50 per cent in new house supplementary and other grants demanded by a number of Opposition spokesmen would cost £6 million.  To eliminate the tax element in tourist petrol, which is now being demanded by some sections, would cost £3 million.  To give additional moneys to amenity grants would cost £500,000.  A variety of other Santa Claus expenditures, extending from subsidising the wiring of new private houses to giving more money to the Land Commission and additional money for Muintir na Tíre and so forth, would have cost an addition of £20 million.  At the end of this beautiful Santa Claus distribution Fianna Fáil would have added to the tax bill this year an addition of £228 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Fianna Fáil's cure would be either unmerciful increases in taxation of £228 million, so that they could don Santa Claus's habit and distribute the little gifts, or they would have had us begging for money around the world to the tune of £353 million.  They cannot have it both ways.  If they had consulted with one another before the commencement of the budget debate they might have been able to agree some figures and eliminate some conflicts. The conflicts that existed between the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Colley on items like the relief of taxation on industry might not have appeared.  Quite clearly they did not consult with one another or, if they did, they could not agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly correct. In am not going to engage in an exercise, which I declined to engage in yesterday, which would involve repetition of statements which I previously made.  There is no point in assuming that we can overcome all our problems by foreign borrowing. Foreign borrowing, no matter for what purpose it is made, even if it is made in order to carry us over the temporary difficulties of the oil crisis, is nonetheless incurring a debt at a high price, because interest rates are currently high and for a short term, because at present money is only being lent on short term.  Therefore we have to be prudent about the size of the foreign borrowing which we make.  From all sectors, not merely from the Opposition benches here, has been incessant demands for more and more money from the Government. The simple truth must be faced that at the moment, when we are operating in a deficit budget situation, we are not as a community paying our way.  We are instead borrowing abroad in order to cover current expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That happens to coincide not only with our own correct assessment of the short term needs of the situation but also with every worthwhile opinion of every reputable economist at home and abroad.  It coincides, too, with the recommendations of all the international organisations with which we are associated, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the European Economic Community, the Organisation for <Col N="810" /> Economic Co-operation and Development and so forth, the recommendation that we should endeavour to borrow without regard to the burden of repayment.</P>
    <P>In extending our foreign borrowing this year, as we propose to do, to £225 million we are satisfied that this is as much as we can prudently stretch our foreign borrowing demands at this time To stretch our foreign borrowing requirements any further would be imprudent at present because we would then have a debt obligation which could be beyond our capacity to pay. We must keep our capacity to repay in mind at all times.  Loan repayments will influence our standards and quality of life later since we will have to set aside a proportion of our resources to repay the debt and interest.  Our credit standing is also something which will determine the willingness of other countries to lend money to us.  To maintain our credit standing we must live within our resources.  The Government may not succumb to all the pleas that are made for additional revenue.  We must limit our expenditures to what we can prudently expect to get on the domestic and international money market.</P>
    <P>It is well also to remember the cost of servicing the national debt.  It makes a serious inroad on current spending. It limits the ability of the Government to hand out in any year all the money that comes in because a significant proportion must be retained in order to repay capital sums and interest.  The cost of servicing the national debt in 1975 is estimated to be £224 million and that, by any standard, is a very considerable sum.  Quite clearly we must be careful not to add imprudently to the very heavy cost of servicing the national debt.  Taken with the borrowings which were made in 1974, this year's borrowings will give a total in excess of the total amount borrowed since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>This is not any sign of improvidence or recklessness.  It is a consequence of the unusual economic circumstances in which this country and many others find themselves at present.  Of course borrowings of this nature would not be feasible at all if the oil-producing <Col N="811" /> countries were not building up massive surpluses of up to £35 billion a year, surpluses which they themselves are unable to consume within their own economies.  On that account they are in some position to lend money.  To our great disappointment, the recycling of surplus petrol dollars has not yet developed with the efficiency and speed one would have wished, but there are signs in the early months of 1975 that there will be an improvement and that the International Monetary Fund will have double the amount it had last year for recycling purposes.  There will also be the OECD recycling facilities for member countries and the private banking system is adapting itself to the changes necessary to recycle surplus money from OPEC.  These countries themselves are engaged in direct lending, particularly to the developing countries.  They gave to Ireland for the first time last year a £27½ million loan. This was a unique development, directly related to the oil situation and one which gives us courage these days that we will be able to get sufficient resources by borrowing them.</P>
    <P>The fact that money is available to us does not mean we must be reckless and take more money than we can properly use and properly repay in a comparatively short period. There are, quite clearly, many uncertainties in the present economic situation both at home and abroad and it is difficult to predict what the trends will be in 1975.  On Monday of this week I was present at a meeting of the Finance Ministers of the EEC where we had a review of the economic situation affecting the Community and the world in 1975. It would be wrong to say the meeting was pessimistic and it would be equally wrong to say it was an optimistic meeting.  The general assessment was that no country in the western oil-consuming world would have a growth rate exceeding 2 per cent, and it was anticipated that a number of countries might not have any growth or have a negative growth rate.</P>
    <P>This is not a very encouraging prospect and the most that can be hoped for is that the slide towards recession <Col N="812" /> will be slowed down in the coming months and that the end of the year might see the commencement of an upturn in the economies of our trading partners and ourselves. Therefore, though at present we can say there is a flicker of light at the end of a dark economic tunnel, we cannot be certain even at this stage that the light could not be quenched by some undesirable economic movement over the year. However if the wisdom that now seems to be descending on the economic and financial world is maintained, we can hope for an improvement towards the end of 1975 and throughout 1976.</P>
    <P>Assuming that the reflationary measures taken in a number of key industrial countries are effective&mdash;in Germany, the Netherlands and the US&mdash; and that as a result the world economy arrests the slide towards depression, the external environment should become more favourable as the year progresses.  However our prosperity, our capacity to improve our situation, will depend as much if not more on our domestic behaviour as on external factors. Domestically, a vital factor will be the trend of incomes.</P>
    <P>If income increases are in line with the Government's recommendations in the White Paper&mdash;increases no more than necessary to compensate for the cost of living&mdash;the growth rate should increase by about 2 per cent. But if there is any departure from these essential guidelines on income, then we will put our growth rate in jeopardy and we will certainly increase the danger of further unemployment.</P>
    <P>This is not an Irish jaundice virus. This is the view that was recited by each member of the Council of Ministers in respect of his own national economy at the recent economic and finance meeting of the nine EEC Ministers.  All countries intend to stick by this formula.  If several other countries have consumer price increases less than ours, because they are not as vulnerable as we are to international trends, and if those countries link their income increases <Col N="813" /> to more than their domestic consumer price index, it means that their rates of income increases will be considerably less than ours.  This in turn means that if we are prudent enough to limit our increases to no more than consumer price increases, we will still be put at risk from a competitive point of view in external markets.</P>
    <P>There are already signs that in some markets the economic situation is forcing down prices.  We therefore face a double challenge, that as our own costs may tend to rise, we may find it difficult to sell in markets where domestic costs are declining, which means we could widen the cost gap and increase the amount of competitiveness facing us.</P>
    <P>An examination of likely trends of expenditure and gross national product shows that the greatest stimulus to our economy will come from exports and consumption. Looking back on 1974 now, we know that the volume of consumer expenditure probably fell by 1 per cent.  In 1975 this trend should be reversed and moderate volume increases could be recorded.  This is partly due to the high level of salary, wage and income increases anticipated.  These increases will come even if there is no new increase in income levels this year, because the carry-over effect of the 1974 National Pay Agreement will mean an increase of 25 per cent in non-agricultural incomes this year without any further arrangements being entered into.  That with much improved agricultural incomes is a very significant stimulus to the economy.</P>
    <P>On the external front merchandise exports should also continue to rise, but it would be unlikely that they would rise at the same fast rate as they did in 1974 particularly as in the early part of 1974.  But industrial exports should pick up significantly in the latter half of the year because of reflationary action being taken in a number of other big industrial countries.  Agricultural exports should see a very remarkable and most welcome improvement throughout 1975. It is not unreasonable to expect also that tourist receipts and numbers <Col N="814" /> should have an upswing in 1975.  A large proportion of our tourist increase in recent years has come from continental traffic, and the indications are that this great and very welcome growth of tourists from continental countries will show a significant increase in 1975, and what we hope will last, the more peaceful situation in the North of Ireland, could have a really dramatic impact on growth in our tourist traffic.  Other earnings abroad are also expected to increase at approximately the same rate as in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Therefore my advice today to industry in general is to prepare now for the inevitable growth which is going to take place in world economics in the latter half of 1975, in 1976 and onwards.  We have come to a point where the factors which were bringing the world into the depression have been recognised and corrective action is being taken.  Some of these depressionary forces have been so strong that, although corrective action has now been taken and the brakes applied, the momentum towards depression is likely to carry some of the world economies a little further down before they reach bottom and start on the upswing.  At last the mistakes of 1974 have been recognised in those countries which were primarily responsible for generating global depression.  As corrective action is now being taken, 1975 should be a year in which we will see steps to end our present difficulties and a significant improvement as a result.</P>
    <P>I cannot overemphasise that it will take some little time before the significant improvement reaches us here.  Usually it takes Ireland from four to six months to respond to significant economic swings, up or down in other parts of the world. When depression is descending on the world elsewhere, it is of benefit to us to be behind others, but unfortunately when the upswing comes it may take us a little longer to absorb the benefit of that upswing.  However, we have both the opportunity and the capacity now to move in the right direction. The best profits are made by people who refuse to follow the herd instinct by those who are one jump ahead of <Col N="815" /> those who are still in a state of despondency, and by those who, when things are in a state of boom, have the wisdom to realise that booms do not last forever.</P>
    <P>The proper recipe for Ireland today is to anticipate the growth which will take place towards the end of 1975, to prepare for that now, to make sure that our capacity will be sufficient to meet the growth which should be quite significant towards the end of 1975 and throughout 1976. If we have the wisdom to do that, we can overcome the delay in improvement which has been our normal experience but which is unnecessary. That is one of the reasons why, notwithstanding the constraints on resources this year, we have given an addition of 43 per cent for industrial expansion, maintenance, development and improvement and for new industries this year.  We regard this year as one to prepare for the inevitable growth which is ahead of us.  The great opportunities which we foresaw for this country on entry to the EEC are still there.  Distressing and all as our experience has been throughout 1974, it would have been immeasureably worse and indeed devastating, if we had not the opportunities and advantages of the EEC open to us. The EEC economy is still basically sound and has within it great capacity for further growth.  A number of the EEC countries are, notwithstanding the oil crisis, notwithstanding the fact that they are importers of oil, in a position of surplus and others are in a balanced position, so that, once the upswing comes, these countries will be ready to absorb a very substantial amount of our industrial and agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>On the import side of the account there are signs of a considerable deceleration in import prices.  In view of this, the increase in the total import bill should be well below what we experienced in 1974.  When allowance is made for increased international transfers from the EEC and other sources, the deficit on current account of the balance of payments is likely to be between £240 million and £250 million.  This would be a <Col N="816" /> very significant improvement in difficult times, a reduction of £25 million to £35 million in the record deficit which we had of approximately £275 million in 1974.  The anticipated reduction in the deficit is, of course, in line with the strategy which we outlined in the White Paper of seeking to reduce the deficit to acceptable proportions over a period of years.  This is necessary in order to ensure a gradual repayment of our debts and in order to show conviction to other countries that we are tackling this problem with which every country will have to deal.</P>
    <P>One of the main determining factors in deciding to introduce what was a carefully expansionary current budget was the Government's commitment to maintain employment.  We have given in the budget a boost to domestic demand by the significant tax reliefs of just £28 million and by the social welfare improvements.  Initially this should result in an end to shorttime working which has been a major factor in pushing up the numbers on the live register over the past few months.  The numbers on short time have varied for some weeks around 10 per cent of the total live register. This situation, with the tax reliefs which we have given and with the gradual improvement in the world economic climate, should begin to correct itself before too long.</P>
    <P>In addition to aid for existing industry the public capital programme is designed to give a further boost to employment prospects.  Particular emphasis has been placed on grants for industrial development with a view to increasing in 1975 and in subsequent years both industrial potential which we regard as vitally important and job opportunities.  To this end the Exchequer contribution to industrial development, through the IDA, was raised for this year from £19.5 million to £42.5 million.  These measures indicate the central role which the maintenance of employment has in the Government's economic strategy for this year.</P>
    <P>We are in no way complacent about the unemployment situation.  It constantly concerns us, but it is worthwhile pointing out that we have had <Col N="817" /> one of the smallest growths in unemployment in Europe in 1974.  Other economies have had increases in their unemployment rates of as much as 150 and 200 per cent while ours has been between 30 and 40 per cent. That is much more than we would wish for but the fact that other economies, including ones which have no balance of payments deficits and which are not obliged to borrow abroad, have had bigger cutbacks and a greater growth in unemployment, is an indication that the Government and our economy are maintaining the maximum amount of employment in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>In addition to job creation we are maintaining our objective of increasing industrial development in the deprived regions.  The IDA have established 23,000 jobs as the target for industrial job creation in 1975. They are confident of achieving this target.  An achievement such as this at a time of serious world depression can be considered marvellous.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with some specific points that have been raised. Deputy Lynch appeared to suggest that external factors were in no way the cause of unemployment in Irish industry.  He said that the fact that industrial exports had increased by 40 per cent was proof of that.  If the world economic climate had not deteriorated and if the economy in Britain&mdash;which is one of our largest markets&mdash;were not in the mess in which it is, our industrial exports for 1974 would have been much greater than they were.  If we had been able to maintain throughout 1974 the momentum we had at the beginning of the year we would have had a dramatic improvement in the number of people employed in industry.  Towards the end of the year there were employed in industry here the same number of people as were employed in that sector at the beginning of the year.  That, too, was a unique experience in the European and, indeed, in the world environment.</P>
    <P>The world recession has affected adversely foreign demand as well as domestic demand.  Despite the expansion of industrial exports last year, <Col N="818" /> consumer demand at home fell and this led to an increase in overall unemployment. There were two other reasons for rising unemployment, first, firms producing for the home market may have lost part of that market because of intense foreign competition and, secondly, the increase in industrial exports may have been generated to a large extent by newer exporting firms with assured markets while older export firms may have been affected by the depressed level of external demand.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy O'Connor and Deputy Dr. Hugh Gibbons and speakers on the Government side, emphasised that the buying of Irish goods is completely within our own control.  There is no restraint on us either by reason of EEC, GATT or any other obligations, from buying Irish goods.  All that prevents us from buying home-produced goods is our indifference or our own disinclination to support Irish industry. That tendency has never been justifiable.  It is unforgivable that people would not give due preference to Irish goods at a time when Irish industry is so dependent on the home-market. It is now more important than ever to buy Irish when so many of foreign markets that were available to us have shrunk because of economic difficulties in those countries.</P>
    <P>I should hope that out of the current debate regarding the problems of Irish industry, people will recognise an obligation to persist in their support of Irish industry and to be proud, as they should be, of the high quality of our goods, a quality that many people may have doubted for a long time but the fact that Irish industry has shown the greatest growth in industrial exports of any European country in recent years, is proof that what Ireland can produce, Ireland can sell in any part of the world.  The Government have warned, as has every prudent economist, that while the quality of our products is good and will always be accepted as such, we must keep the price right.  Whether we do that will depend on our own willingness to moderate our expectations <Col N="819" /> of income improvements. A number of Deputies opposite endeavoured to belittle the effect which imported inflation had on prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the fact that, notwithstanding the jeers of the Opposition, 60 per cent of our inflation is imported from abroad.  Either we import necessary goods from abroad, or we go without. As long as we are obliged to import essential items like energy and so forth from abroad, we will have to pay world prices for these essential commodities.  If anybody knows of any markets where these things can be got below world prices, I and the Government would be only too happy to hear about it.</P>
      <P>The simple fact has to be faced that, if we want to buy essential goods from the world, we have to pay the world prices.  It is the seller who dictates the price and not the buyer.  As I said earlier, there is a hope that throughout 1975 the prices of some commodities will level off and that we will not see, because of the world recession at the moment, increases in prices.  Demand in many cases is now less than supply.  Indeed in some cases producers and suppliers may be forced to drop their prices in order to find markets for their commodities. This will lead throughout 1975 to a situation in which the percentage of inflation attributable to outside causes may become less.  Therefore we would need to take extra care not to generate domestic inflation at a rate even equal to that which we have generated in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been suggestions from the Opposition that the Government propose to abandon price control.  I would hope that the debate which is now taking place on prices during Private Members' Time, and the speech yesterday and other utterances from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Government, will show that the Government intend to <Col N="820" /> continue to keep control over prices. An essential consideration in determining a proper price is the provision of an adequate profit so that employment can be maintained.  It would be a stupid policy indeed which put such a curtailment on prices that profits were eroded and converted into losses to such an extent that people became unemployed because of the inability of employers to pay them.</P>
    <P>Already a number of employers have said that they are unable to meet the 10 per cent threshold increase in the national wage agreement because their profit situation is in jeopardy. The tax reliefs given in the budget to industry will be of some assistance to these people, but we must face the possibility that in some cases there may have to be an adjustment of the previous guideline for prices if industry and employment are to be maintained. I have not heard anybody suggest yet that employment should be put in jeopardy in order to keep prices down.</P>
    <P>Some commentators have suggested that the Government should come to the aid of industries which are unable to meet the 10 per cent threshold in the 1974 wage agreement.  Indeed they have further argued that the State should provide the proportion of pay necessary to enable employers to meet what exists under the 1974 national wage agreement and any future pay agreement.</P>
    <P>I want to put beyond all doubt the Government's attitude on this matter. This attitude is not due to any disinclination on the part of the Government to help.  It is dictated by economic realities; those realities I outlined at the beginning, the reality of a deficit of £125 million, the reality of taxation which in most areas cannot be increased without acting as a disincentive, the reality that the current budget is now running at £1,250 million odd.  In a time of economic difficulties the State is unlikely to enjoy buoyancy in revenue such as was enjoyed in days when, in common with the rest of the world, Ireland was enjoying an economic boom.</P>
    <P>In 1974, notwithstanding inflation which many commentators jeeringly <Col N="821" /> suggested was something which Ministers for Finance relished because it improved revenue, we found that revenue buoyancy fell.  Estimates of revenue were not fulfilled in the outturn. In 1975 we have been extremely cautious in our estimates of revenue. While we have been cautious we have been realistic.  It would be wrong for anybody to assume that there will be a significant difference in the estimates of revenue made for 1975.  There will not be.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government were willing to come to the assistance of industry and employers for the purpose of paying wages, the Government could get that money only by taxation, or by borrowing abroad.  For the reasons which I spoke about at such length earlier, it would be imprudent to increase our foreign borrowing significantly and certainly we would be unwise to increase our foreign borrowing for the purpose of meeting current consumption.  If foreign borrowing is to be made it ought to be concentrated on investment so that the moneys invested will improve the country's capacity to repay the borrowing made, and to pay the interest on it.  To return to prices, it seems to me that the suggestions from the Opposition on prices are ill-judged and hasty.  We must look at the consequences of all price increases. We must look not merely at the consumers' interest, which is a very valid one&mdash;and one does not wish to see the consumer carrying any more costs than are necessary&mdash;but also at the employment position, and indeed not merely the current employment position but also the capacity of firms to re-invest in order to expand later on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley suggested that I had not done anything in the budget to try to break the inflationary trend.  It is probable that the indirect taxation imposed in this year's budget will increase the consumer price index by about 1¾ per cent.  We did not do this with any great relish.  The impact of that increase could be reduced if we, as a community, did as many other countries do, that is, if we eliminated from the base of indexation of income increases such elements of indirect <Col N="822" /> taxation as amount to expenditure on luxuries in order to transfer resources to poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the Government drew attention to this sensible discipline in the White Paper, <i>A National Partnership.</i>  While we have spoken about this in that White Paper and elsewhere, we have not yet heard anyone say it would be wrong to eliminate such a percentage from wage calculations in future.  This seems to indicate that people realise this is a reasonable and not unfair thing to do, particularly at a time of economic difficulty.</P>
    <P>If we had the wisdom to do that, we could significantly reduce the effect which otherwise indirect taxation would have upon costs generally.</P>
    <P>The additional indirect taxation on luxuries in this budget was unavoidable unless desirable essential increases in social welfare allowances were to be foregone.  The cost of the total social welfare benefits is £34.63 million while the yield from the additional indirect taxation is estimated at £32 million and, as I pointed out earlier, tax reliefs in the budget have amounted to £28 million.</P>
    <P>The other options open to the Government would have been to increase income tax, which we considered to be wrong at a time when many incomes were in fact falling in both nominal and real terms, or we could have increased indirect taxation, for example, on VAT, or we could have increased the budget deficit and, if we had increased the budget deficit, we would also have had to increase the foreign borrowing requirements.  I have no doubt that, if we had adopted any of these other courses, they would have met with equal objection from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Prior to the budget there was a suggestion in the report prepared by the secretariat of NESC, subsequently endorsed by others, that taxation reductions should be on VAT and not on incomes.  I had the opportunity of meeting the social partners prior to the budget and I put to each in turn what their preference would be&mdash;a reduction on VAT or an increase in personal allowances in income tax&mdash;<Col N="823" /> and they were unanimously of the view that tax reductions should be given by means of income tax allowances and not on VAT.  That was because it was seen, as it will be seen by any sensible person, that if income tax allowances had not been adjusted, people would have sought bigger wages to compensate for the erosion because of inflation of the personal allowances under the income tax code.  It was also seen by many people that a reduction in VAT rates would not necessarily mean that the reductions would be passed on to the consumer.  There would be a likelihood that at least a proportion of the reductions would have been lost in profits before any part of the benefit reached the consumer.</P>
    <P>On the VAT front it was suggested by Deputy Colley that we could have reduced VAT by 4 percentage points and this would have produced a reduction in living costs.  To do that would have meant forfeiting £67 million revenue and that £67 million would have had to be made up elsewhere. The £67 million, if it were imposed on the old reliables in addition to what we imposed, would have meant colossal increases in these items to a point where there certainly would have been a reduction in consumption and a consequential material reduction in revenue.  If we added on those increases, which would be thrice the increases we imposed, the cost of living would have risen by between 5 per cent and 6 per cent, all for the purpose of tricking around with the VAT system to get an illusory reduction of 1½ per cent to 2 per cent.  The net position would have been an increase of 4 per cent in the cost of living and a loss of revenue.  That loss would have had to be made good elsewhere.  This, again, is another example of the total confusion in thinking on the part of the Opposition.  Every proposal they made in this debate in itself contained its own contradiction and, as if that were not good enough, there was not a speaker on those benches opposite who made any proposal which was not subsequently contradicted by one of his colleagues.  Of course, the sincerity of people who talk about reducing <Col N="824" /> VAT on essential items can be fairly tested against their promises in this House that, when they return to power, they would reimpose VAT on foodstuffs.  Now they talk about having food subsidies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the truth. Deputy Haughey's view is that the Fianna Fáil Government, if returned to power, should re-impose VAT on foodstuffs.  Instead of this wonderful 5 per cent reduction that Fianna Fáil were going to get by producing £100 million out of the air to subsidise foodstuffs, their policy, certainly until recently, was to have a tax of over 5 per cent on food.  I think we can now reject as another insincere and badly thought out idea this suggestion that Fianna Fáil would subsidise foodstuffs.  Their behaviour in the past was to abolish with one stroke, all subsidies on foodstuffs and they followed that up by imposing a tax on food which remained for ten years until we got into power in 1973 and wiped it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, I think, covered the main lines of criticism of the budget.  As I said earlier, they were obviously very shallow and badly thought out and <Col N="825" /> there was no effort at all by the Opposition to produce a party line because they contradicted one another again and again and the way in which the debate fizzled out indicates an indifference on their part as to what is really happening.  On that account, I have great confidence in recommending this third budget of the National Coalition to Dáil Éireann for approval.</P>

I should like to raise a point of order now on the order moved this morning and passed by the House in regard to the conclusion of this debate.  It mentioned the conclusion not later than <Col N="826" /> 9.15 p.m., or whatever time is set out, by a member of the Government.

      <P>The order this morning provided for the conclusion of business at 10.15 p.m. but it contained the stipulation &ldquo;if not previously concluded&rdquo;.  Hence it could conclude earlier and, indeed, it has concluded.  All the Fianna Fáil speakers offering were called and, when no further Members offered, the Minister was called on at 12.12 p.m. to reply.  In the circumstances the provision in the order for a final Fianna Fáil speaker to be called not later than 8.15 p.m. was rendered abortive.</P>

      <P>I do not question the Chair's ruling at all.  I merely want to ascertain the facts: I am sorry I was not here.  The fact is that Deputy O'Malley and I were engaged on a special committee of this House <Col N="827" /> the whole morning and if we had had the slightest warning one of us could have come in.  We have been sitting since 10.30 on the Law Reform Bill Committee and we were not informed.</P>

      <P>For the record, since the peculiar situation has arisen in which, despite the order made this morning, I have not been allowed to reply, it should be placed on the record of the House that the Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party was informed this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach of the names of four Deputies on the Government side who intended to speak in the debate and who did not speak.  It is only correct that that should be placed on the record of the House.  Whatever the reason for their not speaking it is not my business but it contributed to what has occurred.</P>

      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the way this situation has developed is in no way an attempt by the Government to boobytrap the Opposition.  It is not an attempt to do that at all.  The situation, as I understood it and anticipated it this morning was that I knew of three or four Government Deputies whom I gratuitously named and which I was under no obligation to do, for Deputy Lalor.  I will tell the House who they were if Deputy Lalor would like me to do so, because they did intend to speak and are disappointed at not having had the opportunity but it just so happened that at the moment Deputy O'Connor sat down there was no one else in the House at all except a member of the Government side who was not among the four Deputies I had mentioned but there was no intention on our side to lay a landmine under the Opposition in this regard.  I appreciate Deputy de Valera's disappointment.  I assure him that it is shared in some degree by the people on this side who <Col N="828" /> have been deprived of an opportunity to speak.</P>

      <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that.  We appreciate that that is what happened. The Parliamentary Secretary, through the Chair, will forgive me if I emphasise that it is very difficult to get the opportunity for discussing financial business.  I have been seeking the opportunity.  I know it is nobody's fault that I was not here.  I was engaged on a committee of the House all that time along with Deputy O'Malley and other Deputies on the Government side.</P>

Would the Minister tell us why that has not been done?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Along with Deputy Fintan Coogan I think I was the only Deputy now in the House who was in the House when the Chair called upon me to conclude.  When Deputy O'Connor, who was speaking from the back benches&mdash;there was no member in the Fianna Fáil front bench at the time&mdash;sat down, Deputy Coogan spoke and when he sat down the Chair called upon me to conclude, there being no other Deputy in the House much less anybody offering or in a position to speak.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce had, in fact, intended to speak today and I know that he was ready to speak but in the situation which arose there was no option but for the Minister to respond to the request from the Chair. May I say that perhaps if I had had further time I might have spoken in a very different way but I also had to <Col N="829" /> respond to the situation as it occurred? As Deputy Colley knows, the Minister for Industry and Commerce did make a very useful speech last night on this question of price control on a Private Members' Motion.  So, his words of wisdom have not been lost to the House.</P>

These are now being examined to see how they can be implemented. The 30-year rule in Britain applies generally but there are certain restrictions of a character which restricts sensitive papers&mdash;sensitive in the sense of either where persons are still alive or for some other reason.

The price given is an average price and it varies from over £70 per acre down to as little as a few pounds an acre for very inferior land.  The land acquired for forestry is, by and large, land that is not useful for any other purpose.  I do not accept that there is unemployment in the forestry section in recent times&mdash;this does not arise on the question.  Over the past ten years or so fewer people may have been employed in forestry than previously, but that is due to the introduction of mechanical appliances such as tractors and also to weed-killing substances and things of that kind that have reduced the necessity for employing as many people as previously.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a specific question.  Is the Minister satisfied that a maximum of £70 per acre is adequate?  I do not accept that all the lands the forestry section acquire are not suitable for anything else.  They are acquiring mountain areas that have been used for sheep-rearing over a long period which farmers are very reluctant to sell.  Is the Minister satisfied that a maximum of £70 an acre is high enough?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Within the last few years, since the advent of the EEC, it has been more difficult to get land for forestry because <Col N="834" /> farmers are inclined to hold on to it to decide whether they can reclaim it and graze animals on it or not and, of course, the market price for land of this type is always under review and if it is necessary to increase it it will be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps the EEC has taken to review and extend the Arusha and Yaoundé Conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly) Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose, in view of the lengthy nature of the reply, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Protocol 22 of the Treaty of Accession, concerning relations between the Community on the one hand and the Associated African and Malagasy States (AAMS) and the independent developing Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Caribbean on the other, envisaged that the countries which participated in the Arusha Convention and certain Commonwealth countries listed in Annex VI of the Treaty of Accession should be offered the possibility of ordering their relations with the Community according to three formulae; namely:</P>
      <P>1.  participation in the new Convention to follow the Yaoundé Convention then in operation,</P>
      <P>2.  the conclusion of a convention of the Arusha type, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, particularly in the field of trade, or</P>
      <P>3.  the conclusion of trade agreements.</P>
      <P>In the event, negotiations on the first model were begun in Brussels on 25th July, 1973 and invitations to participate in them were subsequently accepted by a number of additional countries, namely, Bahamas, Grenada, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Liberia, Sudan, Guinea, and the new state of Guinea-Bissau. In all, 46 developing nations, including all of black Africa, participated in the discussions on a single model of economic relations with the Community. It is, perhaps, worth noting the remarkable unity which these countries, known collectively as the ACP States, displayed during these negotiations.  Never before have so many States had to collaborate on each side in working out an agreement of such magnitude and technical complexity and of such vital interest to the economies of all the parties involved.</P>
      <P>These negotiations ended on 1st February, 1975, in agreement on all the texts of a new convention&mdash;the &ldquo;ACP/EEC Convention of Lomé&rdquo;, so called after the capital of the West African state of Togo, where the agreement is due to be signed on 28th February, 1975.  The texts are to be recommended by the ACP negotiators for the approval of the Council of Ministers of the ACP, meeting in Accra on 11th and 12th February.  The new convention will apply for a period of five years from its entry into force, following the completion of the necessary ratification procedures.  In the meantime transitional arrangements will be made to facilitate trade relations.</P>
      <P>It is of interest to note that it was agreed during the negotiations that the amount fixed for financial co-operation would be calculated over a five-year period commencing with the date of signature rather than a five-year period from the date of entry into force.  This agreement constitutes a substantial improvement in the Community's offer of actual financial aid over the next five years and thereby a substantial further concession to the ACP states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new convention covers trade; stabilisation of export receipts; industrial co-operation; financial and technical co-operation; provisions relating <Col N="839" /> to establishment, services, payments and capital movements; institutions and general and final provisions.</P>
    <P>In the case of trade, the Community decided not to seek reciprocal concessions in return for free access to the Community market for products originating in the ACP.  Free access was granted to the ACP countries for all their industrial exports to the Community and for 96 per cent of their agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>The new convention contains a number of novel features going beyond the sort of relationship which existed under the Yaoundé and Arusha Conventions.  Perhaps the most significant is the scheme, in the trade sector, for stabilisation of important export receipts of the ACP states, giving them a guaranteed price level for such primary products as tea, sugar, coffee, sisal, iron ore, cotton, palm products and raw hides and skins.</P>
    <P>There is also an important advance on the old type of arrangement in the Convention's Chapter on &ldquo;Industrial Co-operation&rdquo;, which aims to promote the development and diversification of industry in the ACP states through the transfer of technology, through market promotion and through investment by Community firms in the ACP states.</P>
    <P>The financial co-operation envisaged by the new convention amounts to a total of 3,390 million units of account, of which 3,000 mua will form the new European Development Fund, 2,100 mua in grants, 430 mua in special loans, 95 mua in risk capital and 375 mua for stabilising export earnings, and 390 mua will come from the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>These significant features distinguish the ACP/EEC Convention of Lomé from its predecessors and mark a new type of co-operation between nations of the developing and the industrialised worlds.</P>

      <P>Diplomatic relations have been established since 1st January, 1974, with: Lebanon, Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Kuwait, Morocco, Quartar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>Of the foregoing we maintain an embassy in the Lebanon at an annual cost to the Vote of my Department of approximately £65,000. Ambassadors will be accredited to the other countries on a non-resident basis at an annual cost of approximately £500 in each case to cover travel, representation, and miscellaneous expenses.  Embassies in Moscow and Vienna were also established since 1st January, 1974, though we have had diplomatic relations with the USSR and Austria before that date.  The annual costs in these cases are estimated at £65,000 and £52,000 respectively.</P>
      <P>In addition, annual rentals and maintenance costs for premises to be borne by the Vote for Public Works and Buildings will amount to approximately £30,000 in the cases of Moscow and Vienna and £40,000 in the case of Beirut.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if his attention has been drawn to the report of the proceedings of the House of Commons of 22nd January, 1975, to the effect that Rockall generates its own fishing limits like any other part of United Kingdom territory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made by the Lord Advocate for Scotland on the date mentioned by the Deputy that Rockall generates its own fishing limits like any other part of the United Kingdom.  It was made in the course of a reply to a question whether the Lord Advocate intended to pay an official visit to Rockall.  The Government do not accept that the <Col N="841" /> British Government is entitled to make or enforce any prohibition on fishing in the seas about Rockall and have so indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the Government do not accept the right of the British Government as indicated by him, may I ask him what steps our Government are taking in connection with this reiterated claim by Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, the House, perhaps, ought to know that no effort has been made to enforce these claimed fishery limits against our fishing ships and, secondly, that the whole question of maritime jurisdiction is under consideration by the Conference on the Law of the Sea. It is regrettable that the British Government should have sought to anticipate the conclusions of that conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that it is regrettable that the British should have sought to anticipate the agreements of that conference, nevertheless since they have done so does the Minister intend to take any steps to counteract the reiterated claim of Britain in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's interest, of course, is immediately centred round Rockall but the Government do not accept in general that islands as such necessarily generate a jurisdiction in the way that ordinary land does and the Government have pursued that point of view by their representation at the Law of the Sea Conference last year by sending the Attorney General in person there.  The conference ended inconclusively but the Government have pressed that point of view and have tried to recruit support for it and I think I can tell the House there is some support for it.  The Conference on the Law of the Sea will reconvene next month and I hope that when it does the Government's point of view will be successfully pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary <Col N="842" /> Secretary agree that a specific rebuttal of this implied claim might be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>A specific rebuttal was made by the Minister's Department on 17th October, 1973.  The British Government formally informed the Department of their intention to enforce a prohibition of fishing around Rockall and a couple of weeks later the Department sent a short note back saying that the Government did not accept that the British Government were entitled to make or enforce any prohibition on fishing in those seas.  Apart from a rejoinder which reiterated the essence of the first note that is the situation so far as a formal exchange has got.  The Government did in the words of the Leader of the Opposition, specifically rebut the claim when it was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reply made on 22nd January in the British House of Commons.  Was there a specific rebuttal made of that implied claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it is not considered that a specific rebuttal of a claim which is part of a parliamentary reply in the British House of Commons requires to be made.  The Government's position has been made perfectly clear and the Government's general position in regard to maritime jurisdictions is being vigorously pursued.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Heads of Government decided on 9th-10th December last that the regional fund would be put into operation by the institutions of the Community with effect from 1st January, 1975.  Since then the council has been examining the draft implementing regulations which will govern the operation of the fund.  These cover such matters as the areas to benefit, the type of project to be assisted, the level of fund aid to particular projects and the financial administration of the <Col N="843" /> fund.  Agreement was reached at the council on 10th-11th February on all but one of the outstanding points and I expect that all the implementing regulations will have been adopted early next month.</P>

There is a further claim now before the conciliation council that certain staff, including provincial postmen, be given a Monday to Friday five-day week.

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the post office premises at Raheny are proving physically <Col N="848" /> inadequate for the pressure generated by housing expansion in the area generally. I have been taking steps to relieve this pressure by the establishment of new sub-post offices.  One such was opened at Donaghmede shopping centre last month.  I have also approved the establishment of a new sub-post office at Kilbarrack and it is hoped that it will be possible to appoint a postmaster there shortly.  I hope that these steps will so relieve the pressure on Raheny that the normal good standard of service there can be maintained at all times.  I shall keep the situation under review.</P>

      <P>I am only too willing to hold a competition for a licence to provide a cable system <Col N="850" /> there when I am satisfied that a satisfactory signal can be received and the other conditions attached to the granting of licences are met.  I understand that one company have shown interest in the possibilities of piped television in the Galway area but are not yet in a position to formulate proposals in the matter as it would be necessary to set up a monitoring system over 12 months in order to ascertain whether a reliable signal would be available all the year round.  Without such information clearly no worthwhile proposals can be formulated.</P>
      <P>I have been in touch with representatives of the Galway multi-channel television campaign both during last year and within the last few days about this matter and I believe they understand the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if the effect of his reply is that the people of Galway cannot expect to have available a second television channel earlier than at least 12 months from now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case. The only company who have shown interest in the matter in relation to cable television have reported that they would need to monitor the fairly faint signal available in the area over a 12month period to ascertain whether a reliable all-year-round service could be maintained for viewers.  Obviously in relation to cable the work of providing such a service could only start if this monitoring produced satisfactory results and that would take some months. We expect that by the end of 1976 the transmitters and micro-wave links in which the Government have invested will be completed and that by then it should be possible to provide by that means one alternative service which we think is likely to be BBC 1.  It will be the first time any choice of programme will be available to residents in the Galway area.  It is progress in the direction this Government would like to see and, if I infer correctly from this question by the Fianna Fáil spokesman, I am glad that they would also like to see freedom of choice expanded in this area.  Some previous statements by Fianna Fáil Deputies in <Col N="851" /> this House suggested they opposed the bringing of what Deputy Tunney calls &ldquo;Telefís na Banríona&rdquo; to areas such as Galway.  I take it that that position is not now maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair point.  I have not yet had the benefit of the views of the present spokesman for Fianna Fáil&mdash;I am sorry he is not here today but I appreciate he has to be somewhere else.  When Deputy Brugha was spokesman I had many discussions with him on this subject and he indicated he favoured an alternative service but that that alternative should be a second RTE channel.  My understanding of the views of people in Galway and elsewhere is that a second RTE channel is not regarded by many of them as a satisfactory outcome.  Ideally what they would rather have is probably, as Deputy Molloy now suggests, piped television programmes from UTV, BBC 1 and BBC 2.  It is not very likely they will get all of them.  It is my understanding from my discussions with their spokesmen that they would prefer even one outside service direct such as BBC 1 to RTE 2.  It was my proposal to provide them with BBC 1 but this was deprecated by Deputy Tunney&mdash;I am sorry he is not present either&mdash;as constituting a proposal to bring to the people of the west &ldquo;the Queen's television&rdquo;, &ldquo;Telefís na Banríona&rdquo;. It appeared to me that Deputy Tunney, a Dublin Deputy, tried to stand between the people of the west and south and what he seemed to regard as the corruption implied in &ldquo;Telefís na Banríona&rdquo;.  If that is not now Fianna Fáil policy I am glad to note it.  However, I am not quite clear what Fianna Fáil policy is, perhaps because their spokesman is not present for his question.</P>

      <P>The Department's information, based on knowledge about distance from BBC and UTV transmitters, is that signals which would provide acceptable reception on the cable system are not available off air in Galway city.  In order to provide acceptable reception the signals would need to be available on a continuous basis and tests would need to be undertaken during a fairly long period to establish the quality and regularity of such signals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regarded as inadvisable for the Department to arrange tests of signals quality as suggested. The only people who can usefully make such tests are cable operators who would have to have regard to the type and location of mast it would be economic to provide in relation to the estimated capital and running costs of a cable system in that area.  The quality of reception on a cable system depends not only on the signals available off air but also on the type of mast provided and its proposed location.  Accordingly, there would be no point in the Department carrying out tests in the absence of <Col N="855" /> evidence of tests carried out by cable operators interested in providing the scheme, together with particulars of the type and location of mast proposed. Moreover it would be undesirable for the Department to do anything which would involve taking responsibility for the quality of signals in the case of multi-channel cable television systems.  The signals at best are of the fringe type and are below what would be regarded as acceptable by normal engineering standards.</P>

      <P>On balance, I would. The minimum size of a refinery nowadays is reckoned to be twice the size of the existing refinery here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Court have not recommended a two thirds increase in the pensions of CIE wage grade pensioners.  On 1st July, 1974, the Labour Court recommended that similar arrangements to those obtaining for public service employees should be made for CIE wage grade pensioners with effect from 1st July, 1974.  The court also recommended that in calculating total pension, that is, two thirds of the rate of pay in force on 1st July each year, account <Col N="860" /> should be taken of personal social welfare benefits paid by the State but exclusive of such benefits paid in respect of dependants.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of the recommendation CIE granted pensions to wages grade pensioners equal to those which they would have received had they retired on 1st July, 1974.  The company also undertook to review these pensions in the light of the position current on the 1st July each year in future.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Transport Act, 1950, the onus is on CIE to make proposals to me for both new and amending superannuation schemes.  The full implemetation of the court's recommendation in relation to the calculation of CIE pensions would involve a radical change in the structure of the statutory CIE wages grade pension schemes and I understand that CIE are at present in consultation with the trade unions on the question of amendments to the wages grades pension schemes.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>Since 1946 it has been Government policy to encourage the use of native fuels.  Effect has been given to this policy through the use of turf and Irish coal for the generation of electricity and by ensuring that State, semi-State and local authorities give a preference to native fuels for space and water heating and other heat loads normally associated with buildings under their control.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the improvement of roads, including roads in bog areas, falls mainly on the Minister for Local Government.  Grants are available to county councils for improvement works under the local improvements scheme administered by that Minister. The scheme includes bog roads.</P>
      <P>Grants for the improvement of minor access roads and bog roads are also given by Roinn na Gaeltachta. These works are extended by the county councils.</P>
      <P>My responsibility in this connection is limited to the provision of small grants for the improvement and maintenance of bog and accommodation roads used for the delivery of turf to the small power stations at Gweedore, Screebe, Miltown Malbay and Cahirciveen. There are no funds at my disposal from which a grant for other bog roads could be given.</P>

As I said earlier today, we have gone away from the day of the ass and side creel to get into bogs.  You must have tractors today and most of the roads are unsuitable for them.

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been giving this proposal very sympathetic consideration from the tourism point of view.  The scheme proposed by the Irish Hotels Federation does, however, raise a number of serious difficulties. In the first place it is difficult to establish that the proposed concession would, in fact, lead to increased tourist revenues which would justify the direct cost to the Exchequer.  The scheme would also involve a subsidy to foreign tourists and, therefore, discriminate against Irish motorists, including tourists from the North of Ireland.  As Deputies will be aware there have also been demands from other sectors of the economy for concessions in respect of petrol tax.</P>
      <P>Any scheme for separate prices for petrol for tourists or other particular classes raises grave difficulties of administration and opens the way to abuse.  Such concessions also, of course, run contrary to the policies of conservation of energy which we have adopted in common with other oil consumer countries.  The proposals are still under examination in consultation with the Department of Finance and I hope to be in a position to convey a decision at a very early date.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister taking into account the fact that this country is an island and every foreign tourist who comes here, other than those from Northern Ireland who would not count under this scheme, has to bring his car in by ship?  The cost of getting here is much greater than it is in respect of getting to any other European country.  Does he not appreciate that, unless some concession is given to motorists, not alone will there not be an improvement in the number of motoring tourists but there is likely to be a drop because of the substantially higher costs of getting to Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Shipping in the area referred to by the Deputy is within easy range of one or other of the British west coast marine radio stations which, like their Irish counterparts at Valentia and Malin Head, maintain a constant listening watch on the recognised international distress frequency.  These functions are discharged by the stations in question on an international basis and in discharge of obligations under international conventions which transcend national boundaries.  In the circumstances there would be no point in duplicating at considerable expense the already adequate facilities provided by British west coast stations.</P>
      <P>These stations operate on MF (medium) frequency and vessels in excess of certain dimensions are required under the Merchant Shipping Acts to carry MF radio equipment for safety reasons.</P>
      <P>In the case of the accident referred to by the Deputy I understand that the MF radio fitted in this vessel was in a corroded and unusable condition. The vessel was also equipped with a VHF radio which was in working condition, but this equipment is suitable for short-range operations only and does not permit of communication with the coast radio stations.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to honour its promises in regard to control of prices; notes with concern the apparent intention to enforce even less strict price control; and calls for the implementation of the various available forms of assistance to industry which will help firms in difficulties without resorting to further price increases.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Looking through the National Prices Commission reports for the past two years I see that when this Government took office there were 53 applications before it in that month, and within four months the applications had gone to 114.  There was a slight fall back then and, again, there were further rises until it reached an all-time peak in the middle of last year of 128 applications. The rate of inflation and the rate at which prices were allowed to increase is a fair indication of how the Government were running the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are excessive price increases in the reports, for instance, increases granted to solicitors, particularly in relation to free legal aid, range from 43 per cent to 308 per cent.  Even accepting that this was the first increase they got for four years, some of the increases are still excessive.  If a solicitor is making a bail application and a case is stated, for one day's hearing there is a fee of £28 and for each additional day £14.  For a visit <Col N="881" /> to Mountjoy, St. Patrick's or other penal establishment, it is £9 plus travelling expenses as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The commission also deal with the Dublin fruit and fish market.  Restrictive practices in the market are referred to, but only a small paragraph is devoted to this.  If they had really gone into what was happening, particularly in the fish market, they would have found that a price ring and restrictive practices are being operated.  I have seen myself where only six people from particular firms were allowed even to bid.  Suppliers and shopkeepers have come up from the country and the auctioneer would not take their bid because the auction was under the control of these people. I know a case where, because none of those six persisted in the auction, they called it off and waited until the outsider went off so that they could sell the goods privately among themselves. When the commission were carrying out their investigations they did not go deeply enough into it.  I see from the report that they intend carrying out further investigations, and I hope this aspect of the fish market will be thoroughly examined.</P>
    <P>There was a more thorough investigation of the fruit and vegetable market.  There should have been more diligence in regard to the checking of prices, particularly the prices of imported fruit.  Usually the importer is also the wholesaler so that although there is a transfer of the fruit from one firm to another there is only the one person involved.  The traders who come from the country to buy fruit and vegetables in the markets here say that the margins of profits in some cases in so far as the wholesaler is concerned range from 50 to 100 per cent.  Therefore, it is obvious that a closer watch should be kept on prices in this area.</P>
    <P>The big increase in the number of applications for price increases during the two years that this Government have been in office gives a clear indication of the way the Coalition have mismanaged the affairs of the country.  This, in turn, has led to our very high rate of inflation.  There should have been more stringent control <Col N="882" /> such as that exercised when we were in office when the applications each month were only half the number that have been coming before the NPC during the reign of this Government. The situation has now been reached where, because of the rate of inflation, price controls have to be removed in some areas in order to keep some firms afloat and so that they will have a cash flow.  The situation has become so bad that the Minister is afraid to tackle it.  These cold facts are an indictment of the Government's handling of prices during the past couple of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to speak for this side of the House to this motion relating to price issues. We might revert to the motion to realise the degree to which we are speaking at a tangent and to see how irreconcilable are sections of the motion which reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to honour its promises in regard to control of prices; notes with concern the apparent intention to enforce even less strict price control; and calls for the implementation of the various available forms of assistance to industry which will help firms in difficulties without resorting to further price increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion begs the question as to what Deputy O'Malley and Fianna Fáil suggest should be done in regard to this issue.  Last evening the Minister spoke of negativism at the weekend and sought a positive response.  I think we got that positive response in Deputy O'Malley's speech last night. Reverting to our debate on industry and Commerce in December last, a number of speakers from this side referred to the Fianna Fáil attitudes in regard to prices.  We recognise that prices are probably an area of fair game so far as the Opposition are concerned.  During that debate the Minister for Foreign Affairs said that at no stage was there any suggestion either of what precisely should be done or of what we were not doing. We would seem to have the answer from last night's debate because <Col N="883" /> Fianna Fáil, through their spokesman, are apparently articulating a new policy, a clear break from past traditions, in advocating the subsidisation of food.  It is clear that this was the kernel of and, apparently, the solution to the problem.  However, if we consider this issue of subsidisation we could develop a philosophical argument about the Opposition and their attitudes in the past to issues such as this.  I should have thought that within this country they were the ultimate example of <i>laissez faire.</i>  The Minister, being pragmatic, quoted an example&mdash; butter&mdash;in which he said that if the price of butter were to be reduced by only 15p per lb., the cost to the Exchequer would be £12 million.  This would be only one small aspect of the issue we are dealing with.  If the Opposition are being serious about subsidisation presumably they are talking of subsidisation at an infinitely higher level and this, in turn, begs a further question which the Opposition should have a responsibility to answer.  It is that if we are talking about subsidising food as a means of reducing the cost of living and if we are talking in terms of from £50 million to £100 million, in what other area is this money to be found in a way which would not, in turn, affect the cost of living?  There is a great deal of nonsense in this area.</P>
    <P>Because Deputy O'Malley was placed in the position of having to talk about food subsidisation, the motion is foolish.  Apparently, as the remedy for the prices situation, the latter part of the motion calls for the implementation of the various alternative forms of assistance to industry so as to help firms in difficulty without their having to resort to further price increases.  This is a lot of nonsense. There is a wide range of assistance to industry.  That range of assistance exists through State policies, through the auspices of the IDA, through the CCT, through the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, through the Industrial Credit Corporation, through Fóir Teoranta if there is a rescue problem where a company is in a critical state. <Col N="884" /> Any question of implementing these forms of assistance does not apply to Government implementation but to implementation by the firms who are being encouraged and exhorted every day of the week by the Minister to implement them.  It is farcical to suggest that the implementation of this assistance is relevant to the Government if the Government are selling the idea to people that they should avail themselves of the assistance which is available in the morning if they apply for it.</P>
    <P>It is ambiguous and quite far-fetched to suggest that such implementation, whether it be by private industry or by semi-State bodies, or by Government Departments, will help firms in difficulty without resorting to further price increases.  That is the inference in the motion.  There is no corollary that if greater effectiveness takes place, that if greater productivity takes place, this will result in further price increases.  This also is a lot of nonsense.</P>
    <P>In the National Prices Commission's Monthly Report for November, 1974, they refer to this issue.  They state:</P>
    <P>Given the size of the increases in money incomes that have occurred in recent years, and the increases that will occur during 1974, it is only very rarely that they can be met from profits or significantly offset by improvements in productivity and efficiency.  If all applications based on increased wages and salaries were rejected, the result would again be redundancies and bankruptcies.</P>
    <P>They also state:</P>
    <P>If the Commission rejected all applications for price increases while the external and domestic causes of inflation continued to operate, the consequences could be predicted with confidence.  If firms were not allowed to recoup the increased costs of imported materials from higher prices, redundancies and bankruptcies would follow within a relatively short period.</P>
    <P>This is the reality of the price issue. <Col N="885" /> In setting out so many irreconcilables, the motion is obviously mischievous and intent on gaining publicity rather than contributing to national debate in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the motion noting with concern the apparent intention to enforce even less strict price control.  This merely refers to a side remark made by the Minister in his speech in the Estimate when he spoke of the liquidity position, when he spoke of the difficulties many companies are getting into, when he spoke of the necessity for profits, and of the certain circumstances in which very strict price controls might be against the national interest.  If Deputy O'Malley notes with concern an intention to enforce less strict price controls, this does not relate to the reality of business and commerce and the necessity for price increases based on increased costs which arise and for many other reasons.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the position in the textile and shoe industries.  We are being treated a little unfairly in this regard.  The Minister referred to it yesterday evening.  There are other points which should be borne in mind. I know the Minister has had discussions with the Commission.  The first result of his negotiations has been a visitor to this country to investigate the position.  I know the Minister is extremely concerned about the position in the textile and shoe industries.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to put certain matters into perspective.  When we entered the EEC we were extremely fortunate in being able to retain certain incentives for industrial development which were not conceded to any other country in the EEC.  Up to now we were not saying these things too loudly because it might have been damaging to the national interest if we tended to gloat about them.  In the present climate, it is necessary to say these things.  We have been allowed to retain the concession of complete relief from taxation on export sales in the manufacturing industry.  We have been allowed to retain the option to give substantial cash grants in the area of capital investment in manufacturing industries <Col N="886" /> coming in here.  We have been allowed to arrange that this applies to sales within the Community, apart altogether from sales in North America, Japan, the Middle East, the Near East and Scandinavia.  This was a tremendous concession and achievement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me compliment the Government on their achievement in retaining them, It was a very good deal which I, for one, applaud.  It must be put into perspective that, if we can retain these incentives, we have an enormous advantage in attracting industries.  We are aware of the figures for last year in which industrial exports ran at about £600 million and in which the percentage increase was about 40, completely beyond the level of inflation.  Along with agriculture, this is the most buoyant element in our economy.</P>
      <P>The danger we are in as a country is that if we press too hard, we may gain in the short term in one or two narrow instances which are a small percentage in relation to industry and to the nation but, in the long term, there can be a catastrophe if the squeeze is put on us in a much broader area.  This is a matter about which we should show some sensitivity and some real concern.</P>
      <P>The question of internal or external factors in these increases has been raised.  Deputy O'Malley suggested that one-third of these are beyond our control. I have not looked into the available statistics but, broadly speaking, a great deal of them are imported.  There are factors which are national which, to a degree, are imported.  One of the national factors, which is to a degree imported and which is inevitable, is the consequential farm price increases arising from EEC membership and consequential increases in the price of foodstuffs in Irish shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that through EEC membership we have managed to increase substantially the income for the farmers who, together with their farm incomes and greatly increased social <Col N="887" /> welfare benefits are more than matching any pace of inflation.  We know that as a consequence of that, farmers' goods in the shops or in the market place will increase in price.  We are conscious of that.  However, as a nation it makes for a very good deal, because we have proportionately the highest number of people in any EEC country still working in agriculture, in comparison with the situation in Britain and Germany where you are talking about a 5 per cent fringe and where the workers tend to pay for the party if there are enormous price increases.</P>
    <P>We have attempted to protect other sectors through the substantial social welfare increases.  While we have imported inflation to an extraordinary degree, in addition, many of the statistics related to what is termed internal are to a degree external in that they are beyond our control.  If we are negotiating in Brussels for the benefit of our farmers, which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been doing extremely well over the past two years, every time he negotiates successfully it adds on an internal increase which is inevitable but which is for the greater benefit of the nation.</P>
    <P>Additionally in the internal elements are the normal wage increases coming to people which again are inevitable to a degree.  Suggesting that the internal element in this is completely within the hands of the Government to do what they like with it, is a great deal of nonsense.</P>
    <P>The profits issue has been raised and the question of liquidity and the banks.  In referring to this yesterday, Deputy O'Malley attempted to relate the liquidity issue and the banks issue to price increases.  I accept that it is a factor.  Without question there is an inter-relationship between the different elements in any business or any industry.  It is far-fetched to bring this in as a broad reason for price increases because the relationship is minimal.</P>
    <P>Again referring to what I quoted from the Report of the National Prices Commission, of course there is a liquidity problem, a banks problem, but the solving of the liquidity problem, <Col N="888" /> or the expansion of credit by the banks, might well improve the liquidity of the companies.  There is no inference in any way that it will lead to these companies having any capacity to reduce prices.  Suggesting that greater liquidity or expansion of credit will create a situation in which prices will come down is a lot of nonsense. It does not hold water.  It is the rebuttal of these suggestions which has now put the Opposition into the position of talking about the subsidisation of food.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the offshore oil question.  In my judgment, it is irrelevant to this motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. With regard to the National Prices Commission and the job they are doing, they were set up by the previous Government and there has not been any change of policy to my knowledge.  It seems illogical to me that people now in Opposition, who established this commission, which is working under the same terms of reference today, should at this stage start complaining about the commission and the work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their job is not to prevent price increases but to examine applications coming before them and see to what degree they can moderate demands.  I am personally aware of many instances where companies have made applications and these applications were not <Col N="889" /> granted, or possibly half the increases sought were granted, or possibly more. In the judgment of some of these companies the increases granted were not sufficient to allow them to expand or take up options in other areas of activity.</P>
    <P>We are talking now about Irish industry and Irish people and, if we are to attempt to support Irish industry, Irish personnel and Irish key management in the battle of wits, and wits is the word, against the multi-nationalists and the large companies, and we do not apply the same <i>raison d'etre</i> which is applied to these companies in other countries, we are downgrading Irish management, Irish personnel and Irish business people and putting off for some time the possibility of Irish business taking up certain options. This is the reason the Minister referred to the fact that in many instances it is possibly true to say that profits at a higher level should be made in the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>From June, 1973, to October, 1974, for example, the National Prices Commission examined 1,634 proposals; the recommendations they made were for £33 million under the figure sought.  My own view about prices is that the market place decides, if there is a fair market place, and I have had some personal experience in the grocery trade.  I am aware that for a decade or 20 years there has been the most intense competition in this trade, the type of competition which has sent many family businesses to the wall. There has been rationalisation.  There has been the development of supermarkets, all based on keen prices. There have been recommendations made to successive Ministers about unfair competition and companies selling goods too cheaply.  This is the reality in the market place and so it seems to me the market place does not hold any answer on pricing difficulties.</P>
    <P>Might I summarise by describing this motion as a gimmick?  It is not serious and the fact that the spokesman for Industry and Commerce should take it in such a way as to talk about the implementation of various forms of assistance to industry proves it is a <Col N="890" /> gimmick.  I would ask him when he comes to reply to say in what way the Government could implement their alleged obligation in relation to private companies in industry.  If the response is positive it is possible there are things we should not be doing and things we should be doing that we are not doing. If there are aspects in that area we should like to hear them.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to have an expansion of that point, on the question of calling for the implementation of various forms of assistance to industry and how this relates to helping firms in difficulty without resorting to further price increases.  We are also entitled to an expansion in regard to the food subsidy issue because, if we are now reaching the stage where the spokesman of Fianna Fáil&mdash;the party of private enterprise, as they claim themselves to be, the party which in office in the past made notable achievements in the area of industry and commerce, which I gladly acknowledge&mdash;in a major debate on price control issues tables a motion which is a lot of nonsense and irreconcilable in itself and suggests in the latter part of his speech that the answer in regard to price control and price increases is the subsidisation of food, then we have reached a really extraordinary stage thinking back to the removal of VAT from food by the present Government, a step opposed totally and vigorously by the Opposition who said it would make no difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>It made this difference: it reduced the price of food by the proportion of VAT on the day on which it was removed.  What happened to cloud the decrease was the fact that there had been inflation and farmers had got substantial increases in prices and the result was that it had had to go into the market <Col N="891" /> place and into the shops and therefore the reduction was not as apparent as it might have been that VAT was effective.  What the Opposition are saying to us is to extend the VAT situation.  A year ago the Opposition opposed the removal of VAT by a minor percentage from food and Deputy O'Malley, the Fianna Fáil spokesman for Industry and Commerce, the largest party in the State, is telling us now that the answer to price increases is to give subsidies on food.</P>

      <P>Not only do they want an expansion in the areas of food which are going to be covered and the areas in which they think subsidy will work, but there is a complete change of philosophy.  We would like to hear the reason for this change.  We would also like to hear a further extension of this and the degree to which the Opposition would welcome the subsidisation of food.  As the Minister pointed out, a reduction in the price of butter by 15p would cost the Exchequer £12 million and butter is only one item on the shelf. The Opposition would extend subsidisation to flour, bacon, meat and so on.  We are talking then about £60 million, £70 million or £100 million&mdash;take your figure&mdash;and, when the Opposition have taken that figure, then come back to us and tell us from which area the Exchequer will get these funds and, when the Opposition have got these funds, will they tell us then whether or not the getting of these extra millions from other areas of activity in the economy will or will not have any effect on price increases or price control and the degree to which the Government may be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view this motion is a sham. It is not serious.  I would have welcomed <Col N="892" /> areas of constructive help as to how development could be advanced and how we could attract more jobs in the nuances in which constructive opposition might be helpful.  I agree with the remarks the Minister made last evening.  In this debate the speeches we have heard are a carry-over of the negativism of the Opposition at their annual party conference over the weekend.  This is a bankrupt policy.  In a narrow political sense it may suit my Government to see Fianna Fáil in the role of Alice in Wonderland in this area of industry and commerce and prices, but I think it is sad for this nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was extremely interesting to listen to Deputy Staunton saying that the idea of the Fianna Fáil spokesman for Industry and Commerce putting down a motion condemning the failure of the Government in not living up to their promises was a sham motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain?  I did not complain about objections to price increases.  I complained about the extensions which are contradictory and do not make sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that there are a great many ideas in connection with prices now that do not seem to make sense but which, in February, 1973, seemed to make a heck of a lot of sense.  We had the shameless admission in an article in a daily newspaper over the last few days from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that a number of promises were made before the last election and had not been kept.  But one sees things differently when one gets into Government.  He did not quite say what his colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said some time ago, that nobody should have taken them seriously, but he did say in effect: &ldquo;Now that I am in the chair of the Minister for Industry and Commerce I find that the application of an idea is extremely different from the generation of the idea in the first instance.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very conscious of the difficulties <Col N="893" /> that exist in relation to price increases and because of the knowledge I had of the inflation taking place abroad and affecting prices before 1973, it became extremely difficult for me at that stage to justify the very small increases that had taken place over the previous 12 months.  It was extremely difficult for me then to find a logical answer to the claims that were being made by Opposition spokesmen that they would be able to stabilise prices and prevent further increases.  Deputy O'Malley in moving this motion gave a number of ideas on how the situation could be improved and made suggestions which the Minister brushed aside.  It appears to me, having listened to Deputy Staunton, that he considered this to be a rather ridiculous motion that need not be taken seriously.  I think the Government have reached a stage when they accept that they have not been taking it seriously and that this is generally acceptable.  Deputy O'Malley mentioned that the general public are punch-drunk with price increases. This is so.  No matter how sizeable price increases are at present they do not seem to provoke the same reaction from the public as they did two years ago because they were, in general, rare at that time.  The 1p on the loaf, the butter, or the stamp caused consternation but now, due to the efficiency or inefficiency of the Minister for Industry and Commerce increases are an everyday occurrence, led primarily by his colleagues in Government.</P>
    <P>There is no need for me to go over again the ground covered yesterday by Deputy O'Malley&mdash;the unchecked, unmonitored increases conceded, the increases the Government gave to themselves and to the Government services in television, the ESB and various other public services and which have succeeded in bringing the public to a punch-drunk state so that if a person picked up the paper tomorrow and saw that bread had gone up by 3p on the 2 lb loaf he would say: &ldquo;This is awful but what can we do about it?&rdquo;  People are wondering when this Government will collapse so that they can get the old duffers back, the <Col N="894" /> fellows without brains who for 16 years kept the country going, improving the economic situation year after year without any of the glamour and without having the services of a specially detailed publicity agency&mdash;I do not want to go into that.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been able to present himself as a most sincere and genuine person who looks objectively at everything and studies it from all angles.  He has certainly satisfied the country as a whole that he gives sufficient time examining every topic from every possible angle, generally taking two years to make up his mind in regard to anything except prices&mdash;they seem to be sanctioned as they roll in. To Deputy Staunton, I would say that I am not aware that the National Prices Commission, as such, has been attacked.  Up to two years ago the Commission was recognised as an agency which had been set up while I was Minister for Industry and Commerce to examine price increases and make recommendations to the Minister who carried the can for sanctioning them.  The publicity and the announcements issuing from the Department of Industry and Commerce in my time&mdash;these can be checked&mdash; showed that the Minister had sanctioned the increases but now every official announcement comes in the form: &ldquo;On the recommendation of the National Prices Commission, the Minister has sanctioned ...&rdquo;.  The can is supposed to be carried by the Commission, dedicated people doing their job to the best of their ability.  But the Minister must accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>We had a number of increases that the Prices Commission did not sanction or recommend such as those I have been talking about.  Whenever we come up with constructive, straightforward criticism the Minister for Industry and Commerce, having no genuine answer to it, says: &ldquo;You are damaging the national economy; you should not be talking like that; this will interfere with our image in Europe.  You are affecting the overall business I am trying to do very quietly in Europe.&rdquo;  We had an example of this yesterday evening when the Minister attacked Deputy O'Malley <Col N="895" /> for raising certain discussions in which the Minister, it would appear, is surreptitiously engaged in Europe to help our economy.  Everything the present Minister is doing seems to be surreptitious; we cannot see any evidence that he is doing anything useful for the country.</P>
    <P>One of the taunts thrown at the Opposition regarding their criticism of the Government's failure to implement that promise&mdash;and there is complete failure in that regard&mdash;is: &ldquo;What would you do about it?&rdquo;  I remember offering advice to the Minister six or eight months ago&mdash;which was not accepted then&mdash;that he should do something about meat prices.  Everybody, except the Minister, knew that cattle prices were at a very low ebb.  I read in the same article that he likes moving around among his cattle.  I am sure he did know cattle prices were very low but he did nothing effective to have the benefit&mdash;a disadvantage to the farmer &mdash;converted into an actual benefit to the housewife as it should have been, enabling her to procure cheaper meat. He did express a pious wish that butchers should charge 5p per lb less but there was nothing to back that up. On the other hand, yesterday, when Deputy O'Malley was attacking the Minister, the Minister asked if the Deputy was suggesting that the farmers should not get the higher prices as agreed by the EEC.  Of course, the farmer should get the higher prices and we can assume that when the farmer gets the higher prices and the butcher has to pay more for the fat cattle there will be another price increase.  That is justified but it is the responsibility of the Minister to see that when the price of cattle goes down there is a corresponding reduction in the price of meat.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the monitoring being done by the Minister's Department and by the National Prices Commission on the purchase price of imported articles.  Let us take the example of boots and shoes.  I accept that the Minister has a problem in this regard because if he monitored the prices and effectively <Col N="896" /> controlled the mark-up on those articles they should be sold at much lower prices.  In that way they would probably constitute greater competition for home-based industries.  When I was Minister I asked the trade unions to take note of this matter. The boot and shoe industry is in serious trouble.  Let us take a pair of Irish shoes selling at £7 or £8 and giving a profit of, say, 25 per cent or 33 per cent to the retailer.  On the other hand, a pair of Italian or English shoes may give him 55 or even 100 per cent profit.  For that reason the shop assistant or shop manager will run down the Irish shoe and recommend the foreign one.  This situation arises because the Minister is not effectively controlling the mark-up on imported articles.  I accept that he has a problem but he has a long enough experience of price increases to take effective action.  There is the extra bonus for the shop assistant in selling the more expensive article and this is preventing the sale of the home-manufactured article.</P>
    <P>A prominent trade union leader made a recommendation in the last few days that all imported articles should have a protective duty of 33 per cent imposed on them.  This, as he sees it, is to give a boost to home-manufactured products.  I believe it is the wrong way of doing it and it is also impracticable.  Our spokesman on Industry and Commerce and our spokesman on Finance have talked about the question of reducing VAT in order to give an incentive in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton suggested that we could not be serious and the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked about the about-turn of a party which had imposed VAT across the board and had rejected Opposition criticism at the time it was introduced.  At that stage we told the Opposition and the public that if we were to take VAT off food and put it on other items, which is what the present Government did, it would have a greater inflationary effect.  This fact is completely overlooked by Government spokesmen.  The Government cannot justifiably claim that the Opposition <Col N="897" /> have not been constructive in relation to price increases.  Deputy Staunton, a short while ago, again claimed that more than 50 per cent of our inflation is imported despite the evidence presented to us by the Central Bank and also the statement of Deputy Staunton's own Taoiseach.  There is no point in the Minister for Industry and Commerce continuing to blame the Arabs.  We know all about that. It is remarkable that the main criticism of the only Government speakers we have had&mdash;the Minister and Deputy Staunton&mdash;was that we had no right to put down this motion.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt the Government have failed to honour their promises.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="898" /> and Commerce has the audacity to stand up here and say I am wrong when I say he has admitted that he has failed to fulfill his promises in this regard.  I am not putting the actual words into his mouth but he certainly did say that being in Government and being in Opposition were two separate things and that it was far easier to see from the Opposition side how things should be done but that when you are in Government yourself it is a different proposition.  That is grand once you have deceived the public and got to that side of the House.  I got a degree of satisfaction listening to Deputy Crinion quoting from the monthly reports of the National Prices Commission and referring to the fact that when this Government took office the number of price applications before the National Prices Commission was 53.  We all know that would only take up two or three pages in the bulky monthly reports at present.</P>
      <P>I hope that the Minister for Finance will read that aspect of the report because I have a recollection of him saying that one of the biggest problems the present Minister for Industry and Commerce had when he took up office was to get the doors of the Department open because the place was packed to the door with applications for price increases that were awaiting the change of Government.  It is now on the record that the smallest number of applications in any month were the 53 applications that were on the desk of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce shortly after he took up office. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Staunton talked about what it would cost to subsidise food and the figures of £80 and £90 million were mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>We merely made suggestions and we were wondering at what level the Deputy wanted to pitch in at.  We were not speaking definitively on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was stated that it would cost £12.4 million a year to subsidise butter to the extent of 15p per Ib.  My information is that very few retail stores in Border areas on our side <Col N="899" /> can succeed in selling any butter.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce in the &ldquo;Involvement&rdquo; programme last week welcomed this idea and said it was a help to us that we were able to buy our own Irish butter back so cheaply from Britain.  I do not think the Minister was conscious of how hard it is for the retailer in the Border areas to live when housewives from such areas, and further south, cross the Border weekly to purchase their supply. In welcoming this the Minister said that the British Exchequer was subsidising those people but I have not heard of any arrangements made by him to help the retail trader in those areas who have to live with that sort of recession around them.</P>
      <P>I found it interesting that when the Minister mentioned that in order to subsidise the food items mentioned by Deputy O'Malley it would run to between £80 and £90 million and that if he had that sort of money to spare he would much prefer to give it out in social welfare benefits or to use it to stimulate the building industry.  That statement was quite intriguing in view of the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, does not seem to be aware that that industry needs stimulating.  The communication between the Government and the general public seems remarkable but what is twice as remarkable is the lack of communication between one Minister and another in the present Government.</P>

      <P>I suspect that there is not a sufficient monitoring of the prices of imported articles.  Whether this is deliberate or otherwise I do not know but taking it across the board with the amount of general household <Col N="900" /> articles we need and are imported if an effective job of monitoring was done we could reduce the cost of living considerably.  I do not want the Minister to say to me that there are no fields where an effective policing job of this nature could not be done more efficiently.  I throw that advice out to the Minister for free.  The Minister has said that one of his worries in relation to the price control as operated by the National Prices Commission is that some of the Irish manufacturers are being watched too closely.  In mentioning the relaxation in price control he said he might have to allow a greater degree of profit.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was afraid the policing by the National Prices Commission would have the effect, following the criteria they had been following in relation to applications for price increases, of squeezing some of the manufacturers too much.  On the other hand there are importers who are not being watched as effectively as they should.  I join with Deputy Crinion in his views about the importation of various fruits, and so on.  It appears as if there is not a sufficient check in this regard and the housewife has to pay more.  I was surprised that Deputy Staunton, who speaks so much on industry and commerce, said that the non-availability of cash or the liquidity problems of industries were being exaggerated by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

      <P>Liquidity is one of the problems as also is the availability of cash and the best way the Government can keep companies in business, rather than allowing greater price increases than are justified, is to improve the availability of credit from the banks in the manner suggested by Deputy O'Malley.

      <P>I want to place clearly on the record of the House that it is possible to set maximum prices or regulations and to police them and this Government have most certainly done so under the general aegis of the National Prices Commission and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The only exceptional difficulty in policing in so far as specific commodities are concerned has been in relation to drink.  It is no harm to remind the House of the efforts of the Government in this regard. We now have maximum price orders fixed for a number of commodities and if Fianna Fáil want to be constructive they should at least say that prices should be fixed in relation to a number of additional items.  In doing so they would have to consider the consequences in respect of employment, profits and viability of an industry.</P>

      <P>We have rigorously policed maximum price orders in relation to a series of commodities and we will continue to do so.  I will give the House some examples of the surveillance we have carried out. From 1st November, 1973, to 31st January, 1975, in relation to maximum prices for milk we had 44 prosecutions and 40 convictions; in relation to maximum prices for household goods orders we had 231 prosecutions and 229 convictions; with regard to maximum prices on cigarettes we had 14 prosecutions and 14 convictions; in relation to other maximum price orders we had 42 prosecutions and 42 convictions, a total of 333 prosecutions and 325 convictions in the period in question.  Deputies O'Malley and Colley should examine carefully their record when they instituted the surveillance machinery and when they listed a smaller number of commodities for maximum price orders.  They will have to agree our record is much stronger, more rigorous and effective.</P>

It shows a man in a bookshop who wants to buy a book called &ldquo;Learn About Inflation&rdquo;; the assistant tells him although it is marked £1.25 it has gone up to £3.50.  Unfortunately, that is not just a joke&mdash; it is the kind of reality consumers of every commodity have to face in the shops.  I am supposed to apologise to their majesties, the Government and their supporters, for having dared to put down a motion that called attention to the fact that the Government got themselves elected on a promise to keep the price of everything as it was in March, 1973.

      <P>The Government have and that is a problem for them. I was criticised in a patronising way by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for allegedly not suggesting how prices should be controlled.  I spoke last night for 40 minutes and, apart from the Minister's interruptions, I devoted 30 minutes to a long list of things which could be done but were not done.  However, I have been criticised <Col N="904" /> by the Minister and Deputy Staunton for not doing that.</P>
      <P>I do not know what is the point of speaking in the House.  I set out my criticisms and suggestions but I was criticised immediately afterwards for not doing so.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke for 30 minutes last night and today Deputy Staunton spoke for 25 minutes but the entirety of each speech was to criticise what I had said.  Neither of them made the slightest attempt to justify themselves or to defend their record because it was unjustifiable and indefensible and this they knew quite well. The people know the facts only too well.</P>
      <P>It is almost implied in what they said last night and today that we should be very grateful we are living under a Government who have inflation running at a rate of 20 per cent to 25 per cent.  Even though the Minister did not say so, Deputy Staunton made it quite clear that he approves of the less strict price control, which the Minister threw out as an aside in Deputy Staunton's words, on one occasion.  Aterwards he was not quite sure whether he should have done this but, in practice, there is less strict price control.  We are told it helps companies but last night I gave a long list of methods by which companies could be helped in their liquidity and other problems.</P>

      <P>As well as the very large number of increases in prices <Col N="905" /> which have taken place, a small number were as a result of the deliberate action of this Government on matters under their own control, which they did not have to send to the National Prices Commission.  Posts and Telegraph charges went up by 75 per cent. It costs ?d. in old money to post an ordinary letter.  RTE licence fees increased by 40 per cent.  Health contributions increased by 80 per cent. Petrol, which was already at a very high price as we all tragically know, increased by 15p, or 3s. overnight in five surreptitious minutes in this House at the end of November.</P>
      <P>The increases in the budget added 2½ per cent to the cost of living index. The social welfare stamp has gone up by an amount that is as yet undisclosed by the Government but it could be increased by as much as 100 per cent.  They have not denied the suggestions that that is a possibility.  All these matters were totally within their own control and completely without justification.  Not one word have we heard from the other side in an attempt to justify that.  Everyone of those matters affects every person or business throughout the country directly or indirectly.  By driving costs up they correspondingly drive prices up. This is the Government who allege they are doing their best.  If their members believe they are doing their best with regard to prices, they are the only ones who do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was alleged today that we are complaining about the National Prices Commission.  I was very careful in all I had to say last night to point out the difficulties under which the prices commission work, to point out the long, as I described it, <i>apologia pro vita sua</i> which they printed in their December, 1974 report to quote certain parts and to show the difficulties and the limitations under which they work.  I pointed out last night that this commission were set up in the summer of 1971 at a time when inflation was running at about 7 per cent and was in no sense a fraction of the problem it is now.  At that time they were given certain terms of reference.  Now in 1975 when inflation is running at probably 23 per cent or more, that <Col N="906" /> prices commission have somewhat narrower terms of reference if anything because the important commodities such as fertilisers and animal foodstuffs were removed from their control and overnight in many cases increased in price by 100 per cent.</P>

One of the numerous suggestions I made last night&mdash;although I am told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="908" /> and others that I did not make any at all&mdash;was that in the context of the present situation, with inflation running at over 20 per cent, and perhaps as much as 25 per cent, and particularly with large sums of money coming into the country as a result of our entry, happily, into the EEC, this is the time to begin to implement the putting of subsidies on certain vital commodities which are absolutely necessary to sustain life in our people and, particularly in the poorest people.  What is alleged is that because we applied VAT in 1972 across the line at a time when inflation was 7 per cent, the things which were valid then should be equally valid now.</P>

      <P>Inflation is now running at 23 per cent.  I pointed out that in Northern Ireland at the moment butter can be purchased by the housewife for 23p per lb. retail.  Down here it is 42p or 42½p.  As Deputy Lalor said, happily many hundreds of thousands of people are in a position to purchase butter at 23p per lb.  That is not much good to retailers in six counties around the Border.  As the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries pointed out in the course of an Adjournment Debate on the increase in the price of butter shortly before Christmas when one of the subsidies was removed deliberately by the Government, causing an increase of 3p per lb., butter is supposed to be bad for your health.  Even if it reduces consumption, what about it.

Fault was found with our alleged lack of suggestions but not the faintest effort was made to defend the situation because prices of essential commodities increased last year at 20 per cent per annum and are running in the current year at 23 per cent at least and possibly 25 per cent. Let me remind this House that this is from a Government which, if any one single point got them elected, as they were narrowly elected at the end of February, 1973, it was the promise, which some people fervently believed, that prices would be controlled by that Government and that the outrageous increases of 7 per cent and 8 per cent <Col N="910" /> per annum, which had been taking place up to then would be stopped&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The benefit of the EEC monetary and prices package to the Irish agricultural sector is estimated at £60 million in a full year, or approximately £45 million in the calendar year 1975.  The cost to agricultural employers of granting a wage increase of £2.80 per week from 1st March would be approximately £3.3 million for 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that the order of the Agricultural Wages Board now before Dáil Éireann does not provide for the 10 per cent threshold increase payable under the national agreement from 1st March, 1975; and if any decision has been made on the form of new wages and conditions of employment legislation for the benefit of agricultural workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the function of the Agricultural Wages Board is to fix only the minimum rates of wages which should be paid to agricultural workers.  The order in question provides for an increase of £2 a week in the minimum rates as from 3rd February, 1975.  In fixing the minimum rates the board takes all relevant factors into consideration including the trend of wages generally and the capacity of farmers to pay.  The question of introducing proposals for the amendment of legislation on wages and conditions of employment of agricultural workers is at present under consideration in consultation with the various interests concerned and it is expected that a decision will be reached at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour when legislation will be initiated to restore parity of paid holidays for agricultural workers under the Holidays Act, 1973, and for the establishment of a Joint Labour Committee for agricultural workers under the Industrial Relations Acts.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is having a Bill prepared for introduction in the House as soon as possible to amend the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Acts so as to restore the holiday entitlement of agricultural workers to parity with that of other workers under the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of a joint labour committee for agricultural workers, I have had discussions <Col N="880" /> in the matter with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries who has been in consultation with the farming organisations involved.</P>
    <P>The question of the establishment of a joint labour committee for agricultural workers will be considered by the Government in the near future.</P>
