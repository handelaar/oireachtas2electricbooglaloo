      <P>Before we adjourned yesterday evening the Minister, in reply to a question from me on the meaning of subsection (2) of section 3, said that no foreign company investing in an Irish industry would come under the provisions of the Bill.  That is what I understood the Minister to say, and that I see in today's press is what he is published as saying, that subsection (2) of section 3 of the Bill does not apply to investment by any foreign company in an Irish industry.</P>

      <P>The Minister should get this clear in his mind.  It is putting the Irish Government in a peculiar position if foreign investment is not taxable and Irish investment is.  I spoke to a number of Irish businessmen recently, businessmen who are not necessarily supporters of Fianna Fáil, and they informed me that it was their opinion that a bunch of children had got hold of the economy and were running it into the ground.  One businessman described the economic activities and performance of the present Government as being similar to a group of school boys who had got hold of a bus on a free day from <Col N="5" /> school, succeeded in starting the engine but did not know how to put the bus into forward gear.  It appears that the Government have succeeded in putting the country into reverse gear.</P>
      <P>To date 127 industries have been closed down by inflation and by the failure of the Government to prevent the import of cheap foreign goods from outside the EEC.  These goods are being imported mainly through Britain.  Why this was allowed to happen I cannot understand.  We find today that steps are being taken to deal with this matter but the Minister for industry and Commerce, in spite of our advice to him last December, could not make up his mind to stop the import of cheap goods as other members of the EEC had done.  In December we urged the Minister to deal with this matter and we promised to support him in any difficulties that might arise.  The important thing was that the jobs of Irish workers should be safeguarded.  Action is about to be taken now when the Irish workers have no jobs and are on pay-related. It is too late.</P>
      <P>In addition we know that 50 firms have notified the Labour Court that they will be unable to meet the national pay agreement increases.  Those firms have had to make that decision because they do not have the money nor can they make the profit to enable them to pay their way.  This brings me to the difference between the enterprise company and the State.  The difference is that the State, and State bodies, can rest on the shoulders of the public, on the Irish taxpayers.  The competitive enterprise company has to survive in a tough world where there are no taxpayers or exchequers to help them.  This Government ought to learn one fact of life, particularly the Labour element in the Government, that the EEC will not allow subsidisation of industrial or agricultural goods coming into their markets but these are the markets we have to fight for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real lesson we and Britain must learn about the EEC is that there can be no featherbedding or cushioning.  If we are willing to work we will get the results as many of our <Col N="6" /> industries have proved in recent years. If we try any gimmicks we will be sat on by practical people who will not be fooled by promises.  My main criticism of section 2 is against the tax package described by the Minister for Finance as a straight deal for the public.  Deputy Barry Desmond yesterday described the Minister for Finance as the most radical Minister for Finance we have ever seen.  The Minister for Lands who was sitting in for the Minister for Finance yesterday pointed out that this was an innocuous Bill.  In as much as the ceiling or level is high and the rate of tax is relatively low it is innocuous.  Deputy Desmond said he could not understand why Fianna Fáil were opposed to this.  I realise that Fianna Fáil are taking a political risk because Deputy Desmond, and his Labour colleagues, will do in the coming months precisely as Deputy Desmond did yesterday&mdash;they will try to prove to the public that Fianna Fáil are on the side of the rich.</P>
    <P>The reason for our opposition to this Bill and to the general tax atmosphere being created by the White Paper and these Bills is the major disincentive to energy and enterprise being created by this sort of taxation.  It is being done at a time when Irish industry in many areas is virtually collapsing; at a time when we are having announcements almost daily of factories being closed down and at a time when in comparison to 12 months ago 45,000 additional people are out of work.  The sad thing about this is that the Fine Gael Party earlier, guided by the late Deputy Sweetman, and the Fianna Fáil Party, guided by the late Deputy Seán Lemass, made a significant and, I hope, permanent contribution to ending the curse of emigration. Efforts were made, despite the cynics, to encourage Irish people to invest in Ireland and build up industry so that the picture we saw during the first half of the century of people having to emigrate to obtain employment would be ended in our time.  Unfortunately, the combination of Fine Gael and Labour in the Government is recreating an old cycle.  It is bringing <Col N="7" /> about a situation where we will see nothing but dole and emigration if the Government do not pull themselves together.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal a little bit further with Deputy Desmond's contribution yesterday.  Deputy Desmond, as well as being a Member of this House, is a trade unionist.  He said there could be no value to Fianna Fáil in opposing a wealth tax.  Of course there is no value to Fianna Fáil in such opposition. Fianna Fáil's opposition to this tax has nothing to do with wealth.  It has to do with the livelihoods of Irish people, and if Deputy Desmond and his colleagues are going to engage in the politics of envy described by Deputy Colley yesterday, then Fianna Fáil will perhaps have to suffer some minor consequences.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are taking a political risk, but Fianna Fáil believe in the provision of work for Irish people. Fianna Fáil do not believe in chasing after a handful of people who may have a lot of money simply in order to create the picture: &ldquo;We are all on the side of the poor.&rdquo;  We are opposing and criticising these measures.  We specifically oppose the flat level of the capital gains tax, and I am sorry that members of the Labour Party are not in the House this morning.  The proposal put forward by Deputy Colley was to start the level of capital gains tax at 50 per cent in the first year so as to catch the speculator, the person that Deputy Desmond talks about.  Our proposal was directed deliberately towards energy and enterprise, and as with this Bill here, the present capital gains proposals from the Government have the major defect that whether you are a get-rich-quick merchant or whether you have spent your life working hard giving employment, the same level of tax will be charged in future, according to the capital tax measure, 26 per cent. Irrespective of whether you bought a parcel of land, sold it within six months at double its price, or whether you worked building up a farm or building up an industry or a small business for 25 or 30 years, you pay the same level of tax.  That, I believe, is a disincentive, reversing the trend of economic leadership <Col N="8" /> that was set in the thirties by the late Seán Lemass.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond goes out of his way to deride and sneer at Fianna Fáil. Does Deputy Desmond not realise that if Seán Lemass had not the courage, the faith and the imagination 35 years ago to set about building an Irish industry, Deputy Desmond might now be in Camden Town or some part of the United States or Australia?  Deputy Desmond, like myself, and the rest of us in this House is being maintained here by the Irish taxpayer, which includes the Irish worker, who has to pay his income tax.  Unlike myself, who has to try to maintain and keep alive an Irish competitive enterprise, Deputy Desmond, before he became a Deputy, was maintained by the subscriptions of Irish workers whose jobs were founded and established by the policies of Seán Lemass.  It ill-becomes any member of the Labour Party, particularly a trade unionist, to run down Fianna Fáil because Fianna Fáil are trying to defend the energy and enterprise which inspired Irishmen earlier on to try to get the economy on its feet and end the tide of emigration.  As a Deputy reminds me, we get more trade union votes than Deputy Desmond or his colleagues.  That is because the Irish worker is a lot more intelligent than the Deputies of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I regret having to hit out so hard at members of the Labour Party, but a little frankness in this House is overdue.  I should like to know if Deputy Desmond or any member of the Labour Party can give me one example of an industry set up by him or any of his colleagues giving gainful employment to any Irish worker.  As far as I know, the only contribution &mdash;I am not talking about the trade union contribution, which is a significant one, but the employment contribution&mdash;given by Deputy Desmond and his colleagues is to employ some girl typists in trade union offices, and their wages are paid out of the earnings of workers.</P>
    <P>One of the issues I wish to take up before I conclude is this description &ldquo;wealth tax&rdquo;.  It is a very nice, highsounding, popular word, &ldquo;wealth&rdquo; tax.  It is tied up with the politics of <Col N="9" /> envy, but basically the effect of this kind of tax is to discourage investment and the creation of wealth.  The creation of wealth is the key to prosperity and employment.  Wealth is the result of the imput of energy, self-reliance and drive by individuals into an economy such as ours plus, as Deputy Belton would say, a bit of capital if you can lay your hands on it.  If our resources are not expanded through development opportunities and investment, leading to the creation of wealth, then there is only poverty and emigration facing us, because there will be no wealth to share.  You cannot share what you have not created, and if you discourage it, it will not be created.  It is wrong to discourage enterprise in a developing economy.</P>
    <P>The concern of Fianna Fáil is not the individual wealth that may have been made by the efforts of a few individuals.  A good tax code, including a more discriminatory capital gains tax and a proper inheritance tax should be able to look after overaccumulation of wealth without deterting enterprise and investment.</P>
    <P>Personally, I think this exception could be made in regard to some of the examples cited by Deputy Desmond yesterday, that is, in relation to very large land holdings, particularly where the land usage could be questioned.  But that has nothing to do with the principle which Fianna Fáil is trying to defend of encouraging investment and risk capital.  We are sufficiently strong in our social attitude not to be afraid to say we encourage capital and the creation of wealth because when wealth is created the economy and the people gain.</P>
    <P>Modern wealth is created by enterprise, energy and capital, and discouragement means that the community will suffer, not the wealthy few.  Yesterday Deputy Desmond&mdash; and I think the Minister on one occasion&mdash;cited examples such as West Germany, Sweden and Belgium&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no use in making comparisons between the Irish economy and any European economy. If a valid comparison could be made it would be with Italy, which has not this kind of tax.  I suggest that Australia would be a pretty good comparison. You have a Labour Government there as in Britain but a Government that is strong enough to avoid this kind of tax package in the interests of the economy.</P>
      <P>Last night Deputy Desmond boasted of what his friend, the Labour Chancellor in Britain, Denis Healey, will do with wealth tax.  The Deputy may boast all he likes about his British Labour colleague: all I hope is that the Irish economy is not tied to the British economy when it sinks.  We are not concerned with what goes on in other countries; our concern is Ireland and the effect of Government policy on incentives to industry.  The principle of introducing taxes so as to appear nice and perhaps gain votes on the basis of envy is no contribution to life in Ireland.  Whatever justification there might be for this type of tax if our economy had reached the European level&mdash;that is a long way off&mdash;it is not justified now.  Irish conditions do not justify introducing taxes such as they have in Britain and in fully developed economies such as West Germany, one of the most sophisticated economies in the world.  Our economy is virtually stagnant and the Government's performance is contributing to disincentive rather than incentive, the opposite to what the Government should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need more investment and we need people in government who know how to manage and direct the economy with confidence and experience. This Government have proved they have not got these qualities.  The whole atmosphere generated by the Government's tax package is a major disincentive to investment, the provision <Col N="11" /> of jobs and the strengthening of industry.  In conclusion, I would describe the Government as a government of ways and means to close down industry and possibly close down RTE.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Good boxers never hit their opponents when their opponents are down.  In this case the Labour-Fine Gael Government are the heavyweights and their opponents the ordinary people.  The real recipients of the blows from the Government involved in the introduction of this wealth tax are, in my opinion, the many thousands who have lost their jobs and the many who, apparently, will lose them.  The Government must be punch drunk at present, reeling from internal problems and dissension.  They do not know if they are coming or going and their one aim is to try to keep themselves financially afloat.  Even the ordinary man in the street is now realising that the Government have bankrupt the country.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult to understand, if what we heard from the Minister for Lands and Deputy Desmond is correct, that this innocuous measure as they described it, the Wealth Tax Bill, will yield only about £3 million, why they are prepared to run the risk of upsetting the whole economy for that sum.  If that is so, it is bad for the country and for the Labour-Fine Gael Government because by their present actions they are doing irreparable damage to the country.  I should like to take up some points made last evening by the Minister for Lands and Deputy Desmond.  There were many inaccuracies in what they said and as the night wore on it seemed they were trying not only deliberately to mislead the House but the people also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of this Wealth Tax Bill many people outside are beginning to wonder what all the talk is about&mdash;what does it mean?  Wealth means money or something akin to it&mdash; will it improve our situation?  Will we be better off?  People in the dole queues are saying: &ldquo;This is great but will it give us employment?  How will it affect our economy?&rdquo;  They are right to ask <Col N="12" /> if it will create new jobs, if it will increase exports.  I suppose everybody is asking if it will break the inflationary spiral, which is strangling the country much quicker than many realise.</P>
    <P>At last the Labour-Fine Gael Government are beginning to wake up and to realise the irreparable damage which this inflationary spiral is causing.  People are asking whether this legislation, legislation described by the Minister for Lands as innocuous and described by Deputy Desmond as fiddle-diddle legislation, will do anything to help those people who are in serious difficulty. Both the Minister for Lands and Deputy Desmond made cases last evening as to why we should have a wealth tax.  However, despite continued urgings from Deputy Colley that the Coalition give sound economic reasons for introducing this tax at this time, bearing in mind the unfortunate state of our economy as a result of its mismanagement by the Government, no such reasons were forthcoming.  We know the Minister for Lands to be a fair man but it was obvious last evening that he was very uncomfortable, that he was put to the pin of his collar to bluff his way out of the situation and that he wished that he and not the Minister for Finance were in Brussels.  The Minister for Finance is endeavouring to have the Bill dealt with in his absence.</P>
    <P>Many of our Ministers are uncomfortable in those days but the Minister for Lands was the most uncomfortable Minister last evening that I have ever seen.  He knows that the introduction of this legislation is sheer lunacy, that instead of putting the country back on its economic feet it will worsen the situation, lengthen the dole queues and close many more of our factories.  Lest anybody should think that I am being unfair in my criticism I would refer to the first question on today's Order Paper. Question No. 1 asks how many workers have been laid off in a factory in Killarney town.  The factory in question must be the shoe factory. Another industry in the town, Pretty Polly, is in serious difficulty also.  This concern employs more than 1,000 <Col N="13" /> people but short-time working is in operation now and it looks as if the factory is going into a tailspin.  Will the introduction of this tax do anything to help keep more than 2,000 people employed in those concerns? The second question on the Order Paper asks what are the prospects of an industry being established in Rathmullen, County Donegal.  Will the introduction of this tax create an atmosphere that will be helpful in enticing investors to establish here?  We know that it will have the opposite effect, that it will discourage anybody who may have been interested in coming here.  The next question refers to further redundancies due to take place in a firm in County Offaly where 110 jobs are at stake.  A Labour-Fine Gael Deputy asks what are the chances of having an advance factory at Ballymote, County Sligo.  While I am not the Minister for Industry and Commerce I can tell the Deputy concerned that there is not a chance of any such industry for his town.  Like many other advance factories throughout the country, it would be empty.  As Deputy Brugha has pointed out, a big factory at Dunleer, County Louth, is closing today.  All the glib phrases of Deputy Desmond and of others on the Government benches will not help one of these unfortunate people who are being thrown out of employment. Even before the beginning of the tailspin into which this Government have brought our economy, we were not ready for the introduction of a wealth tax.  Our economy is still developing and this party hope to be able, when the time comes, to put it back once again on the road to economic development.</P>
    <P>We are far behind our partners in the EEC in regard to economic development. I do not mind whether Deputy Desmond quotes his case from a red or from a green book but I can tell him that this is not the time for the introduction of further taxation. We are bankrupt as it is.  How can anybody in fairness hope to compare our country with other European countries?  Deputy Desmond tried deliberately to mislead the House.  He continued to tell untruths until he was <Col N="14" /> checked.  Through this House he tried to tell the people that there was a wealth tax in every country in Europe. Although he was proved wrong on that he was not put off his track because it does not matter to him.  It is only a game, hypocrisy on his part.</P>
    <P>I like Deputy Desmond personally but unfortuantely for him he is not regarded as a heavyweight within his own Labour Party.  If he were he would have been recognised and would have been given something at the time when things were being given to people in such a generous way for so many different reasons.  Deputy Desmond last evening was doing a flak job, a cover-up on behalf of the Labour-Fine Gael Government in an effort to create a smokescreen and in order to undermine and to knock the serious contributions to the debate by members of my party.  It would appear that he was deliberately sent for and told to talk.  When he saw the way things were lining up here last night he got himself ready and made a contribution which, in all fairness, did not do him justice.  Those who congratulated him must realise that in doing so they are partly responsible for the hypocritical approach of the Labour-Fine Gael Government to this legislation.</P>
    <P>If we are being compared with other European countries there is an obligation on the Government and their spokesmen, in the interest of fair play, to compare like with like. This did not happen.  The Government spokesmen, the Minister for Lands and Deputy Desmond, who is the Deputy Chief Whip of the Government, must be reprimanded for the unfair way they went about their task last evening. Even if they had not been so unfair, the question must be asked, will the introduction of a wealth tax help us to catch up with our EEC partners?  It would be very easy to produce a litany of woes as far as the economy is concerned.  The economic difficulties we are now in will be regarded as a monument to the mishandling by the Government, a Government of so-called bright sparks, a Government we are often told by themselves and those in the media <Col N="15" /> who favour them for one reason or another who have a monopoly of the brains, that could run the country as it should be run.  The brightness is dulled and the sparks are burnt out, barely glowing.  One thing is certain: things are in a bad way, and no amount of flak work by Deputy Desmond or by the Minister for Lands, who is a fair merchant at it when he gets going if he thought he would get away with it, or by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is trying to create confusion by the introduction of a second channel in the single-channel area, or by anybody within the Government or outside the Government working on their behalf, will smoke screen the stark realities from the people.</P>
    <P>There are 103,000 or 104,000 unemployed and there are economists who are now saying that the unemployment figure will be 150,000 or 160,000 by the fall of the year.  Will the wealth tax now being introduced help to create jobs?  Will it create the climate which the Fianna Fáil party worked so strenuously to create, a climate of goodwill as far as foreign investment is concerned?  Will it result in the opening of any of the 140 or 150 factories that have closed down in the last six or eight months?  Will it help any of the factories that are tottering on the brink of closure?  Will it bring workers on the three-day week back to normal working?  It will not. The Bill will yield approximately £3 million pounds to the Exchequer and no more than that.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of the Government to cause confusion on practically every front to hide the position that I am talking about, they have nothing to offer the people.  All their efforts are an exercise to divert people's minds from the real issues.  Things have changed rapidly for this Labour-Fine Gael Government over the last 18 or 20 months.  We remember the fanfare of trumpets, the unlimited publicity which members of the Government got at all times.  Thing are very different now. Despite the best efforts of the highly skilled and well-paid professional flak merchants they brought in and made <Col N="16" /> civil servants of, there is a failure to convince the public that things are well when they are not well.</P>
    <P>It is immaterial now what spiel comes from the Government Information Bureau or what script is issued on behalf of any Minister by the wizard in the Government Information Bureau.  The people say speeches are all right, television programmes are all right, but what about the husband who is out of work and the youngsters finishing school&mdash;what are their chances?  Let Mr. MacConghail fly from Farranfore to Dublin to write a script for the Minister for Labour to apologise for his failures on television, but what about jobs for the young people, for the people on the dole?</P>

      <P>What about the factories that are closing down?  What about the harsh fact of life that we are at the top of the league as far as inflation is concerned?  There are 103,000 unemployed and the expectation is that there will be 150,000 to 160,000 unemployed by next September or October.  With galloping inflation unchecked, the Government are doing nothing whatever about it.  Despite urgings and pleading from this side of the House and from outside the House for the Government to take action in a responsible way, there are milk and water statements from the Taoiseach and members of his Cabinet, threatening us with dire actions, the consequences of which must be lived with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a fair gallop but a stop was put to the gallop of the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael members at the recent annual conference of the unions in Wexford.  The Taoiseach and his colleagues were told in no uncertain fashion: &ldquo;Lay off this; do not interfere with us or we will bring down the Government&rdquo;.  Perhaps this is the key to the introduction of the wealth <Col N="17" /> tax at the present time.  Is it being introduced as a sop for members of the Labour Party to ensure they will bolster up the Coalition?  Is pressure being exerted on the Fine Gael members for the sake of the survival of the Labour/ Fine Gael junta?  The only other reason is that the Government are so badly off for money that they need desperately the £3 million, and are being forced along irrespective of the consequences to the economy.  It must be one of those reasons that has prompted the introduction of the wealth tax at this time.</P>
    <P>This question has not been answered by the speakers I heard in the debate.  Instead, we had a barrage of flak and personal abuse to members of my party which was uncalled for, and it was a pity it occurred.  I did not expect it.  The moment of truth for this Labour/Fine Gael Government is close at hand.  When they took office, amidst a fanfare of trumpets, they were able to boast for some time of the growth in the economy, without acknowledging their reliance on Fianna Fáil's management of the economy.  Subsequently, when things began to go wrong they blamed external factors entirely, but they can no longer escape responsibility.  The recent speeches of the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers, including my Limerick colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, suggest that at last the Government are willing to admit to some degree that something is seriously wrong with the economy. For the first time, they are beginning to admit there is some obligation on them to do something about the matter.  So far they have not done anything, but we must be grateful that at last they are moving in the direction which Fianna Fáil have been urging on them since last summer.</P>
    <P>At that time they were claiming they were not responsible and could do nothing about the disastrous fall in farm income and cattle prices.  At the same time, Fianna Fáil were pressing strongly for the introduction of the green £ as a way in which they could help.  After a delay of six months they were forced to acknowledge, with tongue in cheek, that <Col N="18" /> we were right, and finally we got the green £.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we have been trying to get the Government to accept that they had a duty to do something about the serious unemployment and inflation problems, instead of hiding behind the lame and untrue excuse that all these problems were caused by international events over which they had no control.  For example, before the budget last January details of ways in which the right kind of government action would help were spelled out by Fianna Fáil.  It was suggested that any government spending should be concentrated on reducing prices, by cutting VAT rates and by holding down the prices charged by the ESB, CIE, RTE and other State bodies.  In this way our rate of inflation would have been dramatically reduced and the extra spending power obtained because money would go further would have meant that more jobs would be protected because of the increased demand for products.</P>
    <P>At that time, similar to other occasions, our advice was rejected. The Labour/Fine Gael Government story was that they could do nothing about inflation.  The budget was supposed to be concerned with saving jobs.  We all know today how wrong the Government were.  At last they are starting to admit we were right and that in order to protect employment we must cut down inflation.  It is unfortunate that the long delay means that it will now be much more difficult and more expensive to cut down unemployment and inflation.</P>
    <P>One must ask if this is the right time to introduce a wealth tax, when prices are 15 per cent higher than they were last November when we were first suggesting action to the Government in an effort to pull us out of this tailspin.  After those months about 15,000 more people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>Another reason&mdash;in many ways it may be the most important reason&mdash; why it is more expensive and difficult to take effective action is because the new national wage agreement must be based on the assumption that prices <Col N="19" /> will rise this year by more than 20 per cent.  Under the terms of the agreement the minimum rise in each three-monthly period is guaranteed at 4 per cent.</P>

Not alone did we have a discussion on wealth tax and the proposals in the Bill but the debate ranged widely over capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, unemployment, dole queues, redundancies and so on.  It was difficult to understand how such latitude could be given, but as it was I am basing my points on arguments put forward by members of the Government during their contributions.  I shall certainly respect the Chair and do my best to confine myself to what went before.</P>

      <P>Under section 2, which proposes to charge wealth tax, we will do serious damage to our economy with inflation running at the rate it is.  If inflation were reduced to zero for a three-month period salaries and wages would continue to rise and this would cause a new round of price increases and one would find it difficult to blame employers and trade unions for negotiating another pay agreement.  They would be doing what the Government encouraged them to <Col N="20" /> do in the White Paper, <i>National Partnership,</i> released last November.  I should like to say publicly now here that employers and trade unions deserve the gratitude and support of the community in adopting the reasonable approach they have adopted.  Trade unions were demonstrating they were willing to agree to no increase in real pay levels this year but were willing to settle for a rise which would only compensate for price increases.  On the other hand, employers on their part were indicating they would continue to maintain employment and pay levels to the maximum extent possible. They understood the difficulties with the Government trying to introduce, as they describe it, an innocuous measure which will yield only £4 million. This is being done at a time when unemployment is well over 100,000 and looking as if it will increase by 50,000 or 60,000 more.  We have a Government so badly off, so bankrupt and so desperate for an income of £4 million from this measure that they are willing and prepared to throw caution to the winds and travel the road they are going irrespective of the harm they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should know that many firms are out of business and many more are in dire straits.  A previous speaker said that notice has been served by upwards of at least 50 other firms that they will be in difficulties in meeting their side of the national pay agreement.  All this is happening at a time when the Minister for Finance has the bit between his teeth, a very common occurrence, and is running with the blinkers over his eyes, not knowing where he is going, also a very common occurrence. He is now trying to tell us this is the proper time for the introduction of a wealth tax.  Even if he had wanted to, for whatever devious reason he might have, he could not have picked a worse time for the introduction of this tax.  If his reluctant substitute here, Deputy Fitzpatrick, Minister for Lands, can tell us why this wealth tax is being introduced we might make some progress.  What are the economic reasons for its introduction? Why is it necessary?  What good <Col N="21" /> will it do for the man out of work and the man on the three day week?  Will it create more jobs?  Will it cut down inflation?  Will it help to increase our exports?  I am convinced that this measure will do nothing whatsoever to help us with our unemployment problem and our inflation problem, which has run unchecked up to now, and nothing whatever to help us increase our exports.</P>
    <P>The Government have been asked to give their reasons on an economic level as to why they are introducing this tax now.  They have failed to give that reason.  The Minister for Lands, a very shrewd parliamentarian, found himself with the unenviable task last night of trying to shuffle from one leg to the other to fill in the 15 or 20 minutes during which he spoke without answering the direct questions put to him by Opposition spokesmen.  The Government have failed to tell us why they believe it necessary to introduce this tax.  They have failed to tell us the economic reasons for its introduction and they have been by no means clear about the effects of its imposition.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On a point of order, Deputy Collins said I spoke for about 20 minutes last night.  I made a Committee Stage speech in which I dealt with this tax and other taxes.

I did not think it was relevant in relation to a Committee Stage discussion on section 2 and I confined myself to taxes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree and it is unfortunate the debate was allowed to develop as it did.  I am now in the awkward position of having to deal with charges made against my party and against individual members of my party because of the stance adopted. I have no intention of entering into conflict with the Minister for Lands as to what he did or did not say.  He has his officials available.  I have not got a copy of what was recorded here last night and, even if I had, it should not be used to say who said this and who said that.  I sat here and I made notes of what Members said.  I will confine myself mainly to an area that was well covered and I will do my best to deal with the arguments that refer to this particular section.  I promise not to be as wide-ranging as the Minister's Labour Party colleague who spoke for over an hour yesterday evening and who brought us on guided tours to every European country, until we checked him, where he thought wealth tax is in operation.  The only European country he forgot to bring us to was Russia.</P>
      <P>The only argument put forward, particularly by Deputy Desmond, with regard to section 2, which proposes to charge wealth tax, is one of equity. The glib phrase used and not substantiated is that of redistribution of wealth.  The Deputy made hay last night when talking of the redistribution of wealth but somebody on his own side of the House forgot to tell him that the Minister for Finance, when dealing with this Bill, is on the record as saying that this wealth tax will in no way redistribute wealth.  He said the wealth tax would just cover up for the loss of death duties to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the poor man be any better off as a result of the introduction of this tax?  Will the poor man get any extra to feed himself, his wife and family when things are as bad as they are now and when he never needed money as much as he does at the present time?  Will the poor man who is out of work and unable to manage, <Col N="23" /> who possibly has a mortgage on his house and cannot meet the payments, be any better off with the introduction of this tax?  I do not think so. The only distribution of wealth the Minister for Finance conceded would take place was a redistribution of wealth among the members of wealthy families.  I am sure he knows many more of them than I do, but if this is the only redistribution of wealth that takes place I want to say to the members of the Labour Party that they are misled and it is apparent they do not know what this wealth tax is all about.</P>
    <P>The argument of Deputy Desmond that the wealth tax will redistribute wealth is ludicrous.  What arguments in favour of wealth tax and in favour of this imposition at the present time are left?  It has been said by some Members that the case put forward last night could be regarded as a begrudger's case and the case of the envious man.  I would not accuse Deputy Desmond of being a begrudger or a man who is motivated by envy, but he should sit back and examine his own contribution and he will agree with me that what he said last night could leave him open to the accusation that the case he made could be regarded as a begrudger's case and the case of an envious man.  Deputy Desmond was the only member of his party in the House who offered or who has been in the House to offer on this particular section.</P>
    <P>Full employment and the ideal of full employment is a sick joke at the present time.  I believe it can only come about through the development of industry.  I believe the introduction of this tax will screw the development of industry into the ground.  I also believe that the initiative required in the development of industry will also be screwed into the ground by the introduction of this wealth tax.  Any section which proposes to charge a tax of this nature, which will affect the economy, must be resisted as strongly as it can be.  It is fair to say from what Deputy Desmond said last night that he and his colleagues do not understand the role of those who invest their capital and skill in industry <Col N="24" /> for the purpose of providing employment.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes law it will frighten off investors into the country. The IDA are being muzzled by the Government with regard to the information which they must have about the number of inquiries for the establishment of industry in this country.  There is no new person setting up an industry to provide employment for the people.  If the Government and the Minister for Finance are foolish enough to go ahead with this tax the creation of employment for our people will be a thing of the past and the IDA will have great difficulty in trying to continue the work they have been able to do because of the economic climate created by Fianna Fáil over the years. Somebody in the big brother of the Government, the Fine Gael Party, should, in the interests of the economy of the country, explain to Labour Party Deputies the function of those who invest capital and skill in industry in the country and provide employment.  If this had been done a worthwhile job for the nation would have been carried out in getting these people to understand what it is all about.  The question must be asked if this section is carried and if this proposal to charge a wealth tax is accepted: &ldquo;How many jobs will be lost because of it&rdquo;?  We must also ask how many jobs have been lost already because of the talk about it.</P>
    <P>In an effort to be fair to the Government we must ask: &ldquo;How many jobs will the wealth tax create&rdquo;?  I do not believe it will create any jobs. If the Government can prove otherwise they have an obligation and a responsibility to tell us.  It is now a recognised fact that there has been a big reduction in the number of new jobs that might otherwise have been created here.  During Question Time yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in the most uncomfortable position he has ever been in trying to fob off questions with regard to job losses, job creation and job opportunity for the many thousands unemployed.  If marks were <Col N="25" /> being given for performance that Minister would have needed a calculator to get the pass mark. If this section is carried the mediumsized Irish firm, the family firm, will suffer most.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a recognised fact.  This charge was made to the Ministers for Finance and Labour and neither Minister, nor the Minister for Lands, was able to take up this charge and deal with it.  The Minister for Lands had the opportunity of dealing with that charge but he did not avail of it.  I hope the Minister will give the information available, if such exists, to rebut the charge.  With the introduction of this tax the small family firm which is already in serious trouble will suffer most.  What will happen then to these people and their employees?  Is it just a pious wish of the Coalition Government that the dole queues will disappear overnight? Is it not also the pious wish of the Minister for Lands who said &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; to my charge?  These factories will close down, because the wealth tax will act as a catalyst to hasten their closing down.  Is the Minister for Lands not in cuckooland when he made that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister for Lands know or care that this is what must happen? It must be apparent to the Government members that the unfortunate people who are on the dole queues for many months are beginning to see that the flak job being done by the Government Information Services in an effort to smokescreen the facts at great expense to the taxpayers is not a true indication of the position.  There is no point in members of the Government, whether they write the speeches themselves or whether these are written for them by the wizards of the Government Information Services, believing that.  What they say will not help the man on the dole queue.  He wants to get off that queue, get back his job so that he can come home with his head in the air and his wage packet in his pocket once a week for his family.  He does not want his children <Col N="26" /> seeing him going down the road to sign on at the employment exchange.  That man only wants a decent chance.</P>
    <P>The Government, for a miserable £3 million and a piece of innocuous legislation, are ensuring that whatever chance that man had of holding his head up in the air he now has none. The Government are being pushed and goaded into the introduction of this tax.  With this hasty and foolish legislation the small family firms will suffer.  Nobody is going to take pride in the fact that there are 103,000 people unemployed or in the fact that that figure could be up to 150,000 in the autumn.  We would all like to see full employment, irrespective of our political differences.  If we achieve full employment the Minister can then return to the House with these taxation measures.  It will be a new ball game then.  I appeal to the Minister not to be pushed by the lefties in the Labour Party into destroying the country further; not to be pushed by the Labour Party to go further than he knows he should go.  The Minister should not let the leftists in the Labour Party, with their shortsightedness and misunderstanding of the situation, as evidenced by the contribution of Deputy Barry Desmond, push him into doing something which he knows is stupid in the extreme.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the harm this will do to foreign goodwill built up over the years painstakingly by successive Ministers for Finance and the IDA.  That goodwill was built up in an effort to attract foreign investment here to provide employment for our people.  Would a Fine Gael Member explain to the Labour Party Deputies the role and functions of the IDA in the hope that they will understand what it is all about?  Is it not a fact that few if any Members of the Labour Party provide employment for any person in their own private lives? I am not holding that against them. The Fine Gael Members should tell their Labour colleagues in Government how the efforts of the IDA are being seriously hindered by the wealth tax and the Government's attitude, as demonstrated in recent months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="27" /> Is it not a fact that inquiries for the setting up of new industries are practically non-existent? In Limerick city and county between 8,000 and 10,000 people are unemployed. Factories are closing down and nothing done about them.  We were all waiting for a huge development at Ahanish Island on the Shannon but nothing ever happened.  This £100 million project was to start months ago but it has been put back.  Is the truth of the matter not the fact that they cannot raise the money on the international market?  Is that not one of the reasons, plus the fact that the Government, instead of helping industries to get established in the way we helped them when they came first when we were in Government, are practically driving them out of the country?  The imposition of this wealth tax and the acceptance of this section which proposes to charge the wealth tax will do so much harm to our country that we shall be reeling for many years to come.  Indeed, the sick joke last night when we were leaving here was that, with unemployment as it is, with inflation unchecked as it is, the next spate of redundancies will probably take place within the IDA.  There would be redundancies on a large scale outside their own sphere of responsibility.  The Government, being pushed as they are by the &ldquo;lefties&rdquo;, are throwing caution to the wind and can stand accused of national treachery in bringing in this &ldquo;innocuous&rdquo; legislation, as it was described by the Minister for Lands, not caring what harm it was doing in the meantime to the many thousands of people who are out of work or will be out of work as a result of it.</P>
    <P>A wealth tax at this time is out and must be out.  What we want at present is something that will build up our economy to where it was when we in Fianna Fáil left it and to take it from there to the situation where we can have full employment.  It was interesting last night to note the remarks from the Government benches in regard to their own attitudes to investment from the United States.  Maybe it is just as well, because the investors <Col N="28" /> from that country were perhaps the first to see through this Labour-Fine Gael Government and its foolhardy promises of legislation which were forced on them at Ard Fheiseanna or party conferences.</P>
    <P>Our good image which it took so much to build up is gone.  The confidence of the foreigner in setting up industries in this country is gone since Labour and Fine Gael got the reins of Government.  Americans shy away from this country.  Is it any wonder that we are now referred to as a banana republic in certain international financial magazines?  Might I say that what was deliberately read into the record here last evening by Deputy George Colley from a letter he received from a good friend of Ireland with regard to the image of Ireland abroad at present for the purpose of influencing and encouraging industry here, is a view that is held by many.  It is surprising that the Minister and his colleagues have not heard this before now, because over the last six months many of them are travelling so far afield that one would have thought that some friend of the country would have told them what the score was.</P>
    <P>We are not an industrial country, and irrespective of what buttonhole trade unionists in the Labour Party might say, we have a responsibility to encourage the setting up of industry to provide employment for our people. The introduction of this tax will knock that on the head.  We have challenged the Government more than once to demonstrate even one argument in favour of this wealth tax.  We have had nothing from the Minister who spoke last night other than remarks which I shall deal with later on when I come to them.  We have had nothing from Deputy Desmond other than half paragraphs he read out of a little green or red book which unfortunately he did not seem to read too well and which I saw floating around this morning. Maybe we shall get more from it.  If we are to have arguments for or against the introduction of legislation in our little Parliament given to us from gentlemen who write little books, whether they be red or pink, then God <Col N="29" /> help the Labour Party and those who are allied to it.</P>
    <P>The only kind of argument we are getting is that we shall have equity.  As I have said already, Deputy Ryan, the Minister for Finance, admits that this alleged equity argument is not on and it does not arise.  Let me say to those who are arguing on the alleged equity part of it, that personalities in regard to the members of this Parliament should not enter into it in any way whatever.  I do not mind what the personal position of any Member of the House is.  Good luck to them. They have worked for it and earned it.  It is a sad day for a Government Minister bringing in legislation having an ally who was forced on him so as to form a Government and who starts picking at personalities in this House and saying that because of their own personal positions they were against the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am vehemently against these measures, and never in my life will I be touched by this wealth tax, because no matter how low you bring the threshold you will not catch me, because there is nothing to catch.  I am saying that to show people like Deputy Barry Desmond that personalities should be left out of it completely. Perhaps there are a couple of people who can talk for themselves over there if they want to, but I do not think it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said last evening that this measure was long overdue and good for the country.  If I were musically inclined&mdash;and thank God I am not at this stage&mdash;I could nearly put music to that phrase, &ldquo;long overdue and very good for the country&rdquo;. We have heard it so often from people like Deputy Desmond, that it is again to be regarded as what it is, an empty phrase, unless he is prepared to substantiate it.  If there are good economic and social arguments, let us hear them, but let us get away from these empty phrases.</P>
    <P>If the Government want something to do other than trying to push this section through, let them set about reducing inflation, which is the highest in the EEC, something for which all <Col N="30" /> the Deputies on that side of the House should hang their heads, because they have done nothing whatsoever about it.  The Labour Party should know&mdash; I am not sure about Fine Gael members&mdash;that inflation is crippling the poor and the higher it goes the harder the poor are hit.  I hope this will be recognised fairly soon by those who profess to represent the poor or say that they have something in common with those who represent the poor. The poor man is caught by this inflation. I suppose he is unorganised. The man with property should hold his own but the poor man, dependent on wages, has no chance.  If the Government want to do something worthwhile for the country they should come here with some proposals to stop this crippling inflation.  Those proposals are already nine months overdue and as time goes on the position becomes worse.  The economy is being crippled and the question of a wealth tax is far less urgent than need to curb inflation.</P>
    <P>Let the Government do the job they should have tackled long ago. They should stop talking, whining and moaning about it.  They should get their priorities right and not worry whether the people in the single channel areas will go for BBC 1 or RTE 2. The people will make their choice when they get the full facts from the Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Priority No. 1 is to curb inflation.  The Government should stop trying to raise a hare when there is no hare to be coursed and no dogs to course the BBC 1 hare, which is not even a reality at present; we have no permission to do anything with it.  We should deal with inflation and forget about introducing a wealth tax, which only makes matters worse.</P>
    <P>If the Government are in agreement, and if their leader agrees with them and they are prepared to work together, they should have a chat during Question Time and decide to throw out the wealth tax and stop mucking about for the next two or three months, or however long it will take to get a measure through which they describe as innocuous and which <Col N="31" /> can only yield £3 million.  Instead, the Government should give work to those in the dole queues, curb inflation, do something, as they said they would, about prices and make it possible for people to live.  They should not try to push this section through.</P>
    <P>What will it cost to administer this Bill?  How will we know?  If we are to charge a wealth tax we should know if it is worthwhile, how much we will have out of it, when administrative costs are deducted.  Because of the Government's present attitude the people's confidence in the Labour/ Fine Gael Government is at its lowest ebb.  If the Government are serious, if they know or care what they are doing, do they know what this wealth will do to the country?  In an effort to fireproof themselves against the just criticism levelled at them from many fronts are they trying to redherring the whole affair?  I say to them: drop these proposals and get on with the job you should be doing: get down to the real problems and do something about them.  Why is this House sitting in marathon session in unbelievably hot weather so physically demanding on members present in this Chamber that one would almost ask permission to take off one's coat?  Is that possible?</P>

      <P>Last evening charges were levelled against our spokesman on Finance, the former Minister, Deputy Colley, by the Minister for Lands.  These were charges made in an effort to hit the headlines and throw up a smokescreen.  There were charges of sabotage and of not understanding the Bill.  If anyone does not understand the Bill before the House the Minister should not strain his neck too much looking over his shoulder.  He need not have looked over any shoulder last night, because members of his own party who have been in the House without a break for longer than he has been were sickened by the contributions of the Minister and Deputy Desmond.  Members of the House had to leave, and members of the other House who came in when they were leaving threw <Col N="33" /> up their arms in disgust at the contributions made by Deputies opposite on section 2 because it was clear they did not understand it.  If the Minister for Lands wants to throw stones he should realise that it is a very dangerous occupation.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for Lands could make no attempt to answer the arguments put to him.  He adopted the attitude that attack is the best form of defence.  It upsets the Government to be told that they are mad in taking this action and this is what they have been told by people who are friends of this country, people who have endeavoured to provide employment for our people.  If the charges made by the Minister for Lands are to be levelled against anybody, they should be levelled at himself and Deputy Desmond because the Minister collaborated with Deputy Desmond when he tried to mislead the House.  Deputies on the Government benches made it clear by their gestures that they were disgusted with the Government's performance but because of their loyalty they said nothing.</P>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister he admitted that the situation in the country is bad.  He said we were experiencing a difficult time but why did he not tell us what the Government intended doing about such matters as inflation, unemployment and the cost of living?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands endeavoured to take us back over the years from 1959 to 1973.  He opened an area of debate on which he should not have embarked when he began a general discussion on our taxation system during that period.  The record of the Government in this House during recent weeks is one that they should be ashamed of.  They have voted against curbing the speculator.  Let not the people opposite ever tell us that we were slow in bringing about improvements in the taxation system.  Fine Gael who wait for the Labour Party to tell them, when politically, to go to sleep, ran away from taxation.  I do not know how any member of Fine Gael, having listened to the debate here, can vote for this measure.  The <Col N="34" /> lust for power is a strong motivating force but let Fine Gael Deputies tell their Ministers that they must not worsen the situation for our economy.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister gave us much information regarding details of the Bill which was already known to us but he was asked what value the Government and, in particular, the Labour wing of the Government, put on employment.  He was asked what value the Minister for Industry and Commerce places on the lengthening dole queues.  At some stage I trust we will have an answer as to how this Bill benefits the economy.</P>
    <P>We have the highest tax in Europe as was stated in one of our evening papers, that has not been contradicted by any member of the Government or by any of the highly paid talent that was imported into the Government Information Service.  We are the least developed country in Europe but Deputy Desmond endeavoured to compare us with the wealthiest nations in Europe.  Let us compare like with like. By his silence the Minister for Lands condoned what the Deputy said but let Deputy Desmond compare Ireland with southern Italy, an area with which we have much in common.</P>
    <P>Not only are we the least developed country in Europe but we have also the highest rate of inflation and unemployment. I do not know what school of economics Deputy Desmond attended but he should at least know the dangers of introducing a wealth tax at this time.  The Government are embarking on a course of lunacy.  We do not know whether it is because they are bankrupt and need the £3 million or the £2½ million that will be got when administrative costs are covered&mdash;we are not told how much they will be&mdash;or whether it is a sop to Deputies of the Labour Party.  Why are the Government throwing caution to the wind and making a bad situation worse?  Why do they not do the things they should do?  They should do everything humanly possible to attract industry to this country, everything humanly possible to create employment, to give people a chance to bring home a wage packet and to have a proper sense of pride in doing so.  Let <Col N="35" /> us get our priorities right and tackle the problems that need to be tackled and stop the hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>There were 70 hours spent on the last tax Bill and there is a prospect of another 70 hours or 170 hours on this Bill.  The Labour-Fine Gael Government have introduced these Bills for reasons they have not given, and they are not economic ones, because if they were they would have said so. The Government must be charged with irresponsibility in taking up the time of the House in dealing with what the Minister for Lands described as an innocuous measure, a measure which brings in very little to the Exchequer, instead of getting down to the business of running the nation and looking after the people.</P>
    <P>Anyone in this House who says that it is not the duty of the Government to help to provide employment is not worthy to be in this House.  It was said once before by a member of the Minister's party that it was not his responsibility to provide employment for people.  Thank God, the Minister's party have seen the light since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At least we thought they had but perhaps we should have second thoughts about it.  The doubts which we have are justified when there are 104,000 unemployed and the thousands of school leavers have not a chance of a job even in the Civil Service. All the indications are that there will be 150,000 or 170,000 unemployed in the autumn.  The Government are doing nothing about it.  They are trying to get out of Dáil Éireann as fast as they can to go on their summer holidays.  Why the mad rush out of here?  Why is there all the talk in the corridors about finshing in the hot weather and getting out of here fast, that it is not human to be here?  Of course, it is human to be here.  We are paid to be here.  There are many outside who would gladly take our places. If it is not human to be here as is suggested through the Government Whip's Office, it is much more inhuman that people outside should <Col N="36" /> have no prospect of any sort beyond the dole and there is nothing for the young people leaving school, not even the price of a calculator to help them to keep up with the Joneses in the examinations.</P>
      <P>Let us get down to basics.  Let us kick out this wealth tax and let us look after the people who sent us here. Deputies who have towns or urban areas in their constituencies have been approached by constituents who are on a three-day week or who are redundant and cannot meet the mortgages on their homes and asked what will happen to them.  Does anybody on the Government side of the House care?  Will anything be done about it? The Government have a terrible responsibility. Anything will do when things are going well and when the media are working with the stuff that is fed to them at high expense to the ratepayer and taxpayer through the well-paid gentleman brought into the Government Information Bureau.  A party can stay in government when things are going nicely for them.  Now things are not well.  The Government know it and have admitted it.  They must face up to their job and stand on their own feet irrespective of the differences that there are between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  The Government must do what they have to do.  They must help the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond says that we spent 70 hours on the last tax Bill, as if it should have been passed in five minutes.  They were not men enough to vote for the one clause that had any teeth in it, that would have been good for the country.  They voted against the clause that would catch the speculator.  Now they are trying to get another bit of legislation through &mdash;part of a package.  They should throw the package overboard because it is too heavy for the little boat they are in and there is a fierce storm around the headland.  Do the Government care?  Are they running true to tradition?  Are they doing what they did in 1951 and 1957?  Are they going to make such a mess of things and create such havoc that eventually, whether dictated to by Senator Mullen <Col N="37" /> or anybody else, they will throw in the towel and run to the country?  I hope they will not run true to tradition.  If they do they will have thrown all their responsibilities overboard; they will have neglected their obligations and will have sold the Irish people down the river for the third time in a short number of years,</P>
    <P>We have had discussions on unemployment that were forced on the Government.  The Minister for Local Government told us untruth after untruth in connection with the employment position in the building industry, and members of the Government who had the information in their hands did nothing about it.  We had the suggestion last night from Deputy Desmond that the building societies should do more.  The Government should have been making demands on the building societies some months ago when the queue of applications for loans was a mile long.  If building was going on, unemployment would be down.</P>
    <P>The Government forget the fact that 127 firms went into liquidation in the first three months of this year. They are not interested.  For a reason that I cannot understand and which is not an economic reason this wealth tax is introduced at a time when there are 127 firms in liquidation and 50 others in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>People outside do not want to invest their capital in this country.  They are no longer interested in investing here. Unfortunately for us, the term banana republic is being given more meaning by the way the Government are behaving. I shall not talk about the individual behaviour of the Minister for Finance last week in reference to Deputy O'Malley or about the Ceann Comhairle and the way he mishandled the whole affair.  I am worried about the image of our country abroad and the effect that the image will have on foreign investors and the fact that they are not coming in, and about the dole queues and the prospect of their doubling or trebling in the near future and about the unchecked inflation and the prices that have gone mad. Nobody seems to care.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> Would somebody who is good on publicity, who has the ear of some newspaper reporter or editor, get the message out to the people that the Government are engaging in diversionary tactics in order to cushion themselves from the criticism which must be levelled at them for having the country the way it is?  We are the laughing stock of Europe and the United States, as any banana republic is.  It galls me when I see the fantastic effort that was put into the building up of the economy over the years being nullified within such a short time. Private enterprise is shunned whether Fine Gael Deputies want to believe it or not.  Private initiative is being choked and strangled but nobody over there shouts stop.  The truth of the matter is that nobody wants to come to this country any more.  The wealth tax at this time will cripple our industries and it will destroy many of our small Irish-based family industries. What we want is investment in industry and the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>There was a lot to be said for the comment of the Minister for Defence on the White Paper on wealth tax some months ago when he said, &ldquo;Forget about that; it is only Civil Service talk&rdquo;.  How silent is the present Minister now when it comes to the wealth tax?  Has he got his priorities right?  Does he know that one of the biggest and most successful industries in the country, which is located in his constituency, has closed down?  What has he done to help these people?  We will know as time goes on.</P>
    <P>I hope something worth while will come from this discussion, that the Government will have second thoughts and that they will withdraw the Bill.  We will not sneer at them if they do that.  They should not make an unbelievably bad mess worse than it is.  They should have sympathy for the people out of work, do something for them and give them a chance to live.  The Government should do what they can to ensure that more industries will not have to close.  They can do this and save face in the knowledge that they are doing a worthwhile job.  Government is not <Col N="39" /> always easy.  When things are bad a sign of good government is to do the right thing and do it quickly.  This Government stand accused of grave neglect of their responsibilities on many fronts which have led us into this economic morass.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond last night said that only a few people would be caught.  He told us there are only a few millionaires and he threw his hands around&mdash;he could do that because some of his colleagues were not in the House then.  He tried to do sums and told us that very few people would be caught.  If this is so, it is all the more reason why the Bill should be withdrawn because of its consequences. The Deputy said that the most a millionaire could be caught for would be £6,000; if this is so, let the Government withdraw the Bill immediately. They have done enough harm already.  We are told that only £3 million or £4 million will be obtained from this legislation.  If the Government are so bankrupt that they are forced to go after this money irrespective of the consequences I suppose we may be facing a very early election.</P>
    <P>I do not know if a phrase used by Deputy Desmond last night is on the record; it was, &ldquo;God knows, it is so harmless.  We are only charging 1 per cent for the time being&rdquo;.  That was said in the presence of a Minister who has been designated to steer this Bill through the House in the absence of the Minister for Finance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is a point of information for the House.  I have here my own note which I took last night and which I am prepared to stand over, making all allowances for human nature.  If I am wronging the Deputy I apologise, but my honest recollection of what was said by Deputy Desmond was, &ldquo;God knows, we are only charging 1 per cent for the time being&rdquo;.  We have here a notice saying that Deputy Desmond stated on Radio Éireann that &ldquo;once the principle has been accepted it is an easy matter to adjust the rate&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Even if an assurance is given here today, will it be accepted?  How many times have the Government reneged on their promises and broken their word?  How many times have they been accused of dithering like the Minister for Industry and Commerce, fiddling away without a string to his bow while Rome is burning?  Yet, Deputy Desmond tells us that they are only charging 1 per cent for the moment; the legislation is dismissed with a wave of the hand as unimportant, where only a few hundred people will be caught.  The Deputy asked us &ldquo;Who are they, anyway?&rdquo; while looking over his shoulder and seeing that his colleagues, who might be affected, were absent from the House.  He told us that all the Government wanted to do was to widen the tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke about the redistribution of wealth, despite the fact that the Minister for Finance told him indirectly he was talking through his hat, that he did not know what it was all about.  In an effort to help the Minister for Lands last night, Deputy Desmond made a definite pronouncement to the effect that there was a plentiful supply of money coming into the country for investment purposes and for the purchase of land.  The Minister will recollect that.  The Deputy told us that he knew positively that money was available.  This morning I checked with a number of leading auctioneers in Dublin on the extent of inquiries from Britain regarding land.  I checked with Deputies here who are in the auctioneering profession about the extent of <Col N="41" /> inquiries they knew about.  I might have known I should not have bothered because Deputy Desmond deliberately told untruths last night in giving the general impression that there was large-scale investment into this country from England for the purpose of buying up land.  That statement was condoned by the Minister for Lands who sat silently and did not even tell Deputy Desmond he was on the wrong tack.  If the Government persist with this measure it is our belief they will multiply the dole queues and have many more questions on the Order Paper about the closing down of factories and the plans for industries to fill the empty IDA advance factories.  It is of this we are afraid and, if they persist with this section, they will deliberately clobber those who believe in free enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They are clobbering those with initiative and goodwill who would be prepared to come in here and provide employment.  I believe this action by the Government will introduce a new breed of people into this country.  Even if the Bill is withdrawn now so much damage has already been done it will take several years to repair it.  Enact this measure and the country is in for a long and troubled period.</P>
      <P>It is no good Deputy Desmond coming in with a textbook printed and published in England, written by an English author, trying to read from it arguments as to why a wealth tax should be introduced here.  Deputy Desmond, as I say, deliberately tried to mislead the House by saying all European countries have a wealth tax, and he said Britain would have it soon.  He mentioned the name of the responsible British Minister; we were lucky we did not have him over here because we would be much worse off. Is that the case for introducing this legislation which will harm the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked for the economic arguments and all we got was page 91 out of whatever book it was.  Is that good enough?  Deputy Desmond embarked <Col N="42" /> on personal abuse and gibed at some members of our party.  He did not do himself justice.  He has the ability, like everyone else, to put a fair case. He did unbelievable injury to himself last night in carrying on the way he did.  His contribution was worthy of a light programme on RTE.  He and the Minister accused us of not knowing what the Bill is about.  That sort of thing rankles.</P>
    <P>I hope that even at this late hour, with the country practically bankrupt, with the highest unemployment for many years and with inflation rampant, the Government will wake up.  We have the highest taxation in Europe, the highest unemployment and the highest inflation.  I appeal to the Government to have sense and withdraw this Bill.  Let them get down to the serious task of doing something worth while for those who have nothing other than the dole.  Let them help the housewives who are hard pressed trying to make £5 do the work of £4.  The Government should be doing something positive not introducing, as the Minister for Lands described it, an innocuous measure like this.  The Government should be giving some hope to those who are in the depths of despair.  I have painted a fair picture.  I have removed some of the unnecessary varnish.  I have dealt with the kernel of the problem.  Is it not sheer lunacy for a Labour-Fine Gael Government to introduce a measure like this?  The second last time out Labour tried to go it alone, and Fine Gael tried that also.  Knowing what the consequences of this measure will be, is it not sheer lunacy to insist on its passage?  The Minister is a fair man.  I respect him. I know he is doing this job for the Minister for Finance.  I am glad he is because I think he has a better sense of fair play than his colleague and surely he realises the damage this Bill will do.  Surely he realises it is foolhardy to insist on its passage, a Bill designed to bring in approximately £3 million a year.</P>

      <P>No, because they pay it in America.  Fianna Fáil, as well as nearly everybody in this House, object to some sections of this Bill.  Have Fianna Fáil come out yet and said if they will vote against the Bill <i>in toto</i> or in bits and pieces?  I believe there is a group in Fianna Fáil who will split with them if they do not vote for it.  The speech made by the last speaker would do for anything because there was very little about the Bill in it.  I have great admiration for Deputy Colley but he has been criticising the effect this Bill will have on business.  When he was Minister for Finance he increased the corporation profits tax on companies and that caused large-scale unemployment. When he brought in that tax he was told by the Opposition that it was very dangerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> I am for this wealth tax although perhaps I am not for the amount. This is the time to bring in a wealth tax when there is a world recession and there is unemployment in all the European countries, some of which have never seen it for over 50 years. This is the time when a Government want money.  They need to help those who may be out of employment for a short time.  I believe that a person who does not want to work is entitled to get something to keep him alive. Those who lose their jobs, through no fault of their own, should be paid a sum of money as near as possible to what their original salary was until such time as they get further employment.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Collins that I am not a Leftist.  I agree with this tax and I employ people.  In the explanatory memorandum we are told that there are three assessable persons, namely, the individual, the discretionary trust and the private non-trading company.  The case of the individual is easy to understand. There are no thresholds for the discretionary trust.  That is all right if the person who created the discretionary trust is alive.  What is the position if he is dead?  Is there a threshold then?  What happens if there is a trust for four people whose grandfather left it but the parents have no threshold to use?  The parents in that case may not have sufficient income to be able to use a threshold.  Is a threshold allowed for that trust?</P>
    <P>Will the individual, in the case of a discretionary trust, be forced by the valuation of the Revenue Commissioners to pay out so much money out of his company so that the company are left short of liquid cash?  Business people want to know how they will be fixed as a result of this.  That is why I stated on the first section that a businessman likes to know whether five years' purchase or ten years' purchase is taken into account in relation to the assets value.  The assets value might be a certain figure this year but they might be worth practically nothing next year and might increase again the following year.  Will there be a rule of thumb in the case <Col N="45" /> of an individual?  Let us say six years ago the valuation was ten years' purchase. Will the Revenue Commissioners take that?  Today it could be down to four years' purchase.</P>
    <P>I do not believe anybody in the world knows how to stop inflation quickly.  It can only be done gradually. If price control is used to reduce inflation how will the Revenue Commissioners value a property that has a price control on it and has practically nothing to show for profits?  Will there be four years' purchase on that?  Four years' purchase can mean nothing but VAT still has to be paid out of it.  I would like to see those things spelt out a little more.</P>
    <P>I asked on the Second Stage the amount of money <i>in toto</i> a person has to pay out of every £ he earns.  The Minister has given some information on this, but we could still reach a stage where a person could earn £1 and pay £1.10 or £1.20.  I can give examples of countries where this does not happen.  I know that Britain is worse, but who will look at Britain as an example today?  The businessman likes to know where he is going and to be able to plan ahead.  I know this is very difficult for any Government or individual to do.  There was a time when it was possible to do this, but that day has gone with the rate of inflation throughout the world.  The Government of some years ago, who introduced at least two budgets annually, did not plan ahead.</P>

      <P>A person must pay two taxes whether he makes money or not, VAT and wealth tax.  If he is a minus quantity he pays VAT and if he makes no money in his business but his assets are worth a certain amount he is followed for wealth tax. How can the Revenue Commissioners assess the amount he is liable for? He could finish up paying wealth tax on something he has not made any money on.  I do not believe that tax here should be lower than other countries, but it should not be much greater.  At present it could be slightly greater because we are not basically <Col N="46" /> an industrial country; we are not as industrialised as other European countries.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of tax must come from those who make profit to bolster up industry.  Some years ago the Fianna Fáil Government imposed restrictions on the import of certain goods with the result that people had to pay ten times the price for it to bolster up industry.  It is not too bad to tax our people a little above other countries provided it does not leave us in an uneconomic position.  I would be obliged if the Minister would give us a list of all taxes paid by the people in other European countries, direct and indirect taxes. If given these figures we would have a better idea of what is happening.</P>
      <P>It is hard to compare one wealth tax with another because other countries may have certain local taxes or better children's allowances.  If these figures were made available we would know how tough it will be to be in competition within the EEC.  It is important for us that our taxes are at rates which are not excessively greater than those in other European countries.  I include in that personal allowances.</P>
      <P>I should like to give an example for consideration by the Minister.  If we take 1974 and assume that the married person&mdash;I am excluding children's allowances&mdash;has an income from employment of £6,000 per annum and that the balance of his income is from investment.  Assume that the top rate of tax here will be 80 per cent that person would start paying tax on an annual income of £9,150.  The corresponding figures in other countries are:</P>
      <P>Luxembourg, £14,320, 57 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>Denmark, £6,670, 61 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>Germany, £38,900, 59 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>Netherlands, £22,620, 71 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>United Kingdom, £20,865, 98 per cent rate.</P>
      <P>Belgium, £44,710, 70 per cent rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> I agree with a tax that is used to bolster up certain commitments a Government may have and will have because of European or world conditions. I reckon that 80 per cent should be the maximum with all taxes. I want to get across that if a person earns £1 he should not have to pay 22/-.  Fianna Fáil always got the man in the street who was getting £3 a week to pay treble the price for shoes and other commodities when they were cheaper outside.</P>
    <P>In the case of the actual rate of tax we are paying, assuming again that the married person I referred to earlier does not get any children's allowance or other exemptions, the rate for tax in Denmark is .9 per cent above the threshold.  This rate is reduced if taxable income is less than 6 per cent of the taxable net wealth.  In Luxembourg the rate is .5 per cent above the threshold and Netherlands .8.  In the event of a control on prices being introduced and a trader being forced to pull down his price what compensation will such a person get against wealth tax?  In Europe the marked up price at any retail outlet is greater than here, and we are greater than Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 27, to insert a paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  The Principal Act shall be regarded as always having included the words added by paragraph (a) hereof; and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to rectify retrospectively the position which had existed from the passing of the 1945 Act up to such time as this Bill is passed, in which there appears to have been a different statutory provision in relation to the deduction of levies from what was the actual position in practice in relation to the deduction of the levy.  Subsection (1) of section 27 of the Principal Act of 1945 simply read:</P>
      <P>Every person who, is a licensed bookmaker, enters into a course bet on or after the commencement of this section shall pay to the Board a levy calculated at the rate of the prescribed percentage for the time being of the amount of such course bet.</P>
      <P>That was the end of the subsection. The clear meaning of that is&mdash;and I do not think it is in dispute&mdash;that the amount of levy payable to the board on that winning bet and, therefore, the amount that could be deducted by the bookmaker was 5 per cent of the stake wagered in relation to that bet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice has been for a good many years past and possibly since 1945 for bookmakers, when paying a winning bet, to deduct the levy from the total of the stake which is being returned to the winner.  The purpose of paragraph (a) of section 3 of this Bill is to regularise that position.  If it did not need regularising and putting into statutory form, there would have been no need for paragraph (a) of section 3.  There is a need and that <Col N="49" /> is why it is there.  What I am pointing out to the Taoiseach is that this paragraph (a) and the addition of these words to allow for the deduction of the levy from the total returned to the punter will regularise the position as, and from the coming into force of this Bill when it is enacted, but it will do nothing to regularise the position that has existed, apparently improperly as far as the statute is concerned, between 1945 and the passing of this Bill, because it has been, as I said, the invariable practice for a bookmaker to deduct 5 per cent of the total return to the winning punter.  It seems to me that there was no statutory authority for that, even though it was a universal practice.</P>
    <P>If there was no statutory authority for it, it seems to me that the punter would be entitled now to seek back from the bookmaker in the case of every winning bet the difference between the total amount of levy deducted and the amount of levy that would have been appropriate to the stake only.  That would run into millions of pounds over a 30-year period. I do not think it is feasible or possible that that money could, in fact, be recovered now at this stage.  That is why I have put down this amendment to cover that kind of situation, which would be simply to the effect that the principal Act shall be regarded as always having included the words added by paragraph (a) hereof which are the words to the effect that the levy is payable on the total amount of the stake and the winnings.</P>
    <P>I presume that, even though a punter would be entitled under the statute to demand back the excess levy which was deducted from him by the bookmaker because the whole transaction is founded on a bet, which is an illegal and void contract anyway, no court, one imagines, would seek to indirectly enforce a bet, which is, what an action for the recovery of excess levy might be construed by a court as amounting to.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless there is a situation which is quite anomalous.  That it is anomalous is proved by the fact that it was found necessary in this Bill to add <Col N="50" /> the words contained in paragraph (a) of section 3.  If the situation had been that the previous practice was in order and in accordance with statute, there would have been no need to add the words which are here.  By adding the words that are here and not making it retrospective, this House would, in effect, be saying: &ldquo;Something improper and illegal took place for 30 years but we are not doing anything about it.  We are just rectifying it as and from now for the future.&rdquo;  In the case of very substantial bets the amount of the levy would be considerable, particularly in respect of a horse which was backed at generous odds, for example a winner at 50-1 or 100-1. The stake would be very small but the winnings would be very large and the combination of the winnings and stake would be very large.  If somebody put £100 on a horse at 100-1&mdash;I know it does not happen very often on an Irish racecourse&mdash;the winnings would be £10,000.  The practice hitherto has been to deduct the levy at 5 per cent on the total returnable to the punter which would in this case be £10,100.  Five per cent of that is a very substantial amount of money&mdash;it is over £500&mdash; whereas by statute the entitlement of the bookmaker and the right of the punter was that the 5 per cent could have been deducted on the stake only, which was a £5 levy.  The difference, therefore, in this example that I have given is a sum of £500, which is a considerable amount of money by anyone's standards.</P>
    <P>It may well be that some punters will consider taking legal action or attempting to take legal action in these circumstances when they become aware of the fact that this section 3 (a) rectifies what is now wrong.  In the example I have given the bookmaker is compelled to deduct levy amounting to £505 rather than £5 which is a bookmaker's only entitlement at the moment.  It is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I adverted to it on Second Stage and the Taoiseach replied to the effect that he read out an extract from a document which the bookmaker signs for the Racing Board at the time that he is being given a permit.  In the document there was an undertaking <Col N="51" /> on the part of the bookmaker, as a consideration for his getting the permit, that he would deduct, not just on the stake but on the total returnable to the punter, a 5 per cent levy. This may well regularise the position as between the bookmaker and the Racing Board.  It does not regularise the position as between the bookmaker and the punter who in the example I have given is still entitled under statute at least to claim the £500 excess levy back from the bookmaker which the bookmaker deducted from him.  I am not to be taken as suggesting that the bookmaker, in deducting levy in accordance with what has always been the normal practice, acted improperly or that he did not return it to the Racing Board.  I am quite satisfied that he did and that he was only doing it in accordance with his signed undertaking with the board on the obtaining of his permit.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, as between the bookmaker and the punter there was an over-deduction in the example I gave of £500.  The only bar there might be legally&mdash;and I am not certain that it would be a total bar if this amendment is not accepted&mdash;to the punter suing for the recovery of the £500 excess levy in that instance would be a possibility that the court would hold that the action was basically founded on a bet which, as the House well knows, is totally illegal so far as the civil law is concerned.  It is void and unenforceable, out of which, in the view of the court under our general law of contract, no rights of any description could accrue, and the court would possibly take the view that if someone wants to enter into an illegal contract with the bookmaker or anyone else, he cannot then seek to have rights enforced for him arising incidentally out of what is fundamentally illegal; when I say &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; here, I do not want to be accused of saying that it is against the criminal law or anything like that, but the Taoiseach understands I mean &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; in the technical contractual sense, not in the general popular sense to the extent of avoidance or unenforceability.  It is more than just <Col N="52" /> unenforceable because its side transactions are tainted by the original illegality of the act in entering into the bet.  For that reason there is certainly the possibility that a punter taking action would not succeed.  That is not the only reason he would not succeed.</P>
    <P>On statute, under these two Acts, the 1945 Act and this Bill, on the face of it he has to win because it is proved beyond doubt by virtue of the necessity to put in section 3 (a) into this Bill to amend section 27 (1) of the 1945 Act that the position that had existed from 1945 up to the present has not been in accordance with statute.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to rectify that situation&mdash;to prevent or save actions being taken founded on bets.  Where it was generally known and well-known to be the invariable practice that a bookmaker deducted levy on the winning stake, it would be unfair that anyone should seek to take an action in those circumstances. The situation will be rectified by section 3 (a) when this Bill is passed because what is recognised by section 3 (a) as the invariable practice has been the invariable practice since 1945.  It is only right and proper that the intervening period of 30 years should equally be regulated by section 3 (a) in the same way as that proposes to regulate the position in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that retrospective amendment in the case is not necessary.  It is contended, I believe, that the existing practice is legal and universally accepted because, first of all, the practice is that every racing card contains the notice and I quote:</P>
      <P>The existing percentage deduction for levy is 5 per cent or 5p in the £ on the amount returnable to backers, that is, stake and win.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that this term can be read into the betting contract between the punter and the bookmaker.  In addition, as I mentioned on Second Stage, punters are familiar with the practice and I do not think any case has occurred where they have disputed <Col N="53" /> the bookmakers' right to deduct levies from winnings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the contract is between the board and the bookmaker in respect of his licence and I suppose in respect of the levy he returns but I do not think it is correct to say there was ever a contract, as Deputy O'Malley remarked, between the punter and the bookmaker. As he mentioned, it is well settled that actions of that sort are unenforceable and void, as distinct from the legal and commonly accepted interpretation of the term.  As I mentioned earlier, the bookmaker when he gets a permit from the Racing Board signs an undertaking to deduct the total amount being paid on winning bets.  That is the practice.  The document which I quoted here on Second Stage is the standard form between bookmakers and the Tote.  In addition, there is this notice on the race card which, I think, implies and certainly puts punters on notice that the percentage deduction is 5 per cent or 5p in the £ on the amount returnable to backers, that is, stake and win. I am advised it is not necessary to insert the amendment as suggested. The purpose of the amendment which is contained in the Bill is to formalise the existing procedure which has been operated in practice possibly almost since the inception of the board, certainly for very many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what the Taoiseach is getting at when he says there would be a certain position made clear but if this was all that was needed up to now I should like to ask the Taoiseach why it was necessary to put in section 3 (a).  If what was happening under the 1945 Act was valid up to now, why was it necessary to put in section 3 (a) into the Bill?  The point that Deputy O'Malley is making is valid in that any punter, it would seem to a layman like me, would be entitled, unless Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted, to sue for having an excess of tax deducted from <Col N="54" /> him.  Not being a lawyer, I would not be able to interpret it but it would seem to me to be common sense and reinforced by the need that the drafters of this Bill saw for putting in section 3 (a).  If section 3 (a) was not necessary in the 1945 Bill, why is it necessary in this Bill?</P>
      <P>It would certainly tidy up the legislation tremendously if Deputy O'Malley's amendment were accepted.  It would do away with all ambiguity.  We have an obligation in this House, no matter how trivial or unimportant the legislation may seem to be, that the legislation coming out of the House would be tight and unambiguous.  I would suggest to the Taoiseach that he would give very careful consideration to the acceptance of this amendment.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the House and particularly the Members who have spoken for this amendment that when the 1945 Act was being introduced, I happened to be chairman of the Bookmakers' Association.  We impressed on the then Minister the significance and importance of the introduction of this regulation to protect us and to legalise our standard of operation.  Unfortunately, the man concerned knew little or nothing about the business and his advisers were not very favourable to the profession which I represent. Having had long discussions with the Minister and the Taoiseach at that time, we failed to legalise what we thought should have been in the Bill.</P>

      <P>We had discussions with the then Minister.  It was agreed with the Racing Board that we would sign a contract that on all winning bets we would make the appropriate deduction. That does not mean what Deputy O'Malley has misrepresented to this House.  Up to two years ago tax deductions applied only to winning bets so that while the bookmaker paid tax on all bets, he collected only on winning bets.  Therefore, something that should have been done in 1945 is being done in 1975.</P>

It is not necessary to be a bookmaker to know all about racing and racing affairs.  The attitude of Deputy Coughlan and his colleague &mdash;he knows who I am talking about&mdash; is totally wrong and unjust when, by the amendment put down by Deputy O'Malley, we are proving our concern and our knowledge of what is under discussion.  Deputy O'Malley saw a flaw in the old Act.  He has pointed it out very forcibly and very impressively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach maintains that the fact that the notice appears on a race card more or less regularises the position but acceptance of Deputy O'Malley's amendment regularises the position from a legislation point of <Col N="56" /> view and will protect what has happened in the past in the event of somebody suing for paying huge amounts of tax on the winning portion of the money as against the original stake.  Deputy O'Malley gave an example of 100/1.  He said this does not happen very often but even on a 5/1, 6/1, 8/1 or 9/1 shot most of the tax which was deducted by the bookmakers was all on the winning content.

      <P>Could I have clarification on one point?  It would appear from the discussion that up to now 5 per cent on all bets placed with bookmakers should have been paid as a levy but the bookmakers collected in tax the levy on the total winning bets.  Deputy Coughlan has pointed out that no tax was collected on losing bets.  Am I to understand that the correct tax was paid as a levy to the Racing Board while the bookies collected tax which, on the law of average, should have been somewhat less since, if a bookmaker is to remain in business he must take in more money than he would pay out?  Am I to understand that bookies collected less tax but, in fact, paid more tax or was the tax that the bookie paid just the tax that he stopped from the punter when he was paying out his winnings or was it the tax that should have been paid on all bets struck?</P>

      <P>Deputy Power, again because of his ignorance of the matter, is misinterpreting the position. The position is that if a bookmaker holds a £100 on a race and does not pay out anything, that £100 is no longer a £100 because he has to pay the tax out of it.  He is not collecting tax because nobody collects winnings. This does not often happen, unfortunately, but to off-balance that, he collects on winning bets and very often he pays more tax than he should pay.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Power will see from the section, it has been the practice that a bookmaker deducts tax&mdash;the current rate is 5 per cent&mdash;<Col N="57" /> on the total amount paid to a successful punter.  In other words, the total stake and win which the punter should get.  That has been the practice for I think most of the time that the Racing Board has been in existence.  The point that has been made by Deputy O'Malley is that because the proposed section 3 (a) seeks to amend section 27 of the 1945 Act and to formalise this procedure, that a section should be added to provide the amendment would be regarded as having been in the original Act, in other words, that it would apply retrospectively in order to remove doubts.  I am advised that this is not necessary. But it has often been the experience in this House that when legislation is introduced, some changes are made to formalise procedure or to remove doubts and this particular section is for the purpose of doing that.</P>

      <P>I am slightly ignorant of the procedure that bookies adopt in regard to the return of levies but perhaps it is as well that one should admit his ignorance rather than feel that one is in a position that one knows everything about everything. My question still remains unanswered as to whether the tax that is returned is the tax that the bookie actually collects on winning bets or the tax which the bookie should have collected on all bets which is returned by way of levy at the moment?  If it is the tax that the bookie collects, I maintain that that, if the bookie is to remain in business, is less than the levy that would be returned on all bets because a bookie, if he hopes to stay in business, must take in more money than he pays out.</P>

      <P>One could go to a race meeting and be involved in racehorses, as I have been since I was able to walk, but one would not be aware of the ramifications of what goes on in the minds of bookies and in the returns of bookies.  Most Deputies know that a bookmaker's books should balance. I cannot say if that is always the case but the practice is, as I mentioned <Col N="58" /> here the last day, that the bookmaker gets a betting permit from the board.  He gives an undertaking to deduct the levy from the total amount paid on a winning bet.  That is what the bookmaker is liable for and that has been the practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if I could comment particularly in relation to Deputy Power's question?  I see the point he is making.  Many people may be under the misapprehension that what a bookmaker returns by way of levy to the Racing Board is what he deducts from successful punters.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If he did, I am afraid that is wrong.  What the Racing Board require from a bookmaker and what he is obliged to pay them is what is set out in section 1 of section 27, that is, 5 per cent of every bet that is made with the bookmaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the example I have given of a 100 to 1 winner and a man with £100 on it, the total amount of levy that is deducted by the bookmaker, as between the bookmaker and the punter on that particular bet, is £505, but the amount payable by the bookmaker to the Racing Board in respect of that bet is £5 because the Racing Board under subsection (1) of section 27 of the 1945 Act are entitled only to 5 per cent of each bet that is made, irrespective of whether it is a winning or a losing bet.  Therefore, in that particular instance the bookmaker has collected, ostensibly by way of levy from the punter, £505 on that bet but he remits to the Racing Board only £5 in respect <Col N="59" /> of that bet.  But in case anyone thinks that the bookmaker makes a profit of £500 on that transaction, he does not necessarily do so, because he also has to pay the Racing Board 5 per cent of every bet which he held on that race, all the other bets being losing bets from the point of view of the punter.  He pays 5 per cent on every bet he held.  He pays only £5 on that particular bet but he also pays 5 per cent on every other bet.</P>
    <P>Other things being equal, the extra £500 levy which the bookmaker deducted from that punter on that particular winning bet would cover, and perhaps more than cover, all the other bets which he held in that race and in respect of which he had to pay levy to the Racing Board.  From a bookmaker's point of view, the longer the price of the winner, the better, in the sense that he receives back by way of deduction from the punter a much larger amount of levy than he himself has to pay to the Racing Board in respect of that particular bet.</P>
    <P>If a man had a 100 to 1 winner in some race, the probability is that the bookmaker would hold only one bet on that particular horse and would have held a large number of bets on other horses.  He would have to pay 5 per cent levy on each of those bets that he held.  In theory, over a long time the profit levy or the apparent profit on the deduction in an instance like that would balance out by the apparent loss on the other bets.  In other words, if you held several thousand pounds on an even money favourite in the same race which was beaten then you pay 5 per cent on that several thousand pounds.  It may be that on a particular race a bookmaker would make a profit <i>vis-à-vis</i> the levy; in other cases he would make a loss.  Over a long period, in theory at least, the two probably balance out.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless while that is the mechanics of the situation, the additional words here make no reference to paying anything to the Racing Board. Section 3 (a) simply refers to the transaction as between the bookmaker and <Col N="60" /> the punter.  If the Taoiseach suggested that the amount deducted from the punter was payable to the Racing Board that would not be correct.  Even though in practice it might be correct it would not, as a matter of mechanics, be correct.  In section 3 (a) there is no reference to the Racing Board.  It regulates only the relationship or position of the bookmaker <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punter. The Racing Board are getting their 5 per cent anyway on all bets.  This has always been the practice, and it is not being changed by this Bill, because they are not involved.  But because the position as between the bookmaker and the punter is very much involved I would again strongly urge on the Taoiseach that to avoid disputes which must inevitably arise when the position has been brought to the notice of people, as presumably it will be after this Bill is passed, and to regularise the position as between the bookmaker and the punter for the last 30 years, this amendment should be accepted.  It would simply have the effect of putting the 1945 to 1975 period on the same footing as the post-1975 period would be.</P>
    <P>If there were no problem about this, if the problem did not arise, as the Taoiseach suggested&mdash;but I suggest that it did&mdash;there would be no need, as was suggested by Deputies Crowley and Barrett, to bring in section 3.  What the Taoiseach is suggesting to the House now is that because there is a notice on a race card that solves the problem, everything is all right.  I do not think that we could accept that a notice anywhere on a race card would have the same effect and power and precedence as an Act of Parliament.  I agree with the Taoiseach that it regularises the position as between the bookmaker and the Racing Board, but it does not regularise the position as between the bookmaker and the punter.  We are proposing in section 3 (a) to regularise it for the future, but we are leaving a 30-year gap in which it is not regularised at all.  All the notices in the world on race cards cannot overrule what is the statutory position, and the statutory position as it is at the moment is contained in section 27 (1) <Col N="61" /> of the 1945 Act.  In other words, it states that a bookmaker is entitled to deduct only on the stake and not on the winnings.</P>

What is in operation is an arrangement of convenience between the bookmakers&mdash;an illegal arrangement if you like&mdash;and the Racing Board, that tax as a lump could be deducted from the winning bets only.  I would like to know what happens to tax in cases where the punter will pay on his placing of the wager.  Is that tax returned to the Racing Board?  This practice is in operation and the punter is entitled to insist upon it.</P>

      <P>I am not confused. This is a fact and the punter is acting within his rights.  Is this tax returned to the Racing Board?  For these reasons, as well as others, Deputy O'Malley's amendment is quite a sensible one.  Racing is a very important <Col N="62" /> industry.  Punters, many of whom are visitors from far-off places, are entitled to be clear-cut in their understanding of betting, levy and taxes. There is an inconsistency between the SP offices and the course betting in that when one places a bet in an SP office the tax is immediately submitted with the wager.  The two situations are parallel.  The Bill as it is needs the type of amendment that Deputy O'Malley proposes.  It is sensible and reasonable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>It seems from the difference of opinions expressed in this debate that the man who has been carrying all the taxation which has gone to the Racing Board happens to be very much in the minority, the winning punter.  The bookmaker from what has been said, and from what Deputy Coughlan has been saying, has not suffered because there is a balancing up between winning and losing bets.  As we know, very few bookmakers go out of business and we do not want to see them going out of business.  The balancing must be working pretty well, because the amount they collect is balanced by their total commitment to the Racing Board. Therefore we can only assume from what has been said that the punter who has a winning bet pays full tax on stakes and winnings.  He has been carrying practically the whole burden of this taxation as we see it without any legislation to back up this situation. The way out is really to accept Deputy O'Malley's amendment in this case to regularise the whole position. It seems to have been most irregular, as we now see from the way the debate has developed.</P>

      <P>A levy is payable on all bets.  Some confusion may have arisen because of the query of Deputy Power.  The procedure is that the levy is payable on all bets.  If a person has a bet of £1 at 9-1, he is regarded as winning £10.  He gets £9 and the bookmaker deducts £1.  From the £1 he pays 5p in the £ to the Racing Board. On losing bets he pays in the same way, 5p in the £, that is at the current rate of deduction of the 5 per cent levy.  I do not think there is any confusion <Col N="63" /> about this.  It is the practice and has been the practice.</P>

      <P>Is it 5 per cent of every bet staked?  It would appear to me where people have been paying tax on their winnings that money has been extracted from them under false pretences.  Strictly to interpret this legislation would mean that if taxes to be paid are levied they have to be paid on the stakes.  Only now in this do we see any provision to have a levy collected on the winnings.  It reinforces all the more Deputy O'Malley's amendment because, although I have been going racing since I can remember, I was never aware that I could go to my bookmaker and insist that he took 5 per cent on my stake.  I understand now that he can do it but up to now has never done it.  I think that it is legally possible to do exactly what Deputy O'Malley says, to sue the bookmaker for taking money under false pretences from the punter.  All the legislation says is that 5 per cent is payable on all stake money.  It is only now that we have a situation whereby it is on the stake plus the bet. I would ask the Taoiseach to have a very serious look at it.</P>

We heard a lot about illegal betting, off-course betting.  Is it not a fact that all these percentages are collected from the small punters, from £20 down?  No tax is being paid on bets of £100, both on and off course.  If it was collected from all there would be no need to have 5 per cent for the <Col N="64" /> Racing Board.  The small punters are paying all the charge.  If it goes up to 10 per cent I can see more and more illegal betting going on, both on and off course.  The problem is the greater the levy the smaller the Racing Board's percentage.  Let us be honest with ourselves, we know this is going on and have been told it is going on both on and off course.  The large punter who goes up with £100 is not going to pay 5 per cent.</P>

This has been adopted by many punters who stand on their entitlement under that 1945 Act to pay the levy on placing the wager. Despite what Deputy Collins says, bookmakers have no option by law but to accept tax when the wager is being placed.  The situation certainly needs clarification.  I think the Taoiseach would agree there is no political kudos in this.  It would be a sensible arrangement to regularise the situation whereby people would know exactly where they stand.</P>
      <P>Two practices have been in operation on race courses, maybe with a small minority of the bookmakers, but I asked a bookmaker would he accept the payment of tax on the placing of a wager and he said: &ldquo;Yes, I have seen a woman produce pennies and halfpennies and, according to law, I have to accept the payment of tax with the wager.&rdquo;  This is a point that needs clarification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the point Deputy Cronin has been making which is fundamental to this amendment, to demonstrate it I must go back to the example I have already given of a bet of £100 at 100 to 1 on of which what purports to be levy is deducted by the bookmaker on the total amount concerned; this will amount to £505 deduction from the punter in this particular example. Assume for the purposes of the argument, even though I know it is unlikely to happen in practice, that that particular bet was the only bet the bookmaker held on that race, he would deduct £505 from the punter but under section 27 would remit only £5 to the Racing Board.  In other words, there would be a profit for him of £500 or there would be £500 put towards the losses he sustained on the bet.  What I want to make clear is that, in that instance, even though £505 is deducted by the bookmaker from the punter only £5 is paid by way of levy to the Racing Board. This gives rise to a great deal of misunderstanding and confusion.  It is another very strong reason why, in fact, this amendment should be accepted to regularise the position, not just for the future but over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>When people become aware of this, particularly those who have had substantial gains at longish odds like 50 or 100 to 1, and of the fact that there has been no statutory authority for the practice of the past 30 years, then, as I said at the outset to the Taoiseach, there is a strong possibility of quite a series of actions being started in the courts, with a lot of disagreement and misunderstanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is being regularised by section 3 (a) here as to the future. What I am saying to the Taoiseach is borne out by the kind of examples and queries of Deputy Cronin, Deputy Power and others.  We agree with the regularisation of it for the future, but because it only accords with what has been the practice we think that it should be regularised for the period from 1945 to the present day.  If it is not there will be action <Col N="68" /> against bookmakers by punters who are aggrieved, and rightly aggrieved. I am not suggesting that the bookmakers did anything wrong.  They did not.  They deducted in accordance with their own undertaking to the Racing Board and they had to do it. Nonetheless under statute the punter was wrongly treated.  There was not statutory authority for what happened in relation to him.  It is borne out by the kind of example I have given where in a particular bet the bookmaker deducts from the punter £505 but remits to the Racing Board only £5.  That is the precise position, and it will cause a lot of annoyance on the part of the punters, particularly when they now realise that there was not statutory authority for the deductions that were made.  They were made on the strength of an undertaking or a contract as between the bookmaker and the Racing Board and not under any authority of any Act of this House.</P>

      <P>There is not really much confusion in the minds of most punters on this.  They all understand the position.  Occasionally people who do not bet or race regularly may be slightly confused and occasionally issues arise, either disputes between bookmakers and those who bet, or we hear criticism even occasionally of tax deducted in the SP offices.  Any punter who places bets with bookmakers at race meetings is familiar with the pattern.  The existing practice is not included in detail in the statutes.  So far as I am concerned I do not suppose it makes an awful lot of difference.  As I say I do not feel very strongly about the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Malley and it is not necessary from the legal point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies feel that it would improve the Bill, I do not mind having a look at it to see whether it is necessary. The phraseology used by Deputy O'Malley is all right but it might be necessary to have a look at the actual terms of it because what in fact has been done here is to formalise a procedure that has been in operation for very many years under the 1945 Act <Col N="69" /> and which is included in similar terms in the Act Governing Bord na gCon.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that what has been in operation up to now bears no resemblance to what should have been done if the Act had been adhered to?  Furthermore, the reason for this Bill is to provide money by way of levy to the Racing Board.  The Racing Board ignored the Bill as it was in 1945 and implemented an agreement with the bookmakers whereby they were meant to accept 5 per cent of the money that a bookmaker paid out rather than accept what they were legally entitled to, 5 per cent of what a bookmaker took in.</P>

I have been totting up how many bets I can remember where you had to pay out a substantial amount of tax on them that you could certainly under the present legislation claim back.  The Taoiseach would be very wise really if he did cover retrospectively.  Nobody likes retrospective legislation.  It is something to be avoided, except in the direst emergency, and this could be one.  If he accepts Deputy O'Malley's amendment he would be cutting off any source of dispute that may occur.</P>

That is the regulation and that is the law and, having held our books for six months we destroy them.  We have to hold all books and all accounts for six months.  Deputy O'Malley comes along with a mythical situation of a man having a £100 on a 100/1 winner.  Aesop in his hey-day would not produce anything like this of a man putting a £100 on a 100/1 winner and that was his only bet.  That would not have happened in Aesop's time.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that any person having a bet since 1945 can now come along and sue a bookmaker for some levy that he was not entitled to pay. That is another myth because it is an absolute impossibility for this person to do it in this Bill.  We discussed the matter with the Taoiseach who, as I said, and repeat again, is the only Taoiseach who ever met us.  On the introduction of the Racing Board Act, 1945 when I was chairman of the bookmakers and on the introduction of the Bord na gCon Act we could never get as far as we wanted to go. We have had discussions with the Taoiseach.  We are professional men licensed to carry on a professional business.  We are happy and we are convinced that what is included in this Bill satisfies us and is a protection of our future.  That should be our consideration.</P>

      <P>With respect to Deputy Coughlan and this great study and discussion that his association seem to be having among themselves and with other people, if they got a professional in-depth study done on the existing <Col N="71" /> legislation because of this legislation they would have discovered, like Deputy O'Malley has discovered on behalf of all of us that there was a serious flaw which could escalate now as a result of it being highlighted.  If there is a flaw in legislation it is only right and proper that it should be highlighted and corrected.  Deputy O'Malley has brought in his amendment in order to correct the previous position which could now prove very dicey because there are people and punters who can remember the individual bets with bookmakers on which they had to pay a lot of tax.  They now appreciate that they did not have to pay tax on the total and were left completely unprotected or wide open by the existing law.  It is quite possible that they will go to court and perhaps look for their money back.  They may not have had too many winning bets since they had that one.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has highlighted a flaw and we all accept that it was a flaw.  The only thing that seemed in any way to regularise it, as the Taoiseach said, was a notice published in all racing cards but this does not amend the existing legislation.  In order to protect everyone who has been involved, including bookmakers, Racing Board and strong punters I think the acceptance of the amendment is the key to it.  With regard to having doubts about on whose side Fianna Fáil are we are on the side of the racing industry as a whole, breeding and racing, for the good of the economy.  I have nothing against bookmakers, racing boards, punters or the people that are interested in racing.  We are out to improve in every way we can within reason an industry that we are all proud of.</P>

      <P>To get the facts right, section 3 of this Bill formalises for the future the practice that has been in operation.  It is considered necessary to do this in order to remove doubts.  That was how this problem was brought to light.  Deputy O'Malley <Col N="72" /> suggests that because it is being brought to light in section 3 which amends section 27 of the Principal Act, it should be made retrospective to cover any transactions which were provided for since the parent Act was introduced.  I do not think there is any fundamental objections to it but I am advised, that it is not necessary.  In fact this issue was brought to life by the provisions of section 3 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 28, to delete &ldquo;ten per cent.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;six per cent.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is possibly the most important amendment that I put down.  It has the effect of giving statutory force, if it is accepted, to what I understand is the proposal of the Racing Board in relation to levy.  The Taoiseach informed the House on Second Reading that while the Bill contained a provision allowing the Racing Board to increase the levy to a figure not exceeding 10 per cent from its present figure of 5 per cent the intention of the Racing Board was at the moment to increase the figure to 6 per cent only.  I was informed to the same effect by the Racing Board but I was also informed, quite properly, by the official concerned that while it was the intention of the board to raise the levy to 6 per cent only in this present year, that he could not, on their behalf, give any assurance or give any indication <Col N="73" /> that it would not be raised to some higher figure next year or in some other future year.</P>
    <P>That may well be the feeling of the Racing Board but I feel strongly, particularly as we have raised no objection, in principle, to the increase of 20 per cent&mdash;it is an increase of 20 per cent from 5 per cent to 6 per cent&mdash;one can get away with saying that the difference between 5 and 6 is one, but the increase in the amount of levy that will be taken from punters is 20 per cent.  We feel that that is more than adequate at the moment.  In agreeing to that we think it not unreasonable that this House would bind the Racing Board to a situation that if they wanted a higher increase than 20 per cent in some future year they should come back to this House to get it.</P>
    <P>I understand that in 1945 there was a great deal of discussion about the levy that was being imposed on the establishment of the Racing Board. Many people were afraid that the introduction of a levy would be used in some way as the thin end of the wedge, ultimately, to establish a tote monopoly here as there is in almost every country in the world, except in Britain and ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some States in America where it is legalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from a number of States in America, Britain and Ireland, betting is a State monopoly. It is enormously profitable.  The Taoiseach was good enough to quote figures here the last day; £84 million was given to the industry in 1973 in France.  No wonder they have huge stakes.  The minimum bet there is something around £2,000, where our minimum stake is about £200.  It was feared that it was the intention of the Government of the day to increase this levy gradually until it reached the stage where it was no longer profitable or economic to bet with bookmakers and it would be more attractive to bet on the tote instead.  Ultimately, the stage would be reached, as in France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> It was specifically written into the 1945 Act that the maximum levy was to be 5 per cent.  That was inserted, I believe, by way of amendment.  In the original draft of the Bill there was no limit but an amendment was inserted to prevent that ever happening.  Now there is a proposal to increase the levy. There is a fair enough case for a certain increase; that is why we did not oppose it the last day, but there is no case for a potential increase of 100 per cent, which is what section 3 (b) would bring about.</P>
    <P>In effect, this House will lose all control of any future increases up to 10 per cent if we pass this section as it stands.  The Taoiseach will tell me that there is a provision at the end of this Bill to lay the regulation which the Racing Board will make on the table of the House, but in practice those regulations are never disallowed. It must be years since one was disallowed in this House because the Government of the day, presumably, would not allow the regulation to be made in the first place if they did not agree with it.  They have a majority and they are going to get it through anyway even if a motion is put down.</P>
    <P>I disallowed, in the Seanad about four years ago, an order of the Incorporated Law Society increasing their fees.  That is the only time for many years where a statutory instrument such as this was actually disallowed by either House of the Oireachtas.  It can only be done, as it was done in that instance, where the Government of the day so decide.  It is really the Government who have the say rather than either House of the Oireachtas.  Giving the power to the Racing Board to effect an increase of up to 100 per cent in levy, even though it is subject, in theory to the power of the Houses to overrule it, is not good enough.  If we give them that power, we can be fairly sure that it will be used within a matter of a few years because the temptation to use it will be too great, the pressures on the Racing Board to use it will be too great.</P>
    <P>The only effective brake on a further increase being imposed by the Racing Board would be the acceptance <Col N="75" /> of my amendment.  This would confine the increase to 20 per cent&mdash; from 5 per cent to 6 per cent&mdash;and if in one, two or three years' time, the Racing Board feel they have a strong enough case for a further increase to say 7 or 7½ per cent let them make a case to the Government and Opposition of the day.</P>
    <P>It is wrong in our view to give power to the Racing Board to effect a 100 per cent increase.  I know they are not going to do it this year but we are practically half way through 1975 and they could easily on 1st January next impose a larger increase than the 20 per cent they are doing this year. They could immediately increase the levy by 20 per cent and on 1st January, 1976, they would not be in breach of any undertaking if they went from 6 per cent to 10 per cent and effected a 100 per cent increase in the levy.  That would be wrong from a number of points of view.</P>
    <P>I am not going to go into the merits or demerits of a State monopoly on the French lines.  I know there are quite a number of people connected with racing who are strongly attracted to that ideal because of the huge amounts of money which are made available to the betterment of racing in France and in other countries.  But our circumstances and those of Britain are different.  While the amount that the Racing Board are able to get as a result of our present betting set up is, unfortunately, much less than one would wish for the sake of the industry, nonetheless much of the atmosphere of meetings is created by the fact that bookmakers are there.  You have probably much higher attendances from people who might not otherwise bother to go, people who are not that interested in racing but because there is an atmosphere, not so much in places like the Curragh, Leopardstown and others, but at many of these holiday meetings, where the attendances are often huge, in places like Galway, Listowel, Tralee and Killarney where the quality of racing is not the only attraction.  Therefore, I cannot see the <Col N="76" /> French system working here, and because many people will feel it should not operate here, we have got to maintain a control on the right of the Racing Board to increase the levy on bets with bookmakers.  Otherwise the levy could become so high that betting would drop off, and a lot of licensed bookmakers would go out of business &mdash;and unlicensed bookmakers would begin to spring up.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that 80 or 90 per cent or more of the betting that takes place in Ireland is done with bookmakers rather than with the tote, which never caught on in this country in the way that it did in some others. The tote for the most part as the Taoiseach and the House know, deals only in very very small sums of money. Most of its betting is in tiny units of 20p and 40p.  I often wonder if it is economic for them to bother at all with such tiny sums of money.  Because of that, the levy of bets with bookmakers is of considerable importance to our whole racing industry.  That is why this House and the Oireachtas generally should maintain close control over what the Racing Board are permitted to do by way of imposing a levy.  For these reasons I would ask the House to accept the amendment here in my name to confine the increase to one of 20 per cent and let it go up from 5 to 6 which is, as I said, 20 per cent.  If in 1977, 1978, or subsequently, the Racing Board feel that they have a strong enough case, let them come back here to the House and make that case through the Government of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons. In this Bill for the first time the regulations are obliged to be laid before the House and they can be annulled.  That power was not in the previous Act. That is a change which gives the House control over it.  It was prescribed in the 1945 Act that the Racing Board can change the levy only with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The procedure and practice in the earlier years was that the levy was put on at 5 per cent.  It was subsequently reduced to 2½ per cent. Many people forget that.  It was only <Col N="77" /> after a lapse of a number of years that it was again raised to 5 per cent.  In this Act the ceiling is raised to 10 per cent, a ceiling which is not in the Bord na gCon Act.  Deputy O'Malley is aware that there is no ceiling in the Bord na gCon Act.  Deputies have not said anything about it.  The House has no control.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in that case is the Minister responsible.  It can only be increased with his consent.</P>
      <P>In fact, there are two safeguards in this Bill, one is that there is an overriding ceiling of 10 per cent and also this Bill amends the 1945 Act, which had no requirement that regulations should be laid before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bord na gCon Act has that requirement, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That requirement, but no ceiling, none whatever in the Bord na gCon Act&mdash;it could be 100 per cent&mdash;and there has been no criticism about it.  In this Bill there is an overriding ceiling, but, in addition, there is the requirement, which was not in the 1945 Act, to lay the regulation before the House, and the House will have the opportunity of annulling it.</P>
      <P>In this Bill there are two requirements which must be complied with; neither the board nor the Minister can exceed 10 per cent.  It is the intention of the board to increase it by 1 per cent.  Admittedly, the personnel of boards change, but as I said on the last day here, although Governments have come and gone, this is the first amendment of the Act for 30 years. The board never appeared to exceed in any sense what would commend itself to the board as being in the interests of racing.  In fact, as I say, originally the levy was 5 per cent, which was the maximum permitted up to now, and subsequently the board, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, reduced it to 2½ per cent.  Then, over a period of years, it was again raised to 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bord na gCon Act there is no ceiling.  There is only the requirement that the consent of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries must be secured; in this case it is the <Col N="78" /> consent of the Minister for Finance. There is the added safeguard now that if a regulation is made it must be laid before the House.  All experience would indicate that, conscious of the needs of racing and, at the same time, aware of the liability of punters, the Racing Board have taken these matters into account in the past, and I believe they can be relied on to do the same in the future.  It is hardly the occasion now to get into the wider question of whether a total monopoly would provide more money for racing or not.  However, the general view is that circumstances here are different from those of France.  In France there are no football pools; here, although they are not run in this country, a good deal of betting takes place on pools in Britain and to that extent some of the money is siphoned off in directions other than racing.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Dáil for a very long period has recognised that the procedure laid down in the Racing Act and Totalisator Act provides for both tote and bookmakers, is the one most suited to our conditions.  As I say, this particular section as drafted gives the original safeguard of the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It has an overriding maximum as in the parent Act, but the maximum is now being raised to take account of changes in money value.  In addition, the regulations are required to be laid before the Dáil and can, if the Dáil wishes, be annulled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if there is any prospect of an industry being established in Rathmullan, County Donegal, in the near future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been informed by the Industrial Development Authority that, together with An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, they are negotiating with a firm with a view to the settingup of a fish processing facility in Rathmullan. The promoters are expected to submit a detailed proposal to the IDA in the near future.  The project would have a substantial employment content.</P>
      <P>Rathmullan should also benefit from the employment opportunities afforded by the Courtaulds project at Letter-kenny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that the negotiations which were temporarily held up have been reopened and <Col N="81" /> the IDA are awaiting detailed proposals but the IDA will certainly move briskly when those detailed proposals arrive.  The ball is not currently in their court and there is no hold up on the State side and no wish to hold it up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the further redundancies that are about to take place in a firm (name supplied) in County Offaly, which will result in the loss of 100 jobs; and if he has any proposals under consideration to protect this industry from foreign trading difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the firm, to which the Deputy refers, have found it necessary recently to issue redundancy notices to nearly 100 of their workers.  These redundancies are, I understand, largely due to a falling off in orders for one of their principal products on the home market.</P>
      <P>I have indicated previously, in reply to similar questions, and I would refer the Deputy particularly to columns 519 and 2111 of the Dáil Debates of 16th January and 15th May, 1975 respectively, the action which is being taken, within the constraints imposed by our international treaty obligations, to help certain sensitive sectors of industry including textiles.  This firm would benefit from the results of this action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the company called a recent Press conference at which it was stated that if imports were not curtailed or completely shut out the company would have to close?  Is he also aware that the closing of the Blarney Mills in Cork had an adverse effect on them as they used to supply these mills?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of various statements calling for the complete shutting out of imports but I have made it clear that while we have, in regard to all the possible headings, done a large number of things to protect the textile industry and various <Col N="82" /> sectors of it, the hope of total exclusion of imports is vain.  It is not in our power without breaching the Treaty of Accession to the Community in a way that would provoke an instant retaliation from the Community. It is simply not in our power to do that within the terms of the Accession Treaty.  The powers of retaliation of the Community, through the court and in other ways, are very substantial and where other countries have tried to do these things, they have used these powers promptly, so that the thought of the whole gamut from grants to loans to export promotion, help with design, management advice through the NDC&mdash;all of those things and the more recent things we have done such as surveillance and tightening up by the Revenue Commissioners are available to help the firm but to say that we could shut out competing imports is to raise a vain hope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a specific question to the Minister in relation to the firm in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I can go into this in detail if Deputies wish it, but in relation to the firm in question or to any other exporting firm, the counselling of a course of action which would provoke retaliation which could be dealt with, as the Deputy suggested, as it arises is mistaken.  There is only one country in the Community more <Col N="83" /> dependent on foreign trade than we are, that is Belgium which has a much stronger economy, and to provoke an avalanche of protective measures on the part of adjoining countries to which we export would really&mdash;I know the Deputy does not wish it nor does any Deputy&mdash;inflict much greater harm on industry and employment than to proceed with the mechanisms.  I am not any more satisfied with them than other Deputies but they are the only course open to us and recourse to violation of the Treaty and the provocation of retaliation would produce a much worse end result and a much greater threat to employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if you are dealing with South Korea and countries like that, to which our exports are very small, there can be no significant retaliation by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the Deputy should be aware that the 16 countries of the so-called low-cost quota area which includes the Far East low-cost producers, do not include Korea, with which we have made a separate arrangement.  But they include the others.  There are two things: first, there is the continuation of the quota order restricting imports to £100,000 per annum which, in terms of our total production, is very small, and, secondly, we have restructured the permission given under that £100,000 quota to admit only things which complement and do not complete with our own production.  In regard to them we are doing something, and in regard to South Korea, which is not included in the low-cost quotas, we were the first, and we are still the only country to have obtained special arrangements through the Community for our restriction which has brought down, in the period since February when we invoked it, the import, for example, of South Korean shirts&mdash;woven shirts&mdash;to a total of 3,000 dozen, a little over 30,000 shirts which in terms of total production and consumption is very small.  In the areas <Col N="84" /> where action is possible we have acted in those two specific ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the company stated that if they did not receive immediate help they would have to close with a loss of 380 jobs?  In reference to the Minister's reply it was only after constant pressure from us on this side of the House that he decided to take action of the nature which we in Private Members' Time requested last December.  He left it until now and the onus is on him and on the Government for the situation.  It is shameful that the Minister and the Government carried on in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps he intends to take to provide employment in Banagher, County Offaly, in view of the recent closure of a firm (name supplied), now in the hands of a receiver, which resulted in the loss of 110 jobs; if there are any new negotiations in train for the take-over of this factory; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that following the advertising of the business for sale by the receiver, the authority has put a number of interested parties in touch with him.</P>
      <P>With regard to the general question of industrial development the Industrial Development Authority is promoting Offaly vigorously and is using its flexible grant powers within existing statutory limits to achieve this.  In the case of Banagher the authority in conjunction with the local authority is at present endeavouring to purchase a suitable site for industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have met them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the IDA interested in purchasing the factory in view of the fact that it is a viable concern?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="85" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated in my reply that a number of companies have shown interest.  While the names of the companies are confidential, I can indicate that I have in my brief the names of six companies who have made an approach and that other inquiries have been made through financial institutions.  There is a substantial volume of inquiry in regard to that factory.  I would prefer to seek a solution by means of a take-over by another viable concern rather than pursue direct intervention, although I do not rule out the latter.  When there are good inquiries it is better to leave the matter alone and hope that some of these other firms will take over this factory and continue it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister reasonably optimistic about one of those six firms taking over this very important industry in South Offaly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six that are named and there are indications of other inquiries received, but I think that to hold out hopes and subsequently have them dashed is psychologically worse than to indicate &mdash;which is the truth&mdash;that I am not certain that any of them will take it over.  The substantial volume of real inquiry is encouraging, and more than that I cannot say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy details of that but he can be assured that all the help of what I might call the rescue services of the State&mdash;the IDA and other agencies&mdash; will be made available to ensure that there is no impossible burden handed on with the plant and staff.  I cannot give details because I am not party to them.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a receiver in and that he has a very clearly defined legal position and legal rights, and while the State can encourage and help, his rights are clearly defined, and his duties to the people to whom money is owed.  I cannot say more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that this factory involves more than putting a big number of people out of employment in my constituency and in Offaly, and that it also involves the slowing up of a housing drive in which they were concerned.  It is very important that the factory be taken over and that the commitments the factory had entered into would be fulfilled by the company taking over the factory.  It is very serious for my county where big commitments were made in the housing area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  I have met a delegation from the factory and from Banagher some time ago, and the Deputy may be assured of all the assistance it is possible to give through the agencies at my disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the parties that are possibly interested are all Irish firms?  Can he give us an assurance on behalf of the IDA that even if the best prospect is not realised there could be some arrangement whereby the IDA would hold on to the factory and not have it sold off in bits and pieces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all Irish firms and firms of which I would already have known about; they are substantial firms.  As regards the final outcome I cannot add to what I have said.  I cannot give the absolute kind of guarantee the Deputy would wish, but he can be assured that both IDA and Fóir Teoranta are monitoring this situation for reasons mentioned by various Deputies and, above all, because it is in a town where it is the only substantial employer, a fact which gives great strength to their arguments.  We will do everything we can but I cannot give an absolute guarantee the Deputy may wish to get; I do not think I have the legal power to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be in a position to confirm that the six firms he has mentioned are of a similar type of business as that formerly carried on by Banagher Tiles and in the event of the firm being taken over, would it be possible that the skills and techniques of those previously employed in this industry will be utilised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not help if I were to give the names of the firms but I am very anxious, as are the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, that skills and techniques that have been built up in the Banagher work force should be continued.  They are useful and necessary, and that is the intention behind the efforts being made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions during the past few months, I am seriously concerned about the difficulties at present confronting a number of sectors of industry in Ireland, including the shirt-making industry.  I have been endeavouring to ensure that everything possible is done to relieve these difficulties in so far as they are due to trading conditions in the home market. However, in the case of the shirt-making industry it appears that one source of difficulty is depressed demand in the industry's major export market.</P>
      <P>As regards the home market, I have explained on a previous occasion the constraints imposed by our international obligations and the steps I have taken within these restraints. These include: an arrangement for the limitation of the volume of shirts imported from Korea; the investigation by the Dumping Commission of possible dumping of shirts from various sources; an intensification by the Revenue Commissioners of their existing systems of control and scrutiny of import documentation; proposed introduction of a system of surveillance of all clothing, including shirts&mdash; that is being done now and discussions with the British authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure which the Minister gave me for shirt imports from Korea alone was 67,000.  Can the Minister say whether the restrictions and constraints to which he has referred in his last reply and in reply to the previous question apply to all third countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not apply to all third countries.  There are two specific restraints, one is the low cost quota system which applies to 16 countries in the low cost category and many of which are Far Eastern countries. The arrangements with South Korea are unique to Ireland and are separate from those other arrangements because at the time of the arranging of the low cost quota South Korea was not a significant exporter. There are other arrangements at Community level with other very numerous countries of the world where, in very low cost circumstances, there is the development of the textile industry and the endeavour by exporters to build up markets in the Community.  These are the common external arrangements of the Community as a whole and all of them are in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that of the dozen or so shirt factories in County Donegal two or three have closed, that others are about to close and that all remaining ones are on short time?  The Minister's refusal to meet a joint deputation from the Buncrana Urban Council and of other representatives of that area, together with people involved in the shirt industries, is totally out of line with what Britain is doing.  Is the Minister aware that the British Government have come to the rescue of shirt factories in Derry and in Northern Ireland generally in a big way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding imports from countries outside the Community, <Col N="90" /> we operate the same regime as all other member states.  Other countries engaged in the shirt and textile industries are experiencing the same difficulties as ourselves but they have all avoided having recourse to the sort of restrictions of trade which Deputies on the other side of the House are calling for.  Regarding movement between members of the Community, with the rapidly eroding tariffs that exist, free trade exists, but the forms of aid to which the Deputy referred in respect of Derry were in the nature of direct financial aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with it.  I would remind the Deputy that in 1974, the last period for which I have figures, the amount of grants paid to the textile industry was £2.3 million while the amount of grants approved was £33.6 million and the amount of loans from Fóir Teoranta was £1 million.  For a country of this size and for an industry of the size in question, those were substantial sums.  They indicated a real effort to help those industries in difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the statement he made indicated that the main cause of the closure of factories was the failure of the Irish shirt industry to get into outside markets?  Would he not admit that the main causes of the shut down in the industry are (1) direct imports from third countries and (2) the indirect imports to Britain from third countries and their re-exportation from there to this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's diagnosis.  In my view there are two major reasons for the situation.  There is the decline in the <Col N="91" /> level of orders, the decline in purchasing in our export markets and its intensification of difficulties for shirt producers and for comparable industries in every country of the Community and also in every country of the world.</P>
      <P>We have the added difficulty of a rate of wage inflation which is presenting a real problem of cost for our producers.  That, too, is a very major cause of the situation.  Before leaving my office today I prepared notes on 13 separate heads of activity in which we have engaged so as to help the shirt and textile industry, starting with grants, going on to loans, to export promotion, to design service, to management advice through the confidential evaluation service of the NPC, reorganisation studies, to control of South Korean imports, of imports from the low cost areas, to the surveillance mechanism, to the Revenue Commissioners mechanism of intensification of scrutiny of documents, to the EFTA negotiations and to the anti-dumping investigations and the approaches turned down, regrettably, by the European Commission. The efforts to invoke article 135 of the Treaty were turned down.</P>

      <P>The purpose of giving the 1974 figures is that they are the most recent I have.  I talked about the year for which the figures exist.  I do not have figures for this year.  There is no slackening of effort.  While the situation is very serious, it would be much worse without the steps taken. I do not accept that it is hopeless.  The position is difficult but not hopeless.</P>

      <i>Note:</i> Each complaint of dumping made to An Coimisiún Dumpála is examined in the first instance to determine if there is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of injurious dumping.  Where there is such evidence An Coimisiún always endeavours to resolve the complaint by negotiation; only where they have failed to secure the agreement of the party complained of to eliminate the margin of dumping do they carry out a formal investigation.  Formal investigations are initiated by publishing notice of intention to investigate and inviting submissions from interested parties.</P>

We are dependent on other countries not manipulating their dumping protection to exclude our exports.  We have to operate the code.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to what I said in the Dáil on 4th December last when I dealt with this problem in some detail.</P>
      <P>Quantitative restrictions or increased tariffs on imports, which are the remedies most frequently proposed for the present difficulties in various sectors of industry&mdash;particularly in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors&mdash;would be contrary to our Treaty obligations, especially those arising under the Act of Accession to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> In effect, we have to rely on Article 135 of the Act of Accession to the EEC which provides that the EEC Commission may, in the period to 31st December, 1977, authorise us to take protective measures in the event of serious difficulties arising in particular sectors of the economy.  I have made the strongest possible representations to the Commission over an extended period but the Commission has not been prepared to authorise such measures on behalf of our textiles, clothing and footwear industries, because other member States are faced with the same difficulties in these sectors as we are and any concession granted to us could lead to a serious reaction throughout the Community. It is necessary, in this matter, to bear in mind the extent to which the economy of this country depends on exports.  Statistics show that even in the very sensitive sectors mentioned there are areas where the value of our exports exceeds that of imports.  We would, accordingly, be vulnerable to retaliatory action by other States in response to protective measures in our case especially if these measures were taken contrary to the commitments we have entered into.</P>

      <P>The Deputy who put that question, or on whose behalf the question was put, which would probably be more accurate, has not conformed to the Standing Order.  I know the lady Member in question probably has something else to do but I make this point to indicate that, with the exception of Deputy Hogan O'Higgins having come in about one minute ago, the benches opposite have been completely empty during the whole of Question Time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the system of deposits, as distinct from quantitative restrictions&mdash;the system of deposits introduced by the Italians &mdash;was introduced in circumstances where they declared a balance of payments difficulty.  That was under Articles 108 and 109 of the Rome Treaty.  Those are steps that we do not propose to take.  I know of no other steps taken by member States which have not been taken by us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware. The Deputy will be aware that in invoking Articles 108 and 109 what the Italians did they did with the approval of the Commission in circumstances of a balance of payments crisis, which is what is specifically catered for under Articles 108 and 109.  The Deputy will be aware that the damage to this country of declaring a balance of payments crisis where there is not one, for the purpose of protecting certain sectors of <Col N="100" /> our industry, would be much greater than any possible good we would gain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be familiar with the fact that it is difficult to prove dumping into one's own <Col N="101" /> country.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the dates of his discussions in the past six months with the EEC Commission and the UK authorities in connection with the problems facing the footwear and textile industries; the particular aspects <Col N="102" /> discussed on each occasion; and the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I had discussions with the EEC Commission and the UK authorities in connection with the problems facing the clothing, textile and footwear industries on the following dates within the last six months:</P>
      <P>2nd December, 1974 &mdash; Meeting with five EEC Commissioners in Brussels; 9th/10th December, 1974 &mdash; Meeting with EEC Commission task force in Dublin; 14th January, 1975 &mdash; Meeting with Commissioner Gundelach in Dublin; 21st January, 1975 &mdash; Meeting with Commissioner Gundelach in Brussels; 29th January, 1975 and 6th February, 1975 &mdash; Discussion with Commissioner Gundelach; 10th February, 1975 &mdash; Meeting with Mr. Peter Shore UK Secretary of State for Trade in Brussels.</P>
      <P>That was my personal participation but the contacts have been continued at high level in my Department and they are continuing.  The matters under discussion at all of these meetings were the problems of the footwear, clothing and textile sectors, and the measures which might be taken to remedy these problems.</P>
      <P>I have indicated previously the measures which were being taken to help the sensitive sectors of industry in so far as we were free to do so within the constraints imposed by our international obligations.  These include anti-dumping investigations, adjustments of the quota licences for textile piece goods from 16 Far Eastern and Eastern European countries, more intensive checking of imports by the Revenue Commissioners, a restraint arrangement with South Korea in regard to exports of shirts from that country and the early introduction of a formal system of surveillance on imports of certain clothing, footwear and textile goods.</P>

      <P>I heard with some wry amusement &mdash; which did not give me any pleasure &mdash; the speeches from the Opposition with regard to this matter.  I could have taken paragraphs from them and quoted identical arguments which I had made to the Commission and to the British.  It is with great regret that I say the rejection of our approach under Article 135 which was conveyed to me on 14th January by Commissioner Gundelach was confirmed on the following day as the position of the Commission as a whole.  I am familiar with the arguments the Opposition have made.  I made them myself.  I can fairly say there was no point made from the Opposition that I had not used in endeavouring to impress the seriousness of the situation on Brussels and on Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight business missions, organised by Córas Trachtála and aimed at generating increased exports of Irish goods and services, have visited the Middle East in the past six years.  Most of these included Saudi <Col N="105" /> Arabia in their itineraries.  The most recent mission to visit that country returned less than a month ago.</P>
      <P>I myself led the mission to the Middle East from 26th October to 6th November, 1974.  It was organised by Córas Trachtála and sponsored by the Irish Exporters' Association.  Twentyfour business concerns were represented on it.  During my stay in Saudi Arabia I met Government Ministers and leading figures in trade and business circles.</P>
      <P>The Deputy no doubt is aware that since 1972 Córas Trachtála has had an office in Beirut which works for the promotion of Irish exports to the countries of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia.  Irish exports to Saudi Arabia in 1974 totalled almost £1 million compared with the previous highest figure of £384,000 in 1973.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let me finish?  The Minister after his visit to Russia announced he had firm orders for £150,000 after a week.  Having visited Saudi Arabia, and I presume having seen the success of the permanent French delegation in the food market in that country, does the Minister not think we should have similar representation there? Even Australia can export agricultural products to Saudi Arabia.  We are not getting the share we should be getting if we tackled the matter properly and had a permanent mission there.</P>

      <P>If I could get the money I should like to have permanent missions in every country.  We have a permanent mission in that part of the world &mdash; if not physically in Saudi Arabia.  There is a good argument as to whether the Trucial States, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia itself would be the best location.  May I add in defence of Irish exporters and in defence of Córas Tráchtála that since <Col N="106" /> the mission in which I happened to participate there have been three others, one commencing on 13th February of this year, one on 24th April and one on 19th May this year and, while there is not within the confines of Saudi Arabia itself a permanent mission, there is a very vigorous effort to the limits of its budget and its personnel and a very commendable effort by Irish exporters and by Córas Tráchtála in the whole area.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has studied the ramifications of the United States Trade Act of 1974 whereby imports of goods from over 156 countries will be allowed into the United States duty-free and arising from which exports from this country to the United States will be particularly disadvantaged; and if he has taken any steps to seek similar concessions from the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States Trade Act, 1974 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a scheme of generalised tariff preferences whereby most industrial goods and selected agricultural and primary products imported from developing countries will be admitted into the United States free of duty up to certain volume limitations.  It is expected that the scheme will come into operation towards the end of 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> It is not possible to make a clear assessment of the effects of the scheme on Irish exports to the US at present because precise information on the product coverage of the scheme is not yet available.  However, a preliminary assessment suggests that Irish exports to the US will not be adversely affected to any significant extent.</P>
    <P>Ireland is precluded from being designated as a beneficiary country under the US scheme by virtue of certain provisions of the Trade Act. The Deputy will be aware that since 1st January 1972 Ireland has extended generalised preferences to developing countries and is thereby a donor rather than a recipient of such preferences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The last Coalition speaker seemed to imply that Deputy Collins should not have referred to the number of people who are unemployed. He described it as trivialising the Bill before us.  Who is to look after the interest of the massive number of people unemployed at the moment if we are not to refer to them?  Who will ensure that the Government live up to their promises and act in a way that will bring back employment to those people?  I said recently that the Government are doing everything in their power to buy off the unemployed. They are trying to ensure that the amount of outcry is cut to the minimum by giving out the dole.  Surely anybody who has any realisation of the situation must know that they can only go on for so long and that the only positive contribution the Coalition can make to the unemployment situation is to create new jobs for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A type of publicity campaign is going on at the moment implying that people do not want to work, that they are better off drawing the dole and that people actually earn more from unemployment benefit with pay-related benefit than they would in a job.  How many of those 103,000 unemployed would prefer to be working?  What dignity is there in joining a dole queue and drawing unemployment money every week in comparison to going out to work and using your sweat to get a fair return in monetary terms?  It will <Col N="118" /> require much more than money and promises to keep the 103,000 unemployed people silent in future.  The time is rapidly approaching, despite the best efforts of the media to cover up the chinks appearing in the Government, when the people will realise that the Government have been a total failure.  All the promises made before the last election have now been shown up for what they were.  They were only promises.</P>
    <P>Unanimity is growing up among the people that things are very bad but they are progressively getting worse. Scarcely a day passes without a headline appearing in the paper telling us about the closure of an industry.  The normal headline is: &ldquo;A further factory closes down&rdquo;.

It will create a situation where more unemployment will occur.  I do not believe any of us is in doubt about that.  I have asked before in the House what nation can survive on the lunacy of the live now and pay later type of Government we have?  I do not believe it can be denied that in the past two years we have mortgaged our future for the next ten years.  The Government are expending their energies trying to devise new and improved methods of taxing wealth, which is not there.  It is because of the very measures that the Government are now taking that wealth will never be there.</P>

      <P>I sat in the House from 10.30 this morning until 3 o'clock and I listened to every contribution made.  This is the first time, in a reference to unemployment, that any speaker has been reprimanded.  I suggest you are wrongly informed of the situation.  It would be interesting to go back and read the record for this morning if you want evidence. Unemployment is directly related to the imposition of taxation, no matter what type it is, whether it is wealth tax or any other tax.  At a time when a spirit of initiative and enterprise is called for these qualities are destroyed by the introduction of this type of stupid, ideological legislation.  As Deputy Collins said this morning this has been brought about by the Labour Party insisting on being in a position to go back to their people using the slogan: &ldquo;We made sure they introduced legislation which will tax the wealthy&rdquo;.  What a misnomer.  That must be the greatest lie of all time after the 14-point plan.  The people who will be affected by this type of capital taxation are the humblest workers in factories.  People are debarred because of the penal taxation we are about to introduce from using their entrepreneur, initiative and enterprise and the first to be affected are the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far from putting the man they are supposed to be going after out of business they are increasing the dole queues.  We are coming to the stage when those who try to do something constructive are penalised and those who succeed are squeezed.  I can see in operation a frenzied policy of envy, a policy of begrudging.  I challenge <Col N="120" /> any member of the Labour Party to say if anyone of them employs anybody. Do they know anything about how business is conducted, about what is entailed in trying to build up a successful business, about the hurdles and hardships that have to be overcome, about the shortage of credit?  How often do we have employers getting less out of the business than the employees at the end of the week?</P>
    <P>The inevitable result of these type of capital taxation policies will be to kill off any man who is prepared to risk his money in industry, who is prepared to start a new business or to increase his existing business; indeed, who is prepared to invest from borrowed money in the vague hope that at some time in the future he may be able to pay not the capital but the interest.  At this stage in our development national economic leadership was never so badly needed.  At Question Time the Minister for Industry and Commerce pathetically tried to hold a situation that was untenable. Factories are closing down, unemployment is increasing and there is no money for various Government schemes.  That Minister boasted about an export promotion that yielded £150,000.  It was because the Minister led that promotion that it was given such publicity.</P>
    <P>I led an all-party delegation to Libya recently and the orders that resulted from our visit have exceeded substantially the amount the Minister is now boasting of.  It is pathetic that we have a Government who are burying their heads in the sand, clinging to some outmoded socialistic ideology that the wealthy must be taxed so that we will have enough money to distribute.  Last night Deputy Desmond said only a few hundred would be subject to this tax but if this is the case what will be the cost of collecting? What will be the return?</P>
    <P>Near my constituency we had a situation where one of the biggest American companies &mdash; it was rated in the top twenty companies in the world &mdash;was about to start an industry for the manufacture of computers and calculators but because of the attitude of this Government that concern <Col N="121" /> pulled out of the scheme thereby depriving 500 people of jobs.  When I attended the meeting of the southern committee of Cork County Council on Monday we were informed that a crisis situation has developed in the southern committee area where there is a shortfall of more than £3 million. As a result, further jobs are in jeopardy.  This has meant that we have lost 2,000 new jobs which were about to be created in Cork Harbour. This occurred because we did not have the money to put in the proper water and sewerage schemes and the jobs will not materialise.</P>
    <P>The time of the House is being wasted by the introduction of penal legislation at a time when we should be introducing incentives to people to create new jobs.  In May, 103,000 people were unemployed and funds were found to try to buy their silence. However, nothing has been done to try to cure the disease.  As long as public outcry can be bought off until the next general election the Coalition feel they have done a proper job.  The fact that every day that passes we sink deeper into the morass does not seem to matter at all to the responsible Ministers.</P>
    <P>It has become obvious to anybody who studies the political scene that the needs of our economy are totally subservient to the short-term personal political needs of those who govern us.  We have the ridiculous situation brought about by the Minister for Justice in the Seanad who is trying to introduce the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  I do not know what the Minister is at.  What relevance or importance has that Bill now?  Our people are crying out for new jobs but the Government see as their most important function the introduction of a Bill that is meaningless towards the creation of employment.  Maybe, if the British Government cracked the whip and told our Government that they must provide more jobs for our people, as they cracked the whip in regard to the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, we might get more action.</P>
    <P>Individually, the members of this Government are intelligent men but collectively they seem to act like <Col N="122" /> idiots and that is something I cannot fathom.  Surely there is a member of the Government who can use a grain of common sense and suggest that they all get down to the business of running the country.  It is great having the PROs, the publicity, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien and the Minister for Education going on the radio and television &mdash;they are nice and articulate people &mdash;but that is not their job.  Their job is to manage the economy of the country.  If they were to be judged on the results of that management in any commercial enterprise they would not be employed for very long.</P>
    <P>Does anybody care to remember the infamous 14-point plan that was put before the people at the last general election to stabilise prices, halt redundancies, reduce unemployment, and produce a planned programme of economic development?  This must now be one of the sickest jokes of the century.  Our transport and electricity costs have soared, but we introduced capital taxation; our industrial exports for the first time in ten years have dropped, but we introduce capital taxation, the Criminal Law (Jurisdication) Bill and discuss irrelevancies such as BBC 1, BBC 2 and RTE 2.  Of course, this is the smokescreen to hide the reality of what is going on.  It is a pity that we have not on the Government side the late Deputy Sweetman. Whether one agreed with him politically or not one knew that when it came to the business of the country he had his head firmly screwed on.  He would not tolerate the type of messing that is going on now, the type of half-baked legislation we are getting, the type of legislation which is emanating from a shotgun marriage between pink-eyed conservatives on one side and punch-drunk socialists on the other.</P>
    <P>That marriage, like the previous two marriages, will not work out.  Costs and prices are soaring and our workers are being asked to restrain themselves and not look for more wages.  No one can blame the workers looking for more in order to stay afloat, not to mind save or put away for the future.  They need more wages in order to pay for the huge increases occurring daily.  Why did the Government not throw in the <Col N="123" /> towel and say they could not control prices?</P>
    <P>Can we blame the workers for trying to protect their wives and families in a situation like that?  If we were to stop this form of lunacy now, maybe we could make some recovery?  There is some recognition for the first time that we have a crisis on our hands.  I suppose we must be thankful for the fact that recognition has dawned on somebody of the enormity of the crisis. But what are we going to do about it? The Taoiseach who, in fairness to him, was never afraid to speak out the truth, has said we were living on borrowed time and on the goodwill of our creditors.  It was rather significant that this was in the evening papers but was deleted from some of the morning papers the following day.  Maybe somebody in the Government Information Services thought we had gone a bit too far.  However, he is an honest man.  He told the truth.  That is the exact situation. We are living on borrowed time and on the goodwill of our creditors, and unless we pull up our socks immediately, there will be no future for this country.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the town of Kinsale 16 years ago was virtually a ghost town, but because of incentives, encouragement and the building up of the advantages of Kinsale as an area for industrial development, it became a town of full employment.  Alas, in the past two years that town is again approaching the situation of a dead town unless the Government change course and encourage more and more industrialists to set up industry here. It is all very fine to talk about the flight from the land, but unless we can provide industrial employment next door to agricultural employment, then we are going to have this flight from the land.  There is no way in which wealth tax, capital acquisitions tax or capital gains tax will put an extra slice of bread into the mouths of poor people.  The only way is to create new jobs, to give people the opportunity of earning more money, thus giving to their families and to the community a higher standard of living.  The men of 1916 gave their lives in order that <Col N="124" /> we might achieve that.  There are one or two Ministers in the Government who would ask us to forget about 1916, that it was just one big bad dream, that it never occurred.  But that is what those men died for, to give us the opportunity of working in our own country and giving our children those same opportunities.</P>
    <P>What can be done about the situation? It is very hard when you are in opposition to make suggestions to a Government who seem to be totally deaf to the protests that are emanating from all sides about their capital taxation programme.  However, the first thing I would say was vital was for the Government to create a mood of confidence among investors that we are a country who are not going to welsh on any deals or contracts we have entered into, that we are a country where your industry will not be nationalised the following morning, and that we are a country that can supply probably the best and most educated labour force in the world.</P>
    <P>There are things we must impress on prospective investors.  I am afraid we are not doing it.  Confidence seems to be completely lost as regards what is happening in this country.  The Minister for Labour, Mr. O'Leary, said recently:</P>
    <P>The greatest danger of all is that many firms struggling now to keep their heads above water will sink for ever.</P>
    <P>I want to ask him and his colleagues what are they doing about ensuring that these firms which are trying to keep their heads above water will not sink for ever.  Is introducing taxation a method of ensuring that they will not sink?  Is the introduction of a penal system in relation to thrift and hard work and enterprise going to ensure that they will not sink?  I say that it is time the members of this Government, and especially the Labour members, woke up and realised what business is about.  We are told that Ireland's rate of inflation is the worst in the Community. Can anyone tell me what one positive step has been taken to curb inflation?</P>
    <P>The farmer who is the backbone of the economy, under the wealth tax <Col N="125" /> proposals is subject to £1,000 fine if he does not give information on his neighbour.  &ldquo;Spy for us or else you are fined £1,000&rdquo;.  Surely that is going back 70 or 80 years in the treatment of the people, when we ask the farmer to spy on his neighbour, to give information to the Revenue Commissioners so that he can be taxed or he is fined £1,000.  That is a ludicrously stupid situation at this moment of economic crisis.  I suppose that the euphoria of attaining office has not yet given way to the realisation of what government is about, the harsh realities of government, and maybe they are not aware of the facts of our economic situation and what can be done about them.  I think the Government have thrown in the towel and have said &ldquo;Leave it to the PR men.  We pay them enough and we employ enough of them so let them cover for us&rdquo;, and there are many PR people working in the Government Information Service who will have to earn their money if they are to continue to cover up for the Government. The day of reckoning is very close; when the people are going to demand action and not alone action but constructive action by this Government.</P>
    <P>One of the most popular misconceptions about the Government's capital taxation proposals is that they will affect only the very rich, but the contrary is true.  The poor people will be the first to suffer.  The cost of these proposals, particularly the annual wealth tax, will undoubtedly find its way into the prices of various commodities and add to our already crippling cost of living.  Prices are going to increase and workers are going to demand more wages and the cycle will go on and on, all because of the action of the Government.  In so far as these capital taxation proposals inhibit enterprise, they will cause the loss of further jobs, as they have already done, as is evidenced by the results for many of the firms which we discussed at question time; but more important, they are going to hinder the creation of any new jobs, and all this at a time when we have the worst unemployment situation we have had since the last Coalition were in office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> The Government have also refused to build into their proposals an automatic adjustment of the threshold for liability in line with inflation.  One would imagine that inflation did not exist, and yet it is running at 28 per cent per annum at the moment, the highest in any of the EEC countries. The result is many thousands of Irish people who now think these proposals will never affect them will find themselves very shortly caught up in the net, and Deputy Barry Desmond was being honest on the radio when he said that once the principle had been accepted, it was an easy matter after that to adjust the rate, thus clearly indicating to us and the people in the country the danger of this tax.  The slogan of &ldquo;Tax the wealthy&rdquo; is a great slogan but eventually it is going to include practically everybody.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Coalition's capital taxation programme will directly, or indirectly, affect every man, woman and child in this country and that as a result some of them may have to emigrate, others may not be able to go into the type of employment for which they deem their qualifications suitable, and others will have to join the lengthening dole queues.  I have had the extraordinary situation over the past couple of weeks of having graduates coming looking for a job, not a teaching job&mdash;some of them had their B.A. and Higher Diploma&mdash;but any job.  Surely we cannot sit complacently here and look at a situation in which what we consider the cream of our country, on whom there has been a substantial investment by the taxpayers, coming out of our universities and looking for a job.  One person said to me &ldquo;As long as I do not have to queue at the dole office, I will work at anything&rdquo;.  The Coalition Government have a lot to answer for in putting young people in that position.</P>
    <P>Before the last election, there was a great fanfare of trumpets about death duties being abolished.  Everybody took the announcement at its face value and considered that this slogan of the Coalition was one of the principal reasons in rural Ireland for their getting into government.  Nobody <Col N="127" /> ever said then that these were to be replaced by another tax, another form of duty called an inheritance tax.  I would go further and say that death duties being abolished, they have been replaced by three different taxes, wealth tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax, because this Government are so hungry for money that they are just not going to stop at any source where they see any few pounds showing their heads.  We all know that this a most short-sighted policy and a sure recipe for economic disaster.</P>
    <P>What are we going to do about it? Are we going to sit down and objectively examine the details of our capital taxation proposals?  Are we going to ask ourselves if section 2 of the Wealth Tax Bill is really necessary. Is it making any positive contribution to our economic development? If the Government answer honestly it must say that it is not and that in fact the opposite is happening; it is an economic liability.  I have no doubt that the introduction of wealth tax will retard our economic development.  It has already done so as I have instanced.  In our case with an economy so much less developed than in the case of our EEC partners wealth tax is economic nonsense at present.  Whoever in the Government had this brain child should be taken out and shot.</P>
    <P>Some of our wealthiest partners in the EEC have no wealth tax, and those that have operate it on a much more restricted basis than is proposed here.  I cannot think of anything better calculated to inhibit people from investing, taking risks and creating employment than this tax.  Even more important is the effect on foreign investment. Nothing could be more calculated to deter and discourage that type of investment.  Yet, this is what the Government are doing.  Even they must realise that any taxation proposals at this time are undesirable, with inflation running at about 28 per cent, with unemployment about 104,000, an annual increase of 32 per cent in prices and a huge and <Col N="128" /> dangerous balance of payments.  I am particularly concerned that in the past two years our agricultural industry has gone through its worst-ever period.  Many firms are now close to bankruptcy due to shortage of cash and no growth in the economy.  This type of situation demands dynamic leadership from the Government, and we get capital taxation proposals.</P>
    <P>I hear Coalition speakers in this House and at by-elections saying that we have a very serious economic situation but it is outside our control, that it is an imported crisis; yet we are introducing legislation that will compound that crisis and ensure we never recover from it.  The Minister for Finance has adopted a conservative <i>laissez faire</i> attitude towards the whole problem, and instead of tackling our problems he has been spending the time of this House and of his Department on capital taxation proposals which would present problems far worse than those we already have and yield perhaps a tiny revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>We are wasting the time of the House debating legislation such as that now before us.  Fianna Fáil will give all Bills detailed examination and debate, but it is necessary to convince us that the time and energy of the House are not being wasted on matters largely irrelevant to the problems facing us especially in rural Ireland.  The Minister will not even build into the new taxation an automatic adjustment to keep it in line with inflation.  Instead, he says we will review the position from time to time.  Of what is he afraid?  He has already shown that he will not agree with an automatic adjustment for inflation in income tax by means of personal allowances but again he promises a regular review.  If that promise is like the 14-point plan we got before the last election, we know what it is worth.  The result of that dilatory attitude of the Minister is that personal allowances are increased by 15 per cent while the latest yearly figure for inflation shows an increase of 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government's proposals are totally unfair to the self-employed <Col N="129" /> man.  These people trying to provide for retirement in the present inflationary situation are being hammered from every direction.  With the present proposals and the inflation they cannot make any plans for retirement.  It is an impossible situation.  I suppose a wealth tax would make some economic sense in a buoyant economy and would certainly make some sense if productive assets were excluded.  But they are not.  Surely we need to employ productively the maximum amount of assets we can lay our hands on.  Having taxed those assets already the Government, with this legislation, intend to tax them further.  Whether the assets are used productively or not is immaterial to this Government; they are just a subject for taxation. This is economic lunacy where you have an economy which demands more investment and creation of more new jobs.  I do not know how it will end, but I think that rather than having a just society we shall have a &ldquo;bust&rdquo; society.  Nobody will get any pleasure from that.</P>
    <P>We must continue to impress on the Government the dangers in the course of action they are taking.  The managing director of the Bank of Ireland Group has said that loan demands continue to be slack, that they would be underlent during the next six months.  Surely that is one of the most significant statements we have had in recent times.  In other words the money is there but there is nobody to lend it to.  The confidence of the business community has been shattered by the policy of this Government. Business people will not pay up to 16 per cent interest for money that will be eroded by inflation and capital taxation.  Why should they render themselves victims of a bankruptcy court?</P>
    <P>Young people leaving school are facing a dismal future.  The dole queues continue to grow and industries that were founded and nurtured during Fianna Fáil's terms of office are now closing down.  In every Department of Government there is total failure and, as we know, each Department is linked directly with the Department of Finance but in the <Col N="130" /> absence of a thriving economy every Department will be a total failure. Since Fianna Fáil left office in 1973, fertiliser prices, for instance, have trebled and the prices of young cattle are a third of what they were then.</P>

      <P>The farmer is to be the subject of wealth taxation.  Surely his industry is important to him. Although cattle prices are only a third of what they were in 1973, the farmer is to be taxed further at a time when we should be offering him every help possible.  No doubt, in the near future, section 2 of this Bill will apply not only to the big farmer but to the medium-sized and small farmer. Gradually, everybody will be brought into the insidious net of capital taxation. The imposition of this tax will place farmers' sons in an impossible position on inheriting family farms.</P>
      <P>There is the question, too, of those farmers who engage in a small amount of work by way of hire for their neighbours. These people would be taxed both on their farm and on their hire work incomes.  Not only this but the whole system of neighbourly co-operation would be destroyed in this way. Also, farmers will be required, at the risk of enormous fines, to spy on their neighbours, to tell the taxman how many cattle, sheep and pigs their neighbours have and what buildings they have erected.</P>
      <P>A heading in the <i>Farming Independent</i> of May 10 referred to the wealth tax being a big shock and to one man being fined £1,000 for failing to spy on his neighbours.  Surely farmers should not be taxed simply because of the efforts they have put into the building up of their holdings.  Is it right that a farmer's son should be rendered bankrupt as a result of inheriting the family farm?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Lands illustrated last night, he does not understand it either.  If Fianna Fáil were in Government at this time, the Deputy Fitzpatricks would be creating agitation.  We would have a situation where it would be difficult to get in through the gates of Leinster House.  There are no mass demonstrations by the farmers as there were in the Fianna Fáil days although those days were the best that farmers have ever experienced.</P>
      <P>I wonder what has happened to those people who claim to be on the farmers' side?  We might expect our farmers to be treated badly by this Government which comprises a vast majority of city personnel, of persons who have a distinct metropolitan bias. How can they understand what life is like for the farmers?  They cannot know of how difficult is the farmer's life, of how very often he must attend to a cow calving during the night.  At a time when we are introducing a wealth tax the farmer's income has dropped by more than 20 per cent and if we have regard to an inflation rate of more than 24 per cent, we can realise what is the overall decrease in his income.  This proposal is an exercise of cynical power-grabbing by the Coalition.</P>
      <P>The one outstanding success the Government have had is in media control.  They certainly have controlled the media.  They have made sure that anything detrimental to the Government will not be published, that the Government will be projected as a Government of intellectuals, an open Government, a Government with a social conscience, a Government who are united.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very relevant to the Wealth Tax Bill for the reason that during the last election the Coalition Government promised the abolition of death duties but never said that they would replace them by wealth tax, inheritance tax, capital gains tax.  That is the power grab I am talking about.</P>
      <P>This is where the Coalition have been successful, in covering up this type of power grab and the total failure of every department of Government.  I am reminded of the story of the Minister for Love, the Minister for Love being of course Herr Goebbels, Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien himself, who ensures that all we get from the media is love, a representation of a wonderful bunch of fellows doing a great job for their country, making no mistakes, that there is no crisis, that everything in the garden is rosy, that housebuilding is at a record rate, with no reference to the fact that unemployment is at a record rate, that inflation, foreign borrowing and everything else that bodes ill for the economy is at a record rate.</P>
      <P>I suppose the Government believe that by the management of the news media they can bluff the people into believing that any little success they have attained is due to the celebrated brilliance of the Government and that the fact that the whole economy is crashing about their ears is due to outside influence.  The truth is slowly dawning on the more observant that everything in the garden is not rosy and that in spite of the Tullymander of the constituencies the next election will be the Waterloo of the Coalition Government.  We have an obligation in this House to expel those political pirates who got in under false pretences in 1973, before the country is brought to its knees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As representatives of our people, we cannot let the occasion pass without referring to the dismal record of the Coalition in relation to the provision of new jobs.  I want to know why a town like Dunmanway was not given an industry despite promises by Coalition Ministers that it would be given an industry.  I want to know why Dunmanway has not got an industry to <Col N="133" /> absorb the male unemployment in that town and why that town has been discriminated against by the Government. If employment is not provided in rural Ireland there will be an exodus of the rural population.</P>
    <P>Submissions have been made by groups as to the effect the wealth tax will have on business.  These groups, who are politically independent, have demonstrated clearly to the Minister for Finance that the course being pursued by the Government is one of disaster, especially for family owned firms.  Family owned firms which comprise the majority of firms in the country and which provide the major proportion of employment will be crucified under this penal legislation. What is needed now is a regeneration of the confidence necessary for family owned firms to expand their businesses. The best way that that can be done is by dropping these stupid proposals, by doing the big thing and the decent thing, acknowledging that a mistake was made in introducing these proposals, that they were introduced in the euphoria of winning an election and that the Government did not realise what they were doing.  The Government should drop these proposals now.  In this way they will be doing a public service.  If the Government do not drop these proposals, it behoves every businessman, every farmer, every self-employed person to unite and to organise for the purpose of opposing this legislation because their future is doomed if the legislation goes through.  We have to fight this Wealth Tax Bill if the Government will not acknowledge its shortcomings.  We have to ensure that voices of protest go out from Parliament against it and that the people learn that its implementation will spell economic disaster for the country.  We want a just society.  We do not want a &ldquo;bust&rdquo; society. Having regard to the attitude of the Government, it is more likely that we will have a &ldquo;bust&rdquo; society.</P>
    <P>The rate of wealth tax in a country like Denmark, for instance, is 0.9 per cent above the threshold and this rate is reduced if taxable income is less than 6 per cent of taxable net wealth <Col N="134" /> and if there is no taxable income the net wealth tax is reduced by 80 per cent to an effective&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We had the appalling spectacle of the Minister for Lands coming in here this morning when he was forced to contradict what he said last night because he did not understand the Bill.  Yet he had the audacity to tell somebody else he did not understand the Bill.  He has not been in the House when we discussed it and I doubt if it came before him at cabinet level.  Now he is being given the information about the thresholds in the various countries by a civil servant. The ignorance of the Minister in relation to this Bill has been more revealing than anything else here.  It should be a mandatory exercise for every member of the Coalition to come here and listen.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a situation where unemployment is at its highest level and where factories are closing daily.  We have a government who want to close more factories.  We have their stooges behind them, smiling their way through it all.  The attitude is that the situation is critical but not serious.  It is time the Government woke up and put the interests of the country before their own interests.</P>
      <P>It might be asked what else we could expect from a Government who are mainly Dublin-based politicians. They could do with an injection of a few rural-based Deputies who might put some common sense in their meditations.  I fear for the economic future of the country.  I have seen no indication that the Government have taken even one positive action to curb inflation and to create jobs.</P>
      <P>One Minister told us about 16,000 new jobs but he said in a whisper afterwards that 24,000 jobs were lost, leaving a nett loss of 8,000 jobs.  The economic indicators are that by the end of this year between 150,000 and 160,000 people will be unemployed but the only contribution we can make to the situation is to introduce capital taxation.  We are proposing to tax the people who may be our only salvation and who are the only people capable of creating jobs.  The Government's policy is to tax them until they have no money left for industrial expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It grieves me to see what is happening the country.  No politician likes to have people come to his clinic every week looking for work.  As far as the public are concerned, we are the people who are running the country and they hold us responsible for the economy. Because of the massive cover-up exercise by the public relations men in the Government Information Service the facts have not permeated to the ordinary people.  However they will do so, and when that happens we must look out for sparks because sparks will be flying.  Shortly after that the Government will have to give an account <Col N="137" /> of their political stewardship and I will be very surprised if the answer is not a vehement and adamant rejection of that account.</P>
    <P>I hope the gloomy future I fear will not materialise.  I hope there will be sunshine in the future but I do not see it.  I do not see any Minister trying to convince me there is any sunshine on the horizon and I despair of this most of all.  When these people who should know the situation and who have all the facts at their disposal say nothing they imply that they see no hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Much propaganda was made of the fact that we must tax the wealthy and that they will be the only people affected by this tax.  I hope I have demonstrated that every man, woman and child will be affected by this insidious tax.  The Minister for Lands described this as innocuous.  If it is innocuous why bring it in?  We have shown that this legislation will be harmful to the economy.  If it is innocuous why not withdraw it?  But, no. This Minister like his Fine Gael colleagues is a prisoner of the Coalition ideology, an ideology that was outdated in the 1930s, so-called Socialism.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had their way we would have a Socialist State here in which wealth tax would not pose any problem because every person would be doing what we are asking the farmers to do now, spying on each other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keeping to it. I know it is painful for Deputies opposite because under this section we can highlight the dismal performance of the Coalition Government and the economic ruin they have wrought, and the introduction of another piece of legislation is a smokescreen which may work temporarily but will not work in the long term.  We have the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with his BBC 1, 2, 3 and 4.  He sees the need, being a good politician, to divert people's attention away from realities, and so he gets them discussing television instead of the mismanagement of the economy by the Government.  As far as we are concerned, we will ensure that the mismanagement of this Government is highlighted and that we do not have a situation in which the dole queues are numerically bigger than the number of people in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the purpose of this section to abolish private property?  That seems to be the long-term aim of the Government. I am surprised at Deputy Esmonde and others falling for this. Deputy Dockrell had the guts to speak out and say truly what he thought about the Bill.  I am surprised Deputy Esmonde and others are not equally vociferous in their condemnation of this effort at abolishing private property. That is the fundamental issue. Many people in the past made the supreme sacrifice to ensure our right to private property.  With the introduction of this Bill we may well find ourselves with another kind of landlord. <Col N="140" /> Why should we adopt that attitude at this point of time?  Why do the Fine Gael members of the Government allow it?  Some of them are as convinced as I am of the right to private property and the necessity for a free enterprise economy.  We know all Socialist systems have failed because the only way in which they can be maintained is by a secret police force, by armies, by censorship of the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly what I am talking about.  I hope Deputy Esmonde has guts to come back and support his colleague, Deputy Dockrell who told the truth about the Bill and who sees the implication of what it is about.  We will have a socialist state. This is what the minority in the Government want.  The minority are the controlling body of this Government. They want farmers to spy on each other and they also want the people to spy on each other.  That is the only way a socialist system works.  We should reject that system because it has proved to be unworkable in all the countries it has been tried in.  It was as outmoded in 1930 as it is now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a Government of so-called intellectuals introducing this type of legislation, which will do away with the right to private property and which will eventually do away with the free enterprise system.  What Deputy Desmond said was true, and we know he is a confirmed socialist.  He said on Radio Éireann that once the principle has been accepted it is an easy <Col N="141" /> matter to adjust the rate afterwards. This clearly indicates the danger of this wealth tax.  We might say that only the wealthy farmers will be affected now but next year it will be the less wealthy, the year after others will be affected until eventually everyone is brought in under the socialist umbrella.</P>
    <P>We have a Government of intellectuals with their roving ambassador, Dr. Garret FitzGerald going all over the world solving everybody's problems but ours.  We have Ministers concerned with everything else except the economic plight of the people.  We do not hear any of them referring to the 104,000 in the dole queues because that is bad publicity.  That is not what our PR men want us to talk about. They want us to talk about airy-fairy theories.  They do not want us to get down to the nitty-gritty job of creating employment for the people and creating the right for them to have a job.</P>
    <P>A Fine Gael Member said here a few years ago that governments have no obligation to create employment for the people.  Fianna Fáil say they have an obligation to create employment, that the people have the right to employment and the right to a job they are suited for.  I am afraid it is hoping for too much that the Coalition will take any notice whatsoever of the pleas coming from this side of the House. Maybe our pleas will be answered by the people through the ballot boxes in the not too distant future.  They will give the answer to the Government's pathetic attempts at government during the past two years.  I want to quote from the Official Report, Volume 278, No. 10, column 1543 what Deputy Bermingham said on this Bill:</P>
    <P>I feel the Minister has not gone far enough in the wealth tax.  He should have gone higher than 1 per cent.  I believe he is on the right road and that at least he is trying to show that the Government are determined to be fair in regard to the taxation system.  When the White Paper was issued it was stated that the rate would be 2½ per cent. Several representations were made to the Minister and he has now <Col N="142" /> come up with what he considers to be a fair assessment at 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>That is a very significant paragraph from the speech of Deputy Bermingham. That is more or less the statement of Deputy Desmond.  He said: &ldquo;Once the principle has been accepted it is an easy matter to adjust the rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are now getting to the kernel of the issue.  This is the brainchild of the new republican labour party of 1975. They want to tax the wealthy.  Deputy Desmond comes in and says there are only a few hundred of those people and asks what all the furore is about.  The Minister for Lands tells us it is an innocuous Bill.  If it is who is pushing him into supporting it and, as a member of the Government, being a party to its introduction?  I believe there is something far more insidious involved than the mere introduction of a taxation Bill.  I believe there is a complete new principle in relation to the Government of the country involved in this, which is taking away our rights to private property and the continuance of the free enterprise system.</P>
    <P>I am a dedicated supporter of the free enterprise system.  I do not come from a wealthy family.  I have not inherited wealth and I do not have somebody who can come along and give me £40,000 or even a much smaller sum.  I come from working class people.  The only system that I know that is right is the free enterprise system, not the system of communism which ensures that anybody who wants to become a tool of the state can be the same as the man who is working the hardest for that state. Of course, it is because we on this side of the House are the products of working class homes in the main that we are concerned about the employment situation of working class people on the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We all know that the wealth tax <i>per se</i> is not going to affect a couple of hundred people as suggested by Deputy Desmond.  Those people will get out fast and take their wealth elsewhere.  Those who will be affected will be the people who would be employed as a result of the utilisation of that wealth of the couple of hundred <Col N="143" /> mentioned by Deputy Desmond.  We have the worst taxation record in Europe and foreign industrialists are deterred from coming here.  This is happening at a time when we should be encouraging not alone the utilisation of our investments and capital but the inflow of capital necessary for the creation of new jobs.  We should be making efforts to attract capital investment instead of putting obstacles in the way of those anxious to invest their money.</P>
    <P>As a result of all this local authorities will not be able to carry out many of their schemes.  There will be no inflow of capital with the result that they cannot borrow.  We cannot condone mad cap legislation that will put so many jobs in jeopardy.  Are the Government united on this or is it like the Contraceptive Bill that we will have some Members voting with us against this legislation?</P>

I challenge the members of the Government party to speak on this Bill, and not be hiding so that we know and, more important still, that the people know, exactly where we stand in relation to these proposals.  We say the effect on employment will be disastrous.  It will mean the closing down of factories, and the loss or curtailment of many jobs.  The future is very bleak unless the Government drop this illtimed and ill-conceived Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I should like to intervene for a brief period for the purpose of putting the record right with regard to a few matters.  First, in connection with the liability to wealth tax of companies established here by foreign companies, Deputy George Colley yesterday afternoon read into the record a letter from Mr. Frank Reilly dealing with the tax as it applied to companies or industries established here by foreign companies.  He was dealing, in fact, with companies established here by United States companies, and that is clear from the letter.  Apparently Mr. Reilly thought, and Deputy Colley thought, that such companies would be liable for wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat now in the clearest possible terms that companies established here by and owned by foreign trading companies are not liable to tax.  Assume for one moment that company A, a United States manufacturing company, set up a business or factory here.  The company here, B, is incorporated here.  The shares in Company B are held by the United States company A.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Company A is not liable for tax here. Trading companies, whether Irish or foreign, are not liable for wealth tax. The shares in the United States company which, in turn, owns the Irish company, are US assets in the hands of the shareholders of the US company. These shareholders are presumably citizens of the United States and no question of tax can arise.  I think <Col N="145" /> it necessary to put that on the record, because the debate has gone on here all day on the basis that such companies are liable to tax.  I want to state in the clearest possible terms and beyond yea or nay, that they are not so liable.</P>
      <P>The second matter I want to deal with is the point made today on a couple of occasions that this tax will affect small Irish family business.  It is true that the shares in Irish trading companies are liable to tax.  The companies as such are not liable to tax, but the shares held by persons in trading companies in Ireland are liable to tax if they are held by persons domiciled and ordinarily resident here. However, those shares are liable to tax only if the person exceeds the threshold, which for a married man is £100,000, plus a house.  If it is a family business, it is most likely that shares would be owned by, say, a father and an adult son or maybe two adult sons, and each would have a threshold of £70,000 if the person was single, and £100,000 if the person was married, plus a house.  That is why I describe the tax as an innocuous tax, meaning to convey that it would hit very lightly on anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter is that Deputy Crowley sought to strike fear and terror into the farming community. He did very fairly say that it was strange that there was no protest from the IFA.  I stated that the IFA obviously understood the Bill and knew there was no fear in it for farmers. A farm does not become subject to tax unless the farm, stripped of the dwellinghouse and every hoof of stock on the farm, is worth £200,000, because for a married man the threshold is £100,000, and the farm is taken at 50 per cent of its value up to £200,000.  In fact, if you take the dwellinghouse and contents into account, you probably put the threshold at £150,000, and a farmer would want to have a farm of about 300 acres. Furthermore, Deputy Crowley spent quite an amount of time saying to the House and the country that under the Bill, if it was enacted as at present, a farmer&mdash;and he emphasised &ldquo;farmer&rdquo;&mdash;could be fined up to <Col N="146" /> £1,000 if he failed to spy on his neighbour. That was never the effect of the Bill.  There is a clause that requires people in possession of books, records and so on, meaning accountants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the position, and that is why I think it is unfair of Deputy Crowley to try to misrepresent the position and mislead the people.

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Crowley's contribution to the debate on section 2 and I agree with him totally with one exception.  The exception is that Deputy Crowley suggested that, because this is mainly a Dublin-based Government, a certain type of mentality brought forward this Bill.  I want to come to the defence of the vast majority of Dublin men and women, because I know <Col N="147" /> them as reasonable people with an intelligent approach to economics, be it home economics or national economics. I know they will dissociate themselves completely from this legislation and would not have brought it in in a million years.</P>
      <P>There is a rare breed in the Government that in no way represents the mentality of the Dublin man and woman.  Anybody with the slighest bit of economic sense will realise that this section, which is giving power for the introduction of the Bill, will have the effect of destroying confidence in the business community and in the farming community and destroying confidence generally in the sections of the economy that produce wealth and provide jobs, and that all this legislation will do is to further exacerbate the situation by causing further unemployment and further raging inflation. All of this is being done to bring in a miserable £3 million.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act and any regulations thereunder, with effect on and from the 5th day of April, 1975, a tax, to be called wealth tax, shall be charged, levied and paid annually upon the net market value of the taxable wealth on the valuation date in every year of every assessable person and the rate of tax shall be one per cent of that net market value.</P>
      <P>This is socialism with very sharp teeth, and when you go on to read how the net market value is calculated under section 8, you find it is stronger than socialism and is heading for the realms of communism.  I believe fully in a free enterprise society, but what this Bill is trying to achieve by backdoor methods is half way to communism. It panders to the most base instincts of man for cheap party-political motives, suggesting that if your neighbour is working hard providing a better standard of living for himself and his family, and if you do not feel like working you should get a share of what he produces.  This can only be described as the politics of envy.</P>

      <P>Just to wind up, I must say that the contents of a letter I received today from the Minister's Department show no great relief for the footwear industry and the outlook is very bleak.  It was only in December last that his Department made any effort at all to counteract the countries that were dumping in cheap footwear into this country.  That was as a result of constant pressure from this side of the House.  We impressed upon the Government that this would have to be counteracted and, if not, a very serious situation would arise.  It has now come to a doomsday situation as far as the shoe factories are concerned.</P>
      <P>I regret to have to say it is a very serious situation and if something is not done immediately, then I can see nothing but collapse for the whole shoe industry in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the very serious situation that arises in the constituency I represent in relation to the boot and shoe industry and the textile industry.  Traditionally, my constituency <Col N="149" /> has been associated with textile manufacture for very many years and I want to refer to the very serious position which exists in Tullamore where the only worthwhile industry, textiles, now finds itself in the most serious situation since it was established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I think Deputy Flanagan may not understand&mdash;it is a footwear motion we are on, not the textile motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I was interrupted, I was endeavouring to point out that the town of Tullamore finds itself in this very serious situation in relation to the textile industry. I would make a very genuine appeal to the Minister to take some action in regard to imports.</P>
      <P>In relation to the footwear industry, which is of equally serious consequence to the town of Edenderry as the textile industry is to Tullamore, we find, that due to imports, the shoe industry there is in its most serious situation since it was established.  I can recall many years ago when there was a thriving footwear industry in Birr.  That has disappeared.  It disappeared during the administration of Fianna Fáil.  It is right that this should go on record.  While the footwear industry disappeared completely and entirely in Birr, due to the inactivity of Fianna Fáil, we now find the Fianna Fáil Party making pleas to the Minister to take the very steps in relation to Edenderry which they failed to take in relation to Birr some years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a practical side to this.  Politics ought not to be played when it comes to the livelihood of so many workers.  In a town such as Edenderry where the shoe industry has been part and parcel of the life of the town, where the workers are traditionally skilled in the production of first-class footwear efforts should be made to safeguard the employment of these workers.  It is hardly necessary to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that many of these workers who are now faced with unemployment and redundancy and many of them who have lost their <Col N="150" /> jobs are at an age at which it is impossible to have them trained for any alternative employment.  The desire of every public representative is to see all industries thriving.  There is a duty on all Governments within the EEC to take the necessary steps to protect as a sound national investment the industries which we have.</P>
    <P>In relation to the footwear industry, some practical steps must be taken to curb the imports of footwear. We have a duty to protect the jobs of our own people and to keep an industry which is making a very worthwhile contribution to the local economy in an area like Edenderry and the other areas where the position of the footwear industry is causing great concern.  I am deeply alarmed by the situation that exists in relation to the industry in Edenderry.  I would highly recommend the proposals made by the trade unions representing the workers in the footwear industry.  We cannot remain idle, despite our obligations to the EEC, while our own workers, in a worthwhile industry such as the footwear industry, are facing redundancy.</P>
    <P>Our leather industry is closely linked with agriculture from the point of view of the raw material, the hides. I have every confidence that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will, at the earliest possible date&mdash;if he has not already done so&mdash;consult with all the EEC clients and explain clearly and emphatically the case in regard to our boot and shoe industry.  We all want this industry safeguarded and protected.  While you have imports of cheap foreign footwear these are likely to cause further and serious unemployment among those engaged in the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>It is not outside the bounds of possibility that as a result of proper negotiations and making our position clear, the whole situation could be improved.  We must stress the value of an important industry in an area in which there may be no alternative employment.  We must also realise the necessity to keep active, alive and intact a worthwhile native industry.  As I have said, it has connections with the tanneries, with securing and saving <Col N="151" /> hides and it is of vital importance that we should make a serious effort to make the footwear industry secure so that those employed in it will not have the threat of redundancy hanging over them.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, those people who have invested their money in the boot and shoe industry and who are shareholders of various types are entitled to look for some hope of security.</P>
    <P>The serious plight of those engaged in the industry in Edenderry and in other parts of this country has been pointed out and I want to assure the Minister that the case that has been made by the trade union representing the workers and by the boot and shoe manufacturers has not been exaggerated. We realise that since we are part of the EEC there may be many difficulties preventing the Minister from taking the steps that he would like to take in order to protect an Irish industry, but we must make crystal clear to our colleagues in the Community that concessions must be given.  If concessions are given there is an obligation on us to protect the jobs of our own people, to protect the money that has been invested by the shareholders in the footwear industry, which has served this country nobly and well since it was originally established. The Minister is as interested as any of us in this House in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that he will take the necessary steps to see that the jobs of those engaged in the industry will be safeguarded and that he will not allow factories to close down completely as a result of permitting the free entry of foreign footwear, not alone from EEC countries but from outside them.  These imports are causing considerable inconvenience and disturbance and putting inferior goods on the market.  Our footwear industry has gained world-wide recognition and can certainly boast of putting on the world market an article of which Irish industry in general can be rightly proud.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to note my concern because I realise the circumstances of the workers of Edenderry.  I share <Col N="152" /> the sentiments that have already been expressed by other Deputies in relation to this matter.  It is a matter in which there is no room for playing politics: you cannot play politics when the jobs of our people are at stake. This is a time when we should all cooperate, all join together and if there is any assistance or co-operation which we can give the Minister it should and must be given to him in order to strengthen his hand abroad that he may obtain the approval of the other EEC member States for any action he may take to safeguard the footwear industry. Unless some steps are taken by the Government the future is bleak not alone for the workers who are employed in it but also for the shareholders who have invested their money in the industry and also for those connected with the tanneries and the sale of oils in this country.</P>
    <P>I am very discouraged and perturbed about this situation.  That is why I am adding my voice on this motion.  I have every confidence in the Minister's ability to make it very clear that it is our duty to protect our native footwear industry and that all we can do will be done to safeguard jobs and to endeavour to bring back into productive employment those who have already lost their jobs in that industry. I fail to understand why, when we have such an excellent home market, the footwear industry should have been sabotaged by the import of inferior footwear from countries outside the EEC.  We cannot close our eyes to these facts: action must be taken and the sooner the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Lastly, may I appeal to the Minister to solicit the co-operation of trade unions and those primarily interested in and concerned with the advancement and the promotion of Irish industry in encouraging our own people in so far as is possible to buy Irish and leave the foreign articles on the shelves.  It is our duty to do that. I feel that the Buy Irish campaign has not caught on.  Why, I do not know. Perhaps it requires to be brought more forcibly home to our people or perhaps we have lost pride in what our own workers can do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> I ask the Minister to renew his efforts in regard to the campaign for the promotion of Irish footwear.  The jobs of our people are at stake and due to these imports the trade is in a very precarious position.  Nobody wants to see factories close because of the serious loss of employment for so many people.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to interest himself actively in this matter and to see whether there are any further ways in which action can be taken to restrict imports or if he can impose a high rate of levy on such imports. Something will have to be done and the sooner it is done the more secure will be the workers in the footwear industry.  There will be scope for further investment in industry by people who desire to invest money in such a project.</P>

      <P>In speaking in support of this motion my mind goes back a little over six months when we debated a similar motion.  On that occasion the motion read: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to protect the footwear industry in this country.&rdquo;  Prior to and during the course of the debate on that occasion we got the impression that the Minister was not aware of the serious consequences which beset the footwear industry.  In the course of his replies to questions he stated that he had arranged for a task force to come here from the EEC to examine the footwear industry.  At that time we understood that it was going to be dealt with as a matter of urgency but we find, six months later, that instead of an improvement in the situation it has deteriorated considerably. In no area has the impact been felt so much as in the area which I represent, and particularly in Carrickmacross. We are very, very concerned about the plight of the industry there.  We had a factory which employed more than 200 people; distress signals were flying six months ago and a couple of weeks ago the crunch came and the factory has now gone out of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we in the northern part of County Monaghan thought of Carrickmacross <Col N="154" /> we always considered it a part of our county in which there was ample employment, and for many years there was full employment. When the late President, as Minister for Health, came to visit his constituency to speak at functions or at Comhairle Ceanntair, we always impressed on him the necessity for the establishment of additional factories. It was his proud boast on many occasions that there was not one employable person on the dole in Carrickmacross. There was also work available for women who wished to obtain employment.  In fact, we had not got enough workers for all the work that was available so we had mini-buses and coaches transporting women into the factories at 4 o'clock to work until 10 o'clock.</P>
    <P>When we look at the picture at present, on Friday, 30th May, the number of people registered as unemployed in Carrickmacross was more than 500.  This is the change which has taken place in a short time in the north eastern part of the country.  At one time there were some 900 people in industrial employment in the Carrickmacross area and advance projections were for an additional 200 jobs. This, of course, has not materialised and we now have the situation where there are 500 people signing up in a small town with a population of 2,000. That is a sad reflection on any Government; it is a sad reflection on any Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputies representing the area joined with others interested in endeavouring to right the situation.  I would ask the Minister not alone to give assistance and to impress on the IDA the urgency of getting those footwear factories reopened, but also to fufil the promise to start up additional industries.  We were promised a factory of 10,000 square feet, but a factory of this size would not be large enough to absorb all the unemployed. This should be treated as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>Government speakers are giving the impression that there is no hope for the footwear industry nor, indeed, for other small industries.  If there is no hope, it is because of the Government's <Col N="155" /> failure to take the necessary action.  There is evidence that small industries in the North are coping better with inflation than are the larger industries.  The chief executive officer of the local development association in Northern Ireland stated quite clearly in a letter a few days ago that the smaller companies there are better able to cope with the present economic situation than the larger ones. When one keeps in mind the particular problems of Northern Ireland arising from the troubles during the past four or five years, it can be realised what a severe test they were for industry.  The chief executive officer says that the small companies have flexibility and effectiveness which give them a better chance of survival.</P>
    <P>Last night here the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that at various times in the past many people had warned of the dangers from free trade competition that were facing the footwear industry.  It was known that most industries would have difficulties. Our industries always have problems.  They have faced many difficulties since they were set up in the thirties by the late Seán Lemass. Dealing with problems is a normal part of industrial life, but problems should be dealt with by the Government. It is their function to meet these problems.  If the Government are not equal to the task of attending to those problems, the natural thing is for them to move over and let those who solved problems before, those who had the capabilities and who have the capabilities yet, handle the industrial problems.  The Parliamentary Secretary last night went back to the early sixties relating the troubles that would beset the footwear industry.  He gave statistics.  In 1973 when the Coalition Government took office our exports of footwear were in the region of three million pairs.  It has been reduced by 50 per cent since that.</P>
    <P>He asked us to clarify our intentions as to whether we would break the rules.  He threw the challenge over to us last night.  I should like to say to him that Italy at the time they broke the rules had an inflation rate <Col N="156" /> of 24 per cent.  Now their rate of inflation is considerably reduced while we have climbed to the top of the inflationary league table.  He said that about 76 per cent of the footwear was coming from the UK.  When challenged on this he said it was coming in by the back door, that it was production from countries outside the EEC.  It is the responsibility of the Minister to ensure that our markets are not lost and that our workers do not suffer by the imports to this country via England from countries outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>Twelve months ago the Minister had been pressed to take action on this matter.  At that time he claimed, and I suppose he will claim again here tonight, that it was in Brussels and the EEC that the problem originated. He rejected the suggestion of a restriction on the importation of cheap footwear from countries outside the EEC and said that it would be a bad thing to take unilateral action or to look for special conditions for our footwear industry.  Those are the words the Minister used on the last occasion, although England, France, Germany and Italy have all taken unilateral action.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance some time ago did not balk at twisting the regulations regarding the EEC Regional Fund or that seemed to be his intention.  This would indicate that other members of the Government may feel like giving this twist to a regulation when it would suit them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a great deal of talk here last night by Government spokesmen about rationalisation of the industry and the failure to adapt in time to the EEC conditions.  The truth is that it is not EEC produced footwear that is creating the greatest problem for this <Col N="157" /> industry.  That is accepted.  It is cheap footwear from countries outside the EEC.  I am not satisfied and I think very few people in the constituency that I represent are satisfied that a sufficiently strong case has been made in Brussels for the protection of the footwear industry.  The footwear industry does not object to competition. There seemed to be an implication or a hint by Government speakers that the industry did object to competition. The industry has been meeting keen competition on the home market and it has been selling abroad against stern competition for a long time.</P>
    <P>There is another charge that I would reject very clearly, that is, that the workers in this industry are not competent and capable.  While Government speakers have stopped short of putting the blame for the state of the industry on the workers, the inference is there in their speeches.  I claim that they are competent, capable workers.  In many cases there is a family tradition of working in the industry.</P>
    <P>What do we get from the Government when we point out the obvious that not alone have some footwear factories closed, the remainder on part-time, but that the industry is in danger of disappearing completely? All we are getting from the Government are sympathetic sounds, nothing concrete and nothing definite, to help the industry over this period.  It has been asserted by people in the business that before long, probably within 12 months, many of the ills and problems now besetting the industry could very well have disappeared because of the total disappearance of the industry. In that case we would be at the mercy of foreign producers.  We would find that people would have to pay much more for their footwear than they do now.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dwelt all the time on the sixties and seventies, on what should have been done when Fianna Fáil were in power.  The footwear industry has to meet new challenges.  There are new trends in design.  The Minister is naïve if he thinks that anyone will believe that <Col N="158" /> if there was a problem in the industry in 1960 it did not surface until 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The speakers on the Government side seem to be in a desparate scramble to avoid blame for the death of this industry.  They do not worry whether it dies or not but they would not like to be made responsible for the death at the inquest.  They would now like, as they did last night, to try to channel the blame to a party who were aware of the position, who took steps to foster industry, who under the leadership of Seán Lemass ensured that we were fast becoming one of the greatest industrialised small nations in this part of the globe.  The blame must certainly lie with the present Government for their failure to tackle this problem 12 months ago when the signs became first apparent.</P>
      <P>Not only is there that sad situation in Carrickmacross but I do not think Monaghan is getting a fair share of the cake from the IDA at this time.  I have made this case for Monaghan regarding industrialisation on a number of occasions.  I made it when the IDA representative was present at a meeting of Monaghan County Council and no serious attempt was made on that occasion to refute the facts that I listed. I would say now to the Minister that we will have to have immediate action if the footwear industry is not to collapse completely.</P>
      <P>The Minister will probably say that we are making a case for the survival of an industry and for aids to an industry without putting forward an alternative.  I think that an alternative and recommendations for the salvaging and alleviation of the footwear industry were put forward.  The unions who put forward those recommendations felt that they did not get the sympathetic consideration which they deserved. They were listed on a previous occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The managers or owners of factories <Col N="159" /> in the shoe industry claim that a lot of the problems they are facing have been due to the increasing costs and enormous overheads which they have had to meet over the past number of years.  A number of those overheads were because of lack of action or by the Government allowing those massive increases in the ESB and CIE charges, in postal charges and insurance&mdash;in many cases it was 40 and 50 per cent of an increase.  That is what the men who over the past number of years have been endeavouring to keep the industry going had to contend with.</P>
    <P>There was no genuine effort made to implement the recommendations that were submitted to the Minister, that all imports of footwear from outside the EEC should be curtailed. There is still this flow of footwear from England.  The second recommendation in the submission was that imports from inside the EEC countries should be in line with exports from Ireland in the preceding year. In the context of 1975 we would expect that the year 1973 would be taken, in which there were 3.1 million pairs, or 35 per cent of the total Irish market.  The people in a position to know claim that had the Minister been able to ensure that this export market in the region of 3.1 million had been kept at their disposal they would not face the problems that beset them at present.</P>
    <P>The journal <i>Business and Finance</i> referred to the Minister's speech in the Dáil where he referred to inefficiency in both the ESB and CIE.  He is quoted as saying that one must ask in the event of over-manning whether one wishes that there be a reduction in the labour force at this time.  He said he did not think the Opposition wanted that because if there is any reduction in the manning level, extra charges will be put on social payments because people will be out of work.  He said that if one situation is balanced against the other it can be seen that it is cheaper to maintain people in employment in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in the <Col N="160" /> context of that statement to make an effort to salvage not alone a third of the jobs in Carrickmacross but to salvage 100 per cent of the jobs.  The feeling in that area at present is that a slip was made, that there were grants available to set up training factories.  It was availed of by the firm of Armagh Shoes.  I believe that some of the employees in the Carrickmacross area may be seeking employment there.  There were substantial EEC grants available for setting up factories on a short-term basis at least as training factories, and it is felt that even at this late hour he should look into that matter to see if there is any possibility of assistance being got from the EEC to set up a training factory in Carrickmacross.</P>
    <P>Mention was made by a previous speaker regarding the amount of hides.  We seem to be in a very advantageous position in this regard but we do not seem to be making any use at all of this raw product which is essential to the footwear industry.</P>
    <P>On 10th December, 1974, I put down a question to the Taoiseach about the amount of hides that were processed here and the amount of hides which were exported unprocessed. His answer on that occasion was that the raw hides salted and dried comprised 14,238,000 kilos, pickled or limed hides 194,901 kilos and leather 5,372,913 kilos.  That was happening in a time when we were exporting about two-thirds of the raw hides being sorted and dried.  In a time when we had tanneries lying idle in Monaghan, when we had another tannery in need of development, not alone from the point of view of floor area but also from the point of view of equipment at that particular time we had those hides being exported and, in many instances, the leather was being reimported later.  That is one matter I would ask the Minister, in the light of the serious employment position at the moment, to take into account and ensure that raw hides are not exported but are treated here at home and converted into leather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to try to put the situation, serious as it is, into context because I understand, I think, the desperate plight of the people unemployed in the footwear industry.  I understand it also from the point of view of an Opposition and, while it provides an admirable opportunity for thumping the Government, there is a danger of doing damage by exaggerating the actual situation.  He is here to hear me say it, and I want to quote chapter and verse; Deputy Connolly last night fell into that because the danger is that one creates such a state of despondency in the industry itself that there is a drying up of investment and a drying up of confidence which can be desperately damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said, for example, that imports were accounting for 70 per cent of the home market.  I have to tell the Deputy seriously that&mdash;it is not my figure; it is a Departmental figure&mdash; his figure is much too high but imports have grown much too rapidly. I accept that, but my figure is less than 60 per cent; it is 57.3 per cent in fact.  That is one example.  Let me give a second example from the same speaker on the matter of employment. I am not trying to minimise the seriousness of the situation but I want to try to put these figures to which Deputy O'Malley made some reference a minute ago, into context because we had a progressive development of free trade.  In 1969 there were 6,161 people in employment in footwear and by 1973 that number was down to 4,900.  The drop had been of the order of 1,200 people.  The drop from 1973 to now is less than that.  Deputy Connolly said there were 6,000 in 1973 and 3,000 now; he suggested a halving in those years.  The figures I have&mdash;they are not mine; they are official figures&mdash;show that there were 4,900 then and there are a little over <Col N="162" /> 4,000 now.  I know that some of those are on short time but, nonetheless, that indicates that employment in the industry did not halve.  It fell from 4,900 to 4,000, which is much less than the Deputy suggested.  My purpose is not to try to minimise the difficulty but to try to put into context the real situation.  If Deputy Leonard says anybody on this side is suggesting there was no future for small industries, or for the footwear industry, I do not think that that suggestion was made and Deputy Leonard should not put words into our mouths.  Nobody on this side of the House ever expressed that opinion.  It seems to me a false and dangerous opinion.</P>
    <P>In regard to the immediate prospects of the industry too, there is danger. Very briefly I want to quote from the April issue of the monthly industrial survey of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  This is the reply of businessmen about their own businesses. They may not be hard statistics but they are a very useful guide to attitude.  But the months of production ensured in the leather and footwear industry there was .4 months in February, .8 months in March, 1.1 months in April.  I believe there has been a subsequent deterioration in that trend which was almost three times as much time and production ensured in April as in February, but I am suggesting that over those three months there was actually a little bit of improvement.  I do not want to overestimate that but let us, please, on both sides try to put the thing into context.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to a speech that contained many errors.  It was a serious speech by Deputy Faulkner. I do not have the Official Report but I have the transcript in unfinalised form from the Editor's office.  I want to refer to it but the quotations will not be from the Official Report and so I cannot give a volume or a column number.  I shall be referring to a number of things he said because there are very profound and fundamental misapprehensions of quite a serious kind.  Whether generally held or not, it is still damaging to have them bruited abroad.  I quote:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> The Minister is apparently satisfied that his only contribution to the help of this industry is to say that the EEC rules are there and he can do nothing.</P>
    <P>That is a travesty of my belief and it is a travesty of what I ever said about the industry.  I want very briefly, indicating concern, to try to outline the range of activities.  I will come back to this business of the articles of the Rome Treaty and of our Accession Treaty later on, but now let us try to give some sort of indication of the scale of action and the scale of concern.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about the matter of grants and to say, by way of a reply to Deputy Leonard again, though I am not at the moment going to deal with his speech, that there is no limit to the grants available to the industry from the IDA.  There is no limit to the training grants.  They have to be applied for by viable entities.  But we have put no limit and the whole finances of the IDA and AnCO and all the rest of them are there to help the industry with viable enterprise.  I want to put that on the record.  In fact, the adaptation grants outstanding at this time are almost £¼ million, re-equipment grants from the IDA.  These are not grants for new industry but to help existing industries.  Adaptation grants outstanding are almost a £¼ million.  Re-equipment grants are fractionally under £½ million and that does not include another category of grant that I will talk about later.</P>
    <P>In regard to loans, there are, of course, substantial loans from Fóir Teoranta also but I simply mention these as an indication of the scale.  The loans for existing trading firms are more than £½ million, £600,000 from Fóir Teoranta out at the moment. People may think that is not enormous, but it relates to an industry giving employment to just on 4,000 people.  There are, therefore, substantial commitments of public money.  I simply put that on the record as an indication of concern and commitment. Other things are available.  There is IDA, SFADCo and so on; there are those services and grants and loans <Col N="164" /> and Fóir Teoranta moneys.  There is the very profound and admirable effort all over the world of Córas Tráchtála continuously available to generate exports at a time when one half of the difficulty is that demand in the markets that we export to is shrinking very rapidly.  There is a magnificent effort and, of course, I want to reiterate, that is available to the footwear industry and is being utilised by the footwear industry, not with as good results as we would wish but certainly with some results.  That is on the effort.</P>
    <P>The commitment of money and personnel to CTT is greater than it has ever been.  In the matter of footwear, of course, the whole business of design is extremely important, and mention has been made of the design quality.  We are in an area here where things change very quickly, where there is an extremely labile movement of fashion and where, in practice, small units have great difficulty in anticipating changes.  I am not commenting on quality.  The quality is very good but to keep up with the latest moment of fashion is very difficult.</P>
    <P>There is a subsidised design facility available through Córas Tráchtála and the Footwear Fashion Institute.  I do not want to dwell on this.  I just want to indicate that it is there and it is a commitment.  In the National Productivity Committee there is a confidential evaluation service, which is offered to small businesses on a confidential basis, which is a management advice service to enable them to try to identify their difficulties and to overcome them.  If that identifies a weakness there is the technical assistance grant which is 50 per cent of the cost of a consultancy, aimed at improving financial management, marketing, design, productivity and all of the other aspects.  This is a continuing service.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the surveillance mechanism.  There are two parts to this, one of which is the mechanism operated by the Revenue Commissioners.  Companies have to obey the rules formally, but the Revenue Commissioners have been doing an extremely meticulous job since it <Col N="165" /> was requested of them, in verifying documents, seeing the necessary documentation is scrutinised, is provided and is in order.  In addition, we have now the introduction of the surveillance system, which was not introduced as quickly as I would have wished, but it did have to have the approval of the commission.  We have now implemented it and the goods subject to surveillance may only be imported on an import document. The import document must be made on the appropriate form.  The application must be made in respect of each consignment proposed to be imported. A separate import document is required for each consignment.  The appropriate invoice and certificate of origin in respect of each consignment must be produced with the application. At the introduction of the scheme there will be a mechanism to avoid disruption.  Import documents will be issued automatically to correspond with the application form unless there is a reason for doubting the honesty and accuracy of it.  This is a surveillance mechanism as rigorous as any that exists in the Community.</P>
    <P>I will come back a little later on to articles numbered by various Deputies and I hope I will give them their right numbers when I come to them.</P>
    <P>Deputies may believe me or not, but I am solemnly putting this on the record of the House after careful checking and careful scrutiny.  Last night Deputy Faulkner said that the simple facts are that not one of the EEC countries adhere strictly to the rules when their own vital interests were at stake.  I want to say, formally for the record of the House, that there is no example of a member of the Community breaking the rules for more than a matter literally of days or a very small number of weeks before instant retaliation has taken place and the matter has been resolved.  There is no instance where the rules were broken and that party was unpursued by the authorities of the Community and left with that situation continuing. There is no instance of it.</P>
    <P>We may talk briefly of what the <Col N="166" /> Italians did.  The Italians introduced an import deposit scheme but they did it invoking Article 109, which deals with the balance of payments crisis and they were entirely within the rules.  The French tried to do something recently about wine and the book was thrown at them.  They undid it, again within a matter of days.  I repeat that that statement, widely repeated and widely believed, is simply not true.  If Deputies do not believe me they can go to other sources of information which they may think less biased than I am.  I have found that the rules are not by-passed and ignored by the member states.  They are very rigorously upheld.  This is simply a matter of fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner came back to the matter of Italy and talked about Roy Hattersley, and he said that Italy was not pressed for the full implementation of the regulations.  In invoking Article 109 in a balance of payments crisis Italy was within the rules of the Community.  Why do we not adopt a similar attitude to that adopted by Italy?  I quote from this unrevised text.  Because we do not have a balance of payments crisis.  I hope the Deputies on the other side of the House are not suggesting that we have. If they want to make that suggestion, or want to suggest that we pretend that we have a balance of payments crisis for the sake of invoking Article 109, I hope they will ponder on the repercussions of that on the economic health, and on employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I want also to mention the suggestion last night in regard to the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, and I am quoting: &ldquo;The British did not like the re-imposition of the quotas, and they told us so, but the industry got from the decision <Col N="167" /> the boost it needed&rdquo;.  Any fairminded person reading or hearing that sentence could only conclude that the re-imposition of the quotas by Ireland at that time was unilateral against the wishes of the British.  I want to say for the record that that interpretation of what Deputy Faulkner said is not true.  It was done with the agreement of the British after discussion.  That is a matter for the record.</P>
      <P>Mention was made of our dumping laws and it was said that they needed further scrutiny.  We are operating under dumping laws&mdash;I am not criticising them; I am just putting it before the House&mdash;introduced and passed by our predecessors.  I would say, in praise of them, that they went to the limit, in drafting and framing these laws, of what was possible in the light of our international commitments under GATT.  Every country would like to fiddle the dumping laws to protect its own industries, their international guidelines and international rules.  We have to obey them under GATT and we now have further commitments.  Our predecessors in Government went to the limit in their anti-dumping legislation of what was permissible under our international agreements.  I praise them for it.  Those are the laws that I am trying to operate and I cannot make them any stiffer within the guidelines of the international game in this matter.  I am operating them to the full.  It is not a matter of unilaterally making them tougher.  We are operating under what was a reasonable piece of legislation which we cannot make any harder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a quotation, again from the French Premier, suggesting that something remarkable was being done by the French, but the French are doing exactly what we are doing in this context.  What did the French Prime Minister do?  First, he affirmed the important role of the textile industry. We have no quarrel about that.  He then said that the French Government would press the EEC to conclude a bilateral agreement.  What do you think every country in the Community has been doing?  We have <Col N="168" /> given the right to conclude agreements with third countries from the individual members to the Commission and they guard that right very carefully.  Individual member states cannot conclude agreements with third countries.  I say that as a matter of fact.  If the Deputy does not believe me, if he thinks we can make direct approaches to these countries, will he please verify the facts?  He then urges them to get on with it.  Everyone has been urging them on, in their agreement with Taiwan, in their agreement with Hong Kong, in their agreement with South Korea.  We got an intervention because we thought the agreement with South Korea was going to take too long.  We got a special arrangement for Ireland.  Of course, he can urge them to get on and make this bilateral arrangement that will help us all.  We can concur. I can say &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; to the French Prime Minister.  It does not matter a bit.  He said&mdash;I am quoting Deputy Faulkner again&mdash;&ldquo;what prevents us from adopting a similar attitude to the French in relation to our footwear and textile products?&rdquo;  We have a similar attitude to the French.  The French are not doing things in this difficulty and neither are any of the other member states.  They are not doing things that we are doing.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Articles of the Treaty of Rome and of our Accession Treaty.  In Article 108 of the Rome Treaty, if people read the opening sentence of it, they will see that it is inappropriate to the circumstances we are in.  The opening sentence from the official text of Article 108 of the Rome Treaty reads:</P>
    <P>Where a member state is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments,</P>
    <P>People must be quite clear that they want us to declare that and must face the repercussions of what it does to our employment, our industry in general, our freedom of action and our overseas borrowing.  I suggest that we do not want that.  Article 109 refers to where a sudden crisis in the balance of payments occurs.  That is the opening line.  Articles 104, 108, and <Col N="169" /> 109 are not appropriate, I assure the House.  The other Article mentioned is Article 135 of the Accession Treaty. Article 135 (2) states:</P>
    <P>On application by the State concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, determine without delay the protective measure.</P>
    <P>I have gone to them under Article 135 and they have told me, to my great annoyance and disappointment, firstly, that the Commissioner was responsible and then reiterated the next day that it was the will of the Commission as a whole that there was no mechanism there that we could invoke.</P>
    <P>That does not give me any pleasure, but I am telling it as it is.  People have to face the consequences of asking us to invoke these in circumstances that could only produce wreckage, chaos, damage to our industrial exports, and foreign relations. We need desperately the goodwill of the importing countries, and they can give us a much greater thump than we can give them.  The same size of reduction might be tiny for the British market but might be enormous for our market.  We can get a casual belt from some of our important importing countries that could do terrible damage to our exports and employment. It will not make any difference to them because our section of their trade is so small that they can do it easily, but it really hurts us.  Do not ask for that lightly, but if this is being asked for in a deliberate and conscious way, please read the rules, please talk to the Commission.  Do not take my word for it if it is thought I am hanging in the traces and do not want to act or have not tried to act. Do not believe me, but for God's sake do not ask us to invoke mechanisms that will come back on top of us and damage us.  I know the Opposition do not wish it, but if that is done lightheartedly we damage our standard of living and we do not get anything that is any good.</P>
    <P>In regard to our Buy Irish Campaign, in the pre-Christmas situation we had a short-term Buy Irish Campaign, not on a large scale.  I felt that <Col N="170" /> for many years we had buy Irish campaigns and everybody wanted them.  I do not want to make a political issue of this but people were a bit cynical and hopeless about them and did not think they would work.  They felt it was a reflex ritual thing to be done when one could not think of anything else to do.  It is a serious thing, and I got a small committee of very good people who took some months to study the matter and recently gave me a good report.  I want to pay tribute to a number of individual sectors which are carrying on their own work but that is not the concerted campaign.  It has not petered out because I could not launch it until I got serious thinking about the way to get at all the purchasing sections of the community such as industry, farmers and retailers who were never approached before.  It is not a Government scheme.  It is not my scheme, but we got some good hard working thorough people to think about it very hard.  I got a good report and I believe that, if people do not knock it, and put it down, we can have it endlessly continuing, because we need it in the Community, a deeply researched Buy Irish Campaign. I do not like that name but I have not thought of a better one.  I do not want to hear it knocked and I do not want the people to say that the brief thing just before last Christmas was the Buy Irish Campaign.  It was not.  It had not been researched and organised then.  I do not want it thought that that was the result of the labours of the people who worked so hard and well.</P>
    <P>Dumping has been mentioned.  On 10th January I referred the matter to An Coimisiún Dumpála and I say, with great regret but not with great surprise, that An Coimisiún Dumpála got all the information they possibly could and they came to the conclusion that the available evidence does not substantiate the allegation of injurious dumping by the countries concerned. The Commission pointed out that footwear imports from the countries alleged to be dumping represented only 5.59 per cent of the Irish market.  For individual countries the market was much less, generally below <Col N="171" /> 1 per cent.  In other words that mechanism is not a serious mechanism. I accept the seriousness.  I am not now uncovering piece by piece a package though I am profoundly convinced that in regard to the industry and inflation a package is necessary.  I affirm that, though I am not now uncovering the bits of it piece by piece.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech we heard from the Minister is a disappointment to say the least.  We have been told nothing that we did not already know.  The speech in its tone and content is very similar to the speech which he made here in the House on a similar motion on 4th December, 1974.  The thinking of the Minister, and the Government, obviously has not developed in any way since then.  Since then a lot of our footwear factories have closed down. The most recent one was reported in yesterday's papers, Donaghy's of Drogheda are in liquidation after having an enormous loss, so much so that not alone will the shareholders get nothing but the unsecured creditors will not be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Limerick was once a major centre of our footwear industry.  The last remnant of it, Limerick Uppers Limited, is closing next month and the last 85 workers left there are to be let go.  They are the sort of things that are happening.  The position is the same in Edenderry, Dundalk and Carrickmacross.  I was in Carrickmacross less than two years ago&mdash;at the election to the Presidency of Erskine Childers&mdash;and I visited two shoe factories.  They were bursting at the seams and were tremendously prosperous. There were hundreds of people working in them.  I remember being conscious of the fact that there was such a vast number of people in what I thought were rather small and old fashioned factories; a tremendous air of prosperity; and that was only November 1973.  Not one person is working today in the footwear industry in Carrickmacross.  The Minister tells us all the same things and the gist of his story is the same as it was on <Col N="172" /> 4th December last and it is to the effect, that if we had never joined the EEC we would not be in this trouble.</P>

The EEC have all sorts of rules and regulations which stop him doing anything about it and remember I told you not to join the EEC, seems to be his attitude.</P>

The Minister alleged that Deputy Colley misquoted the Taoiseach.  The Minister was partially right.  Deputy Colley did slightly misquote the Taoiseach; in fact, in a significant way he misquoted him, because what he said the Taoiseach had said in relation to the EEC he had said in relation to the OECD, which is not nine countries but 24, as the Minister well knows.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister be good enough to cease interrupting me and I will read the precise quotation from the address by the Taoiseach, Mr. Liam Cosgrave, T.D. at the annual dinner of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry at the Burlington Hotel on Thursday, 23rd of January, 1974, page 4:</P>
      <P>We shall have to balance the national books by a phased reduction in our balance of payments which, relative to GNP, is now the highest among the OECD countries.</P>
      <P>The highest among 24, all the EEC countries being also in the OECD. There is the Taoiseach of this country, the Leader of the Government of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is a member, and he says we have the most serious balance of payments deficit in the OECD &mdash;24 countries all over the globe, and according to the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the same Taoiseach's Government we have no problem at all.</P>

      <P>Therefore, we have proved by the very words of the Taoiseach himself that the sort of conditions which were necessary to enable Italy to take the measures she did exist here in this country at the present time.  Nonetheless, the Minister refuses point blank to take those measures.  It is interesting to see an article by Paul Tansey in <i>The Irish Times</i> of today on this very question. It is headed: &ldquo;How beneficial are Import Controls?&rdquo;  It describes, in particular, the success of the Italian scheme which they undertook on the strength of their poor balance of payments, which proportionately and as a percentage of their GNP was less serious than ours is at present.  It is interesting to read in that article how extremely successful it was, how GATT found nothing wrong with it, how the EEC apparently found nothing wrong with it, and it brought tremendous benefit to Italy.  Let me extract a couple of short quotations from it:</P>
      <P>Italy introduced a system of import deposits affecting imports from all sources in May, 1974.</P>
      <P>Later in the article it says:</P>
      <P>The Italian scheme was abolished last March, but it has played a not insignificant part in improving Italy's economic performance, a performance that is now being referred to as Italy's economic miracle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The article then goes on to set out the figures in relation to our balance of payments and to show how very bad <Col N="175" /> they are, how extremely serious they are and proportionately worse than Italy's at the time she had to introduce the special import deposit scheme.  The article ends up and I quote the last paragraph.  I am sorry I do not have time to quote more because it is very interesting and helps in a substantial way to make the case we are endeavouring to make in the course of this motion and we endeavoured to make six months ago:</P>
    <P>In view of these circumstances it is difficult to envisage any of the international economic organisations objecting to the introduction of some form of import restrictions by this country, at least on a temporary basis.  The time is opportune to introduce them now as part of the economic package currently being considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>That is absolutely true.  There is no question about it.  Still we have a reluctance to act.  If the action we had advocated in December, 1974 had been taken, look at the difference it would have made to this industry, to the clothing and textile industries. Look at the factories that would now be open that are not open; the people who would be in employment now that are not in employment.  Still we got tonight the very same speech from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that we got on 4th December, 1974, namely, the EEC is to blame for the lot: &ldquo;Only for them and their rules and regulations I could do something about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think we have proved conclusively by using the very words of the Taoiseach that if the Minister and the Government have the will and the desire to act now, they can do it.  The figures are there to prove it and the Taoiseach's own words are there to prove it.  I am afraid they have not got that will or desire.  At least one member of the Government is prepared to let this industry and other industries like it go down and down and down, as they have over the past six months.  If they deteriorate at the same rate as they have since we had this motion down last December over the next six <Col N="176" /> months, then there will be no footwear industry in six months' time, and let us face up to that fact.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the situation in relation to buy Irish, and Deputy Faulkner had very strongly recommended this in his speech last night, as he did in December.  The Minister tried to justify the fiasco that the so-called Buy Irish Campaign of last December proved to be by saying that there was no work or feeling put into it in the past, that it was not to be regarded as a proper campaign and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In column 971, Volume 276, of the Official Report of Wednesday, 4th December, 1974, the Minister, in reply to the very same point by Deputy Faulkner, said, and I quote.</P>
      <P>The planning is reasonably well advanced and on next Wednesday morning we will be able to launch formally something that is reasonably well planned, which is realistic and involves wide sectors on the question of &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It was the greatest fiasco of all time. I think they gave this unfortunate committee £2,000 and told them to do the best they could, and the whole thing fizzled out in a week or two. We heard nothing since but the Minister told us today that no planning or thinking went into that, but there are his words of 4th December, 1974, to prove the situation beyond all doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard that the French Government are doing no more than we are doing with this new production that came out today, these two statutory instruments.  The French Government have had this surveillance method in operation from, as far as I can ascertain, 1971, when the first of the directives was passed by the Commission.  In case anyone thinks <Col N="177" /> that these two regulations, which the Minister made on 30th May but to which he did not refer or publish until today&mdash;for some reason presumably connected with this debate&mdash;are a control on imports, they are not because the licences must be given automatically. Everyone is entitled to get a licence so long as he fills in the form correctly.  There is no reason to believe that these two statutory instruments published today and coming into effect tomorrow will have the slightest effect except that those who were wary about filling in the forms will be delayed.  Otherwise, under the Community directive licences must be issued within eight days and nothing can be done about that.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for Industry and Commerce assumed office there has been in that Department a general feeling of inertia and of indecisiveness. With particular regard to the Minister it has been a constant repetition of <Col N="178" /> vacillation, inability to make up his mind about anything.</P>
    <P>Six months ago the Minister was urged to take action in regard to the footwear industry.  He has done absolutely nothing since and factory after factory has closed.  Still, even today, with the facts staring the Minister in the face, he tries to prove by juggling figures around that the facts do not exist and that they are figments of Fianna Fáil imagination.  The Minister is vacillating and he will continue to do that until there is no footwear industry left.  If the rate of decline over the past six months continues the situation of not having a footwear industry will be reached.  If it is any consolation to the Minister, he will then be able to go along&mdash;with his own reasons&mdash;and tell the people concerned that it was all the EEC's fault, that is was the EEC which they joined that let them down.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Wealth Tax Bill, 1975: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Private Members' Time I was making the point that the Wealth Tax Bill in its present form is, first of all, pandering to the lowest instincts of man with its suggestion of a share of the cake without working for it&mdash;in other words, the neighbour who would rather look at the man next door working to improve the lot of himself and his family while he himself does nothing and at the same time expects a share of the profits from that man's labours.  I do not think anyone would like to see that situation, except the Government that we are unfortunately saddled with at this time, a Government who are pandering to this type of base instinct for nothing but low, cheap, party politics.</P>
      <P>The people are more intelligent than this regime suspect because the people can penetrate this pretence of sharing out the national cake in equal slices.  They know that without incentive and without giving a man an opportunity to provide employment for others, there will be no wealth in this country.  It is about time we nailed the lie that this measure will affect only a couple of hundred people.  This Bill knocks jobs; it knocks jobs at present and it will knock jobs in the future.  It knocks jobs that were already lined up.  It will chase industries away from us and discourage those who are prepared to invest to provide extra employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestions made by Deputy Barry Desmond last night that it is only a fiddly little Bill, that it only affects a few people are wrong.  This Bill hits every man, woman and child and despite the public relations operations of this Government, they cannot hide this from the people. Some months back they said the Wealth Tax Bill would share out the wealth of the country equally among the people.  We knew then that this was a false promise and a false proposal and despite the best efforts of the Government Information Service to hide the true meaning of the wealth tax proposals from the people, they realise that if any tax proposals <Col N="181" /> are put forward which rather than being an incentive, are a disincentive, they will stop employers and industrialists from expanding their businesses and will stop other people who are prepared to open up industries. It will hit jobs and will hit every man, woman and child in this country.  All we have to do is look at the figures.  What is happening at the moment?  There are more than 104,000 people on the live register. A large proportion of last year's school leavers still have not got jobs but the fact that they never got jobs means that they are not included on the register.  I would estimate that at least 20,000 people still have not got jobs.</P>
    <P>There are 50,000 unfortunate school leavers at present sitting for their examinations.  They have been studying hard for five years and as if they had not enough worries heading into their Leaving Certificate examination they have the extra worry of where they are going after they finish in a fortnight or three weeks' time.  Where are they going to get the jobs?  That is another 50,000 on top of roughly 125,000 at the moment.  Even the most conservative of economists at this stage are estimating that we will have more than 160,000 to 170,000 unemployed in autumn or early winter. That is 170,000 plus the school leavers.  We are talking about the sort of figures which one finds it difficult to talk about because they are so desperate and so terrifying and the effects, social and psychological, are so appalling to even think about&mdash; figures of around 250,000.  We are only a State of about 3,000,000 people. Then we have the party of the Left, the party of the people, the new republicans of 1969.  They have forgotten about it at this stage because &ldquo;republican&rdquo; is a dirty word in the mouths of some of the Ministers on the other side of the House.  They do not like to mention the word because they think 1916 should never have happened.  The Chief Whip of the new republicans, Deputy Barry Desmond, said last night that this is only a fiddle diddle of a Bill, that it will only affect 200 or 300 people.  We are talking about nearly 250,000 people.  The <Col N="182" /> Minister for Lands says it is an innocuous sort of a Bill which is not causing any harm one way or another. It is a Bill that goes part of the way towards causing an unemployment situation in which nearly 250,000 people will be out of work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond is a Labour member and in the tradition of Connolly and Larkin I would have expected him to be on his feet attacking the whole concept of any legislation which would cause further unemployment at this difficult time in our history.  I would have expected him to be voting with us tonight on our footwear motion because of the death pangs and the death rattle of the footwear industry but he was not voting with us.  He was telling us that he was going to support a Wealth Tax Bill which is based strictly on the policies of envy and has no relation whatsoever to basic economics.  Wealth tax is only one part of a trio of Bills.  No package could be more designed to exacerbate an already appalling situation in employment and in the economy generally.  This Government have taken up the time of this House during the last number of months with no other Bills except the Racing Board and a few other minor Bills. Where is there one job being provided in those three taxation Bills?  In relation to a letter read into the record by Deputy Colley, the Minister for Lands went to great pains to emphasise to foreign industrialists that they would not be liable for wealth tax because, assuming the parent company is based outside the country, they would be excluded.  Assuming the subsidiary company is an Irish registered company you would be paying wealth tax on the shares of the company based in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Minister will have plenty of opportunity to reply.  I will make my point in the meantime.  Are we to have a situation whereby an Irish industrialist is to be penalised for investing money in an Irish company while a foreign industrialist will escape scot free because of the fact that he is a native of another land?  Do we want to see ourselves in this situation?  We are an independent State but listening to some of the speeches of some of the Ministers one would not think so.  We are not mirrors which must reflect all the errors of that section of land which is across the Irish Sea.  If the Government of today had their way we would be tied to them.  Deputy Desmond came in here last night praising Denis Healey, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for his wealth tax proposals. Who in his right mind in any country at the moment wants to be associated with the legislative proposals of the UK Government?  Deputy Desmond seems to think that they were the greatest thing since fried bread.  Ask any man, woman or child anywhere and they will tell you that the UK at the moment is in an appalling state because of the very proposals which Deputy Desmond told us here last night would only affect a couple of hundred people and not to worry if Fianna Fáil tried to protect the rich&mdash;a lie and it is time that that lie was nailed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we should be trying to follow the proposals of Denis Healey or anybody else on the other side of the water when we see the <Col N="184" /> sort of mess they have got themselves into over there.  They got into that mess through the very type of policies and suggestions that are being put forward by the Government, the type of wealth tax proposals, the politics of envy as I keep referring to it and that is all you could refer to it as.</P>
    <P>Some of the countries in Europe have a wealth tax but to assume that we are of the same development standard as they are would be a gross misuse of the imagination.  We are in the EEC with nine countries.  Instead of proposals of a kind which will make us equally unattractive to industrialists, we should be offering every incentive to home and foreign industrialists to provide jobs, to create employment, to create wealth.  The late Seán Lemass, God be good to him, had an old saying that in a rising tide all boats rise.  If there were a strong economy here, strong employment and investment, everybody would get a share of the national cake. With the growth of the cake, the share would get larger.  But you have a situation here where you have a contracting economy, demonstrated by the statistics, and consequently the share becomes smaller.</P>
    <P>We are not at this stage in our history ready for a wealth tax.  In my opinion we will never be ready for a wealth tax.  I am opposed to the basic principle of a wealth tax.  But allowing for the Government's opinion that a wealth tax is necessary some time, this is the wrong time.  It is the wrong time in the wrong place, as the song goes.  We have an under-developed economy, an economy which is contracting and there is a proposal from the Government to bring a wealth tax into that type of situation which will further exacerbate an already appalling unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>What should we be doing?  There was great talk at the time of the election about abolition of death duties and it was going to make us a very attractive proposition to industrialists and to people with money that they would not have to pay death duties.  That was, of course, a hollow promise.  It was removed in May and the inheritance tax was sent <Col N="185" /> in in its place together with a wealth tax and a capital gains tax.  The argument made for the abolition of death duties applies with greater force for not introducing a wealth tax.  Leaving aside the wealth tax as it is introduced here with its penal clauses, of getting neighbour to tell on neighbour, and commissioners knocking on your door because they do not like the way you comb your hair or something else, the situation is that we are one of the weaker countries in the EEC with the highest rate of inflation.  A number of years back, the Irish papers talked about the rate of inflation in Italy and the lira going into crazy tailspins.  Of course, with the Government Information Service that we have one does not read of that sort of thing now in the context of Ireland because it does not make nice reading.</P>
    <P>We should be making ourselves the most attractive unit within the EEC for foreign industrialists to come in but the packages produced by the Government are doing the direct opposite.  We are becoming less attractive day by day, further exacerbating the unemployment situation. Nobody wants to see a deterioration in the employment situation despite the snide suggestions on the Government side when any of us speak about it that we are prophets of doom.  If you include graduates and school leavers together with those on the live register, there will be a quarter of a million people unemployed before Christmas.</P>
    <P>What have we got as Government proposals to deal with this situation? We have spent months talking about Government taxation proposals but there has been no incentive offered to anyone to come in and put a few bob into the country and get a factory going.  It is all knock, knock, knock&mdash; the politics of envy.</P>
    <P>I can excuse the Minister for Lands &mdash;I knew him first by reputation and I have known him since I have come into the House.  He is an honourable man and he represents a party that have in the past supported the traditions of free enterprise and private <Col N="186" /> enterprise&mdash;a mixed economy.  I can have sympathy with the Minister for Lands because he is in a situation where the tail is wagging the dog.  If the Fine Gael Party do not agree with the propositions put up by the Labour Party the Coalition will fall apart and no longer will there be ministerial cars. I am not saying the Minister for Lands is anxious to hold on to his portfolio for the sake of a State car. That would be unfair to the man and I do not want to be unfair to him because I appreciate he has the best interests of the country at heart.  But, having the best interests of the country at heart, I would appeal to him and his colleagues in Fine Gael, to forget power just for power's sake and to think of the country.  I am sure in his heart of hearts the Minister for Lands realises that at this point in time the best thing for the country is that this proposal for a wealth tax be torn up and thrown away and to invite in foreign industrialists, to let home industrialists invest again and continue to expand rather than stand still as they are at present.  They should be given an incentive to invest money and to create jobs.  Then we will all be well off.  An unfortunate Fine Gael Party is being led by the nose by the left wing operators of the Labour Party.  There are many honourable men in Fine Gael who do not like to see what is going on, including Deputy Dockrell who has already spoken on this proposal.</P>
    <P>In the year 1975 discussion should be about inflation and employment If the Dáil is to have any relevance whatsoever to Irish life in 1975 its relevance must be to create extra jobs and eliminate the curse of inflation. If we are to judge from the legislative proposals of the Government they do not know inflation exists and they are unaware that we are heading towards a situation where over a quarter of a million people will be unemployed.  What they are talking about is &ldquo;take, take, take&rdquo; from the section of the community who are prepared to invest their money and to create jobs.  What are they getting in return for all the disruption and the problems they are creating for <Col N="187" /> the business section of the community? I quoted a figure earlier of £3 million but I understand the Minister for Finance has quoted a figure nearer to a £1½ million.</P>
    <P>I have the report of a Dublin County Council meeting of 9th June, 1975, and it is related to the case I am making.  The council currently have overdraft facilities totalling £2 million.  Revenue accounts for £1 million and capital another £1 million.  The accommodation on the revenue account is required to carry the expenses pending the receipt of the rates and payment of recoupable items, mainly Road Fund grants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act and any regulations thereunder, with effect on and from the 5th day of April, 1975, a tax, to be called wealth tax, shall be charged, levied and paid annually upon the net market value of the taxable wealth on the valuation date in every year of every assessable person and the rate of tax shall be 1 per cent of that net market value.</P>
      <P>The suggestion is that we impose a tax.  Having imposed a tax we are entitled to ask where the tax money will go.  The document I was reading was the report laid before the county council.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our cash position has recently been worsened by the failure of the Board of Works to release a loan of £1½ million due on the 3rd June, 1975, against our Small Dwellings loan application of £7½ million for <Col N="188" /> the first six months of this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is talk of raising £1½ million.  If we had a strong buoyant economy rather than an economy which is suffering under the threefold burden of a wealth tax, a capital gains tax and inheritance tax, a situation would not exist where the Government were not able to pay £1½ million which they owe to Dublin County Council under the Small Dwellings loans scheme.  A situation would not exist where the county council would have to borrow another £1 million on an overdraft.  We have the ball at our feet.  All that is required of us is to kick it over the bar. We have a strong potential for foreign investment and for investment by our industrialists.  What incentives are there when a Wealth Tax Bill, a Capital Gains Tax Bill and an inheritance tax are imposed on us?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands has suggested that it is an innocuous tax.  It is a &ldquo;fiddle diddle&rdquo; tax according to Deputy Desmond, and affects only a couple of hundred people.  It is chasing money out of the country; it is preventing money from being invested here; it is preventing investment by people within the country.  Every £ that is not invested in industry is one more job lost.</P>
      <P>Where will the school-leavers sitting their Leaving Certificate at the moment go?  Where will they get jobs? Where have half of them gone from last year?  Where are the 105,000 people on the live register at the moment?  What is the Government's suggestion?  It is a Wealth Tax Bill. A tax on what?  There will not be any wealth left in the country if the present trends continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not kid ourselves: the Government have the strength to put this <Col N="189" /> Bill through.  They have the numbers to walk through the lobby and vote against us.  They will force this Bill through&mdash;not Fine Gael&mdash;but Labour, and Fine Gael are to blame for going along with them.  The damage will have been done and the taxes will have been charged.</P>
    <P>Will the industrialists not pass on this tax in price increases to the housewife who is already overburdened with price increases?  Of course they will. They will not just accept a wealth tax each year and say: &ldquo;That is unfortunate, that is out of our profits&rdquo;. They will pass it on to an already overburdened housewife who has to face the increasing possibility of her husband being out of a job.  The Minister and Deputy Desmond can politely tell us: &ldquo;It will only affect a couple of hundred people&rdquo;.  To use Deputy Desmond's suggestion: &ldquo;fiddle diddle&rdquo; for that suggestion.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the unemployment problem there is also the inflation problem.  When this taxation is passed on to the housewife and the consumer generally it will cause extra inflation. <i>The Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, June 11th, carried a heading: &ldquo;Secret Plans on Inflation&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Cabinet Letters to Both Sides&rdquo;.  We should have sent them on a copy of the Wealth Tax Bill.  That would have sorted it out. At a time when the Government are issuing secret letters trying to curb and cut back on inflation they are introducing legislative proposals which will further aggravate an already difficult situation.  There is nothing in the threefold package we have before us that will not create further inflation.  Inflation is directly related to unemployment. The higher the inflation rate the higher the unemployment rate.  We have the highest inflation rate in Europe.</P>
    <P>The catchword at this time, with the problems of inflation and unemployment facing us, should be confidence. It should be a feeling of confidence in our industrial sector, in our employees, in our work force.  The housewife should have confidence that when her husband comes home on Friday evening, he will not have to tell her he is <Col N="190" /> on a three-day week or that he has become unemployed.  The business community should have confidence in continuing to expand and create new jobs, as they had confidence prior to 1973 before the change of Government.</P>
    <P>I do not want to hear about oil sheikhs or anything else.  Every country in Europe has recovered from the effects of the oil crisis except ours. When the Government Information Service have nothing better to do they hark back to the oil crisis.  Every country, except Britain, who is the sick man of Europe, has got over the oil crisis.  Our Government still fall back on it because they do not like bad news being given to the public.  One cannot keep bad news from families with children trying to find employment and fathers being thrown out of jobs or put on a three day week.</P>
    <P>We should be encouraging increased investment, not imposing a wealth tax. The Taoiseach was quoted recently as saying&mdash;of course, it was changed by the time it appeared in the newspapers the following morning&mdash;that we were living on borrowed time and we would have to do something about it.  This is the Taoiseach of a Government bringing in three Bills which will shorten the bit of borrowed time we have.</P>
    <P>I should like to relate the effects of this Wealth Tax Bill to my own constituency of North County Dublin.  In this evening's papers we read that Aer Lingus had a £4 million loss this year. I had the pleasure of accompanying an Oireachtas deputation out to Aer Lingus last week.  We heard of their problems for the coming year.  Relate these to the Wealth Tax Bill and the other capital taxation Bills before the House.  If we had a strong economy, if we had movement on the part of the business community, if we had people going abroad on holidays, people using the airport, flying to and from Europe, and industrialists coming in here, Aer Lingus would not be facing the problems they have to contend with today.  Many of the causes of their problems are outside the control of this Government.  I admit that. There are economic problems in America and elsewhere, but there are <Col N="191" /> many things we could be doing to assist Aer Lingus.  What are we doing? We are bringing in, as part of a threefold package, a Wealth Tax Bill which will result in a lack of investment here and inhibit movement on the part of the business community. That will mean fewer passengers and less freight for Aer Lingus.  Every vacant seat and every loss of a ton of freight makes problems for them.  Aer Lingus have made a wonderful contribution to the economy of North County Dublin.  A number of people in my constituency work in Aer Lingus and are affected either directly or indirectly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I can appreciate the embarrassment of the Minister when the problems of unemployment in any area are brought before him, a member of a Government which <Col N="192" /> came in a short two years ago in a healthy employment situation and changed that to a situation in which we are facing the prospect of almost a quarter of a million people unemployed. I can understand why the Minister raises this point of order. If I were on the Government side, I would probably feel the same way about it but, even if I were on that side, I would not be a party to introducing legislation that is going to exacerbate further the unemployment situation.  The Fianna Fáil record on unemployment is second to none.</P>
      <P>We have a boatyard in Malahide in North County Dublin which is facing difficult problems because of raging inflation, the highest inflation rate in Europe.  This boatyard can be helped if the Government take some action to reduce the rate of inflation.  Almost 100 per cent of their orders are export orders.  With inflation running at its present rate, their effectiveness on the export market is consequently reduced. What action are the Government taking?  They are saying that in section 2 subject to the provisions of this section and any regulations made thereunder, from 5th April, a tax to be called a wealth tax shall be charged.  This will not reduce inflation; this will increase it further.  We know that unemployment is directly related to inflation.  The higher the rate of inflation the more unemployment there is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say about Malahide can also be applied to Balbriggan.  Wavin, Technicon and other companies are all suffering from the critical illness of inflation and all we are getting is Government lip-service which says: &ldquo;We must reduce inflation.  We are trying to reduce inflation.  Come and talk to us and, perhaps, somebody will come up with a bright suggestion which will save us making a decision. Inflation might just go away and stop bothering us&rdquo;.  Every housewife knows inflation is rising.  Every time she goes out to shop she sees what is happening.  This Wealth Tax Bill will increase inflation still further, rather than reduce it.  We should be trying to reduce it.  If the Government have any concern about the inflation rate <Col N="193" /> and the unemployment situation they should be introducing proposals to remedy them.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum says:</P>
    <P>Section 2 imposes the charge to wealth tax at the rate of 1 per cent, and provides that the tax shall be charged, levied and paid each and every year on and from April 5, 1975.  Tax is payable on the net market value on the valuation date of the taxable wealth of an assessable person.  There are three assessable persons, namely, the individual, the discretionary trust and the private non-trading company, each of whom is a taxable entity.  The market value is ascertained in accordance with sections 8 and 9 and the net market value is arrived at by making certain allowances for reliefs from that market value and for debts in accordance with the provisions of sections 10 and 11.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (3) provides:</P>
    <P>The market value of any property shall be ascertained by the Commissioners in such manner and by such means as they think fit and they may authorise a person to inspect any property and report to them the value thereof for the purposes of this Act and the person having the custody or possession of that property shall permit the person so authorised to inspect it at such reasonable times as the Commissioners consider necessary.</P>

      <P>I bow to your ruling but I think it is an appalling situation that one can have the valuation officer knocking on the door in <Col N="194" /> the middle of the night to count the knives and forks and see exactly what is in the house.  In regard to any tax, it should be related to an individual's or a company's ability to pay the tax out of profits, out of the money earned, be it a weekly wage or a monthly salary.</P>
      <P>The guiding principle should be that if you make £X you are liable to pay a percentage of that sum to the State.  We must have tax to keep the country going but that is not what is included in the wealth tax.  This Bill says even if you lose money in a particular year, if you have a bad year on a farm or if you have a bad year in a business, you still pay the wealth tax.  If this is not the straw that breaks the camel's back I wonder what is? There are many companies struggling at the moment for survival and the Government are suggesting the wealth tax which the Minister very rightly says does not relate to private companies but it relates to the shareholders of such companies.</P>

      <P>There are many family owned companies split between members of families and their shares in the company, even if the company are not making money, will be liable to tax.  A shop on the main street of a town might not be doing very well but the value of the premises will affect the value of the shares in the company. The owner of the shares is liable for the tax on the share value even if the company are not doing well.  The company might have some chance of improving and creating employment but if they have to pay wealth tax on top of the other taxes they have to pay there is no great likelihood of this happening.  We all know the extra expenses businesses have been forced to pay because of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said earlier that farmers do not have to worry about the wealth tax because the threshold is such that £200,000 and 50 per cent value is taken into account.  Deputy <Col N="195" /> Desmond gave the lie to this particular view held by the Minister.  Deputy Crowley, when speaking earlier, made the point that we have the wealth tax and it might be only 1 per cent now and the thresholds may be a certain figure but once the Bill becomes law this can be changed very easily. During the Second Stage debate Deputy Bermingham, a Labour Deputy, also made the same point on the 5th March last.</P>

      <P>The point was not made by me.  It was made by other Deputies.  Deputy Desmond nailed his colours to the mast and said that the Bill was brought in in a fairly diluted form so that it could be sold to the IFA and others but once the Government had got it the sledge hammer would come in and the thresholds would change.  That is basically what he said.  I believe when the Government are stuck for a few pounds they will change the thresholds and the percentages in relation to this wealth tax.  They have not paid Dublin County Council the £1½ million they owe them.  If the Government are stuck for money in the autumn and this Bill is law by then they will come in and change the thresholds and the percentages.  It will be like last December when the Government were stuck for £30 million and the Minister for Finance came in to the House and by the stroke of a pen he increased the price of petrol by 15p.  We all know he will increase the thresholds on farmers and change the percentages from 1 to 2½, which was what he had in his mind in the White Paper.  He had to back down from his original suggestion because of the criticisms he received all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, who is standing in for the Minister for Finance, to go back to the Government <Col N="196" /> and ask them to realise what is being done to the economy by this proposal. He told us that it will bring in £1½ million but the damage it will do to employment is far greater.  Unemployment figures are almost 105,000 and school leavers will add about 50,000 to that.  Economists have told us that later in the year the figure is likely to reach 160,000.  When the school leavers of last year, who have not got jobs, are added to that figure it will reach almost 250,000.  Lack of incentive to industrialists, whether foreign or home based, will create further unemployment.  I appeal to the Minister to realise the unemployment potential of this Bill and also the inflationary elements in it.  I also appeal to his colleagues in the Fine Gael Party to press the Government not to impose this further crucifixion on the people of Ireland.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The principle of imposing a wealth tax was accepted by the House on the 12th March, 1975, when the Second Stage of this Bill was passed after a protracted debate.  That established the principle of imposing a wealth tax.  We are now discussing section 2 of this Bill, which is the section that imposes the tax.  It is significant that there was no amendment down to this section.</P>
      <P>This is a Committee Stage debate, the purpose of which is to amend, where it is thought necessary or desirable, the Bill which was accepted in principle by the House on the 12th March last.  I rise simply to make the point that what is taking place now is a filibuster.  It is an abuse of this House.  I want to put that on record to let the House and the country see that this is sheer obstruction.  Most of the Deputies who spoke today had not even read the Bill.

      <P>I do not think the Minister is the person who should judge intelligence in this House.  The stark reality of section 2 is that it introduces a new tax and that message should be got home to everybody.  I do not think we ought to introduce such a new tax at this stage in our development. If section 2 is passed it will hinder progress and initiative.  Government Deputies have argued in favour of this tax on the lines that because other countries have it we should have it.  The fact that other countries operate this tax is no reason why we should introduce it.</P>
      <P>Have we not got sufficient measures at our disposal to enable the Government to obtain money by taxation? Deputies on the Government side implied that it was wrong to have or to create wealth.  I do not think any fair minded person would accept that argument. There is nothing wrong with a person being successful and it is good to see industries creating more jobs and the standard of living of our people being improved.  The effect of this tax will be that if shareholders of a company make a profit, even if they wish to plough that profit back into the company, it will be less a 1 per cent deduction for wealth tax.</P>

      <P>The wealth tax will also limit the inflow of capital by foreign investors at a time when we need all the money we can get from abroad.  That money is needed to help us readjust and bring back a standard of living we were used to two and three years ago.  We ought to foster companies and aid individuals who can generate wealth and create employment. In this regard it is not a good argument to put forward that the concessions are good and the rate is low.</P>
      <P>We got an insight into Government thinking in regard to wealth tax when Government Deputies pointed out that it would be easy to increase the threshold. They expressed the view that they would have preferred it to have been higher adding that they accepted the 1 per cent but that there would always be another round.  Are they hints of what is to come?  Why are we not dealing with legislation which would have the effect of reducing inflation? It was always the desire of my party to create jobs for those who had to leave agriculture, not only to absorb those who were leaving school, but also to continually pare away the number of those who are unemployed. This is the record we advanced against what the Government advances under section 2 of this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to remind people of the situation and to prove how this policy works.  The figures of unemployed alone prove it: approximately 68,000 unemployed in March, 1973.  This a spring month, and now in a summer month, when unemployment should be at its lowest, it is at a peak, I hope, but I am afraid we still have not seen the peak.</P>

    <P>Where will the school leavers go? I do not want to labour this point, <Col N="199" /> because I can appreciate the difficulties for intending school leavers with examinations upon them.  They are aware of them because they are more educated to the facts.  In considering this Bill and section 2 of it, my mind went back to a tragedy of some two years ago which saw the leading industrialists of our society die.  It was most regrettable.  These were members of the Confederation of Irish Industry. At that time we felt a huge personal loss, but there was also a feeling of depression and anxiety throughout the nation that we had lost many of the best brains, many of our <i>entrepreneurs,</i> many of those who would do good for our society.  There was a lack of hope there for a while.  Therefore, to those who say the plain people of Ireland welcome this wealth tax and section 2, in particular, I say they do not and that their feelings were really exposed at the time of that dreadful tragedy.  People ought to ponder this point before they rush headlong, further wrecking the economy, with measures such as these.  If these men were still with us I believe they would be shoulder to shoulder with our colleagues in the CII saying: &ldquo;No, not at this time.  A wealth tax is not appropriate at this stage of the development of the country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In talking of wealth, we ought to consider that the wealth of this country is our people.  People are seen to best effect when they are working.  I challenge the Minister to say that this measure, which is taking up a lot of the time of the Dáil, will create something new by way of employment, by way of making our people happier, more content, so that they can be more creative.  This tax is premature, being brought in at a time of complete lack of confidence in the economy.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister for Lands to listen carefully to the views of this House, not to adopt the attitude he is adopting, that we are here with one aim in mind, simply to filibuster? This is not so.  I am here, and I know my fellow Deputies are here with one intention, to see that good measures are introduced and that further hardships <Col N="200" /> will not be brought to people's doors.  It is not my intention to filibuster.</P>
    <P>The rules of this House would allow me to speak again on this stage, but I shall conclude by asking the Minister to please change his view of Opposition speakers at this time.  Let us see some open Government rather than the shop-window-blocked-up effort.  He should listen to our views. He is here representing the Government and more particularly in the place of the Minister for Finance.  I hope he will have a good chat with the Minister for Finance on the Minister's return from his important visits in Europe and not say simply that the Opposition created a filibuster. We speak as responsible people who are opposed to this measure at this particular time in the growth of our economy.</P>

      <P>I rise on this section because I have something to say in regard to the wealth tax.  I feel I have a right to say it and that I am not abusing the privilege of the House in any way.  I can safely say that never before in my short time as a Deputy for Kildare have I been exhorted by so many people to make their views known on this matter in this House.  Scores of constituents of mine, not all of them supporters, have asked me to express their views, and I mean to do that.  Possibly they are aware that their representatives in the Fine Gael and Labour Parties whom they have sent to this House will not express their views here. I can assure the House that the views I shall express are my own. They will not be parrot-like, because I have never had occasion to ask anyone to write or make a speech for me.  While what I have to say may not be very palatable, it will, I hope, be intelligible, if not to the Minister at least to the people I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wealth tax is to be introduced from 6th April, 1975.  In the explanatory memorandum we are told that the reason for the introduction of this tax is to implement the proposals of the White Paper on Capital Taxation. This indicates to me that this <Col N="201" /> tax is being introduced because there is a conglomeration of parties in office at the moment who feel they must keep their promise no matter what the price. This is the product of two sections that are acting in discord, and it is obvious to me that the two components of this Coalition can never act in complete harmony.  One of them has communistic leanings and its avowed object is to distribute the nation's wealth and it is obvious too that the other party must tag along, making sounds and signs with no action, to placate them.  It is obvious to me that if this policy is pursued and if by any mischance the present administration continues for very long more, there will be very little wealth to distribute in this country.</P>
    <P>The country is in dire straits and at this stage, with inflation and unemployment&mdash;possibly this has been repeated <i>ad nauseam,</i> but we cannot repeat this often enough&mdash;when you have a country in the dire straits this country is in, strong measures are needed to rectify the economy and make the wheels turn again, but a weak Government is not prepared to take strong measures and if it is the fear of being said to have backed down which will not allow them to do what they should it is high time the Government remembered that the country should come before party and perhaps the leader who is referred to as the person who places the nation first might put the nation first with regard to this section, as he did on the night he voted with us on the contraception issue, but I fear that personal thoughts will not allow them to do that.</P>
    <P>It would be well to ask ourselves at this stage if this tax is needed at all at the moment.  Even since this tax was first thought of and when plans for the production of the White Paper were being mulled over, there has been a distinct change in atmosphere and climate, and I note with a certain amount of pleasure that the proposals have been modified.  The modifications have been made by reason of representations received from individuals, corporations, organisations and others, <Col N="202" /> and I can well understand that there must have been shoals of representations with regard to it.  We should ask ourselves what is the plan of the Government in introducing this tax. Is it to collect taxation?  The amounts mentioned here very from £1½ million to £3 million, not a very considerable amount for such a very stern measure. Is it possible that their attitude is that they have decided that they will do away with wealth altogether, whittle away the wealth, if you can call it wealth, of those who come within this bracket?</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister and the other members of the Government that therein lies the main difference between the policies we have pursued so successfully for many years and the policy they are now pursuing.  Their policy in relation to this section will have the effect of dragging those who are up down to the level of others, while we pursued a policy that succeeded in uplifting people, and I am sure that those who take time off to view the situation and compare it with the situation which we handed over something over two years ago will find the change saddening indeed. Fianna Fáil policy was one that uplifted the people but the present policy will have the effect of dragging everybody down.</P>
    <P>I noticed that Deputy Crowley mentioned that there was no protest from the IFA.  I suppose he was referring to the fact that when our Government were in and certain things were happening which the IFA, or the NFA of that time, did not agree with we had considerable protests.  I can assure Deputy Crowley that I have had many representatives of the Kildare members of the IFA with me and as far as the farmers of Kildare are concerned&mdash;and I am sure that any Minister visiting Kildare in the near future and even the Taoiseach may be well aware of this by now&mdash; will find that the Kildare farmers are up in arms with regard to this tax. I have had representatives from the county executive of the Kildare NFA and their organisers and individual members and a deputation from south Kildare with me, and I have spoken <Col N="203" /> to my own neighbours, whom I would not class as my supporters up to now &mdash;they have been of a different party &mdash;and they have told me that they are very disturbed by the implications of this tax.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that never before in regard to any measure have I heard such an uproar as I have heard with regard to this tax.  It is generally felt that the National Coalition Party must be gone mad at this stage of our development, in the economic situation as it stands, to bring in such a measure, and the only excuse that the diehards who support the party the Minister represents will give for bringing it in is the tug-of-war which must go on in the Cabinet between the two conflicting factions, but the result is chaos.  I am reminded very much of a book which I have been reading lately called <i>Mao Tse Tung and I were Beggars</i>.  One was a student and the other a teacher. They went on a month's tour through China and Mao Tse Tung was a student.  Even though the two people were of different natures and different ideologies, they seemed to get on pretty well for a time, although they did part later on.  I can see a marked resemblance between the present tour of the third Coalition Government and the student and teacher who were involved in this tour.</P>
    <P>Is it not madness to think that when our little country is falling apart about the ears of the Irish people this Bill is brought in?  Above everything else, I maintain that the effect of this clause and the introduction of wealth tax will have the effect of undermining the very industry which is the foundation of all Irish industry and all successful industry in Ireland, the farming industry.  It has been pointed out by people on the opposite side that this is a fiddle-diddle tax that will not affect many people, but I want to point out that a widow with two dependent children whose wealth is valued at £200,000 will be allowed to deduct 50 per cent of her agricultural land to a maximum of £100,000, leaving £100,000 due for wealth tax.  She will get a widow's allowance of £90,000 <Col N="204" /> and £5,000 for two dependent children at £2,500 each, leaving £95,000.</P>

      <P>She will still have £5,000 liable to wealth tax at a rate of 1 per cent at the moment.  This very section, relating as it does to every assessable person, will have a disastrous effect on the farming community in so far as those who are engaged in contracting work are concerned. There will be a distinct disincentive for farmers or their sons to engage in contracting work because of the dangers of the taxation and their allowances will be halved.  I can foresee a situation where only those who are professionally engaged in contracting work and charge a much higher fee and work strict union hours will take on combining and silage cutting, and small farmers who may not come within the scope of this Bill directly will be very severely affected indirectly by the consequent increase in contracting charges, and they too will be forced to pass on this increase in their milk and beef supplies and all other agricultural products and we will again see a situation where the madness of this Government will drive up prices and we will eventually price ourselves out of the world market.</P>
      <P>No matter what anybody says about amendments tabled to this legislation the items that originally appeared in the Bill, it would be reasonable to expect, are the original thoughts of the Minister.  It was and is still held that if the Revenue Commissioners feel that a neighbour of a person being caught for wealth tax is witholding information, they will give him 30 days to supply that information and if he refuses to supply it, he will be fined £1,000 plus £50 per day after 30 days are completed.  The word that has been bandied about&mdash;with good reason I am sure&mdash;is &ldquo;neighbour&rdquo;; everybody comes within that category. I think that shows the original thinking of the Minister when he put this informer clause, as I would call it, in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular date mentioned in the Bill is 5th April.  Farmers in certain <Col N="205" /> parts of the country buy cattle in October and possibly keep them on silage and sell them all before 5th April.  The money would be put in the bank and if it represented more than one-quarter of a farmer's wealth at the time he would not be classed as a genuine farmer. That point deserves mention.</P>
    <P>There is no inflationary clause in the Bill.  I know there is nothing to prevent the Minister from raising or lowering the threshold but inflation is now running at such a rate that everybody is conscious of it and those who are not caught for wealth tax this year will see themselves caught for it next year or the year after unless there is an inflationary clause in the Bill.  Obviously, more and more farmers will be caught each year if this clause is not included.  With the present inflation rate of over 20 per cent, one can see this matter will have to be examined and the farmers met in some way.</P>
    <P>The present rate of tax is 1 per cent.  Business people usually consider a rate of 10 or 12 per cent reasonable and those with money to invest in a bank could easily get that return.  It has been proved to my satisfaction on figures from the Institute of Agriculture that the return from capital investment in agriculture is approximately 2 per cent.  If you were very successful it might range between 2 and 3 per cent.  If we take away 1 per cent in wealth tax, it will leave very little for reinvestment in agriculture and more than ever now we need massive investment in agriculture.</P>
    <P>Nothing brought this home to me more than a recent visit to England where I travelled on the M1 and saw English farms for the first time.  I could see the product of 1,000 years of uninterrupted progress there.  Much of what we would like to see on Irish farms has already been achieved there. Therefore, there is no comparison between the two countries or between Ireland and countries such as Holland and the EEC countries whose farmers are possibly the best in Europe.  We want to encourage people at this time but this measure is only a discouragement to anybody to improve his lot in farming.</P>
    <P>There is a difficulty about the valuation <Col N="206" /> to be placed on land.  Irish farmers are at a disadvantage compared with their EEC counterparts.  There are no rates on agricultural land in England but there are rates on it here. Because of our geographical position Irish farmers must pay more to transport their goods to the EEC.</P>

      <P>So will our farmers. This Government have rectified that. The Minister may be able to elucidate this point.  An accountant who has information is supposed to make it known.  Up to now, it was always felt there was need for secrecy in the case of the legal profession and their clients.  Will that secrecy still be observed if this informer clause is enforced? I believe it will have to be either removed completely or considerably watered down if it is to be acceptable to the people.</P>
      <P>The principle of this Wealth Tax Bill appears to be wrong because it can be changed at will; the threshold can be lowered.  There will be no incentive for private enterprise; it will help to stifle any venture in that way. People will endeavour not to expand their businesses or holdings any more than the threshold for wealth tax.  I hope an inflationary clause will be introduced and that something will be done regarding the difficulties that face small farmers forced to rely on contractors. When we consider all the difficulties, will the end result be worth the candle?  Will the measure bring in enough money to warrant the imposition of this tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a direct result of this proposal I have seen substantial holdings for sale in Kildare.  In my own county I know of somebody who will now be paying wealth tax as a result of this Bill.  He is already paying death duties and it is likely that this man who built up his herd of cows from four to 16 in a few years, who is up to his ears in debt with the ACC, will be paying death duties which arose under our Administration and wealth tax and income tax under the present Administration.  While the <Col N="207" /> short term effect of the measure in bringing in a certain amount of money may appeal to the Government, the long term result will be disastrous.</P>
    <P>Having shown that capital investment in farming brings in an average income of 2 per cent, I need scarcely say that there will be less incentive for people to invest or stay in farming and more likelihood of them selling out.  City people or people with an urban mentality might be under the impression that only the very wealthy will be affected by this Bill.  Many people with large holdings and who are engaged in a system of beef production will come within the ambit of the Bill.  Beef production is very necessary to our economy and any falling off at that level would have its effects down along the line to dairy herds, calves and so on.  While beef production has always been satisfactory here it must be conducted on an extensive scale but, sadly, this proposed tax will inhibit this aspect of farming.</P>
    <P>The Minister is making no provision to cater for inflation.  Neither is there any provision to cater for the consequences of a bad year.  This year, indeed, may be a very bad one in which to introduce a measure of this kind because certain matters are occurring now in respect of which the farmer has no control but which could have a disastrous effect on his income.  However, if he is assessed at a certain level he will have to pay wealth tax regardless of any reduced income he may suffer.  There has been no crop or grass growth during the past month.  This may result in a serious recession in the industry and in a glut in the meat market as a result of the vets' strike.  Apart from the absence of these provisions the date being fixed for payment is one that comes into effect before the legislation is enacted.  It has been suggested by this party that the date should be changed.  I trust that on his return the Minister for Finance will at least accede to that request.</P>
    <P>We have a long way to go before reaching the stage of inputs into <Col N="208" /> farming that we would wish for.  This measure will have a disastrous effect on the industry.  In saying this I am conveying the thoughts of ordinary people in my county who have worked hard at farming.  Some of these are people who up to now supported this Government but even they are convinced that this measure is an act of lunacy.</P>
    <P>The Bill, too, contains some inconsistencies. For instance, it would appear that, as a result of it, two people who would live together without being married might enjoy a greater allowance than another pair who regularised their union.  Also, a man who would marry a business woman, say, a hotelier, would find that his wife's assets would need to be less than a quarter of the threshold if he were to be classed as a genuine farmer.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility, too, that land near a town could be loaded with a 25 per cent extra valuation.  If the land in question is used for agricultural purposes, obviously, it would produce no more than, and possibly less than, land in a very rural area especially when one considers that land near a town is subject to a much greater amount of trespass by way of dogs and of the dumping of refuse and so on than is land in other areas.  A farmer would need to have his combine harvester set very high before beginning to cut a crop in such places. It might well be that land in Kildare in the vicinity of the dual carriageway would be valued at £3,000 per acre for wealth tax purposes.  In such case a farmer would seem to be caught in a net from which there was no escape because if the land is valued at a low rate, he could be caught afterwards for capital gains tax.  The trinity of taxes being processed appears to be much more penal in their implementation than were estate duties.  Some people with whom I have spoken told me that they would be prepared to settle for a tax of the estate duty nature but which would keep pace with inflation rather than to have the taxation code proposed here.  The introduction of a gift tax at a lower rate to counteract what might be lost <Col N="209" /> by the evasion of estate duty would be more attractive to many people than the tax we are discussing.</P>
    <P>This country needs whatever investment it can get, but instead of encouraging people to come here the Government are enacting legislation to keep them away.  There would be nothing wrong with a situation in which Ireland would be classed as a tax haven.  Ours is a very small country&mdash;some might say, insignificant. Our economy is weak and we have a very high inflation rate.  This Bill would be very difficult to administer. It is my opinion that it will treble the present staff administration.</P>
    <P>Farmers accepted the principle of income tax.  I am glad to say that members of the IFA who have approached me found this principle acceptable but they are not prepared to accept this form of wealth tax.  I understand that it has been pointed out to members of the IFA who have attended seminars that if one can prove one is not domiciled in Ireland there is much scope as far as this Bill is concerned.  At least the Kildare farmers went home with the impression that aliens would get preferential treatment to a greater degree than they ever got before.</P>
    <P>It is sad to note that this measure is being brought in at this time when one thinks of the change there has been in our economy in the past two years.  In 1973 all was going well but today the pattern is very different.  This week two of my sons are sitting for examinations.  Two years ago the prospects of their being employed in their own county were bright but there are no such prospects now.  A couple of years ago, too, I spoke with the personnel manager of one of our factories and he told me that business was booming, that there were great plans in hand for increasing production and for embarking on new lines.  Today, with the aid of very good management, they are very fortunate to be able to retain their existing staff but unless there is some change soon for the better, this will not be possible. Irish Ropes is one of the few concerns that have been able to maintain their staff level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> Everywhere I go I am asked, not only by my supporters but by those who up to now supported the Government, whether there is any hope of putting this crowd out.</P>

      <P>I see, Sir.  It does appear that the Bill may do good in that way because in the long run it will have the effect of removing the Government that introduced it.  That is the only good thing I can see about it.  Then we will try to clear up the mess.</P>
      <P>What is necessary now is a move that would give people a certain measure of confidence and hope in the future and a sound base on which to plan for the next quarter of a century. A wealth tax will not do that.  A wealth tax, we are told, will bring in, not £3 million, but simply £1½ million.  It will help to run down the economy.  I have every reason to believe that already it has frightened away millions of pounds of investment capital.  Mention of the wealth tax and the other taxes has frightened money out of Ireland and has stopped money from coming in.</P>
      <P>During the week, when we were speaking about the betting levy Bill the Taoiseach refuted the allegation that I made, but I have every confidence in the information given to me by a well-known horse trainer who numbers among his patrons wealthy people who have considerable investment in this country, people who are <i>au fait</i> with fiscal matters and who would know what happens in the higher levels of finance.  He has told me that the first week this measure was introduced millions of pounds were frightened out of the country and millions of pounds will continue to leave the country as long as these measures are in operation.</P>
      <P>It would appear from the Bill as it stands at the moment that this tax will increase the charges farmers in tillage will have to pay for combine work and farmers in milk will have to pay for silage work and that will be passed on to the consumer of agricultural produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the thinking <Col N="211" /> behind the Bill.  The concept could be said to be sharing&mdash;sharing everything equally.  This is something no country has succeeded in doing to anybody's satisfaction.  Russia, which may be classed as the ultimate in measures of this kind, has proved to be a monumental failure.  Anyone who is familiar with what goes on in Russia will know who shares what there and how people who are in a certain bracket can get preferential treatment to others.  I made the point before that if all the wealth of the country were shared equally this week it would be necessary to have a further share out the following week due to somebody's misfortune or flutter that went astray.</P>
    <P>We are the party who have always stood for free enterprise and open trading.  Before the last election the White Paper would be directly involved in this&mdash;the party the Minister represents promised that a form of taxation related to the ability of the person to pay would be introduced and Fine Gael in Government would abolish estate duty on property passing on death to widows and their children and replace it with taxation confined to the really wealthy.  Many people in my constituency who do not feel they are really wealthy now see that they will be brought into the tax net.</P>

I feel poorer on this side of the House than I did when I was on the other side of the House, and there are more reasons than one for that.  They now see, even though they would not class themselves as in the wealthy bracket, that they will be caught by this trinity of taxes and that the farming community in particular will be caught.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to remind those who voted on the basis of that promise <Col N="212" /> that they cannot divorce one section from the other in this.  They were reminded that if they voted for one party they were to give their preference for another.  There would appear to be no difference between the two parties now.  We have a proper policy in our party that is geared to the needs of all the people whether big or small.</P>
    <P>Farmers have come to see me in Kildare.  They have seen their Fine Gael and Labour representatives. They asked that we would stand up and express their views on this Bill.  I hope I have done that.  They wanted to know what we could do to persuade the Government to change these wealth tax proposals.</P>

      <P>I have been asked after the Second Stage to make people's views known on this Bill.  I know that the other representatives for my constituency were asked to make their views known.  Perhaps they have done that in private.  Maybe some of the changes can be attributed to their good work behind closed doors.  The people who asked them to make their views known hoped that they would do so in public and that their part would not be simply a walk-on part, that they would just walk in when the bell would ring; that they would make the views of their constituents fearlessly known in the House.  Their constituents gave them many lines to say.  I hope they will not forget them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the budget, when it was first mentioned that a wealth tax would be imposed, it was suggested that 10,000 people would be brought into the tax net for the first time.  The Labour representative for Kildare expressed the view that this was good&mdash;good&mdash; and since that he has expressed an opinion with regard to this taxation that 1 per cent&mdash;1 per cent is mentioned here&mdash;is not sufficient.  I would hope that he would come in and tell us <Col N="213" /> more about his views on this matter. The Minister for Lands, Deputy Fitzpatrick, has commented that this viewpoint has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> in the House.  While it may have been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> as far as the Minister was concerned, the people who have been really nauseated are the farming population of Kildare who voted for the party the Minister represents the last time and were asked to vote for the Deputy I refer to as another preference.</P>
    <P>It shows the thinking behind the Bill when two Labour representatives who have spoken on it have indicated in one case that 1 per cent was not enough and in the other case that it would be easy to adjust the wealth tax later.  This is an indication that this is the beginning of the taxation and that thresholds can be lowered or the percentage can be increased later.</P>
    <P>This wealth tax will be a deterrent to the provision of new jobs.  It is hardly necessary to say that it could not have been introduced or implemented at a worse time when thousands of jobs are being lost.  We are told that for 20,000 jobs lost today, 16,000 new jobs were created.  What is necessary is to create a climate helpful to the creation of jobs.  That means an investment of money.  I should like to hear the IDA representatives tell us of the position with regard to persuading people to invest in Ireland since this measure was introduced.  Has it been more difficult to encourage people to come here?  I am sure it has not been easy.  There appears to be a slowing down in this matter.</P>
    <P>As a result of measures such as this our credibility has been lost and confidence in the country has been eroded.  People are inclined to think this is not the ultimate in taxation which the present Government will implement.  They say it is the beginning of taxation and they wonder what will come next.  There is nothing to prevent a change.  A promise that was made with regard to a tax on mines has been changed, and it will be very easy for the present administration to make other changes also with regard to other taxes.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if he is <Col N="214" /> prepared to agree with our proposal that the date of 5th April should be changed to 5th October?  It is a sensible suggestion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister and the Government have entered into this discussion with closed minds and any suggestion, irrespective of its merits, that comes from the Opposition will not be acceptable.  Do the Government not realise that people whom they class as wealthy will have to sell a piece of their land each year to pay this tax?  It will slow down their efforts in many lines and some of them will get out completely.</P>
      <P>It is easy to prove that any country which has been progressive has not adopted taxation such as this.  I would classify America as an example&mdash; maybe not today&mdash;of a country that has progressed in a century and a half from a wilderness to prosperity, as an example of what free enterprise can do in an economy.  If we want to promote any initiative we must give a reward for extra work, but this Bill has the effect of stifling initiative.  It is geared to drag down rather than uplift.  All sensible people, in many cases supporters of the Government, have asked me to impress on the Minister and his party that they want this legislation scrapped.  I speak as a man with very little of the world's goods but I represent all types of people&mdash; big farmers, small farmers who will not be caught for years by this legislation but who are aware of the effect it could have on contract work, and factory workers who have seen the effects of legislation that has been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than two years ago when we were in Government I remember remarking in this House that industry <Col N="215" /> was booming in Droichead Nua and the present Minister for Agriculture said it was starting to rock.  I told him it was rocking round the clock and that industry was booming, but that situation does not exist now.</P>
    <P>Legislation that was planned in a situation of full employment and wonderful prospects is not so enticing or palatable to the people today.  We are in a period of intense recession.  Last March we were told we could expect an upsurge in the economy at this time of the year, but the upsurge did not come.  We are still experiencing the downturn; we do not know if we are at the pit of the scale although I hope we are.</P>
    <P>Everyone in the country who is concerned about the economy says it is time the Government stopped this madness and gave up this legislation. I include in this road workers who have very little money, who are out with hooks cutting the grass verges at the sides of the roads where last year they used some type of mechanical aid; professional people such as doctors who have arguments with the Government; veterinary surgeons who are in trouble with the administration; nurses; doctors; teachers; small shopkeepers who are ground down with tax.  All these people are sincere and honest and they are concerned about what the Government are proposing here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this House must have misgivings about the direction of the economy under the present Government.  In the history of our nation no Bill has created more difficulty or depression.  Yesterday and today we discussed the position of the footwear industry.  This is a time when we should be encouraging every possible investment in order to create employment.  Experts have predicted that a further 25,000 people will be out of work by October or November. We must also take into account the great number of school-leavers who will be unable to find employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In themselves taxes are necessary and when they are applied judiciously they can be to the benefit of the <Col N="216" /> people.  The Government have said that this is a tax on wealthy people, but no Government can catch the really wealthy because they keep their cash in a liquid form and they can move it from one investment to another. It must be obvious to financial experts that the level of cash which our commercial banks are required by law to hold has reached a level much below the safety margin.  This is due to the removal of cash from the country.  This should be a danger signal to the Government to re-examine the path they are treading.</P>
    <P>The effect of extreme taxes imposed in the past on industries, particularly on food and other necessities, has been disastrous.  Last evening I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce trying to explain why our boot and shoe industry is to some extent phasing out, indeed heading, I believe towards complete extinction. The argument was that our people were not being competitive; they had not tried to capture markets.  I doubt if that is true in any walk of life; it is certainly not true of the boot and shoe industry.  This industry was established away back in the early years of this century, established before the State was founded.  There was a famous boot and shoe industry in Killarney.  It produced an excellent product.  It is now in dire straits and so is the factory in Tralee.  It is a sad state of affairs.  How is it that, with all our alleged ability, we cannot get the financial experts and the economists together to steer the country away from the disastrous path along which it is travelling?  The colossal rise in inflation has had a disastrous effect on our boot and shoe industry.  So has dumping from slave labour countries. These manufactures are coming in from Britain packed in British cartons. The customs people and all others concerned should subject these imports to a thorough inspection because it is these imports that are bedevilling the situation here.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford to lose whatever people of wealth we have.  We are in grave danger now of lossing them.  Already a great deal of money has been <Col N="217" /> shifted out of the country.  I have had numerous inquiries from German industrialists about this proposed wealth tax and they have asked me to try to get it across to the Minister for Finance that this tax will seriously militate against industrial expansion. One cannot help feeling this tax is the offspring of extreme Socialist thinking. Thinking about this tax, and looking at the extreme Socialist States, one understands why they have to build great walls and barbed wire fences to keep the people inside.</P>
    <P>All Irishmen are anxious to own something.  No one is naïve enough to think this proposed tax will remain unchanged in the future.  This is the thin edge of the wedge and, as time passes, the rate will be increased and the exemption limit reduced.  In due process of time land owners may find themselves caught in this iniquitous tax net.  People are depressed at the prospect they see ahead.</P>
    <P>This tax will adversely affect our tourist industry.  The industry has been in dire trouble for the past few years. Now the industry may find itself saddled with this imposition.  The Taoiseach and the Government should have second thoughts now about this Bill. At the moment the country is facing ruin and disaster. There is no work.  Increasing numbers are finding themselves unemployed every day.  Industrialists and business people are desperately trying to find ways and means of reducing their work force in an effort to meet rising costs.</P>
    <P>Our people have brains and ability but they are overburdened with taxes. Again, there are too many getting money they are not earning.  This tax could be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  Business people with premises they no longer use because of modernisation and rationalisation will be caught through valuation in this tax net.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in exports in the early months of this year because factories built years ago now have the expertise to produce first-class goods.  Three years ago there were colossal imports of building materials. <Col N="218" /> Now the stockpile is diminishing and we will be compelled to import once more and we will have to pay many times what we paid for our original stockpile to keep even the limited programme we have going.  The cost will be in the region of £3 million to £5 million.  These are the facts.  They must be available to the Government. These imports will further increase the imbalance in our balance of payments. The economists and the Government must be able to assess this position. This is true of the building industry and the imports necessary to keep it going.</P>
    <P>This year is likely to be a disastrous year for farmers.  They have been held up by the veterinary strike and now with the shortage of fodder and grass it means that many of them will have to sell their stock for whatever they can get for them.  This is another problem facing us to which we must give serious thought.</P>
    <P>There is also the difficult problem of finding jobs for approximately 50,000 who are leaving school this year.  There is no place for them to obtain jobs.  Many of those in so-called good jobs are now redundant and are forced to live on the bread-line. We should bring back the capital which has been pushed out of the country.  A lot of money needs to be channelled into agriculture, industry and tourism.  Since last October I have asked several times in the House that a sum of money be allocated to get turf production going but the Government had no money to put into it. We have had magnificent weather when large quantities of turf could have been cut in the west.  It is economical to cut turf now because it can be bought at £7 a ton.  Coal now costs over £40 a ton so turf is very good value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get the overall pattern.  This Bill is a disastrous measure that will do more harm to the economy.  This will send badly needed money out of the country.  There must be experts from the Department of Finance who know that the 42 per cent of the people's money, which the commercial banks are supposed to hold liquid, is far below that at the moment.  This is because the money has been removed out of the country quickly.  Perhaps the Minister for Lands would explain that to me?  Am I still speaking out of line on this Bill when I mention that?</P>
      <P>I am speaking of facts which I know and which are obvious to most business people in the country.  It is the job of business people to try to get people back to work.  This is why I mentioned turf.  If money is floating around it should be used to supplement people's incomes and not be pushed out of the country.  During my years in this House I have never been one to stand up and speak on matters outside that of the debate in question or to speak politically.  The country is in great danger.  If some effort is not made to put it back on the straight and narrow path disaster will follow.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned, it is necessary to get money into agriculture and into industry.  The £1½ million which the Minister for Finance will get out of this wealth tax should be used for some of those purposes.  We all know it will not be long until the tax is increased and everybody in the country will be caught by it.  We know it cannot catch the wealthy man because he can shift his money to any part of the world to make more money for him.  If the Bill was to serve any purpose that is the type of person it should catch.  It is catching the business man and the hotelier.  Eventually it will catch the smaller people.  I hope I have got the message across here that I have tried to get across.  I believe that we are facing a disastrous period between now and Christmas.  I hope I am wrong.  Now is the time to get our economy back where it should be and reduce unemployment.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I said earlier, the principle of imposing wealth tax was accepted by the House on 12th March last after a protracted Second Reading debate.  The House divided and the principle of imposing a wealth tax was accepted.  This is a Committee Stage debate.  I note there are 28 amendments to the Bill tabled in the name of the Minister for Finance.  There are 32 amendments tabled in the names of Opposition <Col N="221" /> Deputies, and that seems to indicate that they accept the principle of the Bill.  Their amendments are obviously tabled in their efforts to improve the Bill.  It is significant that there is no amendment to section 2 nor has there been any motion tabled to oppose the Bill.  I suggest that the time of the House would be better spent in dealing with the 28 amendments tabled by the Minister for Finance and the 32 amendments put down by members of the Opposition. Do the Opposition not want to deal with their own amendments?</P>

      <P>On three occasions the Chair has drawn the attention of the House to the fact that on Committee Stage the House is expected to discuss what is appropriate to the section and not all sections of the Bill.  To do otherwise might be deemed Second Reading speeches.  Section 2 deals with the charging of wealth tax, and in regard to that section the Deputies are bound to keep to that and nothing more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are opposed to this section.  The reason we have not put down an amendment to this section is simple: we are opposed to the section entirely.  We do not accept the principle of the Bill. Wealth tax must be considered in conjunction with the other taxes the Minister proposes to introduce.  We oppose this tax because it is being introduced at a time when our economic position is far from satisfactory. Section 2 will not help the Government to get the country out of the serious economic difficulties we are in; the reverse will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To a certain extent I agree with capital gains tax if it is directed against speculators but I do not agree with it if it is directed against individuals who, by their own initiative and hard work, have acquired assets. Our economy was built up by hard work on the part of industrialists and successive Fianna Fáil Governments; by people who showed their confidence by investing money in the country's future.  To an extent the <Col N="223" /> Government are paying tribute to the economic achievements of Fianna Fáil Governments by endeavouring to impose a wealth tax.  The Government feel that the economy is such that it can bear a wealth tax.  There can be no doubt but that this is the wrong time to introduce this tax, and the Government should withdraw this Bill.  There has been no growth in our economy for almost two years and our national wealth may be reducing in view of the fact that there are 103,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how this wealth tax, as it is envisaged in section 2 of this Bill, will get employment for any of those 103,000 unemployed.  The reverse could be the case.  As a result of this Bill many more people could find themselves out of employment before this year is out We should bear in mind that industry, which is already badly hit by redundancies, massive lay-offs, uncertainty, and lack of positive planning on the part of the Government, will be in a very shaky position following the imposition of this wealth tax.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that industries must pay on their assets and not on their profits.  If an industrialist has sufficient assets as to come within the limits of this Bill, whether his profits be nil or whether his business shows a loss for a particular year, he must pay the wealth tax at the rate of 1 per cent of the net market value of his assets.  An industrialist may have spent a life-time building up his industry, expanding it, creating more employment, and at the end of the day he finds he has to carry this burden, at a time when he is probably making only a very marginal rate of profit, possibly just enough to meet his payroll bill and maintain himself and his family.</P>
    <P>Again, many an industrialist could find himself with a bank overdraft.  He might hope in normal circumstances to get around the bend within a few years, but now, in addition to running his business at a loss for a few years, he must pay 1 per cent of the net market value of his assets.  I believe <Col N="224" /> many industrialists will not take the chance and there is great danger that if this section is passed, many of them will decide to close down.  The worst feature of the situation is that people with money will not invest or buy shares in industry or will not buy it out for the simple reason that they will be afraid that the day will come when they will be in the same situation as a man who was forced to sell out.</P>
    <P>Therefore, under section 2 of this Bill there is no incentive whatsoever to expand, to build up assets, whether by way of improving factory premises or buying new plant and machinery, which is now necessary in any industry, particularly in modern trading conditions, to meet the requirements of top quality goods at the minimum price in European and world markets today.</P>
    <P>This proposed wealth tax could well be playing a big part in the difficult situation in which the footwear and textile trades find themselves.  There are many factors involved in the sorry position of these trades today, but there are a number of persons in this country who would have bought shares and who would have bought some of these factories and made a fresh start by putting in modern plant and machinery and retraining staff, but these very people are apprehensive of the effect this section of the Wealth Tax Bill could ultimately have on their position generally.</P>
    <P>People with money who would normally have come to the assistance of ailing industry will not do so now for many of the reasons I have just stated.  I am convinced that the provisions of section 2 of this Bill have had a very serious effect on the construction industry already, and it certainly will mean the loss of more jobs to the construction industry within the next 12 months.  During the past 12 months or so, thousands of workers in the construction industry have lost their employment for many reasons, but one of the reasons is certainly the proposed wealth tax.  Even as late as this afternoon at Question Time the Minister for Industry and Commerce stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>
