    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is provided that the &ldquo;appointed day&rdquo; means the day &ldquo;appointed by the Minister by order under section 29 of this Act to be the appointed day for the purposes of this Act and different days may be <Col N="1452" /> appointed for different purposes of this Act.&rdquo; Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to explain in greater detail the reasons for the wording of the interpretation of the appointed day and the suggestion that different days may be appointed for different purposes of this Act.  Does that mean that the regulations will be placed before the Oireachtas from time to time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there is no significant reason for the wording.  The Act will come into being on a day designated by the Minister after it has passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas. As the Deputy is aware, under the terms of the Bill the health boards are now taking responsibility for the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance and, it is necessary, for negotiations to be carried out with the health boards after the passing of the Bill to ensure its smooth introduction and to iron out any problems that may exist from the health boards' point of view.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no sinister significance in the wording.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of &ldquo;child dependant&rdquo;, does that include legitimate and illegitimate children? Yesterday on the Family Law Reform Bill we had a suggestion by the Minister for Justice that for the purpose of this legislation and that with which he was then dealing he may abandon the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children.  We believe this distinction should end.  Having regard to the fact that the law appears to discriminate against a human being who in the first instance had nothing to do with his or her social condition or arrival into a world under the rules and standards set by society, we strongly believe that the sooner this distinction is abandoned for the purposes of Acts of this nature, the better.  The Minister for Justice did indicate his intention of bringing in an amendment to the Family Law Reform Bill which we had in Special Committee yesterday, and if the Minister's amendment goes far enough we <Col N="1453" /> will certainly support it, but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to be good enough to explain the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;child dependant&rdquo; as assigned to it by section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is anticipating somewhat one of his own amendments in this respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he raises this point, but I assure the Deputy that my views on the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and some of the ways in which it is used coincide with the sentiments he has expressed.  However, I am at the moment dealing with legislation, legislation which must be capable of being enforced.  Although I have no knowledge of what happened yesterday in regard to another Bill, not having been at the Special Committee, I am sure the Deputy will accept that the points he has raised would be more appropriate on the Bill which was discussed yesterday.  The difficulty that arises here is that a health board, for very obvious reasons, would not be in a position to determine who the father of a child born out of wedlock was.  It would place health boards in an impossible position if they were required by law to do that.</P>
      <P>I fully accept the points made by the Deputy and I share very strongly the views he has expressed but I think he will accept that whatever difficulties arise in that area are more approppriate on another Bill and are not appropriate on this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the child born out of wedlock would be the responsibility of some person and would be living with some people in whose care it would be?  In that case the child would be a dependant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no distinction whatsoever in regard to the payment in respect of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the child be classed as a dependant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The present social climate regards the illegitimate child as <i>nullius fillius,</i> the child of nobody. <Col N="1454" /> The Parliamentary Secretary has now assured the House that the dependant child will receive the supplementary welfare entitlements regardless of his legitimacy or illegitimacy.  Is that what we are to understand the Parliamentary Secretary as saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly.  The only distinction which is made&mdash;this anticipates the Deputy's amendment&mdash; is that as far as liability or the possibility of recovery of any money that might be paid by the health boards is concerned it would not be possible for the health boards to be able to establish or attempt to establish who the father of a child born out of wedlock was.  I can assure the Deputy that is the only distinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate draftsmen have a problem in relation to drafting and possibly they want to cut down on the amount of wording they put into a particular Bill.  This is not a criticism.  There should be at the back of a Bill when it becomes an Act a clearer definition of &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; than saying that it means home assistance within the meaning of the Act of 1939.  For instance, a person would have to have available to him the 1939 Act so that he would know what is available.  We are not passing this Bill exclusively for the benefit of legislators and lawyers.  We are passing it for the benefit of the very people who would not have readily available to them the Act of 1939.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in his reformist and reforming mood might consider the possibility at some future time of including the definition of &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; at the back of an Act.  It may cause difficulty to some people and I do not think we should create obstacles where they need not be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy refers to my reforming mood he implies that it is something which comes and goes.  I can assure him it is a constant thing and not a passing phase. I understand it is extremely difficult in the drafting to spell out clearly and to define clearly just what is referred to in the reference the Deputy has made to the Act of 1939.  As he is <Col N="1455" /> probably aware, I have on a number of occasions stated in the House that I thought the whole area of social welfare and the legislation covering it made it very difficult not only for Deputies and Members of the Upper House but also for people professionally engaged in the field of social welfare and voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>We have at the moment in the Department a consolidation Bill which is at a very advanced stage of preparation. I hope this will make it somewhat less difficult for people engaged in social welfare.  I accept, as far as the ordinary citizen is concerned, that while this Bill will be of some benefit it will be of tremendous benefit to people engaged full time in that area.  We also endeavour, through the booklet which we issue, to explain in as simple terms as possible what people's entitlements are.  There has been a very significant improvement in the presentation of this booklet and also where previously a period of up to five months elapsed between a change in the code and the publication of the booklet we have managed to overcome this and the booklet is now available very shortly after any major changes in the social welfare code.  We are conscious of the need in the Department to inform the public as fully as possible what their rights and entitlements are.  We endeavour to do it in a way that can best be understood by the ordinary man in the street.  I accept that in the drafting of a Bill more technical and legalistic terms must of necessity be used.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording of this section is a matter of concern to this side of the House.  It states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant of his shall be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Within the context of the EEC a nonnational could arrive in this country.  I must say the Department of Justice are pretty rigid in relation to who comes in or does not come in to the country. If some such person found himself or herself penniless does this Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Bill provide for him or her and his or her children?  This is something the Parliamentary Secretary might elaborate on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy poses a fairly hypothetical question.  I do not envisage that we will have many people coming to our shores who will be absolutely penniless on arrival.  They certainly would not be after establishing their capabilities of maintaining themselves, having some job or relatives already in the country, but in the event of such a situation arising these people could be helped under the present Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any social welfare code which covers the situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  They carry the benefits with them to this country but in that event it would be unlikely they would have to have recourse to supplementary benefit allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some definition of the word &ldquo;needs&rdquo; in section 2.  It states:</P>
      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who defines the needs of a person? We all have different standards and levels and our income is never sufficient <Col N="1457" /> to meet our needs.  Perhaps this is defined elsewhere in the Bill but on examination by a health board officer a person can easily satisfy that officer that his income is insufficient to meet his needs.  Suppose a widow has a widow's pension of £8 or £9 a week and she can point out that the price of commodities going into her shopping basket are up 10 or 20 per cent on the previous week, her income is then falling short of her needs.  Is it determined in that way?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy spoke of the increase in the cost of a shopping basket in relation to the widow's pension. We have been very fortunate in that we have been able not only to maintain benefits against inflation so far as pensions are concerned but we have been able to go over and above that over the past two-and-a-half years.  The Bill not only provides for weekly payments but also allows discretion on the part of the health board.  It gets away from the old poor law approach that was in the Home Assistance Act where a person had no rights whatever and it was solely at the discretion of the home assistance officer whether he got any financial assistance and the amount, if any. The amount could vary from week to week, from case to case or from area to area.  One of the most objectionable features of the Act which this Bill replaces is that identical cases in exactly the same financial circumstances and responsibilities could, and in fact, did receive different amounts. This Bill sets out a minimum amount to which a person is entitled by right. Over and above that the health board can use discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked how we defined needs.  There could be a fire in a home where furniture would be destroyed, blankets and bedding and so on.  That is a definite need and could require one lump sum payment.  That can be done under the Bill.  The Deputy also spoke of people with different standards of living.  There could be a woman living in a local authority house at a rent of £2 per week; her husband dies suddenly and she cannot pay the £2.  You could have another widow paying £8 a week rent.  Their <Col N="1458" /> needs, just for shelter, are different and these things must be taken into consideration in defining a person's needs in any particular circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt more with the benefits than with the definition of &ldquo;needs&rdquo;. In the case of the old Act it was at the discretion of the investigating officer, the home assistance officer&mdash; is it not true that under this Bill the investigation will be carried out by the same person and to determine what criteria the different health boards will use to ensure uniformity is one of the reasons why I want to know how &ldquo;needs&rdquo; will be defined?  Section 2 speaks of &ldquo;every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant...&rdquo;.  The Eastern Health Board officers may decide that a person's income is insufficient to met his needs&mdash;this provides for supplementary payments&mdash; and no person is today receiving welfare benefit no matter how generous we think it is who would not find it possible to establish that it is insufficient to meet his needs.  What criteria will the different home assistance officers now use?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true that it was absolutely at their discretion in the past: they had criteria which were used and these were limited by the amounts the local authority said they could pay and a person got the full amount or, if he had a certain income, the yardstick was used to decide what amount he was entitled to and what his actual wants were.  They used the same system as is provided in the Bill in regard to paying a lump sum in cases where persons met with some tragedy or event which deprived them of means which they previously had &mdash;a fire or a death in the family or a long illness.  There was provision to meet these matters just as in this Bill.  Surely the health officers will be given some more definite yardstick than &ldquo;whose means are insufficient to meet his needs&rdquo; to define needs and ensure uniformity in the administration of the Act by the different health boards.  Otherwise you would perhaps have the North Western <Col N="1459" /> Health Board paying more in Leitrim under the Act than the Eastern Health Board may be paying.  Will all boards have the same criteria in defining needs?  No effort is made to set down what &ldquo;needs&rdquo; are.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary must be aware that even in the investigation of means for old age pensions a good deal of reform is necessary.  The same test is being applied now as when small farmers were only receiving £10 or £15 for cattle even though store cattle are now making £150.  The investigation officer is using his own method of investigation and this means that many people are deprived of assistance.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any definition of &ldquo;needs&rdquo; in the Bill.  It is open-ended and every person whose means are insufficient can qualify.  If we are to ensure that there will be some criteria for the home assistance officers to apply with uniformity so that the same payments and qualifications apply in all health board areas we will have to decide on a definition of &ldquo;needs&rdquo;.  This Bill will become an enormous burden on local authorities who are over-burdened at present with rising rates.  The Minister is being generous at the expense of the local authorities.  How will the Parliamentary Secretary apply this provision to ensure uniformity so that everybody will not qualify for a supplementary allowance?  It appears that everybody can show that their income is insuffient to meet their needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is funny to hear the Deputy talking about the terrible burden this is going to place on the ratepayers especially when he was a former Minister for Social Welfare. Under the Home Assistance Act, which this Bill is replacing, the rates paid 100 per cent but under the terms of this Bill the Exchequer will pay 60 per cent of the additional cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Which freezes it.  The Deputy is trying to imply that this will be a terrible imposition on the rates and has got in remarks about the rates being overburdened but this Bill will restore dignity to people who were stripped of dignity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Home Assistance Act was the most disgraceful piece of legislation that ever passed through this House.  It was based on an Act of 1847 and it retained, in full, the poor law mentality that existed at that time.  It ensured that people who sought assistance under it were demeaned and degraded.  Having studied that Act, I came to the conclusion that it was designed to do that.  This is 1975 and it took us until now to restore dignity to those people whose only crime was that in our society they had not the basic necessities of life.  I find it difficult to take this business of Deputies telling the House of the terrible imposition this will impose on the rates. This Bill will be interpreted as a wider term than the necessities of life. It will do so in such a way that people who need financial help can get it and still retain the right to their dignity as members of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is talking a lot of nonsense. Under this Bill the same officers will go into the same houses and ask the same questions in probing the means of the people.  Only those who are destitute will suffer the humiliation of a means test which will be with us and the Minister has done nothing to change that.  Home assistance officers were decent fellows who went about their business as quietly as possible, but they must continue their investigations under this Bill.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is not implying that the assistance will be given out without an investigation. The home assistance officer who now comes under the jurisdiction of the health boards instead of the local authorities will investigate means. They were considered to be the most useful persons to retain because they have local knowledge.  They can do <Col N="1461" /> a fire brigade service in that they can investigate a case today and pay an allowance the same day to a person who has suffered unusual hardship.</P>
      <P>What change has been made from the previous system?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary saying, as he has said about the dole in other places, that the Government are now giving the people this as a right?  Does the home assistance officer now tell people that they will be given the assistance as a present and that they will get it because it is their right?  Who will be entitled to this assistance?  If the local school teacher who has 15 children needs a new carpet for his living room floor, will he be entitled?  I am aware that a committee are probing into the poverty level and that they have not established anything in that respect as yet and until we receive a report from that committee we must rely on the home assistance officers.</P>
      <P>We are seeking to have the payments forwarded through the post because we are anxious to take away any stigma that may be attached to such assistance.  I cannot see the difference between this and the administration of the other Act.  I cannot see how the allowance will be paid without an investigation being made or the person applying.  If that is considered to be affecting the dignity of a person, then unfortunately it must remain and an investigation must take place.</P>
      <P>In Limerick different criteria may be used when assessing home assistance from that used in Donegal or Roscommon.  There seemed to be a lack of uniformity in county councils, not in the upper limits of the amounts paid, which were not very generous, but in the assessment of needs.  A person in Limerick might get the full amount while a person in Donegal with the same means might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What criteria will be used under section 2 which deals with a person whose income is insufficient to meet his needs?  Will the home assistance officers be sent on a course and told to administer this Act in another way? Will there be regulations dealing with income?  Will there be differences in applying it from one area to another? <Col N="1462" /> What allowance will be made for free residence, as in unemployment assistance? The home assistance officers are experienced in administering the Home Assistance Act as it is.  These officers are also used by other Departments, such as Defence, to assess the means of applicants for special allowances granted to persons who hold medals under the Anglo-Irish troubles of 1916-22, and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the stigma will be removed by this Bill.  How? Will there be a new way of assessing means?  Will it be unnecessary for the investigating officer to call?  By what means will he arrive at his decision that a person is in need of the supplementary allowance?  This could be easily understood if we got an explanation of a person's needs.  In cases of extreme poverty this is very easy, but in marginal cases it can be extremely difficult.  The Act provides that a person, if he is eligible and is not getting home assistance or other social welfare benefits, must apply for them.  By way of supplementary payments this Bill will give him the extra money he needs.  I find it difficult to understand how this Act will be administered. How will it be applied uniformly throughout the country?  Some discretion must be given to the investigating officers because it is impossible to have rules to cover every contingency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder did the Deputy read the whole Bill?  Is he aware of what is contained in it when he makes the charge that there is no real change?  Under the Home Assistance Act the Deputy said the rate paid to a man in Donegal and to a man in exactly the same circumstances in Limerick is different.  That is true, but it is also true that the rate paid can and has been different within the same operational area.  People going to the same authority in the same circumstances have got different rates of payment.  Some people have been paid and others have been refused. The Deputy does not seem to think the change in this Bill which gives people a minimum rate by right is very important, but this change coincides precisely with the rate payable to unemployment assistance recipients. <Col N="1463" /> The Deputy does not seem to think it is important that there would be a standard rate throughout the country, not a different rate, that it is not a different way of assessing needs, that it is not left entirely to the discretion of a particular officer or authority, that by law, with the passage of this Bill, these people will have rights to a minimum amount, their means will be assessed on a uniform basis, irrespective of the part of the country in which they live and, more important, that in any area, whether it be Donegal, Cork, Dublin or Limerick, two people in the same circumstances will be assured that they will be treated equally and can assert their rights.  It does not seem to register much with the Deputy, but under this Bill there is the right of appeal against rejection.  This might not appear to be of much importance in the Deputy's mind judging by his comments, but it is of tremendous importance to the person who will be seeking assistance under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The question arises as to who will administer it.  It is the same people who are administering the Home Assistance Act, the assistance officers, the vast majority of whom administered that Act, which could be described as inhuman, to the best of their ability and with the greatest possible consideration they were allowed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy may not agree when I have finished making the point.  They tried to conform to the law in the best possible way.  I know some of them found it extremely difficult to administer the Act because they found it so objectionable, and as individuals they made representations to me to change the system.  It was by good luck that we got people of the calibre of the home assistance officers, because under that Act the qualifications for home assistance officers contained a vague reference to a generally satisfactory level of education.  We cannot continue to rely on luck to ensure that the people who administer this <Col N="1464" /> measure will be of the same calibre. Therefore, by means of a working party made up of home assistance officer representatives and officials of the Department of Health, we are trying to devise a means by which officers will receive training when joining the service.  We hope this will improve the standard of the service to the people who seek assistance.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has said he does not see any major change in this Bill.  I assure him that if he had to approach a home assistance officer for assistance under the present Act and he was fortunate enough to get a very good type of officer, with the best will in the world operating within the confines of the Home Assistance Act, the Deputy would find himself stripped of his dignity, every shred of it.  I do not think this will obtain when this Bill comes into operation. Therefore, I regard the passage of this Bill as a major contribution towards reform of our approach to home assistance and to social welfare in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be too repetitive and hold the section up.  The Parliamentary Secretary went some distance towards satisfying my curiosity as to how the Bill will improve the system.  I agree we have had an excellent staff of home assistance officers.  However, I would point out that the applications coming to the officers involved severe investigation, and that is exactly what this section provides for.  The officer must go into a person's house and ask a set of questions.  There is no other approach.  It is the same approach as we had in the Act and just because this will be another Act does not mean a departure from the fundamental system of investigating a person's means to see whether he is below a particular line of income.  That is the provision we are making here and I hope the courtesy with which home assistance officers approached applicants in the past will continue and that they will not now as established civil servants adopt a certain brazenness.  Sometimes investigations <Col N="1465" /> are carried out by social welfare officers who give the impression that they are there to take something from a person instead of the reverse. I have said this many times publicly.</P>
      <P>There is no question of doubt that the investigation of a person's means involves interrogation and the proper approach rests with the individuals who make such investigations.  The officer must ascertain every iota of information about the person, his rights in property, whether he is renting a house or owns it, whether he has the right to free lodgings.  It is a thorough investigation and it will not be any different under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to know will everybody who is in receipt of welfare payments be entitled to have increased costs, higher prices, taken into consideration. If a man has £15 a week now and it was considered sufficient to meet his needs in October, will he in January next, when prices have gone up by 5 per cent or 10 per cent, have the right to apply to the health authorities under this Act pointing out that his income has been eroded as a result of hugh price increases, and will he have the right to a supplementary allowance in respect of this?  Will that be sufficient reason to enable him to qualify for a supplementary allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am concerned with are marginal cases.  These will be the difficult ones.  I have in mind the type of case which in the past was covered by home assistance because a person did not qualify for any other benefit. The situation at present is that if a person exhausts his benefit under the insurance code, he is advised to apply for home assistance.  There is no difficulty in a case like that but the difficulties will arise in determining entitlement. How is a person to prove that his income is insufficient to meet his needs?  What criteria will be applied by the investigation office in reaching decisions as to what are a person's needs over and above his income?  The section is open-ended in this respect and means that the Bill can be applied at any level at any time.  However, the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that there will be set guidelines.  I take <Col N="1466" /> it that there will be uniformity in this respect and that these rules will be passed to the health boards who, in turn, will pass them to their investigation officers.  Without such guidelines the people entrusted with these investigations and, consequently, with the responsibility of deciding the disbursement of huge sums of money, would be left to act on their own discretion. I am not totally satisfied with any effort the Parliamentary Secretary has made so far in relation to defining what are to be the upper limits. Regarding the guidelines, it is very important that the people seeking benefit understand what they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Department issue a booklet each year setting out the various entitlements. No doubt in their next issue they will indicate the guidelines for this supplementary benefit.  However, the pertinent question at the moment is what criteria will be used in deciding the gap between a person's income and his needs.  If, for instance, a person can establish the fact that he could use a lot more money than he is receiving, will he qualify in part for this extra money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan has covered a number of items but one point that seemed peculiar to me was his contention that within the terms of this Bill home assistance officers would consider themselves as having become established civil servants of the Department of Social Welfare and that, consequently, they would behave in an abrasive and intimidating manner.  I find that very difficult to accept. While there may always be exceptions, in the main it has not been my experience of civil servants that by reasons of their being established, they lose their natural humanity and sympathy towards people who find themselves in financial difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy still does not seem to understand the purpose for which the Bill is designed.  He claims that it will involve a means test, that people availing of the present system of home assistance will continue to get benefit anyway.  That is not necessarily so and the Deputy, by reason of his having <Col N="1467" /> been Minister for Social Welfare for a considerable time, knows this better than any other Member of the House. If during his term of office he found so many abrasive civil servants in the Department he should have taken some action to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's assertion that those in receipt of home assistance would continue to be paid anyway does not hold because in such cases a person may be paid £2 in one week while somebody in exactly the same circumstances might receive £3, £4 or £6.  On the other hand, they might receive the assistance this week only to be told next week they are not getting it. Different criteria are applied from one area to another in regard to the establishing of means.  As I have said repeatedly, the Act was designed, apparently, to degrade and to that extent it has succeeded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan raised the question as to whether a widow, on finding that prices had increased in her shop from one week to the next, could apply for extra benefit to compensate for the increases.  This is another of the hypothetical questions raised by the Deputy but if he has been following developments in this area during the past two and a half years he will realise that so far as prices are concerned&mdash;these are statistical facts&mdash; they have gone up approximately 48 per cent and the lowest percentage increase in social welfare has been 97 per cent and the figure has gone up to an increase of 360 per cent in children's allowances.  I do not think, therefore, the hypothetical case posed <Col N="1468" /> by Deputy Brennan is likely to arise under this Administration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked what are needs.  How do you define needs?  The nearest I can go to defining needs is by saying means fall short of legitimate requirements.  Those are needs. Circumstances differ and there is flexibility in this Bill to cater for circumstances over and above the floor put in as a right.  If a woman loses her husband suddenly and she is living in accommodation at a rent of £2 per week and she no longer has that £2 per week, obviously her need is £2 per week to keep the roof over her head.  In another case the rent might be £10 a week and in that case the woman would have to be given £10 per week to keep the roof over her head.  That is what I mean by needs.  A fire could occur and destroy the contents of a home.  The need there might be for just one payment to replace what had been lost in the fire.  Thas is as close that I can come to defining for Deputy Brennan what need is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to deal interminably with this.  In the Parliamentary Secretary's definition of needs is it the upper limit that will operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Means are calculated under section 12.  If that is what the Deputy is seeking, he will find it in section 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the position is no different from what it has been. That is the point I have been making. The Parliamentary Secretary in order to make this Bill appear as white as possible has got to blacken the Home Assistance Act as much as possible. Let us be honest.  The Home Assistance Act was legislation passed at a time when there was a rather different approach from that obtaining now. Investigators went out and asked questions.  Sections 12 and 20 merely set out the approach.  Section 12 does not define upper limits.  What I am trying to elicit is whether this will apply to many people over and above the category to whom home assistance applies at the moment?  Does the <Col N="1469" /> Parliamentary Secretary envisage a huge number of people being taken in?  He said that 60 per cent was payable by the Exchequer.  The amount county councils are contributing this year&mdash;perhaps it is a bad year&mdash;to home assistance is high because of inflation.  A greater number will qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County councils will still be responsible for any payments up to the amount they pay this year and 40 per cent on to what the increase will be over and above that according to the provisions of this Bill.  It is, therefore, most important to know at what level the means test will operate in defining needs.  Will it apply to all social welfare recipients if they can show their legitimate needs are not met by their present income?  If we wish to apply it in that way, we can do so.  The provision is here in this Bill.  There is no limit.  It will be a matter of a set of rules or regulations to be applied by investigation officers who will have sole discretion. An investigation officer can tell the health authority Pat Murphy has an income of £6 a week below his legitimate requirements to meet his needs and recommend that he should get £6 a week.  Pat Murphy will be able to appeal if he thinks he should get the upper limit in the proposed amendment of £7.75 and have his case reinvestigated. Can a non-contributory old age pensioner who believes his income is insufficient to meet his needs apply for this and will the investigation in his case stand?  In other words, will there be liaison between the two sets of investigating officers?  One set will go out from the health boards and the other from the Department of Social Welfare.  Will there be uniformity as between the two sets?  Will they have some definition of what means are?  How far will these supplementary payments extend?  To what extent will ratepayers have to meet the Bill for supplementary payments calculated on the incomes of people or will such supplementary payments be restricted to people who have suddenly fallen on bad times and whose needs are easily accessible because one knows the house was burned down or something like that or they were deprived of the <Col N="1470" /> breadwinner as a result of an accident? Here the Home Assistance Act operates and always did operate, however much we may denigrate the provisions and the operation of it.</P>
    <P>That is easy to understand.  There is no difficulty of definition there.  We want to get some idea of the extent to which these payments will apply in future.  They could be very generous. They could spread over a huge area, or they could be very restricted and confined to a small number of people only, such as those who benefit at present.  They could extend out to a huge variety of persons.  The local authorities will be anxious to get this information.  Everybody will be anxious to know the extent to which the Bill will be generous.  This will depend on the extent to which the net will be spread in relation to the gap between income and need.  I could not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to be in a position to give us an exact estimate of the extent to which people will benefit.  Is it intended to spread the benefit over a wide area?</P>

If, on the first investigation, he was deemed not to be entitled to an old age pension, taking into account the easement of the means test which has been brought about during the past two and a half years, and which is now very much weighted in favour of the applicant as against what it was when Deputy Brennan was Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy is well aware of the many pleas I made to him personally to change the age limit, and so on, and he took no action.  The answer to the Deputy's question whether this would apply to applicants whose claims for old age pensions were unsuccessful is no, in my opinion.  If an applicant is unable to qualify for a non-contributory pension, having regard to the easement of the means test within the past two and a half years, in my view he would not qualify for this allowance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On the one hand subsection (1) of section 3 seems to be quite definitive in its statement of intent:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any person who is receiving full-time instruction by day at any university, college, school or other <Col N="1474" /> educational establishment shall not be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance.</P>
    <P>If one jumps from subsection (1) to subsection (3), one finds that, under exceptional circumstances, subsection (1) does not apply.  We are concerned as to whether or not it is necessary to enshrine in our legislation a section of this nature because, on the one hand, the statement itself in subsection (1) seems to be discriminatory. It would appear to discriminate against indigent people who may be in receipt of university, college, school or other educational facilities.</P>
    <P>If the intention of this Bill is to be carried out in an equitable fashion, one wonders why there is a need for section 3.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will present a very reasonable answer, or one which he considers to be reasonable.  We would be interested to know what are his views on the section.  No doubt there is a good reason according to him and his advisers why the section should be there.</P>
    <P>If one is talking about free education, in the real sense of the word, it would appear that subsection (1) of section 3 would attempt to exclude such people.  Then at subsection (3) of section 3 the point is made that, notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), the Parliamentary Secretary, in exceptional circumstances, will allow the granting of a supplementary welfare allowance to those people mentioned at subsection (1).  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would elucidate the section itself.</P>

      <P>Let me follow the line of Deputy Andrews in this matter, not to offer any criticism of the section but merely to extract some information on it.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary spell out clearly the difference between subsections (1) and (3)?  In the case of a person on strike we had this type of difficulty even last year.  As the Parliamentary Secretary is aware, very often when such things occur a public representative goes around from one office to another inquiring how such a person on strike can be aided.  Under subsection (1) of section <Col N="1475" /> 3 he is debarred but, under subsection (3) of section 3 he is eligible.</P>
      <P>Is it possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to spell out things more definitely so that even the most uninformed public representative will be able to help such a person?  I am merely asking the Parliamentary Secretary to spell out the difference between subsections (1) and (3) of section 3 because there is a difference.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews made a point about students.  As one can see from the Bill, there is no age limit for qualification for supplementary welfare allowance in the Bill but a student would normally be the responsibility of his parents or one or other of them.  In the event of their qualifying for the allowance, the fact that he was a dependant would be taken into consideration in the granting of the allowance. There can be exceptions to that in so far as a student, in his own right, may be entitled to supplementary allowance by virtue of the fact that he may be the head of a household. Indeed, there may be people dependent on him or he could be an orphan with no parent who would be receiving an allowance in respect of him.  The question Deputy Moore raised referred to people who may be involved in an industrial dispute.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I referred to the fact that some ambiguity had been eliminated in that respect.  But it is reintroduced in section 3 with regard to a university student and so on.  What I am seeking is a definite decision saying that this man is entitled to benefit or he is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, it depends on the person's means and liabilities as to what he would be entitled to or otherwise.  A person directly involved in an industrial dispute would himself not qualify for payment under this Bill but his dependants, his wife and children would qualify.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has read the Bill, he will see that, for the first time, a uniform, standard rate <Col N="1476" /> will be paid as of right.  Also, the right of appeal by an applicant is embodied in the Bill.  Those are two major advances on the present system, under the Home Assistance Act, which we hope to abolish.  Over and above that minimum payment, there are also provided discretionary powers taking into consideration all the circumstances.  Therefore, except in regard to the basic entitlement under the terms of the Bill, it would not be possible to give the Deputy a figure.  It would vary from case to case as far as the discretionary element was concerned.</P>

      <P>This would appear to be a gratuitous reference to those in receipt of full-time instruction. Why must the Parliamentary Secretary highlight this group of people and place them here in a rather gratuitous situation?  I do not make this point by way of carping criticism, quite the contrary.</P>
      <P>If one is to operate the standards laid down in what is a good Act, on the grounds of equity, is there any real need to highlight the group of people I have mentioned?  On the one hand, they are excluded in subsection (1) of section 3 and, on the other hand, included in subsection (3) of that section.  The loophole in this section is symptomatic of the whole Act because, if one turns to section 15 there are exclusions to that also. The Parliamentary Secretary has explained up to a point the matters raised by myself and Deputy Moore. Perhaps he would be good enough to give a definite answer as to why the section is inserted at all?  There may be a good reason for doing so but he does not appear to have dealt with that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern was brought about <i>vis-à-vis</i> a student.  There is no age limit on students.  One can be a student at 50, 40, 30, 20, 18 or 10.  I accept that one can be the head of a household in or about the region of the upper limits.  A person of 18 years could be the head of a household or he could be an orphan.  I am concerned about all these people.  I would appreciate if the Parliamentary Secretary would deal specifically with <Col N="1477" /> whether it is gratuitous to include such people in the legislation.  Perhaps he would tell us if there is any great need for the section itself.  I accept that there may be a positive reason for having the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is there in order to ensure that no injustice is done to the people for whom Deputy Andrews has expressed concern.  As I explained, normally a student would be included as a dependant of an applicant for supplementary allowance. The fact that he was a dependant of his mother, father or guardian would be taken into consideration in determining entitlement and, if there was anything over the basic payment, would be included in any discretionary payment that might be made.  The section is there to ensure that while this is done dual claims will not be made in respect of the one person.  There is a saving clause to ensure that people who may be students and who do not fall into that category, who are heads of households and have dependants, who are orphans or who are relying only on their own resources, would be eligible to make application under the terms of the Bill.  It is there to ensure that people who would have legitimate recourse to the allowance would not be debarred from doing so.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to subsection (3) of this section which may be used to supplement payment to mentally handicapped or other partially handicapped people who might find themselves in employment. If I am interpreting the subsection correctly, it could be used to encourage disabled persons to find employment. Their output might not be up to standard and their employers might not find it possible to give them full remuneration and in such a case the Bill might be used to close that gap. If their output is not up to the standard of normal persons employers do not like employing them and paying them a lesser wage.  This section could be used in the case of such handicapped people who are only getting a partial wage and could bring that wage to the normal standard. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us his views on this matter.</P>

      <P>My intention was to protect the under-privileged by way of a statement of the law by giving permanent effect to subsection (3) and to ensure that regulations under subsection (2) would provide for the granting of supplementary welfare allowances on a permanent basis to people mentioned in subsection (3). That seems to be a reasonable proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate my amendment has been ruled out of order and, consequently, I cannot refer to it specifically.  On Report Stage would the Parliamentary Secretary consider the possibility of putting down an amendment to make a permanent statement of law of the position in <Col N="1479" /> relation to subsection (3)?  As Deputy Brennan said, if we are interpreting the section correctly the supplementary welfare allowance will be an addition to whatever moneys the person will receive in respect of his employment.  For that reason alone it is a first-class section and we support it wholeheartedly.  All we wish to do is to ensure that permanent effect be given to the intention envisaged in subsection (3).</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to enter into a discussion with the Chair because the Chair is only interpreting the Rules of the House as he sees them but, in the circumstances, I cannot understand why my amendment was ruled out of order.

As Deputy Andrews has said, we are trying to discuss the merits of this Bill&mdash;there are some good things in it certainly&mdash; in the broadest possible way so that it will be effective legislation.  Under subsection (3) there is a big problem raised in that parents feel that while they are alive they can help, with the aid of the State to look after their handicapped children but that when they die there will not be proper provision for the children or that the law might change.  Deputy Andrews's anxiety is to bring some comfort to these people by ensuring that on our Statute Book will go this permanent measure.  Again I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give us even some hope that he might amend this at a later Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies on the far side of the House have indicated, it is a very important section and one which will do a tremendous amount of good.  We all know there are disabled persons who are capable, as far as time is concerned, of taking on employment, but their output can be severely restricted in many cases, depending on the extent of the disablement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under subsection (3) it will lie within the powers of the health boards to take into account the shortfall in what they would normally expect to earn if they did not suffer from this disablement and what they would earn if they were full-time engaged in a remunerative occupation.  I think it is a very important advance in this area, and I appreciate that Deputies have seen that and been so ready to acknowledge it.  With regard to payment and the duration of payment under the terms of the Bill payment will continue as long as the need arises and if that is permanent there will <Col N="1482" /> continue to be permanent payment, and the terms of the Bill as it now stands do not debar people from receiving this allowance on a permanent basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section and I would not let it pass without probing a little further.  A subsection to section 4 does what might be provided in an entire Bill to assist the mentally and physically handicapped and other persons in obtaining employment, and it is something the Rehabilitation Institute would be very much interested in at present.  A separate Bill might be needed in order to fully set out the conditions under which payment may be paid.  The Rehabilitation Institute personnel would be interested in trying to find employment, and if they could negotiate what amount might be payable, it would enable them to place many of those partially handicapped people in employment.</P>
      <P>Would that be possible under this subsection or does it merely apply to persons who happen to be in work and make application to have the gap closed?  Would it be possible to come to the health board beforehand and say: &ldquo;Here is a person who is blind and would be able to do a job to some extent but would not have an output which would justify my paying him the full rate.  To what extent would you supplement his wages if I employ him?&rdquo; If there could be prior negotiations in that way, prior consultation, the subsection could result in having many partially disabled persons employed who at present are not.  We have said already when speaking on this subsection that we do not like these people being taken on unless they are paid the full rate, and their output does not justify it.  Not all employers are philanthropists.  Many of them do take on a percentage of disabled people and pay them the full rate just for the sake of helping out those who are engaged in rehabilitation work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a section which can be used with tremendous benefit.  It is probably not sufficient to deal with this problem.  When I was Minister in charge of Labour and also Social Welfare <Col N="1483" /> I had approaches from the rehabilitation people to ascertain to what extent the State would be prepared to assist in the employment of people who were not, due to mental or physical capacity, capable of earning a full wage.</P>
    <P>This subsection can help those people.  It may require a separate Bill to deal adequately with what is proposed in this subsection.  On the other hand, it could be used to permit of the necessary expansion, if widely interpreted, to enable hundreds of incapacitated or partly incapacitated people to find employment.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to elaborate further in relation to this subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously, this is an extremely important provision under the terms of the Bill. While it allows a supplementary allowance to be made to a disabled person who is in full time paid employment but who, by virtue of his handicap, physical or mental, would not be capable of earning sufficient wages it does not mean that all disabled persons are not capable of taking up employment and giving extremely good value to their employers and are entitled to and, in fact, earn, by any standards, a full week's wages.  Deputy Brennan mentioned blind people in the course of his contribution.  Very many blind people are employed and give more than adequate service to their employers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, a number of disabled people are employed.  I would not wish it to mean that a disabled person, irrespective of his capacity for output, could be taken on cheaply by an employer because he would be able to make it up under the provisions of this Bill.  The subsection we are discussing is to cater for a genuine need in our society to ensure that people who are disabled are able to work and are able to contribute but because of the type of their disablement are not capable of earning a full week's wages. Such people could qualify under the Bill.  It would be a mistake if we were <Col N="1484" /> to think that all disabled people cannot be gainfully and fully employed.  I understand, as far as employment is concerned, that the output of very many of them is greater than that of people who do not suffer from any disablement.</P>
      <P>Some employers who have employed disabled people have said that the disabled people are much more conscientious and productive workers than many of their fellow workers who have no disablement.  It is important that we make it quite clear that the provision in the Bill is only to cater for the needs of disabled people who, because of the degree and type of their disablement cannot with the best will in the world perform what would be regarded as a normal week's work and, accordingly, their earnings are affected.  The majority of disabled people are quite capable of doing a full week's work and when they are given the opportunity to do so it has been the experience of employers that apart from possessing all the qualities that make for a good employee their commitment and dedication to their employment is greater than that of their fellow workers who have no disablement.  This provision in the Bill can be of tremendous assistance to people suffering from certain types of disablement in varying degrees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that the Parliamentary Secretary's statement has been reassuring because I hoped that the subsection would have wider appeal than he seems to attach to it.  I asked if a separate Bill would not be necessary.  We all know that many incapacitated people, whether suffering from physical or mental incapacity, are holding down good jobs. Their concentration, because of their incapacity, is very often greater than that of those who are mobile.  I am particularly interested in the type of work available for particular types of incapacitated people.  We must realise that the number of incapacitated people seeking rehabilitation is only a small proportion of the total number of incapacitated people.  This is partly due to the lack of suitable work.  We know that blind people can operate telephone exchanges and some of them <Col N="1485" /> have been trained to use typewriters but their output may not be so good.</P>
      <P>Training is very important in such cases.  If the income of such people could be supplemented from the health boards, it would enable many of them to go into employment where they would serve apprenticeship.  We know that there are hundreds of such people throughout the country who have received no training who may not be listed by the rehabilitation people. Some of those people, such as people with one arm, people paralysed from the waist down and many other people in wheel chairs can carry out a certain amount of work.  We need to do a lot more for such people as the public conscience becomes more and more awakened in relation to providing for them.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm to apply the provisions of this subsection to these people to enable them to get into employment. At the start it is a question of training.  They may find themselves in certain types of employment not very suitable to their incapacity but in which after a certain time they become very proficient.  If such people got a supplement to their incomes at the start it would encourage many people to employ them.  It could be reviewed from time to time if their capacity to earn improved, not taking a weight off the employer by any means, not providing cheap labour&mdash;that is not what I have in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appreciates that there would be a great danger that cheap labour would be availed of by certain employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be open to that abuse, but it could be useful in cases where people are not in a position to earn full wages.  Disabled persons, such as polio victims who have proper education and training, are always capable of holding down any job requiring those qualifications and even of giving a better output than those who are not handicapped.  It would not apply to them but to those who have no training or no opportunity.  It would be of such tremendous assistance from the therapeutic point of view to have employment that any type of work would <Col N="1486" /> be useful.  Without the provisions of that section I cannot see them making much progress because none of us likes to be branded as employing cheap labour.  If we pay some of these people one-quarter of their weekly wage it looks bad and sometimes we do not do it when it is subject to that accusation.</P>
      <P>The words I was using were &ldquo;prior negotiation&rdquo;.  Perhaps prior arrangements could be made.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary does not contemplate the subsection being used to that extent.  Perhaps he is right it might require a separate Bill to cover all the possibilities and permutations that would necessarily come into this type of supplementary payment in respect of handicapped people.  I am in no way taking from the importance of the section; even in its most restricted interpretation it is still calculated to do an excellent job, but whether it could be extended in the wider sense to which I am alluding, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The only problem I could foresee it that some unscrupulous employer or employers might attempt to avail of the subsection to abuse the person suffering from physical or mental disability in his employment. There may be&mdash;no doubt there are&mdash; sanctions for such an abuse.  Would it be too late to consider that at this stage?  I appreciate that once we have got into a section we cannot offer amendments but the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the possibility on Report Stage of making the section subject to some form of sanction or to more rigid control.  It came to my attention some years ago that people recovering from a nervous breakdown condition were employed by certain employers offering a service to the public.  They were paid at the rate of £3 or £4 a week.  Possibly the employers felt they were doing a service to the employees in the context of rehabilitation but they were getting a full day's work from the employees who were recovering from the condition mentioned. It seems grossly unfair in those circumstances not to offer a higher wage.  The rehabilitation element is very important, but people suffering from such a handicap should not be <Col N="1487" /> treated as second-class citizens.  My only judgment of employers of that type is that they are employing cheap labour.  They might consider they were performing a Christian service according to their own ethics but if you pay somebody £3, £4 or £5 a week on a full-time basis it is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan and the Parliamentary Secretary both adverted to the fact that the disabled person is not a second-class citizen and disablement does not necessarily mean mental incapacity. Many people who had been fully fit may, due to some tragic accident, become paraplegic and suffer from a disability below the waist and find themselves in a wheelchair for life.  These people should be given the opportunity to engage in full-time, remunerative employment.  The terms of this Bill would not be envisaged in the context of their work in society.</P>
      <P>We might, in that connection, mention the Irish Wheelchair Association which has done such wonderful work for its members by attempting to bring about&mdash;and succeeding in the main&mdash; an awareness of the rights of people in wheelchairs.  In that context we should examine our own consciences. Deputy Brennan said the matter might be dealt with in a Private Members' Bill or a Government Bill, entitled the Disabled Persons Bill, and the terms of such a Bill might include access to public buildings by persons in wheelchairs, provision of ramps and so on. For instance, can people in wheelchairs get up to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery in this House or to the Public Gallery?  They are citizens just as much as any of us but they are excluded because of their disability from access to the House.  We might begin by providing access in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>I was merely expanding Deputy Brennan's suggestion of a Disabled Persons Bill.  I appreciate that it is not dealt with specifically in the Bill, but if we are talking of disablement and the value of section 4 (3) surely we are entitled to <Col N="1488" /> develop the subject a little on behalf of the people the subsection intends to benefit.  It is not often we have an opportunity of discussing physical or mental disability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I did discuss it on the Second Stage and I am now having a second opportunity of discussing it.  We should avail of every opportunity to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>My reason for making this short contribution on the subsection was to inquire of the Parliamentary Secretary whether he would consider the possibility of introducing on Report Stage some form of amendment containing a sanction to deal with abuses. Given human weaknesses, I have no doubt that there will be abuses under that subsection.  That does not speak well for human kind, but there is a lot of pressure from time to time.</P>
      <P>One can see a weakness in the subsection. The subsection has received the plaudits of the House, and rightly so.  It is a good subsection, but could we not make it a better one by copperfastening it and making it watertight against attack from people who might use it under the heading of cheap labour or otherwise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has made an important and serious contribution in the field of our treatment, as a society, of disabled persons.  I do not see any need for an amendment; but I accept that, were the Bill to be interpreted as suggested by Deputy Brennan, it would be open to abuse. It could be used by unscrupulous employers to obtain cheap labour from people who are suffering from either physical or mental handicaps but who would be giving those employers a damn good return by their labour for any money received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many things being done here today in the name of Christian charity and I am convinced that Christ would denounce them were He among us.  There are disabled people, particularly in rural <Col N="1489" /> Ireland, working in bars, hotel bars and in general hotel work who because of some disablement are being exploited in the name of Christian charity by some of our more affluent citizens.</P>
    <P>This subsection is designed to do one thing: where a person is legitimately in full-time employment and by virtue of disablement, physical or mental, cannot produce an output on a par with other people engaged in that type of employment and his remuneration is less as a result that, he can be taken into consideration under the terms of the Bill.  I do not disagree with the other matters mentioned in connection with the disabled but I do not think they fall within the ambit of the terms of the Bill. Training and things of that nature in the field of the disabled cannot be dealt with under this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the possibility of introducing sanctions.  The Parliamentary Secretary has agreed with the concern expressed by Members on this side about abuses, and I would be obliged if he would give some reasons why he does not consider it reasonable to have sanctions. This is a worthy subsection but it should be protected from attack by the unscrupulous.  The Parliamentary Secretary some time ago informed me that 500 prosecutions are being taken for abuses of the social welfare code. If that is the size of the attack on other sections of the social welfare code one can imagine the attack on this subsection, which is open to abuse by the unscrupulous.  There are unscrupulous people willing to take advantage of such subsections.  They are a small minority, but they are there.  If there is a prospect of one abuse of this subsection it is important that we should protect it by some form of sanction.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider the possibility of adding some protection on Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the possibility of abuse of the subsection arises.  The fears expressed here have been to the effect that unscrupulous <Col N="1490" /> employers who want cheap labour will avail of it.  They cannot do that because the payment is made to the employee and not to the employer. The opportunity for a potentially unscrupulous employer to avail of this subsection is not there.  There is no need for sanctions to meet the fears which the Deputy has sincerely raised.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is very fundamental and concerns persons affected by trade disputes.  Again, I must deal with this section in conjunction with another section, section 15.  If I took section 5 on its own I could not be blamed for wondering why a person who is legitimately out of work by reason of a trade dispute at his place of employment is not entitled to supplementary social welfare allowance.  Having made a clear statement on section 5 (1) that such a person is not entitled to a supplementary welfare allowance, then the Parliamentary Secretary makes exceptions to that rule.  When a man joins a trade union he undertakes to involve himself in a strike if his union consider it necessary.  I accept that he may be entitled to other benefits under the social welfare code, and that his dependants must be taken care of, but why must the Parliamentary Secretary be so definitive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of this section a person engaged in an industrial dispute would not qualify for a supplementary allowance. Normally such a man, if he is a member of a trade union, pays contributions to his union.  Embodied in those contributions is an element that allows for such contingencies as strikes.  A strike fund is built up and usually payments are made to members who are on strike.  Under the terms of this Bill there would be no barrier to the dependants of such a man being granted supplementary allowances.  If a man was on strike, there is no reason why he should <Col N="1491" /> have to witness his wife and five children suffering from the economic repercussions of a prolonged strike.  I do not think our society would wish to wage war, whether it be industrial or any other kind, against women and children.  That is the reason this very proper provision is in this Bill.  On the other hand, a legitimate charge could be made by those on the other side of the industrial dispute if the agents of the State were to be seen as subsidising an industrial dispute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews referred to the exemptions under section 15.  In any kind of liberal approach to this area, where there are general rules, there must be exceptions, if the legislation is worth enacting.  There must be provisions which will take into consideration certain unforeseen contingencies that would not generally apply, but do arise and could impose very severe hardship on individual members of our society.  This type of legislation, particularly the area covered in this Bill, should take those exceptional cases into consideration and ensure that as far as possible there are provisions which will see to it that people are not forced to suffer unnecessary and extreme hardship during those periods.</P>

      <P>Can the money paid to a man affected by a stoppage of work or a trade union dispute in his place of employment be recovered in certain circumstances?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 9, after &ldquo;person&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and payment of such supplementary welfare allowance shall, wherever possible, be made by postal order or cheque&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Earlier the Parliamentary Secretary rightly said that if we are serious about up-dating social welfare legislation we should exclude the element of the poor law mentality and give people benefits to which they are entitled out of right and not by way of charity.  He said the 1939 Public Assistance Act was a disgrace.  He is entitled to that interpretation but we must be fair to the legislators of that time.  We are talking about legislation which is 40 years old and we must have regard to the atmosphere of society and the demands of the time. Our legislators were the touchstone of that interpretation and they came along here and produced an Act in the fullness of their wisdom.  It is easy to use an Act 40 years old, blacken it and then come in here to produce by comparison something that is regarded as whiter than white.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context, this amendment has high relevance.  I accept that supplementary allowances are generally paid by assistance officers handing out the payments in cash or kind to those directly entitled to them. Nowadays the queues at labour exchanges <Col N="1494" /> extend out onto the streets.  I agree there has been such progress in our society that people no longer feel the humiliation that existed some years ago but there are people who do not like the idea of standing on the footpath.  In my constituency of Dún Laoghaire the queue extends from the labour exchange back to St. Michael's Hospital.  Arising out of my efforts there is to be a new labour exchange there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>Thanks.  My efforts have been successful in that respect and I know Deputies in the constituency tried to come in at the end of it.  We can accommodate them at any time.  My amendment would avoid the present system because payments would be made by postal order or cheque.  That is a reasonable proposition. The Parliamentary Secretary delivered himself of a long discourse on the poor law mentality and I am sure he would agree that if we are sincere in this section the amendment can be nothing but totally acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

      <P>The amendment of Deputy Andrews is a good one if only for the reason that old people are nowadays robbed and beaten.  We are approaching the stage when normal coin and currency are disappearing in favour of cheque payments.  There have been all sorts of social reforms since the days of Elizabeth Fry who did so much for prison reform.  Today one would find some of her attitudes almost offensive.  She did great work but always with that condescending attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians must guard against an attitude of that kind.  They must not become mere do-gooders but must show themselves to be men who have a deep concern for social reform.  I am convinced that the Parliamentary Secretary has such concern.  However a Government must never become merely a full-purse Government.  If we look at the 40-year-old Act we are amending we will find that on its <Col N="1495" /> introduction it was much more radical and far-seeing than some present-day Acts.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will find it possible to accept Deputy Andrews's amendment.  Not only must we endeavour to continue to better social welfare payments but we must modernise that method of disbursement. The acceptance of this amendment would improve the Bill. I cannot see any administrative difficulty in paying by cheque or postal order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This question arose during the Second Stage debate when it was discussed at considerable length and when I indicated that I agreed fully with the thinking behind the suggestion.  During the time between the adjournment of the debate one evening and its resumption the following morning I ascertained, from inquiries I made, that in the vast majority of cases it would be possible and practicable to make these payments by cheque.  As I indicated then, I consider this to be the most desirable way of making payments.  However, I do not think it would be possible to accept the amendment and to enshrine in legislation the words &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I assure the House that I am very anxious that in so far as possible payments would be by cheque&mdash;I am referring to all long duration payments&mdash;but there are other types of payments envisaged under this Bill. For instance, in certain circumstances such as the aftermath of a fire, a once-in-a-lifetime payment might be made.  This would be by way of a lump sum paid to help a person cope with a difficult situation, having first ascertained the extent of damage and the losses incurred and so on.  There are also envisaged payments in respect of the dependants of those on strike. Family circumstances can change not only from one week to another but from one day to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred today to the question of abuse of the social welfare code and pointed out that 500 prosecutions had taken place in this context.  So far as possible it is our desire to be liberal in the operation of <Col N="1496" /> the scheme but we must always bear in mind our responsibility to the taxpayers, the ratepayers and to society generally, and consequently we must take reasonable precautions to avoid abuses of the scheme.</P>
    <P>So far as I am concerned payments will be by cheque or postal order where this is possible, but it would not be desirable to enshrine in our legislation the words suggested by the Deputy in his amendment.</P>

      <P>To some extent I appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary's point of view.  I do not have available to me the benefit of a parliamentary draftsman but in drafting amendments I am guided by my head and my heart.  I endeavour to frame amendments comprehensively. Obviously, the wording in this case does not comply with the accepted standards.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that those in receipt of supplementary benefits and other social welfare entitlements during long periods would be paid by cheque or postal order.  Generally such persons would not need to go to a bank or post office in order to cash a pay order because they would be facilitated in this way by their local grocer or some such person.  I do not see why we should not have incorporated as a statement of law a direction in regard to the method of payment.  Were this done the people for whom we are legislating would have no doubt about the method of payment to which they were entitled.  I accept that the Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to ensure that payments are by way of pay order; but, if I withdraw my amendment, will he introduce another in terms acceptable to him and to the Department which will have the same effect?  The legislation would be all the better for having such a provision.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he was engaged in Government business.  I appreciate the difficulties.  I spent a long time in Opposition and I know all the disadvantages and, indeed, some of the advantages of that particular role in political life.  Social welfare payments are paid by cheque and postal order.  Long duration payments are paid by cheque only.  There are practical difficulties in paying every recipient by cheque.  The Deputy said this morning abuses take place.  They do.  The Deputy pointed out we had 500 prosecutions where abuses occurred.  Long-term payments do not present a problem from the point of view of payment by cheque or postal order.  We discussed shortterm payments on a previous section. If I were a worker on strike and my wife and children qualified for benefit for a limited period, I could be on strike for two days, two weeks or two months.  We have to face the realities. There are human failings.  People do not necessarily run to notify you that at a particular time on a particular date they ceased to qualify.  We have a responsibility to safeguard as far as possible against abuses arising.  I accept totally the principle behind what the Deputy is advocating.  It is highly desirable that payments should be made as far as possible by cheque or postal order and I shall do everything to ensure this is done.  But I cannot enshrine in this Bill a provision that that is the way in which payment must be made because, if one did that, one would leave the position unnecessarily open to abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is unintentionally misinterpreting the intention of the amendment.  He used the phrase &ldquo;Payment must be made&rdquo;.  That is not my intention at all.  The intention is that payments should be made in that way in certain circumstances. The amendment does not say that, but that is the intention.  I say &ldquo;whereever <Col N="1498" /> possible&rdquo; and the Parliamentary Secretary says &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo;.  I accept entirely what the Parliamentary Secretary says about the impracticability of making all payments by cheque or postal order.  That just would not work.  The Parliamentary Secretary used the example of a fire. In those circumstances you would not pay by cheque or postal order.  In exceptional circumstances you might but, as a general rule, no.  There is absolutely no reason why long duration recipients should not be paid by postal order or cheque and why that cannot be provided in the Bill is something I do not understand.</P>
      <P>My amendment is not restrictive. It is flexible.  I have said I will withdraw it if the Parliamentary Secretary will bring in an amendment on the same lines.  There is no reason why it should not be given legal effect, the more so as it is already the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the taking away of the old stigma attaching to home assistance. One way in which to remove that stigma would be by changing the methods adopted in the administration of home assistance and stop the queuing up outside some local meeting point to await one's entitlement.  Any degradation in the system is patently manifest in this queue.  People are dragged out, sometimes almost physically incapable, to collect their entitlement. Indeed, in many cases the physically incapable have to send someone else to collect for them.  One of the old arguments with regard to personal collection was that it provided an opportunity for contact with a person with whom you might not otherwise have any contact.  In the case of unemployment assistance a certificate signed by a member of the Garda Síochána is taken as proof that people are genuinely seeking work and therefore still qualify for the weekly assistance they get.  As I said, there are people who are physically incapable of collecting.  In the areas I know there are appointed centres to which the people come once a week to collect. I was rather hoping that system would be done away with.  Even in the case <Col N="1499" /> of a single payment to tide over unexpected tragedy payment should be made by way of cheque or postal order. We know how long people have to wait for compensation for malicious damage.  The fact that it is sanctioned, that somebody has said he will get it, enables him to get extended credit. Even in the case of the single payment it is possible to have an order sent by post to reach an address the day after posting.  If there is any stigma in the present system, this would remove it. It would be reassuring to have it inserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The wording in Deputy Andrews' proposed amendment is that &ldquo;payment of such supplementary welfare allowance shall, wherever possible, be made by postal order or cheque&rdquo;. As it stands, that amendment would be sufficient if the Parliamentary Secretary would accept it.  Deputy Andrews has left it to the Parliamentary Secretary's discretion to change the wording.  The fact that it would be written into the Bill would be reassuring.</P>
      <P>On the question of the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that payment will be made as far as possible by post, there is no guarantee that certain health authorities may not adopt the other system of personal payment, making the point that personal contact is necessary in order to ensure the recipient's continuing qualification. That is not a valid argument any more. I believe acceptance of the amendment would remove one piece of degradation from the system.  The Parliamentary Secretary should accept the amendment as it is, or undertake to have it rewritten and applied.</P>

As far as possible, it is desirable for payments to be made by cheque.  I am prepared to deal with that by way of regulations or by guidelines to health authorities.  If &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo; were enshrined in this legislation Deputy Andrews might spend more time in the courts in trying to define <Col N="1500" /> what it means than he spent here arguing over this section of the Bill. If that phrase were enshrined in the Bill, one could say: &ldquo;It is possible to pay me by cheque and you are breaking the law by not doing so.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In fact, the circumstances of the case and the nature of the case that qualified in the first place for allowance under this Bill might change at very short notice.  I have tried to instance the type of thing we should guard against while being as liberal as possible.  The family of a man on strike can qualify.  He can be on strike for half a day, a week, a month, or a year, but if we are not notified when the circumstances change, the health boards may have to go to court to recover the money that continued to be paid because a constant check was not kept on the changing circumstances in the particular case.  Still being as liberal as one would like to be, there is an obligation to ensure where possible that this kind of abuse does not arise.  I told the House my thinking on this matter.</P>
      <P>I accept the thinking behind the contributions made by Deputy Andrews and Deputy Brennan.  I am prepared to look at it by way of regulations or guidelines to the health authorities but I am not prepared to see that kind of thing, which is, ambiguous, to say the least, enshrined in legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a real case of the pot calling the kettle black.  Times have certainly changed as far as the Parliamentary Secretary is concerned. His condemnation of the purity of my drafting is rather surprising and disappointing. I have already said that, if the Parliamentary Secretary is as concerned as he appears to be about the way the amendment has been drafted, he can redraft it himself.  I have admitted to a piece of impure drafting and accepted the Parliamentary Secretary's strictures with all the humility available to me in all the circumstances.  The Parliamentary Secretary appears to be giving some form of undertaking that he will deal with the matter by regulation.  I wonder whether he can deal with it <Col N="1501" /> by way of regulation.  If he can, will he say that he will definitely deal with it by way of regulation?  These are simple and reasonable requests from the Opposition to the person in the saddle.  There is no reason why they should be met with anything but agreement and discernment.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told Deputies that so far as possible payment will be made by cheque.  In County Cork, in Kerry, and I am sure generally all around the country, most payments are made by cheque.  We now have the very desirable system of the payment of disablement allowance by the issue of books similar to pension books and the recipient can collect his allowance weekly.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the difficulty of interpreting the term &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo;. The Deputy should accept that it is his aim and his endeavour&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We did not advocate the use of a book, such as is used for pensions.  Lack of continuity of payments in this case would not make for the use of a book.  The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary placed much emphasis on the removal of any stigma attached to home assistance and on the concept of dignity of the person so far as these payments were concerned.  This is one means by which, if there is a stigma, it can best be eradicated.  A more dignified approach can be established by having the allowance put in the post.</P>
      <P>It is not a valid argument to say that personal contact is necessary to ensure that a person continues to be qualified or indeed to ensure that he is alive at all.  That can happen in relation to other payments also.  Very often some other member of the family or another person collects; there is no obligation on them to attend in person.  Yet the queues line up.  It is humiliating for people who collect small or large amounts to have to expose themselves to this degradation. If emphasis is being placed on giving this in a more dignified way than has been practised heretofore, this is one case where it can be exemplified better than any other.  If that is seen to be done, certainly there should be no objection to having it written into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This simple amendment is an addition to section 6, which deals with <Col N="1503" /> administration, and would tend to ensure that an effort was really being made to have a change in keeping with the dignity of the person.  The Parliamentary Secretary told us this morning that it was to be paid as of right and that the humiliating provisions of the Home Assistance Acts were now only a bad dream.  The fact that benefit will be spread over a greater number of people would emphasise further the need to use the postal service more.  In fact I would go so far as to use it in every single case, even in respect of a person getting an allowance for one day, because there is now delivery the following morning.  If there is any check needed the home assistance officer can carry out a scrutiny of his recipients by a periodic visit, which he would have to do anyway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any dispute between Deputy Brennan and the Parliamentary Secretary. Nobody could disagree with the sentiments expressed by them.  I do not, nor does the Parliamentary Secretary, want people to call at some public office to collect a few shillings. My knowledge of the payments system is not national; it is confined to the Southern Health Board area, where all such allowances are paid through the post.  For example, where an old age pensioner gets an addition of £1 or £1.50 weekly it is paid to him through the post and, by agreement, that is done monthly.  Small supplementary allowances are paid monthly and this seems to satisfy recipients. The health boards prefer, and they are obliged, to pay through the post.  The only question in dispute here is in regard to cases where an applicant may call on the local assistance officers for urgent help.  They are obliged to deal with that case and determine whether or not it has merit, issue money to buy goods or a voucher with which to buy goods required by the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan should be satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary has gone as far as he can.  He has clearly indicated that the postal system will be <Col N="1504" /> used wherever possible.  The Deputy wants the Parliamentary Secretary to define the term: wherever it can possibly be used.  As I indicated to Deputy Andrews, that may need some determination by a court, and in this type of Bill that would be unlikely.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan will appreciate that the book system for payment of allowances is quite a good one.  What is at present termed home assistance allowance is paid through the post and, if the amounts involved are small, is paid monthly.  I agree entirely with Deputy Brennan that we must preserve the dignity of the person.  This is principally what this Bill is about&mdash;to do away with terms such as &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; and so on, to change the name and, if you like, system of payment.  I see no reason why anybody should doubt the Parliamentary Secretary's assurances so far as that method of payment is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something more than what the Parliamentary Secretary has been saying involved here.  It is not quite as simple as that. Inserting this would not be superfluous because under the Bill as it stands at present the health authority may, if they wish, pay the entire allowance personally.  There is nothing to prevent them from doing so.  I agree that perhaps the word &ldquo;possible&rdquo; could be changed to &ldquo;feasible&rdquo;&mdash;reading &ldquo;wherever feasible&rdquo;&mdash;leaving that option, where it might be more expeditious to have the money collected on a Sunday, bank holiday or some other such day, affording the exceptional case the optional delivery by hand.  Otherwise, the health board, if they so wish, can cause the entire payments to be made by hand.  I am not saying they do that but it is possible. If it were inserted in the Bill it would be an assurance to applicants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">

      <P>I assume that this matter can be dealt with without difficulty.  It is not one likely to go before the courts for determination of what is meant by this or that section or wording.  Its language is quite clear and expresses what the legislator has in mind.  My assumption would be that <Col N="1505" /> the Department would send a letter to each health board setting out what they would like to see happen so far as payments are concerned.  I have no doubt but that such a letter would be accepted generally.  Of course, they could go beyond that and make regulations, or offer guidelines.  But I have no doubt that this can be done by a letter to the eight health boards informing them of the Department's desires so far as the method of payment is concerned.</P>
      <P>There must always be a loophole for the urgent case.  It may be that a case would be urgent today but not next week and such a situation must be checked personally by the local assistance officer.  What Deputy Brennan has argued will be done.  I agree wholeheartedly with his suggestion, as does the Parliamentary Secretary.  There is no dispute here. There is only the possibility that writing something into Bills may present difficulties for those who will be interpreting the measures in the health boards later on and that is what we are trying to avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is guilty of loose thinking and I do not think that should happen on this Bill.  He has said the Bill expresses what the legislature intends but that is not so.  It expresses what the majority intend but it does not express the views of the minority, namely, the Opposition. For that reason we must stick hard on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not been altogether complimentary in relation to my drafting and the suggestion is that the phrase &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo; is out of order.  I do not accuse the Parliamentary Secretary of original thinking in his criticism of me.  I have already conceded that if the expression &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo; is not acceptable in the context of the parliamentary draftsman's requirements, in those circumstances I am willing to withdraw the wording while requesting the Parliamentary <Col N="1506" /> Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare to draft his own wording.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has said he will urge the Department of Social Welfare to send a letter to the eight health boards asking them to give effect to the intention of my amendment.  I am not at all satisfied with that undertaking.  It is a letter from a Government Department with no sanctions in it, good, bad or indifferent. I want the principles expressed in my amendment to be mandatory, without any equivocation or shilly-shallying. I do not want my views and the principles enshrined in the amendment to be carried out by way of a letter from the Department of Social Welfare or any other Department.  I have no doubts about the efficacy of the staff in the Department of Social Welfare but, equally, I appreciate that a letter from the Department to me as a Deputy or if I were a representative of the health board would have little, if any, effect.</P>
    <P>I reject the undertaking given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. He has been guilty of loose thinking with regard to this Bill and his suggestion does not merit serious examination. If he said that he would issue definite guidelines by way of regulations, that would be acceptable but nothing short of that would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretaries to the Ministers for Social Welfare and Agriculture and Fisheries have said they are in total agreement with the sentiments expressed in my amendment and, as they see it, the only area of difference is in the wording.  The phrase &ldquo;wherever possible&rdquo; is unacceptable to them.  I have conceded that if they are right I will withdraw the amendment and let them put in suitable wording. We want the payment of entitlements under this Bill to be made by way of cheque or postal order.  It is accepted by all sides that this is the proper way to handle the situation, that this would be the way it would be dealt with in the payment of benefit to people in receipt of long duration supplementary welfare allowances.  In fact, the Parliamentary <Col N="1507" /> Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare has suggested that this is the way it will be done.  If that is so, let there be no doubt about it.  Let us put it in this Bill.  That is all we want. The Parliamentary Secretary has said that while he accepts our amendment in principle he does not regard the wording as correct.  On the basis of his acceptance of the principle, let him put it into the Bill in his own words.  What could be more reasonable?</P>

      <P>I heard the Deputy say this in his contribution. Before he left the House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare told us that his views coincided with those of Deputies Brennan and Andrews so far as the amendment was concerned.  The Parliamentary Secretary told Deputies that, if necessary, guidelines will be set and regulations provided to ensure enforcement. The reason it was not overemphasised is that it is happening today.  So far as possible health boards are paying allowances through the post. I thought a letter would suffice.  Everyone is in agreement regarding payment through the post or by the book system.  Surely this should be accepted by Deputies opposite as an assurance by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare that regulations or guidelines will be provided if deemed necessary.  There is no room for argument here.  One would think that the Parliamentary Secretary was in favour of personal payments but that is not so.  He favours personal payments only in exceptional cases which he states could arise from time to time.</P>

The Southern Health Board pay supplementary <Col N="1508" /> allowances to old age pensioners and others through the post but this may not happen in the Eastern or Western Health Boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Western Health Board area payment is by the old method where the home assistance officer makes a personal call on recipients and payments are not made in any other way in that area.  I am positive that this is what happens in Mayo.  This Bill should move away from the old system with regard to payments to people in receipt of home assistance.  There has been no fundamental change in the concept of the Bill and as far as I can see the only change has been in the name. Unfortunately, the old system still operates.</P>
      <P>In my county's estimates we provided £280,000 for home assistance. The work will be done by the health board and the county council will have no say whatsoever in the manner in which that money will be expended. We will just be presented with a bill annually from the health boards, and going on experience of what has happened since the health boards were formed, where the number of personnel has been increased considerably, we are likely to see this situation occurring here as well.  As a result of this, we shall have an added increase in our annual estimates, but fundamentally I do not see any basic change at all in this Bill except that we are changing the wording from &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; to &ldquo;supplementary social welfare allowances&rdquo;. Unfortunately, we still have this situation of the home assistance officer making personal calls to recipients.</P>

      <P>What Deputy Gallagher has said is not correct.  Up to the present the county council levied money on the rates for home assistance, and home assistance was 100 per cent a local charge, but county councils had the right to determine applications if they so decided. Some councils did not take that right and they passed it on to the health board.  That was the decision of the councils, and the health boards <Col N="1509" /> sent along the bill, which the councils paid.  Now it has changed in this way, that the taxpayer is helping as well as the ratepayer, and this measure provides for 60/40 per cent.</P>

Everybody knows Deputy Cluskey is a reasonable man and that he will ensure that these payments are made <Col N="1510" /> through the post whenever possible. We cannot overlook the fact that assistance officers must periodically review claims.  Maybe the recipient's position has worsened or maybe it has improved.  We cannot keep the applicant away altogether from the investigating officer, because periodic reviews are desirable.  It can work both ways. The allowance may be increased or cut off, depending on the circumstances of the applicant.  So far as the payments are concerned, it is clearly set down there, and I have no doubt that the Western Health Board or any other health board will be only too ready to accept the postal system where it does not already obtain.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the taxpayer will be responsible for payment of the supplementary social welfare allowance. In our estimate in County Mayo last year we made a sum of £201,000 available, and this year a sum of £280,000.  Those were entirely rate charges.  The administration will also be the responsibility of the ratepayer. The county council will have to pay for that, and the taxpayer comes in just at a figure over the one which has been allowed by us this year on a 60/40 basis.  From that we can see that there is no fundamental change, that the ratepayer is the one who will really have to pay the bill in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought the ratepayer would have to foot the bill in the long run, because the only way he would be obliged to foot it fully is if the amounts were not increased.  I sincerely hope that the need for these supplementary benefits will not arise in future years.  Our system should be changed and our national allowances such that people will be treated fairly in regard to their original allowances and get what is their due, so that only in exceptional cases will the need for supplementary allowances arise.  In any case, in the foreseeable future they are likely to arise, and while we would like to see this sum for County Mayo that Deputy Gallagher speaks about remaining static, it is likely to increase in the years to come.  Then the taxpayer will have to help.  I said during the Parliamentary Secretary's absence that he is in full agreement with the views of the Opposition.  I also said that the 144 Members of this House agree that the payment should be made through the post if at all possible and that it is only in exceptional cases, as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary, that payment will be made by hand.  This particular amendment <Col N="1512" /> is accepted in principle and if necessary the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that it will be implemented through a letter to the health boards. If the other means has to be adopted, it will be done by the Parliamentary Secretary in exceptional cases.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries said that a lot of this will not arise in the future.  I would not agree with him on that because I know it arises every day.  As Deputy Gallagher said, it is a question of the amount the local ratepayers will have to pay.  During Second Reading I pointed out the hardship for a person receiving social welfare payments who, because of disability receives disability allowance. Take, for instance, a small farmer on social welfare with a couple of children who is entitled to £13.  If he gets a heart attack and goes on to disability allowance no allowance is given for the children.  The disability allowance is a personal allowance.  Those people lose up to £5 when they go on to disability allowance.  When I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if the Bill would cover this he said it would. There are quite a number of such people in every county who are on unemployment assistance and for some reason or other have to go on to disability allowance.  They cannot receive unemployment assistance because they are not available for work. In the unemployment assistance there is an allowance for every child but there is no such allowance in the disability payment.  If this Bill covers such people it will be of great benefit to them although I understand the ratepayers will have to bear the burden.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify this.</P>

      <P>A means test applies under the provisions of this Bill.  A person, irrespective of his means, can be in receipt of benefit.  If he ceases to qualify for that benefit, it does not necessarily mean that he will get the same amount of money provided to him under the terms of this Bill because his means might be such as to disqualify him from assistance.  The over-riding consideration under this Bill is need.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher and Deputy Callanan mentioned the imposition on the rates.  There will undoubtedly be some charge on the rates.  This thing is being presented as if it was new.

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that if it is frozen at the 1975 figure it will undoubtedly be to the advantage of local authorities.  The local authorities are being asked to bear 40 per cent and the Exchequer is bearing 60 per cent.  That, compared with the 100 per cent under the previous legislation which this legislation replaces, could not be described as a terrible imposition on the local authorities.</P>

Even if it has to be repeated it is important that the wrong impression should not be created. These are the realities: instead of 100 per cent charge on local authorities for home assistance, the base year 1975 is being taken and 60 per cent <Col N="1515" /> of the additional expenditure is being borne by the Exchequer.

      <P>I take exception to the Parliamentary Secretary's remarks because my county council on a number of occasions put down resolutions seeking to have payment of home assistance made a national charge.  I put down a parliamentary question in regard to the matter very shortly after coming to the House.  I did not have an opportunity of coming in on the Second Reading and that would have been the time to have made my contribution.  As far as Mayo is concerned, and as a member of the county council, I cannot see that we are getting any great concession in this matter.  The sum of £280,000 in our estimates this year is quite a big figure for a county in which we have a demand of £12.57, the highest in Ireland. We are not getting any help in this case.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said on the Second Reading that it did cover the question of the difference between what a person would get in disability payments and what he would be entitled to as unemployment assistance.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this: I do not know how they assess income in both cases because he said it was a question of means test.  I had a case of a man with four children who was eligible for about £13 social welfare. This man got a heart attack and when he went to sign again he was informed that he could not do so because he was not available for work.  There is no allowance for dependent children in the case of disability benefit and the £9 or so that one can get is a personal allowance.  Before this man became an invalid he was able to do all his own work and was entitled to £13 or £14. When he became disabled and was <Col N="1516" /> ordered to stop work completely he had to pay for everything that was done and he had £4 or £5 less income. I asked the Parliamentary Secretary did the Bill cover this type of case and he replied that it did.  I want to know if the method of assessing the man's income will be the same for the social welfare benefit as it is for unemployment benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In section 6 (3) it states than any doubt or dispute as to <Col N="1517" /> which health board shall be responsible for the provision of supplementary welfare allowances to a particular person or to persons of a particular class shall be decided by the Minister. Is that subsection necessary?  Should the Minister be concerned about disputes between health boards as to responsibility for provision of the supplementary allowances?  Could they not be resolved in another way?</P>
      <P>My view is that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare has enough to do in those capacities without having to deal with what might be considered by some as a minor row between health boards but what is a major row from the viewpoint of the person entitled to the supplementary benefit when the row is resolved. Is it the Parlamentary Secretary's intention to give that responsibility to a civil service ombudsman or somebody within the civil service who might be able to handle such disputes and take the pressure off an already heavily burdened Minister?</P>

      <P>I welcome the recognition and appreciation of the heavy burden that rests on the Minister, but it is not envisaged that disputes of this kind would be of frequent occurrence. They would arise very rarely, but it is necessary in legislation to cater for all foreseeable contingencies, no matter how infrequently they may arise.  I do not think it would present any great difficulty to determine the small number of cases that could reasonably be anticipated.

The problem I see in having the authority vested entirely in the Minister is that it may delay the actual process of making payments to people concerned.  Would it not be better to have some arrangement between the CEOs of the health boards by which a decision could be reached more quickly rather than having to go to the Minister?  This would delay the process of payment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), lines 23 and 24, to delete &ldquo;(being either another officer of the health board or a person not such an officer)&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;(not being an officer of the health board)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from public assistance officers in relation to this amendment.  One official expressed the view that the amendment did not place too much confidence in public assistance officers, but like Deputy Brennan, I have found that the vast majority of assistance officers carry out a very difficult task in a good manner. In my constituency I found the public assistance officers to be very good officials.  They have been operating under a 40-year-old Act which should be amended.  They have been doing a good job under the terms of reference of the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  However, in spite of the criticism of my amendment by the public assistance officers I intend to stick out on my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems unfair that the system, and the people operating it, cannot be appealed against outside that environment. I am not in any way imputing any disrespect to public assistance officers but it is in the interests of fair play that the person appealing against a decision of a public assistance officer should not have to go to that official's colleague.  Whilst I accept the criticism levelled at the amendment by people who have been involved in the dispersal of public moneys over the years, people who have been doing a good job and have enjoyed the respect of the community, nevertheless, I believe an appeal should not be passed from one colleague to another.  The amendment <Col N="1519" /> is an effort to propose an alternative way of appealing, to appeal outside the system.</P>
    <P>I view this as a reasonable and proper submission which fits in with the concept of natural justice, that a person is entitled to be heard in his own cause or that his appeal should not be heard in his absence.  In fairness to the Parliamentary Secretary, my amendment does not propose an alternative but I have already committed myself against the idea contained in section 6 (3) of appealing to the Minister and it would seem invidious now for me to propose that the appeal be taken to the Minister for Social Welfare.  That is not my proposal because it would be inconsistent with what I said on the previous section.  My proposal is clearly set out in the amendment.  In spite of the genuine criticism levelled against that amendment by people who have been operating the system, I am standing my ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree with anyone levelling criticism against Deputy Andrews on what motivated him to put down the amendment. Frankly, when I was in Opposition I held the same view but since I became closely associated with the Department of Social Welfare, and obtained some better insight into the workings of the Department of Health, I found the present system extremely successful and not open to abuse.  The public have no reason to feel any disquiet about the way the system is operating.  If one looks at the number of appeals upheld one will see that the fact an appeal may have been heard by a colleague did not influence the officer hearing the appeal in the slightest.  Deputy Andrews seemed to imply that appeals are heard in the absence of the person directly affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

He may be accompanied by a trade union representative or any person who might be able to present the case or help in its presentation. The provision in the Bill does not necessarily confine it to a member of the health board but it does not exclude a member of the board.  If we examine objectively, and impartially, the record of the appeals machinery, we will see that it has worked satisfactorily. I have not heard any serious objections being raised to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the integrity of any public assistance officer is in doubt or the integrity of any member of the Department of Social Welfare engaged in social welfare entitlement appeals.  My concern is the impression this creates in the mind of a person appealing.  He may feel aggrieved that when his application is turned down by one officer it is passed on to another official in the same Department.  If Deputy Callanan and Deputy Gallagher are close, one can envisage doubts being raised in the mind of the person appealing from A to G.  That was the reason for my amendment.  It has raised eyebrows in quarters within the public assistance service but that is their entitlement.  I have no objection to that.  I welcome their constructive criticism.  At no time did they suggest that I should withdraw my amendment.  Quite the contrary. They offered their views which did not coincide with mine.  Nevertheless, I believe I am reasonably right and I am coming to the point of view that the other people were reasonably right too.  Under the circumstances I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>At the moment in most areas the public assistance officer is responsible to a supervisor.  Under this section is it envisaged that somebody else will conduct that business or will a person have a right of appeal to the supervisor as happens at the moment?  From my experience in local authority I know that public assistance officers are familiar with every situation and there is seldom an appeal. These officers have a good deal of freedom in disbursing funds.  Will we have the same problem which we had since <Col N="1521" /> the health boards were set up of too many extra personnel?  This will mean extra costs for the taxpayer and for the ratepayer.  What has the Parliamentary Secretary in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the terms of the Bill the Minister can designate to act on these appeals a person who may or may not be a member of the health authority.  There is nothing in the Bill that would debar the Minister in certain cases from appointing a person who was the superintendent of the assistance officers, but it does not necessarily follow that it will be that person.  It is not envisaged that there will be any great influx of staff to deal with the appeals machinery under the Bill.  The health board or the Minister may decide in some cases that the person so appointed may not be a member of a health authority.  In other cases an officer who is a member of the health authority or a member of the staff of the health authority may be designated.  I could not say in any particular instance that such and such a person or officer will be the appeals officer.  We have not reached that stage yet.  It is at the Minister's discretion as to who will be appointed in each operational area.</P>

    <P>Earlier we discussed sections 5 and 15. We may have to refer to section 21 in a general way.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary expand on the exact meaning of section 8 (a) in relation to section 21?  To say the least of it, to the uninitiated section 21 is most complicated. As we have already said the purpose of any legislation is to have it understandable not only to those who are passing it but to those on <Col N="1522" /> whose behalf it is passed.  In other words, a person looking at this Bill should not have to refer to other legislation to understand it.  That is why I ask for a more comprehensive explanation of this section.</P>

That is not the case now? Therefore, is not the purpose of these grants being frustrated?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The salaries and conditions of Irish teachers, primary and secondary, who are serving in the European schools, are governed by regulations which are of general application to all teachers <Col N="1526" /> on the staff of the schools.  The Irish teachers are in receipt of their full home salaries during their period of secondment and, in addition, receive a further salary from the European schools calculated in accordance with the relevant regulations.  Differences in total remunerations as between teachers of different nationalities arise from differences in rates of exchange and this is a matter of difficulty to which consideration continues to be given.</P>
    <P>In regard to posts as <i>surveillant</i>, the position is that my Department has been prepared to facilitate Irish teachers who wish to apply for appointment to these posts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>With regard to what the Minister said about the absence of consultation in the case of grants-in-aid, as one who has had considerable experience of making grants-in-aid available in the different Departments over which I presided, is the Minister seriously suggesting it is unusual to have consultation in advance of the preparation of Estimates?  Secondly, is the Minister aware that one of the principal complaints of the directors of the academy is that they are asked to submit a detailed estimate of their expenditure under different heads and, when the grant is made available, no reference whatever is made to any of these details?  A block grant is made available.  Thirdly, in view of the complaints made by the directors because of the absence of prior consultation, will the Minister now, even if it is a departure from precedent, consult with the directors with regard to the proper amount of the grant-in-aid that should be made available?</P>

      <P>According to the latest information available from the universities, 1,603 graduates were conferred with the Higher Diploma in Education in 1975.  This number includes teachers already serving in primary and secondary schools.</P>
      <P>The number of new teachers with the Higher Diploma in Education who were appointed in secondary schools at the beginning of the school year in 1975 was 523.  Information is not yet to hand from the schools under vocational education committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in recent times the number of graduates who obtain the Higher Diploma in Education is far in excess of the number for whom posts are available?  We have now quite a considerable number of young people with this qualification without employment and would the Minister state what efforts he has made to inform the schools of the situation so that young people doing the leaving certificate will be aware of the problem facing them if they do a degree and have a Diploma in Higher Education with the object of teaching in post-primary schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The universities, as the Deputy knows, are autonomous bodies and the Minister has no function in the admission of graduates to the H.Dip. course but, having said that, I welcome the opportunities given to me by the Deputy's questions to draw attention to the fact that we are producing a number of Higher Diploma in Education students every year in excess of the number of places available.  In fact, since 1965-66 the number has increased from 686 to 1,800 in 1975-76 and since the number of places in secondary schools in the new meaning of the term&mdash;voluntary secondary, comprehensive and community schools&mdash;is around 500 and not likely to increase substantially, I welcome the opportunity of giving publicity to the fact that those who take the Higher Diploma in Education may face a period of unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Application was made for transport to Clonmacnoise national school for six children in the Creevagh and Aughincabe areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The school transport scheme is designed to cater for children who are eligible for free transport.  Fare-paying children are catered for only to the extent that space is available for them after the eligible children have been accommodated.</P>
      <P>With regard to the availability of facilities for fare-paying children in the Lackabaun area, it was considered necessary, and a result of a proposed amalgamation of two schools in the general area which would necessitate the provision of an additional transport service, to substitute a medium sized bus for the large vehicle which served Millstreet national schools from the Lackabaun area prior to the summer vacation, 1975.  This medium sized bus was adequate for the needs of children who were eligible for free school transport, but there was a reduction in the number of places available for fare-paying passengers.</P>
      <P>The proposed amalgamation has now been postponed for the present and, as a temporary arrangement, the large bus in question has been reallocated to Millstreet.

Furthermore, one of the buses involved would have to operate a right turn from the main Killarney road into the side road on which the school is situated, and this is regarded by the company as hazardous.

Under this scheme a local education officer has been recruited by each of these VECs and seconded to this service under the auspices of the institutions of science and art.  Premises have been acquired by County Meath VEC for the Trim centre and work on the adaptation of these premises will begin very shortly. Premises are also being acquired for the Castlebar centre.  The object of the service is to promote a wider interest in the national collections. Information concerning the collections in the three institutions already mentioned and in the Public Record Office will be provided through these centres and exhibitions will be mounted displaying material&mdash;original or in facsimile&mdash;from these institutions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but I think it right to point out also that Scotiand Yard subsequently issued a statement denying the authenticity of the report in question.  Moreover, and this is perhaps more directly relevant, apart from denying that the statement attributed to them was authentic, Scotland Yard stated, both publicly and in direct communication with the Garda authorities, that as a fact the picture in question was not taken for them in the manner described but was found by them in the course of a search carried out in Manchester.</P>

      <P>May I draw the attention of the Minister to the statement from the Press Association which contradicted the Scotland Yard statement on one occasion and cast doubt in general on the veracity of the Scotland Yard statement?  The Press Association are an international agency catering for the dissemination of news and I would put a lot of reliance on what they have said here.

From the information Scotland Yard made available in their public statement and in direct communication with the Garda authorities, I am satisfied that whatever Press reports were published were not authentic.  They were specifically denied.  The kernel of the matter related to where the picture was taken.

The case Deputy Brennan was making was that a number of people would not be suitable for employment for various reasons, health and so on, and I think the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; clearly indicates that it is not a necessary requirement but where appropriate it would be required.</P>

      <P>All the Bill does is to establish the right of the recipient to minimum basic rates, which were not there before.  The whole thing was at the discretion of the home assistance officers or the particular authority administering the scheme.  An element of discretion is extremely important and it is one that was underlined by people in the area, and by home assistance officers to their union.  They emphasised the question of the discretionary element in the whole scheme, and it is a case that I accepted as being valid. While it ensures that recipients have, as of right, a basic rate, it does not do away with the element of discretion, which is a very necessary element. The only difference it makes is that the discretion starts after the floor, and it is still there.  In certain cases the officer can exercise his discretion and give additional payments over and above the basic payments provided for in the Bill.</P>

      <Col N="1563" /> When the Bill was published and the Second Reading took place, the rates embodied in the Bill were the current rates, the rural rate, for unemployment assistance.  Since that time there has been a revision of the rates.  They have been increased under the general increase that was applied in October to social welfare recipients, and the amendment seeks to establish the new higher rates in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Will the rates here specified be subject to the changes that social welfare should periodically undergo?  In October due to the CPI changes upwards there was a change. Is there any provision for automatic <Col N="1564" /> adjustment or will it require amendment before there is any further change in the rates?  Deputy Andrews' amendments would have considerably improved the section.  I take it that he will be free to discuss the merits of the changes that were ruled out of order.  Without actually referring to the amendments I believe the Deputy will be in order to discuss the merits of what was raised in them.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain if adjustments will be automatic and may be made without amendment to the Bill when it becomes an Act.  Will any further adjustment, such as that in the amendment we have just passed, be made by simple order or will legislation be necessary for the amendment?</P>

In relation to subsection (2), which specifically deals with adult dependants, it is about time we did away with the naming of adult dependants specifically as it relates to subsection (2), paragraphs (a) and (b).

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have said what I have said and I do not intend covering that ground again.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary on Report Stage introduce an amendment on the lines I have already set out?  It is very difficult for me to stand up here and not discuss my amendment in the context of what we are now speaking about.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that what I have said has some considerable merit and that it agrees with the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women?  The matter of the child dependant is again raised in paragraph (c) of subsection (2).  It states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Child dependant&rdquo; means, in relation to a person, any child not being an adult dependant, who has not attained the age of 18 years and who is dependant on that person for support.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will have heard my introductory remarks in relation to the interpretation section, when I asked him if the definition of child dependant, which has the meaning assigned to it in section 10, includes illegitimate children and if in this Bill he envisages the continuation of the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate children in the context of the meaning of child dependant as set out?  It seems to me grossly unfair that an illegitimate child should be discriminated against by any piece of legislation, including the Succession Acts.  An illegitimate child is apparently a child of nobody.  It is grossly unfair that a child who is brought into the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not elaborate because I might distract us from what we are at.  As I explained this morning&mdash;I thought I made it clear because we went into it in some length &mdash;as far as payments are concerned&mdash; there is no distinction between a child born in wedlock and a child born out of wedlock.  The only reference to a child born out of wedlock in this Bill is there for one specific purpose only. I am repeating it because&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It bears repetition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as it does, we will keep repeating it.  The only way it arises in this Bill is that it would not be possible for a health board to go to court to recover money from a person who was alleged to be the father of a child born out of wedlock because the board would not be able to establish whether or not the person named was the father of the child. There is absolutely no discriminatory <Col N="1567" /> element in this Bill against children born out of wedlock.  I believe the Deputy knows that and I cannot fully understand why he comes back to it to suggest that there is such discrimination when there is clearly none.  I did not refer the Deputy to section 10 but to an amendment which he has himself submitted and which will be discussed later on this Stage.  It might then bear repeating if the Deputy is still not clear that there is no discrimination against a child born out of wedlock.  Further, I would not be associated with any legislation that did so discriminate.</P>
      <P>In regard to other matters the Deputy raised in connection with the recommendations on the status of women, no doubt there still remain some discriminatory elements in the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is one of them surely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of them, indeed most of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women in relation to social welfare have already been implemented.  In one case we even went beyond the recommendation in the commission's report.  It is fair to say that the discrimination, built up over the years with the Deputy's support, was introduced into this House by Fianna Fáil Administrations.  Deputy Andrews and others in the Fianna Fáil benches who are now expressing great concern about this discrimination not only did nothing to remove it but during their political lives supported such legislation and perpetuated it.  It is not possible within two-and-a-half years to remove all elements of discrimination built up under Fianna Fáil over a long period, but it is our aim to remove them and we will achieve that aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record in regard to removing discrimination in the social welfare code is a good one: two thirds of the recommendations made by the commission in regard to social welfare have already been adopted in a comparatively short time, the life of this Government.  But Deputy Andrews and Fianna Fáil Deputies bear reminding <Col N="1568" /> that the discriminatory elements are there because they put them there. By their political support inside and outside the House they made it possible to enshrine them in legislation and Fianna Fáil now have the audacity to charge others as if it were their doing.  We recognise they are there.  We do not like them, we are committed to removing them and this we will do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's effort to put me in my place in particular and Fianna Fáil in their place in general was delivered with his usual self-righteousness, based on the touching of some sensitive nerve by my previous submissions.  I do not concede that Fianna Fáil were not concerned over the years with the abandonment of discrimination.  The setting up of the Commission on the Status of Women was a recognition that there was something there that needed to be dealt with and something to be rectified and that commission was set up by this party because of their awareness of the situation.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seems to reserve to himself all the concern for the present situation which now exists specifically under section 10 (2) of the Bill.  He now has an opportunity to abandon what we consider to be a piece of discriminatory legislation, and he agrees that it is.  I shall not refer to my amendment, but if the Parliamentary Secretary is as concerned as he purports to be&mdash;he has shown himself to be concerned with this matter&mdash;there is only one thing in his concern which might worry us on this side of the House and it is that it appears he would like to think that he has cornered the market on concern in relation to the less well-off members of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years Fianna Fáil have shown awareness of and a willingness to deal with the underprivileged section of the community.  Certainly, some areas remained untouched and we concede that: if we had been given the opportunity to deal with them we would have dealt with them.  Certainly, Fianna Fáil were 16 years in office and while, only in recent years have the community become socially aware of and committed to the alleviation of the lot of the underprivileged section <Col N="1569" /> of the community, Fianna Fáil have done much in other areas.  It has been a priority of this party to tackle the problem of social deprivation.  Over the years, no doubt, specific areas have not been dealt with but the Parliamentary Secretary is engaging in an odd and dangerous form of exclusiveness and élitism in taking to himself the whole concern for the underprivileged sections of the community. Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    <P>It has been alleged that my party did nothing in relation to this matter but as far as I am aware the Parliamentary Secretary, while in Opposition, did not articulate as fully or as fulsomely as he would have us believe he did.  Indeed, his party did not do as much as he wants us to believe they did in highlighting this problem.  It is no harm to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that at no time during my contribution on this element of the Bill, particularly in relation to the matter of child dependence, did I say that the Bill discriminated specifically against children born out of wedlock.  I wanted a clear definition, a clear statement of whether the interpretation of child dependent included children born out of wedlock.  The Parliamentary Secretary has given me that undertaking twice but if he gave it to me ten times the message still might not get public awareness.  On occasions things bear repetition.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be drafted in such a way that those affected by it can understand it.  If such people cannot understand the Bill it fails in a small way. When people read an account of this debate in the national newspapers, or in the Official Report, they will be left in no doubt, arising out of the contribution from this side of the House, as to the meaning of the Bill.  The contribution from this concerned Opposition was fair and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary not to be so darned selfrighteous or exclusive about his concern. All Deputies are concerned about the Bill and what it means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary made reference to Fianna Fáil's discrimination in the past.  I am <Col N="1570" /> not sure if he was referring to discrimination written into legislation or to what he might call &ldquo;discrimination by omission.&rdquo;  I do not know of any legislation which discriminated deliberately against any section of the community. It is true that some sections of the community who might otherwise be deserving of assistance from the State were not taken under the umbrella of the social welfare code.  Nobody ever claimed that happened but I frequently said, and the Minister would say the same if he was present, that there will always be a need to improve the social welfare code.  The fundamental social welfare code on which the Parliamentary Secretary is basing his improvements is the code brought in exclusively by Fianna Fáil.  I had the pleasure of bringing in at least eight improvements through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I do not understand what the Parliamentary Secretary is at when he seeks to make kudos out of the effort of Deputy Andrews to expand the application of this section to include other categories.  When the Parliamentary Secretary says it was not possible within two-and-a-half years to do away with all the discrimination I should like him to be specific and tell the House the discriminations he is talking about.  If he is referring to omissions of areas where the code does not reach out to, then it is right that everybody was not brought under the social welfare umbrella in our time.  However, we started the widows and orphans scheme, the legislation concerning deserted wives and the various improvements in relation to benefit in kind, free travel, free electricity and free television licences. Each year we had a Bill expanding and improving the social welfare code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is doing nothing more than his duty in continuing with that practice in so far as it is possible for him to do that with the limited resources at his disposal. The Parliamentary Secretary should be frank and admit that the reason why he has not brought in certain improvements is that the resources available to him are not adequate.  That is the limitation <Col N="1571" /> applied to any Minister.  The Minister for Finance is breathing down his neck and he must have sanction before he can make any improvements in social welfare legislation.  I would have no difficulty in thinking of 1,000 schemes; one has no shortage of social conscience in drafting social welfare legislation.</P>

The subsidies we saved on our entry to the EEC gave a windfall to the Minister which he rightly applied to social welfare.

      <P>I am glad subsection (3)  leaves the expansion of the rates provided less complicated and I asked whether the rates had to be increased in the manner in which the Parliamentary Secretary has had to do it.  Since the Bill was circulated further increases in the rates were justified as a result of a change in the consumer price index.  This is a frequent occurrence these days.  To keep step with that, the Minister will find the frequent use of section 10 (3) very useful when making the necessary adjustments.  I regret the amendments proposed by Deputy Andrews were not accepted.</P>

      <P>A number of issues were raised by Deputy Brennan.  He referred to my dishonest presentation of the position.  It might be useful to <Col N="1572" /> Deputy Brennan and the House generally if I were to refresh their memories about Fianna Fáil's concern in the area of social welfare. Deputy Brennan apparently is not aware that there has been and still is an element of discrimination against women in our laws, some of them in the area of social welfare.  If Deputy Brennan can stand up here and say that no discrimination existed in that field, I can only assume that he did not read the report of the Commission on the Status of Women.  It did exist and, to some extent, it still exists.</P>
      <P>In the two-and-a-half years we have been in government we have made considerable progress in eliminating some of that discrimination.  Deputy Brennan said we depended on the resources made available by the Minister for Finance for social welfare. That is undoubtedly true but, in my opinion, it is more true to say the money is made available by the Government.</P>
      <P>He also referred to EEC subsidies being used by this Government for social welfare purposes.  That is a kite Fianna Fáil have been flying for quite a long time.  I would ask Deputy Brennan to bear with me for a little while and very briefly I will explode that myth.  He mentioned two points: EEC money and the role played by the Minister for Finance in making money available for social welfare.  It is true that the money is made available by the Minister for Finance but to my mind that gives a clear indication of the priority the Government see in that area.  There is no doubt that Fianna Fáil saw social welfare as a very low priority.  It was something to be used purely and solely for electoral advantage.  There was no consistency, no genuine concern and, indeed, no thought or conception as to what social welfare is all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the morning of the budget of 1974, an article appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> entitled &ldquo;What My Budget Proposals Would be&rdquo;.  The author of that article was Deputy Colley, former Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance.  He was out of office in 1974.  He no longer had responsibility. Yet, in that article he said he would <Col N="1573" /> allocate £20 million to social welfare. The present Minister for Finance allocated £50 million to social welfare. That clearly demonstrates where Fianna Fáil stood on social welfare, not only when they were in office but even when they were out of office and could stand back and take a proper look at the subject and had no responsibility for providing the money.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt where social welfare stood on the priority list of Fianna Fáil as compared to the priority list of this Government.  We have suffered from such accumulated neglect that even with the progress that has been made a very considerable amount still remains to be done.  There is no point just talking about child and women dependants and discriminatory elements.  Of course they are there; Fianna Fáil put them there and we will eliminate them as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>Any elimination that can be done as each Bill comes before the House should be done, so why not do it in this Bill?  It is not being done. I want to refer to what the Parliamentary Secretary said about the previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley. Deputy Colley referred to £20 million in extra benefits because the provision in the budget for social welfare has to take account of the estimated disgusting and sickening increase in unemployment and the long lines of the dole queues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 11 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section makes provision for going beyond the limits set down in the preceding section.  It gives the Minister power, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, to exceed the benefits laid down in any particular case if he so wishes.  It also provides certain benefits in kind.  One can easily visualise things which were done under the old Assistance Act, providing means for burial and so on.  It can provide clothing for people who suddenly find themselves destitute and it also makes provision for exceeding the rates laid down, with some exceptions:</P>
      <P>(a)  in any case where such person is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance the weekly amount of such allowance payable to such person may, subject to the provisions of this section, be increased, or</P>
      <P>(b)  in any other case, a weekly payment of supplementary welfare allowance may be made, subject to the provision of this section, to supplement that person's other income.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>The extent to which that section will be applied will determine the success of the whole legislation in regard to a wider number of people.  From the discussion so far, we have learned that the legislation will be exactly the same as has applied in the case of other social welfare persons.  It places an obligation on health boards to ensure that potential beneficiaries will be obliged to apply for one or other of the social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1575" /> During my time in the Department I was preparing legislation for the taking over of the home assistance scheme and one of the things I was anxious to include in that legislation, and in relation to which the Department produced some memoranda, were cases of chronically unemployed persons who are signing on week after week and year after year.  I was introducing the Employment Periods Order and I was anxious to give to those people a weekly allowance and to take them off the unemployed list. I was considering some type of benefit more in keeping with their condition and circumstances.  I wonder if this section will enable the Parliamentary Secretary to do that.  I do not think so because the preceding section places an obligation on health boards to ensure that such people will apply for other benefits to which they are entitled before qualifying under this section.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to do something about unemployed people who are unemployable. It is doubtful if some of these people could be found suitable employment even if we reach the desirable state of full employment, a dream now but which might one day be achieved, please God.  Even when we move to that desirable state there will be people unable to accept employment and I should like to see this section drafted more specifically to take these people off the unemployment register and give them supplementary allowances, subject to periodical revision or supervision to see whether their circumstances had so altered that they could be transferred to some other social welfare categories.  This would be a very useful section if it could be so adapted.</P>
    <P>Without embarking on a Second Reading speech, I think the Bill falls short of fulfilling a most important requirement by not providing for the category I have just mentioned.  This provision makes possible payment in kind to certain people.  No matter how we may denigrate the home assistance scheme, it made provision for payments in kind.  We all remember the old local authority wardrobes out of which clothes could be supplied <Col N="1576" /> to people who were in need of bedclothes or personal clothing.  It also applied in the case of burials where there were no means.  This section merely continues that commendable scheme and makes provision for payment of something more than is provided for in section 10.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the type of case he visualises this section would be required to meet.  Harking back to the question of providing for cases where incomes do not provide for needs, does this section provide that the Minister may come in and say to a health board: &ldquo;These people have an income of £X per week but there is a family of eight or nine dependants, the breadwinner's income is not sufficient to meet their needs and you may in this case pay £X extra per week?&rdquo; I should be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary would give me by way of example the type of person this would apply to.</P>
    <P>In cases where the supplementary allowance is considered to be insufficient the Parliamentary Secretary is being empowered to pay more than the prescribed rate.  To that extent this is a very important section.  The effect of this Bill will be determined by the extent to which this power will be exercised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan has raised two very serious and important points in his contribution.  He has told us that he has given some considerable thought to the devising of means whereby people who are registered as unemployed but who in reality are unemployable for various reasons would be taken off the live register and that some other method be used to cater for their materials needs.  The Deputy referred to a scheme of national assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about 105,000 people on the live register.  We must remember that traditionally we have had an unemployment figure of between 65,000 and 70,000 and that this was during what we would regard as normal times.  This was a very large figure, one which in most countries would have been unacceptable but which we <Col N="1577" /> came to regard as normal.  I agree with the Deputy that in that traditional figure of approximately 70,000 there are people who for various reasons have become unemployable.  It is recognised by people who specialise in this area that if an able-bodied man is forced into a situation of being unemployed, he becomes unemployable after a relatively short time.  Offhand I cannot say whether it would be feasible or possible to institute something on the lines suggested by Deputy Brennan, but the point merits serious consideration and I will go into it in much greater depth than is possible at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke also of the question of payment-in-kind and the important element that this played in the home assistance scheme.  Within the terms of this Bill there is nothing to prevent payment-in-kind either totally or by way of a monetary payment plus an element of payment-in-kind in order to meet a person's needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked whether a person with a large family could qualify for a supplementary allowance. Such a person could so qualify. In regard to another question of his, as to whether a person in receipt of social welfare benefit could have that benefit supplemented, the answer is in the affirmative here, too.  In this context some of the matters that will be taken into consideration will be the payment of a high rent and there may be cases of special food or fuel requirements for a family or for an individual.</P>
    <P>In relation to studies carried out on the subject of poverty it has emerged that elderly people living alone find it much more difficult to cope than an elderly couple living together.  This, too, is a factor that could be taken into consideration in relation to benefits.  That element of discretion, which is so essential to the operation of a scheme of this kind, is well provided for.  Its interpretation is intended to be fairly liberal.  Properly applied this Bill can go a long way towards the relieving of much of the suffering in our society.  The <Col N="1578" /> question of how employable are some of the people who are registered as unemployed is one that is worthy of serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 12.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 12 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder whether the Parliamentary Secretary might put into less difficult language paragraph (b) of subsection (2) of this section which reads:</P>
      <P>the value of any property belonging to such persons (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not so invested or profitably used, the yearly value of the first £400 of the property being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value and the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds the sum of £400 being taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value; and the weekly value of the property being calculated as one fifty-second part of the yearly value so calculated;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will forgive me if I highlight this subsection as a shining example of the type of legislation we should not be passing. Should the Parliamentary Secretary tell us in reply that he does not quite understand what this phraseology means, we shall understand perfectly and shall offer no criticism on that score.  Are we serious about introducing non-jargon-type legislation when we have a subsection such as this in the Bill before us?</P>
      <P>Bills should be drafted in such a way as to enable them to be interpreted by non-legal persons.  They are not meant to be drafted for the purposes of lawyers or for the benefit of the Legislature.  They are for the benefit of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here the Parliamentary Secretary will, I think, concede my point in relation to a comprehensive piece of drafting.  To be absolutely honest, I do <Col N="1579" /> not regard myself as a mathematician. I have gone through the particular subsection a number of times and I have a sort of vague inkling of what it means.  To arrive at what the subsection really means one would need to be an expert mathematician.  I do not mean this by way of criticism of those who drafted the subsection.  I say it rather by way of constructive suggestion for the benefit of those who will draft this kind of legislation in the future so that they will consider those who must interpret it.  Interpretation does not begin and end here in this House.  Legislation should be drafted in such a way that those whom it intends to benefit will understand it.  In my respectful submission, this subsection will be meaningless to those whom it seeks to benefit.  I certainly find it very difficult to understand. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would help me and others who do not quite understand what the subsection means.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <P>the value of any property belonging to such person (not being property personally used or enjoyed by him) which is invested or which, though capable of investment or profitable use, is not so invested or profitably used, the yearly value of the first £400 of the property being taken to be one-twentieth part of the capital value and the yearly value of so much of the capital value of the property as exceeds the sum of £400 being taken to be one-tenth part of the capital value; and the weekly value of the property being calculated as one fifty-second part of the yearly value so calculated;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maggie Murphy down the road will have great trouble interpreting that. <Col N="1580" /> When the Parliamentary Secretary is issuing the booklet he might get a translation made of this, putting the whole thing into plain intelligible language.</P>

      <P>(iii) any sums arising from the investment or profitable use of property (not being property personally used or enjoyed by such person);</P>
      <P>That again is a repeat of the 1952 Social Welfare Act.  Why should something one does not enjoy or benefit from be taken into the calculation? I am sure the draftsman has some reason for this but I could never understand why something not used or enjoyed should be taken into a calculation.  One does not calculate the use of the farm next door.  This may relate to a person living with relatives who have property being profitably used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is this would ordinarily be excluded.  Why has it to be written into the Bill? Incidentally in the very helpful memorandum the same phrase is repeated: &ldquo;Whose means are not sufficient to meet his needs&rdquo;.  On section 2 this morning we were pressing the Parliamentary Secretary to give us some definition of what standards or what criteria would be applied to ascertain when a person's income is not sufficient to meet his needs.  That cannot be quantified at present.  We are hoping that one day &mdash;or are we?  &mdash;the commission now sitting will come up with what is known as a poverty line.  Until they do, I do not know how we can quantify the term which is repeated in the memorandum and laid down in section 2 of the Bill.  This is a supplementary allowance and it is not confined to the prescribed allowances here.  To some extent that would set a certain standard.  The previous section permits the Parliamentary Secretary to go over and above the prescribed amount. Therefore, it is necessary to define in some way what a person's needs are which have to be met over and above what his income permits him to meet.</P>
      <P>The operative term in the Bill is where a person's income is not sufficient to meet his needs.  This is the key to the whole purpose of this legislation. It could be said that when you take the method of calculating means and the prescribed amounts payable, that sets a limit and it is not necessary to define what needs are above what the income is capable of providing.  In the previous section it is made possible to pay more, without limit, than what is prescribed.  The Minister may with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance pay over and above and even supplement the supplementary allowance.  Unless we are to establish some criteria of our own for the purpose of administration, it becomes necessary to define that unidentifiable gap, that unquantifiable gap if you like, between needs and income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, these days everybody can show that their incomes are not sufficient <Col N="1582" /> to provide for their needs.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to their legitimate needs.  It is easy to understand needs when it comes to bread and butter, clothing and shelter. These are legitimate needs.  While the bread on the table is a legitimate need, is the petrol in the breadwinner's car to bring him to work also a need?  Is the car itself a need?  If a man cannot afford to have a car to go to work, is this a legitimate need?  Where do you draw the line?  As yet, no poverty line has been drawn, and no level has been defined at which one can be regarded as enjoying the normal requirements and necessaries of life.  There is an unidentified gap.</P>
    <P>This legislation provides a puzzle for any investigating officer who has to decide whether a person's income is sufficient to meet his needs.  How he does this may be a matter of conjecture. He is not a superman.  He can only use his best judgment, as these people invariably do.  Will his judgment be the same as another man's?  Will it be the same as the other 300 doing the same work?  To what extent can uniformity be guaranteed, or as near to it as possible?</P>
    <P>In the real hardship cases it is easy. If a person has no means the prescribed amount can be provided.  If that is not sufficient he can be given more.  The Bill provides for that.  If an investigating officer wanted to allow his imagination to run riot he could say: &ldquo;The man I investigated today has only a donkey and cart.  He should have a horse and cart.  He should get £10 a week to enable him to get up to a higher standard.  His income is not sufficient to meet his legitimate requirements or his needs.&rdquo; Maybe I am pressing this point unduly but there seems to be a vacuum here and how it is filled by the investigation officers I could never quite understand.</P>
    <P>There are certain rules and regulations under which investigation officers work.  It would be humanly impossible for all of them to work to a precise pattern in assessing incomes.  There is bound to be a judgment error, though not to any great degree.  Nobody can estimate to an exact figure <Col N="1583" /> what a man's stock is worth.  Estimates may fluctuate to the extent that they may be hundreds of pounds out.  In the absence of some specific lines drawn in regard to the normal requirements of a person, it is very difficult to quantify what should be taken as a proper assessment of a person's needs.</P>
    <P>This legislation does not make any improvement on any previous legislation which I had the duty and pleasure of bringing before the House in my time in the Department of Social Welfare. That is not to say the legislation we are now putting through the House will not be a necessary and useful part of the evolution of social welfare towards the ever-improving standards people enjoy.  As normal life continues to improve, social welfare payments should also continue to improve.  To quote an outworn phrase, it is an ongoing situation and it is a never-ending evolution in keeping benefits in line with not merely the CPI but improving standards.  As standards improve, so do the requirements of the underprivileged. They have that right.  No Minister should say he is doing something some other Minister did not do. In 50 years time, some other Minister will be doing something he did not do and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i></P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should give us some explanation of section 12 which sets out as far as possible how means are calculated.  It sets out the exclusions.  It has to be taken in conjunction with the previous section which enables the Minister to go over and above anything prescribed in the rates.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary could give us a reasonable explanation of how the Act will be administered, we could go from the House with a realisation of the extent to which it will benefit a large volume of people.  Is it not correct to say that the Bill merely provides that the home assistance beneficiaries&mdash;as they have been known up to now&mdash;will in future receive rates approximating to those received by unemployment assistance recipients and by similar categories in the social welfare code?</P>
    <P>In an effort to explain the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary has decided to <Col N="1584" /> oversell and exemplify it as a demonstration of a social conscience he alone claims to possess.  Nobody has said that in as many words.  It is merely to bring home assistance under the umbrella of the health boards and raise the rates approximately to those being received by unemployment assistance recipients at present although the Bill does make provision to go far beyond that and, for all I know, may go as far as the Minister would like to push it in regard to the provision of supplementary payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to the method of calculating means under this section.  It appears the home assistance officer's role will be changed completely henceforth.  There is a set number of guidelines laid down.  Might I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it will be part of his duties in future to write reports in respect of cases he has to investigate? Will he have authority to go into bank accounts, post office accounts and so on?  Will he be playing the same role as the investigation officer of the Department of Social Welfare? If his work does follow those lines we will be departing completely from the existing position in relation to the payment of home assistance inasmuch as that the officer can deal with the case quickly and can grant the necessary payments as he sees fit.  If he has to undertake the role of the ordinary investigating officer it means that the whole process will be slowed up.  Generally speaking people who apply for home assistance&mdash;or supplementary social welfare as it is now called&mdash; are in dire need of payments being made urgently.</P>
      <P>In this section we are doing away entirely with the discretion which the home assistance officer has at present in these matters.  I hope that the position is not as I have outlined it but it would appear that this is the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This section leaves many shades of grey.  I should like to see set out at an early date&mdash;possibly on the next Stage&mdash;the actual amount that would be charged against an applicant in relation to property.  Unless that is done I can foresee this <Col N="1585" /> value varying from one health board area to another.  Paragraph (c) states:</P>
      <P>the value of any advantage accruing to such person from the use or enjoyment of property...</P>
      <P>In the case of an applicant who had a house with a valuation of, say, £6, how much would be assessed as profit accruing to him?  What figure would the Minister have in mind for a valuation of free lodgings?  What would free lodgings include?  All of these things should be set out in black and white so that all of us may be aware of them, so that any health board officer will be able to furnish answers quickly.  There is the phrase: provision is included which will enable these rules to be varied by regulation should this prove necessary in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is anxious that the Bill go through quickly and he is making provision to change things about which he is not certain.  I foresee a tremendous amount of confusion arising unless such matters are clarified in advance of the Bill becoming law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from suggesting &mdash;as was suggested by the previous speaker&mdash;that assessment will vary from area to area, in fact that is the position under the present law. It is one of the reasons that motivated the introduction of this Bill by the Government to ensure that there would be a standard rate throughout the country not only for payments but also with regard to means of assessment of income.  The Deputy may have misunderstood that aspect of the Bill.  The present situation under the Home Assistance Act is that the method of assessing a person's needs and means varies from area to area. As I said earlier today, it varies from case to case, so that it is difficult to establish any pattern even within the one operational area.  One is left wondering how some decisions have been arrived at because there have been cases where people in exactly the same financial circumstances, with exactly the same commitments, have been awarded different rates.  That is one <Col N="1586" /> of the most objectionable features of the Home Assistance Act.  By having a uniform basic rate throughout the country and also a uniform method of assessing a person's means we are confident that this will abolish some of the least desirable aspects of the home assistance approach.</P>
      <P>Another question raised was that of doing away with the discretionary powers of the home assistance officer. I explained earlier that the element of discretion is recognised as an essential part of the operation of a proper liberal scheme.  It would be very difficult to have a scheme that operated effectively and efficiently and in a way that would meet the requirements it is intended to meet without allowing that discretionary power to the authority administering the scheme.  What the new Bill does is to give a uniform basic rate throughout the country and over and above that rate there is still the discretionary power.  It is a very important element in the scheme and its importance has been emphasised by, among others, the home assistance officers trade union and, by a number of charitable organisations who have wide experience in this area.  In the new Bill we ensured that that element of discretion would be retained.  The Deputy need have no fear on that account.</P>

      <P>I am aware of most of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.  What I should like to see spelled out is the proportion of the valuation so that people will know the situation.  There is reference to the value of any advantage accruing to the person from the use or enjoyment of property which would include the value of free lodgings or owner-occupied property where applicable.  If we take the case of an applicant who is in a house that has a valuation of approximately £5, could the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how much income would be assessed on such an applicant?</P>

      <P>I accept the Deputy's point that the average person may be confused when he reads about a rate of 5 per cent on the first £400 and so on.  However, for the purpose of this Bill and seeing that it is a departure in that we are now linking the basic rate with an established basic rate&mdash; unemployment assistance&mdash;the same means of calculation should be employed as the same benefits are being paid as of right.  Deputy Leonard referred to subsection (3).  This gives power to the Minister by way of regulation to amend the rules for calculation of means in the light of experience. At this stage it is an established method of assessing means and as it is so closely linked by way of assessment and by way of payment under the scheme it would be appropriate that the same method be employed for both purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is necessary to spell it out in somewhat legalistic and formal terms in the Bill, the Deputy will appreciate that in explaining to the general public about their entitlement to allowances and benefits we should attempt to simplify it as far as possible and to translate the legalistic wording which is necessary for formal legislation <Col N="1588" /> into more readily understandable language from the point of view of the general public.

There is nothing in the Bill which would prevent a health board from making a payment of cash and supplementing that by a payment in kind, or indeed the other way around, by making a payment in kind and, if they thought it desirable and necessary, supplementing that by a payment in cash. They are not excluded from doing either one or the other or both.  The need for flexibility in this regard as explained by the Deputy is catered for in the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is what I call the fire brigade section relating to payment in respect of exceptional need. In fact, this is retaining the most commendable part of the home assistance scheme.  However much maligned and criticised the scheme might be, the home assistance officer could go out and make a payment on the spot, where a tragedy occurred or where circumstances were brought about suddenly that caused immediate hardship.  I should like to see this section used to <Col N="1591" /> a much greater extent.  It can be more appropriately used here than in the previous instance.  I can visualise someone's fare being paid, say, to a relative's funeral.  There were many good things in the home assistance code, but it did not take the human element sufficiently into account.  If somebody destitute died a coffin would be provided, but it was a mere casket without any decorations.  I do not see anything wrong with the health board making provision for a person who would be far away to attend his mother's funeral.  That is perhaps an extreme example, but this is the sort of provision we shall have to face up to in this eternal evolution of social welfare, the human side coming more and more into it.  I would like to have the Parliamentary Secretary commit himself to the statement that he would not be averse to such provision being made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this motion last night I endeavoured to bring home to the Minister and the Government the shortcomings in this scheme as it operates at the moment. It is not suitable to Irish conditions. This must be pretty clear to the Minister <Col N="1592" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries after seeing the scheme in operation for two years.  I have no doubt he is considering changes in it. I have already mentioned a number of the changes this side of the House would like to see taking place.  We have had a tradition in this country of helping the people who need help the most but under the farm modernisation scheme we have lost sight of this principle.  A large percentage of our farmers, as high as 79 per cent, have no hope of becoming development farmers.  They are the people who need help and it is not right that their grant rates should be reduced. We believe they are entitled to a living on the land.</P>
      <P>What will be the position of those people after 1977?  This has never been clarified.  The Minister will probably say that they will be no worse off than they are at the present time. I would like him to say if he will be receiving the same grants and aids as those in the development and commercial categories.  Those people are very perturbed by the position they find themselves in.  Last night I said that the shortcomings of this scheme have not been fully felt as yet.  I hope this debate will be something to make the people aware of the changes that are needed and those that must be brought about if the scheme is to operate to the advantage of the Irish farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at this scheme one begins to think that it has missed the point that the small farmers in Ireland, in particular, have always had a love for their small holdings.  They will not give them up too easily.  They look back on the fight their forefathers had to hold the land.  It is their way of life.  We also have to accept that there is no alternative employment for them.  Since this Government came into office, we have a very high rate of unemployment.  Where will we find work for those who will be forced off the land under the farm modernisation scheme?  Those people will be forced off the land because they will not qualify for the grants at the same rate as those who will be classified as development or commercial <Col N="1593" /> farmers and because of this lack of support will not be able to survive on the land.</P>
    <P>No programme has been devised to find employment for them.  There are no factories or industries of any description near those holdings where they could find suitable employment. The Government seem to have lost sight of this problem.  They do not seem prepared to face up to it.  It must be faced up to because it is a very definite problem.  We also have the problem of farmers who are forced to retire at 55 years of age. If they do not do so, they are penalised by receiving 10 per cent less in their grants.  This is a very severe cut and is unreasonable when one considers that the retiring age for the other sectors of the community is 65 years.</P>
    <P>We must also take into account that, on average, continental farmers marry ten years younger than Irish farmers so this age should be 65 and not 55 if it is to be applied to Irish conditions.  I advocate this change very strongly.  Farmers of 55 years of age are very active people.  They have very good farming ability and this is a very unjust penalty to impose on them.</P>
    <P>We also have to consider the farmers who go out to earn their living to bring in extra money for themselves and their families by finding employment off the land.  Those people are also penalised.  They should be able to get the same grants and aids as the other sections of the farming community, whether they are development or commercial farmers.  I know of many such people in my constituency and whether they work in Dungarvan, Portlaw, Clonmel, Youghal or anywhere else, it is not right to deprive them of the aids and grants they are entitled to.  They should not be penalised for working off the land when they are trying to improve the living standards of themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The most serious aspect of the farm modernisation scheme is finding employment for those who come off the land.  We should be able to avail of other aids and grants available from <Col N="1594" /> the EEC in the future to help to improve industry in rural Ireland.  Such industry would have to be well placed and suited for the different areas. Those people do not want to work too far from the land and they do not want to emigrate.  The Minister should pay attention to this matter and should seek changes in the farm modernisation scheme.  Those changes are very necessary and are urgently needed.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the need for encouragement for market gardening and tillage.  We have encouragements for dairying, beef and sheep.  There has been a huge drop in the potato acreage this year so prices have soared and housewives are paying enormous prices for potatoes.  Farmers should be encouraged to engage in horticulture. There are some small, intensive, market gardeners in my area of Ballinacourty who have to bear high costs to modernise their production, and buy new machinery.  They should get grants and aids to help them to develop. There is also a high percentage of farmers who are denied entry into the scheme because of the high borrowings they had to make in order to develop their farms.  This borrowing is denying them entry to the scheme which is entirely wrong and should be rectified.  Again, I appeal to the Minister to seek and bring about the changes that are so much desired in the farm modernisation scheme and make it suitable to Irish conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an arrangement by which the Opposition speak next for a half-hour and then the Minister? I do not want to interfere with the Minister's time.  However, I shall proceed to make the few points I want to make.  This discussion gives us an opportunity to consider the farm modernisation scheme and to see if changes are necessary and where they should take place.  It would be very naive of anybody to say of any scheme <Col N="1595" /> that is operating that changes are not necessary.  We have had some experience of this farm modernisation scheme and I have every confidence in the Minister's capacity to make changes and adjustments where necessary.  In some cases changes are necessary.</P>
      <P>In order to get this scheme in its proper perspective we should first go back and examine the system it replaced. The farm modernisation scheme has created a situation in which farmers are being categorised in three different categories, development, commercial and transitional. Prior to this, we had a situation in which up to a year ago people not involved in any way in farming, millers, doctors and other professional people, were buying up land at a great rate.  Having purchased huge tracts of land they were able to apply to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for grants and they applied for and succeeded in getting every penny that was available in grant aid.  This was a bad system because ultimately you would reach a position where you would have ranchers and the land intended for farmers would be taken over by these people.  On the other hand, you had the small farmer who had not necessary finance to invest in modernising and improving his smallholding and therefore could not avail of the grants.</P>
      <P>With the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme you have a system under which the people I have mentioned are in the category of commercial farmers and therefore not entitled to grant aid.  That is all right. I heard Deputy Fahey saying that as far as grant aid is concerned it should be diverted to those most in need. This came at a time when Deputy Fahey's party were in power and when changes could be made without reference to Brussels or any outside authority.  A very serious situation developed in my opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I agree entirely with the principle of the farm modernisation scheme I have some complaints to make on some points to put to the <Col N="1596" /> Minister.  In my county, if my figures are correct, we have 36 per cent in the development category, approximately 10 per cent commercial and the balance of 54 per cent, transitional. In my experience of dealing with applications and with the scheme as far as my knowledge goes, far too much time is taken up on the part of people qualified for other jobs, those in the agricultural advisory service.  I ask the Minister and his officials to consider this aspect of the scheme.  It is wrong that agricultural advisory officers, trained and prepared to advise farmers, spend a considerable amount of time on paperwork in connection with the implementation and operation of the scheme.  Anybody who has seen those applications will agree that it is very confusing and difficult to understand.  I believe the agricultural instructors would be doing a better job if they were on the ground to advise and encourage farmers as to what line they should take because it is now more important than ever for farmers to have the advice of those people.  Farming generally has become a highly technical operation and the days are gone when the farmer could jog along without change.  We are now members of the EEC and we have competitors and we must ensure that we take a proper course and that we use all the technical advice available to us.  I should like to see those people who are very qualified, skilled and experienced in the county hall in Cork dealing with paperwork dealing instead directly with the farmers on the ground and advising them.  I think it would be well worth while for the Minister to examine that aspect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>We heard a considerable amount of criticism last night.  I do not object to criticism and I concede that Deputy Gibbons has a great knowledge of agriculture and so has Deputy Callanan.  In the West Mayo by-election I listened to a speech by Deputy Callanan at Newport when he informed his listeners that the only policy to save the west was the policy adopted by Fianna Fáil.  I happened to be canvassing in an area where I did not see the effect or the results of Fianna Fáil policy.  There is a problem <Col N="1597" /> there and all along the western seaboard and we politicians, both inside and outside the House, have paid sufficient lip service to the west but very little has been done there in the past. If one examines the problem from the economic viewpoint and does not consider the social aspect of it, one would remove the people from the land and plant the lot of it with trees. In the past ten years we have had in almost every western constituency contested by-elections and I think everybody, even midland Deputies and Dublin Deputies and Deputies from other areas, now realise that there is a problem in the west.  Directives 159 and 160 are very closely related and I think one is interdependent on the other.  Again, the farm retirement scheme is a good scheme but changes must be made.  In order to solve the western problem we must try to improve the standard of living and in order to do that it is first necessary to examine the retirement scheme.  I think this is the scheme where the 12-years' lease comes in and in certain areas&mdash;and this is not unusual; as Deputy Fahey said farmers in this country marry much later in life than their European counterparts&mdash;you may have old parents, particularly farmers who may be 50, 55 or 60 years of age and have young families and they are going through a rather difficult time financially.  This scheme gives an opportunity to the farmer concerned to lease his land for 12 years.  It gives him a lump sum, a pension and, if my interpretation of the scheme is correct, an income from the land if he lets it to a farmer who qualifies under the scheme.  However, such a farmer has to search around the area to get qualified applicants to lease his land.  That is a difficult problem. While the principles of the scheme are good it is difficult for a farmer, even though he may know his locality well, to know of a development farmer anxious to lease his land.  For this he needs the assistance of the Land Commission officials and local agricultural advisers.</P>
    <P>I did not do much research about this matter because I was informed that I would have only five minutes to contribute to the debate.</P>

Changes are necessary but I have every confidence that the Minister will introduce these changes.</P>

Deputy Hussey has half-an-hour which means he will be finished at 6.50 p.m.  The Minister can get in then and the last Opposition speaker will be called at 7.15 p.m.  That is the position as far as the Chair understands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I did not have the opportunity of hearing the Minister before making my contribution because it is possible he would have been in a position to enlighten us about all the problems we are concerned about in relation to this scheme.  I was sorry Deputy Creed did not continue because, as a European representative, he would have had a useful contribution to make since agriculture is so tied up by decisions taken in Brussels.  It is not my fault that the Minister is being deprived of any time and I do not believe he will be deprived of any time.</P>
      <P>The motion is very important because the scheme has been controversial since it was introduced.  When it was introduced committees of agriculture in the west considered it in detail and expressed concern about it. The Galway and the Mayo committees discussed this at length.  Mayo County Committee of Agriculture went so far as to refuse to administer the scheme.  This shows the concern farmers, and their representatives, had about the scheme.  The scheme has brought about many changes, some of which are not for the good.  In the last 18 months we have seen how the scheme works and it is our duty to make changes if the scheme does not suit our respective counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister, in making changes in the scheme, has the support of the county committees of agriculture he will have a stronger case to make to his counterparts in Brussels.  It would be better for member states if schemes such as this were discussed at home <Col N="1600" /> before being implemented.  The Minister responsible for such schemes could then convey the views of the members of his own parliament to his colleagues in Brussels.  Agriculture is important for us all and the Minister should be aware of the schemes that would suit the different counties. There should be a commitment from the Government to develop agriculture to its full potential.  This is not happening.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our main industry but there does not seem to be any Government policy for agriculture. The Government merely react to certain situations at a given time.  What other industry would survive in this situation?  What other industry would have withstood the economic blizzard of 1973-74 when our farmers were forced to sell their stock at give-away prices?  Thank God our farmers withstood that challenge and are now fighting back.  If agriculture is to become a dynamic sound industry, young people must be encouraged to take up farming as a livelihood.  Young people will not go into farming unless they can achieve a standard of living comparable to that available to those engaged in alternative occupations.  The exodus of young people from the land, particularly in the west, is evidence of the lack of confidence in present policies.</P>
    <P>Dr. John Scully some years ago published an excellent report.  He said that there were 1.7 million acres of land owned by non-viable and problem farmers in the west and that this land was making little, if any, contribution to the general economic development of the region.  The policies which successive Governments followed were not capable of dealing with a problem of this magnitude. This vast acreage of land is lying derelict.  How long can we leave this non-viable and non-productive land? A dynamic policy is needed to encourage those farmers to make their land more productive.  If they cannot make it more productive they can surrender their land to young farmers, at a price. We are not asking them to give it away for nothing.  These young farmers are prepared to work the land and make it viable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> The present Land Commission policy of land acquisition and division has not been successful.  How often in the past have we seen the Land Commission allocate land to farmers who are not even working their own land to full capacity.  How often have we seen the Land Commission preparing a scheme but failing to get at the root of the many problems, particularly restructing and fragmented holdings.  This is a burning question, particularly in the west.  We have seen land divided; but where land becomes available and restructuring is to be carried out, every effort should be made by the Land Commission, before they allocate the land, to ensure that the scheme will minimise or end this fragmentation.  This has not happened in the past as often as it could have. There are still many fragmented holdings which are causing considerable hardship to the farmers using them. They have the problems of right-of-ways, fencing and driving stock through those lands.  This makes farming much more difficult and expensive for those farmers than for the farmer with ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 acres all in one piece.  It is easier to work a farm if it is in one piece than to work a farm in four or five pieces, as happens in the west.</P>
    <P>I understand there is very little money available to the Land Commission for the purchase of land. When land is advertised for sale and the Land Commission are asked to try to acquire it, there is far too much delay.  Every Deputy in the west knows of cases before the Land Commission for the past six months which are still awaiting a decision as to whether they will be acquired or sold on the open market.  Again this is causing uncertainty and problems for the people concerned.  If a shortage of staff is responsible for this delay, more staff should be made available. There are many young people leaving school who are very anxious to get any kind of a job.  They would be well employed in any of the Land Commission offices around the country which we are told are understaffed. There is no excuse for this.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission compulsorily <Col N="1602" /> acquire a farm the farmer is paid in land bonds.  Bonds are not acceptable.  No matter how good bonds may be a farmer prefers to get cash for his farm and that is the only thing he is willing to accept.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries may not be responsible for the Commission, but it is all part of the farm modernisation scheme.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Department of Lands are both involved in this problem.  If there is not full co-operation between them, this scheme cannot be successful.</P>
    <P>The object of the retirement scheme is to provide older farmers with an attractive alternative to farming through a premium and pension so that their lands can be released for use by potential development farmers. One of the great anomalies in this scheme is that farmers whose land had been let for the past few years are precluded from participating in this scheme.  This has been mentioned many times in this House and it is important that we keep plugging at it until it is changed.  This is a serious drawback because if the scheme is to succeed this condition must be changed.  These men should be allowed to participate because farmers who were in the habit of letting their land would be more likely to participate in a retirement scheme than the people who have never done it.  This has been borne out many times in this House.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the farm modernisation scheme as it applies to Galway.  Up to 31st October, 1975, the number of applicants for grants in County Galway under this scheme was 3,672.  The number processed and decisions taken as to elegibility was 2,899.  The number of development farms was 78 and the number of commercial farms, four.  This obtained up to 31st October.  The important thing to remember is that out of 2,899 applicants eligible for grants, 630 were aged 55 or older which meant they would lose one third of the grant.</P>
    <P>This is a serious handicap in the west of Ireland, something we have to emphasise repeatedly.  I want to repeat that this should be changed because <Col N="1603" /> it is very unfair to farmers in the west. Large numbers of such people are farming their land through no fault of their own.  We have had a history of late marriages and naturally in such circumstances a farmer could not be expected at the age of 55 years to have an heir to whom to hand over the farm.  Where such a situation arises there should be some relaxation of the scheme.  It is terrible to see a farmer who has gone to the expense of erecting farm buildings having to pay the same price for materials as the man of 25.  We have heard a lot of criticism of this.</P>
    <P>When a farmer has a son who is capable of managing the farm, even though the farmer has not handed over the farm he should qualify for the higher rate of grant.  I understand there is a move in this matter but I do not think anything definite has been done about it.  Where the son is managing the farm, the farmer should qualify for the higher rate even though he has not handed over his farm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any of them been refused the higher level of grant?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to my knowledge. When the son is managing the farm and is seen to be managing the farm the higher rate is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew there was some move about it but I was not sure.  I am glad to hear that such a farm qualifies even if the father is still the registered owner.  It is hard to expect farmers to retire at the age of 55.  People employed in industry are not asked to retire until they are 65 Even in Government Departments many officials are not promoted to senior ranks until they are 55 years or older and they can still do good jobs. The same should apply to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Participants in the scheme are asked to plan ahead for at least six years.  In present circumstances it is impossible for a farmer to plan that time ahead.  The Government themselves <Col N="1604" /> have not planned ahead for six years and neither have the Brussels bureaucrats.  We are living in a time of change and this seems to apply more to agriculture than elsewhere. Therefore, it is unreal to expect a farmer to plan ahead for six years. He might be in beef this year and might find it profitable to be in some other form of farming next year. There is far too much uncertainty in farming.</P>
    <P>I fear the national herd is being run down.  Whenever I attend a cattle mart I see large numbers of cows being sold.  This is happening throughout the country.  Any mart one attends devotes half the day to the sale of cows.  Last year this was understandable because of the fodder situation but the trend is continuing.  In the past two weeks the price of milk cows increased so much that they are out of reach of the ordinary farmer.  They are making £300 to £350.  I cannot understand why the sale of cows is continuing and I am worried that we will be in serious trouble next year or in 1977 when the impact of cow slaughtering will be felt.  I have seen a figure of 401,000 cows slaughtered in nine months and a later figure of 15,000 cows being slaughtered per month.  How long is this to continue? We would have a terrible job next year or the year after trying to replace those cows.</P>
    <P>As well, the beef cattle export business is at risk due to the dispute between the Minister and the vets.  I am sure the Minister is concerned that there should be an early settlement. At the moment farmers have to pay for the testing of their cattle which puts more expense on them at a time when the Government are saving money on them.  Taking the long-term view, it is a disastrous situation because we may find ourselves in 1978 with the brucellosis scheme not completed and we will not be able to export cattle to the Continent.  It is important that this dispute is resolved very soon.</P>
    <P>Another scheme introduced during the year was the disadvantaged areas scheme and in the west, particularly in Galway, the people were very disappointed. <Col N="1605" /> This scheme involved headage grants.  We made our views known to the Minister that we were disappointed in Galway that only a small area of the county was included even though it was designated a disadvantaged area.  Certain areas were selected and this has caused a lot of controversy and bad feeling throughout the county.  I do not see why we should not be treated in the same way as Mayo, Donegal and other counties. When this scheme is being reviewed next year, I hope there will be 12 counties included.  The same should have applied in respect of the disadvantaged areas scheme.  It is wrong that farmers living outside those areas but most of whose lands are within the areas should be deprived of the grants.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to encourage tillage.  Last year we experienced the effects of the non-avail-ability of fodder.  Coupled with the fodder shortage was the high price of meal.  If each farmer was encouraged to produce, say, an acre each of potatoes, beet and such crops, the benefit to themselves and to the economy would be great because we would be saved from having to import vegetables in such large quantities. There is the situation in Tuam where the potato plant operated by Erin Foods has been allowed to come to a standstill because of a shortage of potatoes.  I am not laying the blame for this at the feet of the Department, but some plans should be devised to ensure that sufficient quantities of potatoes are available for factories such as this.</P>
    <P>This was a difficult year in this respect because of the high prices obtaining on the commercial markets, but the Department and the Sugar Company together with the farmers should co-operate in devising a scheme to prevent the sort of situation I have outlined.  The discontinuing of operations at this factory means no employment for the farmers and others in the area who worked there on either a part-time or a full-time basis.</P>
    <P>There were many other points I intended raising but I shall have to forgo <Col N="1606" /> them because of the time factor. In any case, our biggest concern is that the changes I have outlined should be made in the farm modernisation scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing specifically with the package of directives there are a few general remarks I should like to make.  This motion has been discussed in a reasonable and thoughtful way and in this regard I compliment Deputy Gibbons and his colleagues.  There were the inevitable side swipes at Government policy in areas unrelated totally to the motion, but I suppose we can expect such remarks.  However I trust that the atmosphere which prevailed during discussion of this motion augurs well for future discussions on agriculture.  The best possible results for Irish farmers can be achieved only if we all regard ourselves as being of a team.  This is particularly important in the context of our membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>I have the responsibility of engaging in negotiations in Brussels and Luxembourg and I am supported ably in this task by a first-class group of officials.  It is in these places that decisions are taken generally, but I want to emphasise also that the Members from all sides of this House who attend the European Parliament are doing very important work.  It is only right that this be recognised.  I fear it could happen easily that the work they are doing would not be appreciated fully, particularly in their own constituencies, from which they must be absent for prolonged periods from time to time. I assure them that the opinions they express in the Parliament are not ignored at the Council of Ministers. All the Members concerned are giving the maximum amount of attention to the work involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I must point out that much confusion has been caused by misinformed public comment&mdash; some of it deliberate and intended to mislead the people into believing that everything was wrong in these directives and that the responsibility for this should be placed on the Government of the day.  Directive 159 was adopted long before we entered the Community, <Col N="1607" /> so that we had no part in its formulation. It was accepted by the previous Government, who conducted the negotiations for membership.  I have been accused of giving no indication of our being dissatisfied with the directive. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have said here on many occasions that what we were doing was putting the directives into practice, that in this way we were finding out their snags and shortcomings, that we were accumulating evidence which we could bring to Europe as proof of what was wrong with the directives as they applied to this country.  This was the right way to proceed.</P>
    <P>There were delays in the use of the directives to the maximum extent. These delays were caused in no small way by the views and criticisms expressed by Members of the Opposition as well as by other people.  The farmers generally were suspicious because they believed the stories that were being bandied about.  However, they know for themselves now what is the real situation. They have been operating the schemes and know that the levels of the benefits they are getting are far superior to anything they had at any time previously.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition say, for instance, that those who are not development farmers are deprived of development aid and they talk of 79 per cent or 80 per cent of farmers being in this position.  But let us not forget that those farmers are getting higher levels of grant aid now than ever before.  All transitional farmers are being deprived of is the 10 per cent for mobile equipment and the 10 per cent for the purchase of stock. They are getting 50 per cent for land reclamation.  This is much higher than they ever got before and they are getting 30 per cent for farm buildings. In these circumstances, should those who indulge in the criticism not have stopped this long ago.  Instead, they should have been encouraging farmers to use these schemes and directives to the maximum extent for their own benefit and not deprive them of something that is there for them to take. Our attitude, as I said, has been to <Col N="1608" /> put the directive into effect, gain experience, ascertain the facts, ascertain the faults and then bring the facts and the shortcomings to the notice of the commission to try to get things altered.</P>
    <P>We have done that.  We did not want to do it until we had at least 12 months' experience of the scheme operating, and operating properly, and, having had that experience, we brought these snags to notice.  We brought proposals to modify the comparable income.  We see the comparable income as a serious snag and we are doing everything we can to overcome it.  Already we have done a considerable amount to overcome it by regionalising and by making it a lower income for the west than for the rest of the country.  In this way we are able to bring more people in under the comparable income.  That is one of the matters we have raised in the Community.  We are trying to get improvements and an alteration that will at least enable us to get more people in under this particular aspect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>We have to deal with the limitations on investment.  We are trying to have this revised to take account of inflation and to remove some of the restrictions applying to pig production. As Members know, pig production is not included in the way it should be. We have also raised this question of the 55 years of age.  We are trying to get that altered.  Now this has another side to it.  If we get it raised to 65 then a farmer of 55 or over will not have the opportunity of retiring until he is 65 and he will not be able to secure the benefits provided by the pension scheme.  This is a snag, but one cannot have it every way.</P>
    <P>The overall EEC contribution is only a little above 10 per cent.  This is a very serious snag.  It is just not possible for a small and weak member state, as we are by comparison with the others in the Community, to get anything like the same benefits other states get.  That is a serious snag.  We want to try to get more Community support.  I think it was Deputy Fahey referred to the fact that if a farmer buys stock he gets a 10 per cent <Col N="1609" /> grant while, if he rears the stock, he gets nothing.  That is a serious difficulty. We have raised this and we have got recognition of it.  So far we have failed to get results, but it is not for want of taking it to the Commission and trying.</P>
    <P>The position is that we have placed all these defects before the commission. We have had discussions on two occasions with the commission and we hope to have a further discussion at official level and then have an opportunity of discussing this at the Council of Ministers in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gibbons criticised the fact that Directive 159 was applied uniformly throughout the member states and he argued there was something all wrong about this. He is wrong in this.  It is, you must remember, a Community and we are members of it and the conditions are the same for every country in the Community and the farmer has to measure up to these conditions before he secures the grant aid provided. I do not think it really matters except that other countries were there before us and they have got a great many of these benefits.  One of the things about these schemes is many of the member States already had a great many of these things and they are now applying whatever assistance they are getting from the Community, but it is not improving the situation for the farmers.</P>
    <P>I said we have regionalised income and income in the west is now £1,785 and for the rest of the country it is £2,080.  In considering this matter of comparable income we will have to be careful not to argue for an income that is too low.  We want to bring our farmers up to the level of income of those employed outside farming.  If we do not do that we will make our farmers into second-class citizens.  Who wants to do that?  It might be a way of getting them into a higher level of grants, and that is important, but we want to aspire to a level of income which will ensure farmers will stay on the land and they will not stay <Col N="1610" /> unless they get an acceptable standard of living.  All of us should recognise that.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Hussey who regretted the number of small farmers.  Deputy Hussey and his party cannot opt out of this because they created most of them with their policy of 20- and 25-acre farms. Now we start regretting.  We must pin the responsibility on the right party.  The Opposition were 35 years in office and they went on producing these small, uneconomic holdings which are now causing all of us so much trouble.  We must all recognise that there must be consolidation and the only way that can be done is by reducing the number of farms. You cannot make a 20-acre farm viable unless you give the farmer more land.  That must be recognised.  If you give him more land you reduce two farmers to one.  That is logic. That is the only way it can be done in most of the country where you have small farms.  Otherwise, you must take one out of it altogether and give him a holding somewhere else.  That has been done in a limited way over the years and it continues to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey says six years is too long for any man to plan ahead. Farming is a slow business and you cannot make much change in a farm in less than three or four years. Perhaps six years is a bit long, but there must be targets.  Even in business there are targets and people think it is a good idea to have targets in business.</P>
    <P>With regard to the level of grants, we must have regard to the fact that by comparison with the previous level of grants available to farmers the grants are generous and the aims of the directive are good.  We have been trying to improve the directive.  We want to improve it.  The 30 per cent grant for building and the 50 per cent grant for land reclamation is a high level of grant when one considers the upper limits have been removed. There is now no upper limit of £45 or £50.  You get 50 per cent of whatever the job costs.</P>
    <P>I want to get out of people's minds <Col N="1611" /> once and for all the idea that transitional farmers are being badly dealt with and done down.  The fact is we have got 37,000 or 38,000 applicants. We have got 700 who are qualified to be development farmers who simply will not have it.  They will not take on the decision.  They want to be regarded as transitional farmers because they will not keep accounts and they will not go through the programme required of them and, therefore, in that sense it could perhaps be said that the grants for the transitional farmers are too high because you have these people opting in this way in order to get into the other category because they consider apparently that it is easier for them to do that and accept the grants in this way.  This is unfortunate for the country because, when we do that, the State pays the entire bill.  We want to get them into the development status because then, at least, we get a small contribution for Europe.</P>

      <P>Time and again the question has been asked: what will happen to other farmers after 1977? Deputy Fahey alleges farmers do not know what will happen after 1977. This is an old chestnut.  I have spoken about it in the House before but nobody wanted to listen.  I should like to set out the position again.  Directive 159 says that the provision enabling member states to give aids above the normal level to certain farmers outside the development category should be reviewed before April, 1977.  The issue is not whether other farmers will continue to get grants.  They will.  The issue is whether we will be allowed to continue to give them extra grants. The main concern of the review will be to assess whether there is further need in the Community context for such measures.  There will be discussion about the position of these farmers before the end of 1977.  Does anybody in this House, or in any member state, imagine that, if there are a large number of these farmers in existence after 1977, everybody can <Col N="1613" /> run away from them and leave them high and dry if there is no alternative employment for them?</P>
      <P>A question was raised about farmers in part-time employment not getting fair play.  What is part-time employment?  They are allowed to spend 50 per cent of their time on the farm and get 50 per cent of their income outside.  I would look upon that as part-time employment.  If that is the position, they are treated the same as anybody else.  I think this is fair. If they are development farmers at the end, they are still allowed to get 20 per cent of their income from outside, provided they have the income for one labour unit at the end of the six years.  I would not think this is unfair treatment for part-time farmers.</P>
      <P>There are three or four attitudes on this in the country.  Macra na Feirme are deploring the fact that we have 40,000 part-time farmers.  They are proud of this fact in Germany. Minister Ertl regularly refers to the wonderful success this is.  I see nothing wrong in having part-time farmers. Under this scheme they are being properly treated.</P>
      <P>The allocation of vacated land has also been raised and the fact that only development farmers are entitled to land.  There is a misunderstanding about this.  Deputy Cunningham raised it repeatedly.  A person who is entitled to priority here is a person who, when he gets additional land, is seen to come into the category of a development farmer.  If he can put forward a plan, assisted by the advisory services to do so, to show that if he gets ten or 20 acres extra he will be a development farmer, he can be programmed.  The development farmer is a man who has enough land already himself and who is programmed.</P>

      <P>One way or another my time has been taken.  I want to deal briefly with Directive 160 because I am told the response to Directive 160 has been quite good.  A large number of farmers are opting either <Col N="1614" /> for selling their farms and taking the pension or for a leasing arrangement, which is possible.  It has been said it is not possible, but it is possible.  I have a lot of extra information here but, unfortunately, I have not got time to give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

      <P>I gather from what the Minister said that he is anxious to make some changes and some improvements in the farm modernisation scheme.  Any help he requires from this side of the House will be forthcoming and, indeed, I am sure our representatives in the EEC will do likewise at that end.</P>
      <P>I was surprised at the Minister's statement that only 10 per cent of the moneys available under the farm modernisation scheme come from EEC funds.  This is a big disappointment to me.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on this on some future occasion. My understanding, and I think the public's understanding, of Directives 159, 160 and 161, was that 25 per cent was being put up by the EEC and 75 per cent by native Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>However, it is a surprise to me to learn that only 10 per cent represents EEC funds.</P>
      <P>Another surprising aspect of this&mdash; and the Minister talks about the public being misinformed&mdash;is that his Parliamentary Secretary is the most misinformed person in this House.  His Parliamentary Secretary stated categorically that there is no difference at all in the grants available to the development farmer and the transitional farmer.  The Minister has clarified that but I wish he would clarify the mind of his own Parliamentary Secretary who said otherwise here last night, and who said the grants were the same when, of course, they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed out two instances <Col N="1615" /> where the transitional farmer receives a lower grant.  I would ask the Minister if it is not a fact that the transitional farmer has not available to him the same variety of grants as has the development farmer.</P>
    <P>Another point mentioned by his Parliamentary Secretary and touched on by himself&mdash;and I do not want to go too deeply into Directive No. 160&mdash; is that a transitional farmer will receive land vacated by farmers under the farm retirement scheme.  That statement is marginally true only.  If, in that area, there are farmers who are classified as development farmers, they are entitled to first preference.</P>

      <P>In any review of the farm modernisation scheme the Minister must consider differentials between certain areas.  He called it regionalisation.  This is necessary but not only in respect of grants.  The whole scheme must be reappraised in such a way that more benefits will accrue to the farmers in the larger parts of the country, where there are small farmers, that is the west, and indeed in some other areas also.  It is a pity that more assistance is not given them.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the disadvantaged areas where very few of the farmers reap the advantage of either a transitional or development grant under this scheme.  So far many of the farm activities financed heretofore through grants by the Department are not now so financed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a common complaint.  In regard to the farm retirement scheme the Minister for Lands should make changes here so that it can be dovetailed with the farm modernisation scheme.  In most counties along the west coast 4 per cent only of farmers have been classified as development farmers.  I think that is roughly the average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 4 per cent or 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very small.  In reconsidering this and any proposals he may put to the EEC, the Minister should envisage that it may not be necessary in the case of better land where most of the farmers will qualify as development farmers, whereas farmers in the west and, indeed, in other areas are finding it very difficult to qualify as development farmers. That is why I urge that the facts of the case be put strongly by the Minister to the EEC so that he may be permitted, if he is not already, to regionalise this scheme and bring more farmers in the west under the development cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Lands was able to make very substantial changes in the farm retirement scheme.  One of <Col N="1618" /> his boasts was that he had made it a better scheme than those operated in other EEC countries.  I am surprised that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in charge of our most important industry, cannot stand up and make the same boast in respect of the farm modernisation scheme.  If he says that he is getting only 10 per cent from the EEC, then he should try for more and make a case for more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>And also that the subvention by our own Department should be greater.  After all, if the Minister for Lands can make a better case to the Government for the improvement of Directive No. 160, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries&mdash;apart from anything we ask him to do <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC&mdash; should make a case to the Government for dealing with many of the points highlighted by speakers on this side.</P>

I am sure the Minister will agree that what we advocate is reasonable.  He may not be able to achieve it all but he should make an effort to do so.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1) (a), line 4, to delete &ldquo;legitimate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This has been discussed at considerable length during the course of the debate.  At 10.30 this morning it was raised by myself and replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary, and again my request for further information on the matter was dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Section 16 reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  For the purposes of this Act and without prejudice to any obligations imposed by law or otherwise, the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  every man shall be liable to maintain such of his legitimate children as are under the age of sixteen years;</P>
      <P>With my amendment the section would read: &ldquo;Every man shall be liable to maintain such of his children as are under the age of 16 years&rdquo;. The Parliamentary Secretary has fairly dealt with my point on the matter of children born out of wedlock. He has expressed his point of view very thoroughly on it and he is in entire agreement with the view expressed by myself that the new law should not distinguish between legitimate children and those born out of wedlock.  I would respectfully urge the Parliamentary Secretary to accept the intentions of my amendment and to indicate once and for all that here we have a beginning of the abandonment of discrimination against those born out of wedlock.  I have opened the debate on it and I know I will be supported by my own party on this subject.  It is a matter now to see if the Parliamentary Secretary accepts the amendment.</P>

      <P>As I explained to Deputy Andrews this morning when this issue arose, under the Bill there is no distinction whatsoever with regard to payment made between children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock.  The only reason the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; appears in the Bill is that under the terms of the Bill health boards may seek to recover from people who would normally be responsible for the maintenance of dependants moneys paid by the health boards to maintain those people.  As I explained this morning, it would not be possible&mdash;and I am sure any reasonable person would accept this&mdash;for a health board to establish whether or not a particular person was in fact the father of a child born out of wedlock.  That is the only reason any reference at all appears in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I believe my views in this area are well known.  There is no element of discrimination whatever embodied in this Bill with regard to the reference to legitimate or illegitimate children. Other legislation provides other means.  Recovery can be made by the mother of the child under the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act, 1930.  As I explained at some considerable length, it would not be possible for a health board to pursue an alleged father of a child born out of wedlock for the recovery of any moneys paid by the health board towards the support or maintenance of that child.  That is the only reason any reference appears in this Bill, but by no stretch of the imagination could it be regarded as discriminatory.</P>

      <P>Is there any way in which the term could be applied to the parent rather than to the child? I always feel it is an injustice to call a child illegitimate.  It seems to me in the case of a child born out of wedlock that it is the parents who are illegitimate, not the child.  I can see the difficulty, as outlined by the Parliamentary Secretary, in not knowing who the father might be.  If the term &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; is to be used, could it not be applied to the parent?  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary's comment on this and to know <Col N="1623" /> if he has given any thought to the matter.</P>

      <P>Since the Parliamentary Secretary is not prepared to accept the amendment why not delete the word &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; entirely and say that every man shall be liable to maintain such of his children as are under the age of 16.  The actual use of the word indicates a certain discrimination.</P>

      <P>Two points have been raised.  If Deputy Briscoe is looking for my opinion I would not apply the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; to either child or parent.  There can be various reasons for these things.  Time and the rules of the Chair confine us to the business before us and do not permit for elaboration on this.  I understand that this section is necessary in the legislation to protect the health boards from being placed in a position where they could become involved not so much in the recovery of money they have paid in support of a child but in trying to establish whether or not a particular man was the father of a child born out of wedlock.  That is the sole reason this word appears in the legislation. As I said previously, there is absolutely no element of discrimination against the child born in such circumstances; but it is necessary to have this word in the Bill for the reasons I have just stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree in 1975, when there has been such a lot of talk about removing some of the undesirable phrases and references in the interests of eliminating discrimination, that it would be an opportunity to show some sign in this legislation, which is supposed to represent some advancement towards the changed outlook, that we are in earnest about removing some of those references? I understand the point he is making regarding the enforcement of the recovery and that it is necessary to spell out certain things in the Bill.  I believe that could be overcome easily by avoiding this term.  We should have a look at the matter before Report Stage to see if that could be done.  It <Col N="1624" /> may seem only a detail but it is rather important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern shown by the other side of the House for the use of the word and for some of the stigma which attaches to the use of the word in our society. I do not believe if this word were deleted from this legislation that it would have any effect whatsoever or that it would make any contribution whatsoever towards changing the outlook in our society and the understanding of very many people in our society towards not only children born out of wedlock but people's attitude and behaviour towards women and girls who have children born out of wedlock.  The attitude of some of our would-be respecters of society towards these other members of our society is equally important.</P>
      <P>While I appreciate fully some of the points raised by Members of the Opposition in relation to this I believe if any benefit can be derived from the elimination of the word &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; it would be more appropriate to other legislation.  I am advised that it is necessary in this Bill for the sole purpose that I have indicated&mdash;that it would not be practicable or possible for health boards to be involved in trying to establish who is the father of a child born out of wedlock.  That is the only reason that there is any reference in the Bill to the words &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; or &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo;.  In the circumstances it is a necessary safeguard against that type of involvement for a health board and I am sure that having heard the explanation the necessity for it being in the Bill will be accepted by the Oppostion.</P>

      <P>This is purely a protective mechanism against the possibility of a notice being served by the health board in the form of an unregistered letter which might fall into wrong hands.

The only exception is that I could not accept that all such notices could only be sent by registered post: some must be served by hand.  In the case of a deserting husband, for instance, while his place of employment might be known and might be fairly stable his place of residence could change fairly frequently and it would be impossible to ensure that notice served upon him even by registered post would be received by him.  It might also be difficult to establish, even if he did receive it that he did, in fact, receive it.  We must have flexibility but I accept that where it is served by post it should be served by registered post.  We must have the alternative to cater for the case I <Col N="1626" /> have mentioned, that notice can be served personally upon a defendant.</P>

      <P>It is certainly examined against the background of our membership of the EEC and the implications of that membership but it might not always be possible for a health board to recover money due to them or even to serve notice if somebody is living abroad.  That does not necessarily apply in regard to the persons entitled to be maintained. They could well have notice served on them under the new legislation&mdash; not this Bill&mdash;and be able to receive maintenance.

Section 16 provides that action may be taken to compel a person liable to support another&mdash;that would to some extent meet the case of a man who drinks his allowance before he goes home.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 36, to add &ldquo;or the Court may be additional order direct that the amount of the contribution be deducted from such person's income and paid to the health board&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is consistent, I think, with up-to-date thinking on legislation which should now be acceptable to this House.  Members of the Special Committee on the Family Law Bill are dealing with the type of intention envisaged in my amendment, where the defaulting judgment debtor, presumably the husband, fails to honour a court order on a weekly basis.  In those circumstances the order, further to the order envisaged under section 17 (4), should have an additional element, namely, that the husband's salary should be attached to ensure payment without fail of the orders directed to be paid by the court.  It is a reasonable proposition and one which is consistent with another Bill being dealt with by a Special Committee of the House. It is also a recommendation envisaged in the 19th Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure. The amendment would not affect the section which, as set down, is a good one.  It would be an additional beneficial element and I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to be consistent in legislation of this nature by accepting this amendment; we are attempting to be consistent in our opposition in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the publication of the 19th Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure I stated my position in relation to the attachment <Col N="1628" /> of salaries at source and that was an indication of the intention of this party to ensure that such a situation would be brought about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not as simple as the Deputy thinks.  I am not questioning the thought behind his amendment.  However, if a father does not support his wife and children and they avail of the provisions under this Bill which would permit an allowance to be paid to them, there is nothing to stop that woman going to court under the provisions of the legislation before the Special Committee of this House.  It would be possible for her under that legislation to obtain an attachment order on the husband's earnings. That would be a court intervening between a citizen and his direct responsibilities towards his dependants. I am advised that it is constitutionally questionable whether the attachment order could be made in respect of money to be payable to a health board or local authority.</P>
      <P>I am not questioning the motivation behind the amendment but it is not possible to accept it.  The provisions of the Bill do not interfere with the legitimate rights of the wife to pursue in the courts a husband who is not living up to his responsibilities and to have, under the provisions of the Bill before the Special Committee, an attachment order made on his earnings payable directly to her.  An attachment order for money to be payable to a health board or local authority is not on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt about the constitutionality of the amendment.  It fully subscribes to the Constitution and the House would not be consistent if the amendment is not accepted.  I have suggested that the salaries be attached at source when the money is outstanding by the judgment debtor or the person in debt to the health board or local authority.  In the normal way if I owed money to a health board that is an irrefutable fact.  In my view, the law in those circumstances would fully subscribe to the Constitution and the constitutionality of my <Col N="1629" /> amendment cannot be in question. If a citizen or a company owes money to a health board that board is entitled to pursue that citizen or company through the courts to ensure that money is paid.  Under those circumstances I envisage this as an analogous situation and I find it difficult to understand how the Parliamentary Secretary can wave the Constitution at us as a reason for not accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Andrews' legal background, I must accept the advice offered to me in regard to the constitutionality of the provision.  There is no question of the health board being owed money by an individual and the board not seeking to recover that money through the courts.  Of course the boards will, and they are entitled to, do that.  But the amendment suggests that an attachment order be made on the man's earnings and the money due be stopped at source.  I am advised that it is questionable if this is permissible under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>There is a vast difference between that and the case of a deserted wife with five or six children pursuing through the courts her right to maintenance for herself and her children from her deserting husband.  Under the Bill before the Special Committee the court can stop money at source in respect of these responsibilities and pay it directly to the person involved. There is a difference in the courts doing that and an employer stopping money at source to be paid to a health authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lady in question is not debarred from pursuing through the courts her right to maintenance and the health board are not debarred from pursuing through the normal channel the person responsible for the maintenance, the person who owes the board money because that board intervened to ensure he lived up to his responsibility. The Deputy's amendment seeks to stop the money at source and make an attachment order in regard to the person's earnings.  I am advised that this cannot be done because the <Col N="1630" /> money is owed to a health board or a local authority, but under the provisions of this legislation it can and will be possible so far as the person directly affected, the wife, is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House could agree to this section because it adds a further burden of 40 per cent on the rates.  I would have thought that this Bill was an opportunity for the Government to give a practical expression to their avowed principle of reducing the rates and easing the burden on ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When discussing other sections today I tried to get from the Parliamentary Secretary the extent to which he expected this would impinge on the rates.  I was talking about better provision for those who formerly benefited under the Home Assistance Acts.  I am sure the Minister is not possessed of the necessary foresight to gauge the extent to which the net may be spread in regard to extra supplementary allowances over and above the limits set out in the Bill.  To estimate the cost is difficult, but one thing is certain&mdash;it will mean very definite extra burdens on the health board, and if the Bill is to be as generous as the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, if its provisions are to be spread as widely as he said, the cost will be very heavy.  These will be added to the existing health charges which have been escalating <Col N="1633" /> beyond the ability of people to pay and the two alone will impose massive extra charges on the rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister will argue that he is paying 60 per cent of the increase over the base year of 1975.  We argue that this Bill presents the first opportunity to the Government to demonstrate their anxiety to ease the burden of rates, but from all estimates this Bill will make the rates burden even greater at a time when the Central Fund should be coming to the relief of local authorities who will be further mulcted to pay the cost of home assistance.  We cannot permit this to happen.  We have had the amendment of Deputy Andrews which states that the Minister shall, out of the Central Fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section unless the Minister is prepared to give an undertaking that he is prepared to amend it in the manner everybody desires.  A lot of play was made about the desire to remove the stigma of home assistance but here we are still hanging on to the local rate which in itself is a stigma from the point of view that beneficiaries will be aware the local authorities, local ratepayers, are coming to their rescue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take a man living in a little cottage with a £5 valuation on the side of a mountain.  He pays more than £60 in rates at a time when we should have had a serious undertaking to relieve the rates.  This has a serious effect on poorer sections.  If that man repairs his cottage, he will find that his valuation will jump to £10, £15 or £20.  He then finds himself having to pay £120 in rates annually and to tell him that he is contributing to the home assistance classes under this new Bill introduced by this Government will not make him feel happier.  It will not remove any of the stigma attached to the home assistance scheme.  I do not think anybody can defend this method of financing this legislation, least of all a Government that had given a solid <Col N="1634" /> undertaking to work towards the complete relief of the rates burden, a burden that is increasing each year.</P>
    <P>Why is the opportunity to do this not being availed of here?  It would lend some air of credibility to the Government's commitment.  What is being granted&mdash;60 per cent of the increase&mdash;is a poor gesture towards that commitment.  Nobody can be satisfied with that proposal.  The gateway is being opened in this Bill for the operation of Parkinson's Law.  Many new appointments will be made by the health boards to enable them to administer this legislation.  There will have to be machinery for appeals and for recovery.  There will be involved, too, a great deal of investigation, all of which means a substantial additional arm of the administration of the health boards.  While the Parliamentary Secretary may say that some personnel will be transferred to the health boards from local authorities, we can rest assured that there will be no reduction in the personnel of local authorities but that many extra officials will be appointed by the health boards.  Therefore, the cost of the administration of this legislation can be expected to spiral year by year.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of the Bill are to be worthwhile, the cost will be astronomical. We are witnessing another demonstration of the deception of this Government.  What the Government are saying is that while they are implementing better social welfare legislation they are ensuring that it will be paid for at local level.  Already the local authorities are unable to meet rising costs.  Can anybody here predict the local rates for next year?</P>
    <P>There is provision in this Bill for going beyond the prescribed rates of assistance and for the interpretation of one's needs but the cost of all this will bear heavily on the smallholder who already is paying rates as high as £13 in the £ in some of the poorest counties.  I am glad to be able to remind the House that in our time we derated his bit of land and when the time comes we will do the same in respect of his private dwelling.  In the meantime, though he is burdened with having to pay rates on his little <Col N="1635" /> cottage which for this purpose is valued at £5, £10 or £12 with the result that he may be paying more than £100 in rates.  He will be paying virtually for benefits that he will be seeking himself because the stage has been reached of transferring the benefit merely from one pocket to another.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations there is to remain the stigma attached to home assistance.  Recipients of this benefit were often embarrassed that their neighbour should be paying extra rates to meet the cost of the scheme but that is to continue.  Having listened to us perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary has had a change of heart and intends amending the section before Report Stage, a step which I urge him strongly to take because the people have had enough.</P>

      <P>I rise to support Deputy Brennan and to say that this section makes a mockery of the Government's promise to reduce rates.  I speak only from experience in my own county where we are faced with a record rate of approximately £12.20 in the £, a considerable amount of which is due to increased health charges and also because of the liberal attitude we adopted in relation to home assistance.  We will be asked to support this legislation to the tune of almost £300,000 in the current year plus 40 per cent of any extra cost to what can be called the base figure for 1975.</P>
      <P>As happened in the case of the health boards, I can foresee a series of appointments to administer this section so that not only will we have to meet the cost of the supplementary allowances but also the cost of the administration of the scheme.  I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary can ask a member of a local authority to give to the health boards what is virtually a blank cheque because the Bill, quite rightly, leaves a certain amount of discretion with the home assistance officers and leaves with the Minister the power to increase the allowances which I am sure will increase each year in relation to increases in the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1636" /> The Parliamentary Secretary should now accept that this section will cause undue hardship to local authorities all along the western seaboard, especially in those areas where you have a number of people who will be recipients of these supplementary allowances and where you have the smallest valuations and the biggest rate per £.  Mayo County Council have been discussing this to estimate how much this will cost.  Frankly, we have been unable to reach a conclusion but we think the cost to us in the first full year will be at least double what we are now paying.  One of the charges made on almost every platform in West Mayo against Mayo County Council and the members of that body was that the rates were so high because the county council was controlled by a Fianna Fáil majority.  This at least will help to kill that charge because what the Parliamentary Secretary is asking us to do now is to accept that these allowances, which I welcome, will to the extent of at least 40 per cent be paid out of our rates.  That is something we will be unable to do and that is something we will have to oppose as strongly as we can on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>This alleged imposition, as it has been described by Deputy Brennan and others, on local authorities must be brought back into its proper perspective.  What exactly is involved?  Under the old Home Assistance Act, which this Bill will replace, 100 per cent of home assistance was borne by the rates.  There was no Exchequer contribution of any kind. Fianna Fáil speakers are trying to get it across to the people that this is the first time there will be an imposition on the rates when in fact the exact opposite is the case.  There will now be an acceptance by the Exchequer of 60 per cent of any additional expenditure over and above the 1975 rate and that means that the other 40 per cent will be shared proportionately amongst 31 local authorities and not borne by just one local authority.  Granted, there is only one Exchequer and it will be liable for 60 per cent.  There are 31 local authorities and they will be asked to bear <Col N="1637" /> proportionately between them 40 per cent of the additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically every Opposition Member from the introduction of this Bill right through to this Committee Stage accepted that this was a good Bill, acknowledged that it would do things that were long overdue and acknowledged that we were restoring to those at the lowest end of the scale economically speaking a certain dignity. On the other hand, they now introduce the emotive issue of rates.  Taken out of context this can only lead to misrepresentation.  Deputy Brennan said 1975 was a bad year from the point of view of expenditure on home assistance and that is the year to be taken as the basis.  If one looks at the situation and examines what happened over the last two-and-a-half to three years, from the Exchequer's point of view it might have been much more favourable to pick another year because what has been happening over the last two-and-a-half years is that people, who had no other resources and nothing on which to maintain themselves, because of the broadening of the scope of eligibility for social welfare benefits and allowances ceased to be a liability on the local rates as they would have been had they been in receipt of home assistance.  Over the last two-and-a-half years there has been a very, very considerable easing of the means test which resulted in making quite a number of people eligible for non-contributory old age pensions, widows pensions and so on. Before the easement of the means test these people had no alternative except to seek home assistance.  The reduction in the pension age has given another outlet to people who would otherwise be a charge on the local authority, and solely on the local authority.  Such things have been introduced as allowances for unmarried mothers, deserted wives, prisoners' dependants, single women and so on.  A whole range of people have been brought in over the last two-and-a-half years and that has resulted in a diminution of responsibility where local authorities are concerned. It is very important that through misrepresentation, designed or otherwise, an emotional atmosphere is not created amongst ratepayers <Col N="1638" /> against those who want to avail of their rights under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not object for one moment to people on the other side of the House saying the Exchequer should accept the full cost, but I do object when we get this emotional approach which distorts the actual impact it will have on the rates, and which can lead, and is in great danger of leading, to a climate of opinion being created, by misrepresentation of the facts, against people who want to avail of their rights under this piece of legislation.  I repeat: the fact is that local authorities in the past and at this moment&mdash;and this will remain the position until this Bill comes into operation&mdash;are responsible for 100 per cent of expenditure on home assistance. In this Bill, the Exchequer is picking up 60 per cent of the additional cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I genuinely do not believe the vast majority of the ratepayers would object in any way to the relatively small charge this will impose on them in order to do what is enshrined in this Bill, that is, to return their dignity to the people who avail of these services. I impress this again upon Deputies. Do not, by exaggeration or distortion of what the impact of this Bill will be on the rates, build up a climate of opinion among ratepayers which will militate against these unfortunate people who are the least privileged in our society.</P>

      <P>If the old Home Assistance Act had one stigma more than another, it was the knowledge that the benefit was paid out of the local rates. People who drew it felt their neighbours were contributing to them.  It went through the hands of the county council and did not pass just from one door to another.  Here was an opportunity to remove one definite stigma. It was a greater opportunity.  It was an opportunity to relieve the rates of a burden with which they will now be saddled for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not go so far as to say this was an easy year for home assistance payments.  He recited a number of benefits which, he said, took the load off.  Is he aware it was the worst year the local authorities had to face?  They had to face the highest charges since home assistance was first introduced.  Does he deny that?  That is to be the base year.  This charge will be tagged to them for the rest of their lives by a Government who promised to reduce the rates. There is no getting away from that. We will not be silenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will make it clear to the people who have to face this extra charge on the rates.  Not merely was the opportunity not taken to ease the burden as was promised, but they will have to pay 40 per cent of the extra charge.  If the Bill is to be worth the paper it is written on it will spread <Col N="1640" /> out to give more and better rates to more people.  That is why we are here. That is why we praise this legislation. If the Bill does that it will impose a severe charge.</P>
      <P>The magnitude of the extra charge is more than the councils have been able to estimate so far.  They have been wrestling with it for the past few weeks and they do not know.  It is a completely unknown factor to them.  If it is anything like the health charges we have no difficulty in anticipating how it will be reflected in the local rates when they are being struck for next year, and particularly the year after when the Bill will have been a full year in operation.  We have not yet heard the appointed day when the Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister, or the Parliamentary Secretary on his behalf, is not trying to defend for two definite reasons the imposition of this charge on local rates when it is the first genuine concrete opportunity the Government have had to give expression to their avowed purpose to reduce the rates and to remove the stigma of the old home assistance.  The beneficiaries under the old scheme felt their neighbours were contributing to it by paying extra rates, which was true.  We are told to keep quiet and not to be emotional.</P>
      <P>Even at this stage the Minister should pull back and delete that section and meet the cost of this from the Central Fund.  If he has a lot of money to spend&mdash;and he has told us there will be no shortage of money for social welfare&mdash;surely he should keep his hands off the local rates. Does he appreciate the standard of living of the man in the small cottage on the side of the hill which has a low valuation of £8 or £10?  This man has to pay a £100 in rates.  He may be a beneficiary under the social welfare code.  He may be submitting an application under this Bill for relief from rates.  This is too much of a change from one pocket to another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has done well in bringing in this legislation. He should now go the whole way and announce that the Government are prepared to relieve the rates <Col N="1641" /> of this burden and prepared to remove the stigma caused by the old home assistance and that these people will be paid direct from the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should not take exception to our arguments.  We can prove categorically that a very heavy imposition is placed on ratepayers under this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to read some figures which I asked the accountant in Mayo County Council for when this Bill was first introduced in the House on 19th June.  Expenditure in Mayo on home assistance up to 31st March, 1973, was £86,143.  Up to the end of March, 1974, it was £115,080.  In the nine months of 1974&mdash;from March until the end of December&mdash;expenditure was £120,933, and for 1975 we have provided £201,500 in our estimates.  We have spent to date £280,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out by other speakers and by myself earlier, when I may have &ldquo;jumped the gun&rdquo; in relation to this section, it is obvious that expenditure will be much higher in the future.  We will be responsible for administration.  In the health boards there will be extra personnel.  When we were running the health services under the county councils we did a reasonable job in an endeavour to keep staffing and so on at a certain level.  Now many extra staff have been appointed; there are CEOs, programme <Col N="1642" /> managers and all sorts of extra staff.  This pattern will be followed right along the line when this Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the extra services which will be provided. At present there are certain areas where people are entitled to free fuel and so on.  This will apply in every health board area, which will increase the cost of the whole operation.  It does not matter what argument the Parliamentary Secretary puts up, we are not going to be able to manage on that figure of £280,000 which has been spent this year in Mayo.  Next year we will have an increased demand for expenditure.  Granted 60 per cent of it will be paid by the National Exchequer.  Still it means that the local authority in the future will be faced with an increased bill for home assistance.  It does not matter how the Parliamentary Secretary tries to paint the picture.  We are not trying to be emotional on this side of the House.  We are giving solid facts as we see them as representatives of local authorities.</P>
    <P>That is why I add my voice to that of others in requesting that this be made a national charge.  I put down a parliamentary question on this matter in May, 1973, asking that payment of home assistance be made a national charge.  It is a fair way of dealing with the matter and eliminates the imposition of further hardship on ratepayers. As has been stated, in our own county we are faced with a demand of £12.57; certainly we will be paying over £12 in rates this year.  At present a small shopkeeper is barely able to keep his door open because of various increases and the way business in general is declining.  Those are the kind of people who will be hardest hit by this type of demand.  Indeed, many of them may be faced with the position of having to apply for home assistance themselves.  Take the case of people who are self-employed, who are finding it difficult to eke out an existence and, incidentally, are not covered under this Bill.  They are the people who will really have to face these extra charges on rates.  We are not being emotional.  We are simply <Col N="1643" /> giving the solid facts as we see them and, in particular, in relation to our own counties.</P>

      <P>If I sound emotional about rates I will not apologise to any person in this House.  To me it is an emotional problem because I come from a constituency where the word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is a highly emotive one. &ldquo;Rate&rdquo; is a four-letter word considered to have a very bad meaning.  I cannot help feeling emotional about it.</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us how much money in 1974 was provided by all the local authorities for home assistance, the total moneys provided in that year for home assistance and the projected total figure for 1975?  The Parliamentary Secretary may have the figures in front of him and, if he has not, he should have.  If one compares the 1974 figures with those for 1975, then the Parliamentary Secretary's boast that he is only going to pay 40 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>60 per cent; I beg your pardon, using the 1975 figures as a base sounds rather hollow and shallow.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House consider&mdash;and it has become almost a cliché through its constant use&mdash;rates on urban and rural dwellings to be an outdated and penal tax.  We had the Minister for Local Government coming out in his usual bland fashion saying something would be done about the matter of rates.  If we heard him once we heard him ten times and still nothing has been done about them. Even the Minister for Local Government agrees with us that people in private dwellings should not be asked to pay rates.  We have an opportunity to uplift the proposals here from the rates, put them on the Central Exchequer or charge them to central funds, which we believe is a reasonable suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know my amendment proposing that has been ruled out of order.  We say to the Parliamentary Secretary that he could introduce an amendment, <Col N="1644" /> as proposed by this side of the House.  As we consider it a matter that will have to be examined at some future date, with great respect to the Chair&mdash;and I do not wish in any way to contest his ruling&mdash; we feel we are being discriminated against in Opposition by not being in a position to propose at least charges on central funds. We feel the proposal should not be ruled out of order in the first instance. Indeed we should be afforded an opportunity of discussing it.  Then if the Parliamentary Secretary, or whoever is in his place, feels that our proposals are acceptable, they should be so accepted.  But to rule out a discussion on an amendment which proposes a charge on central funds is to me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, without apology to the House, I am emotional about rates and will continue to be.  They are a penal form of taxation.  The opportunity presents itself to the House now to lift home assistance as a charge from the rates. No matter how much the Parliamentary Secretary boasts about the amount being paid&mdash;in this case 60 per cent&mdash; by central funds or the Exchequer, it is not good enough, the burden becomes more harrowing and hardships more severe.  As a public representative, I have seen them.  No later than yesterday I received two letters from individual constituents of mine complaining about the burden of rates on them, and <Col N="1645" /> these people were widows.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is serious about reforming the law he has an opportunity now to do so.</P>
    <P>We have given an undertaking&mdash;no matter how much the Parliamentary Secretary or the Government sneer at us&mdash;to abolish rates as a matter of urgency.  One of our first priorities when we return to power will be to lift the rates burden&mdash;call it what you will&mdash; from the ordinary householder.</P>

He also said that all that was being asked of local authorities was a very small increase. If that is the case, on behalf of Mayo I am asking him to take up that small increase.  Will he accept 1973 as the base year?  This Bill is another example of Government thinking, of bringing in legislation and asking others to pay. We have had examples in the grants offered in relation to the Road Fund: in Mayo we have been asked to pay £ for £ for a special grant.  Quite rightly the Parliamentary Secretary has hailed this Bill as a tremendous advance.  He said it will give back some dignity to people but, at the same time, he is not prepared to take up excess expenditure even over 1975.  Let the Government prove their social conscience.  If they are going to call the tune we are asking them to pay the piper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious the Parliamentary Secretary is going to pursue what is in the Bill.  Has he considered that the poorer local authorities did not have schemes as large as those operated in better-off areas due to the burden they would impose on the ratepayers?  If a national scale is <Col N="1646" /> introduced this increase will fall much heavier on the north-western counties.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has spoken about the emotive words used on this side of the House about rates. An important fact is that by this legislation there will be a considerable burden on the local authorities concerned and we are asking the elected representatives to rate accordingly while they will have no control over the services.  This is a very serious situation.  It is generally accepted that after this year health charges will no longer be a charge on the rates.  I understand that because it will be operated by the health boards it will be known as a health service and will be costed accordingly.  There are many ways in which difficulties may be encountered in relation to the contribution. When the health boards were formed the various county managers made arrangements with the CEOs and these agreements differed from one health board area to another. What is the situation where the local authority handed over the lot to the health board?  All these things can discriminate against the local authority that retained the overall running of the home assistance services.</P>

      <P>The cost to the Exchequer would be 60 per cent over and above the 1975 figure.  The Deputy may not be aware that the 40 per cent is divided proportionately among 31 local authorities.  The 60 per cent is borne by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be fair to the Deputy because I think he has a point with regard to Mayo.  I had discussions with all of the CEOs regarding the introduction of the scheme after the Bill was circulated and the CEOs from Mayo made the valid point that that county had increased its allocation on home assistance quite substantially.  In fact, the allocation was increased from £116,000 in 1974 to £214,000 in 1975.  To me that indicates that Mayo has been trying to live up to its responsibilities in this area.  It means, however, that Mayo will have to pay proportionately more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <P>I never give warning of it.  The Deputy spoke of receiving letters from two constituents whom he stated were widows.  Undoubtedly rates are a problem to some people in that position, not all.  The fact that one is a widow does not necessarily mean that one has not got the material goods of this world.  As far as material goods are concerned one can be better off financially by being a widow than by being a wife.</P>

      <P>Anyway the position is, as I have stated, that 1975 is the base year in the Bill.  A large number of people have been taken off home assistance by virtue of the fact that the social welfare code has been extended very considerably by easement of the means test, lowering of the pension age, unmarried, mother's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, prisoner's dependants' benefit, single women's benefit&mdash;a number of things have been done.</P>

      <P>I think it is important that we should pay tribute to the home assistance officers as they are now.  They will of course become officers of the health boards under this legislation.  These are men of experience, a body of men of the highest integrity, and they have been proved by the operation of the 1939 Act to be men of the highest integrity and efficiency.  It is suggested that in future those appointed by the health boards to operate this legislation will have training available to them. Nevertheless, it is only fair to point out that the men who are transferred to the health boards by virtue of the provisions of this Bill are men whose experience is irreplaceable.  I think it would be wrong of the House to conclude its deliberations on the Bill without paying tribute to them.  It is my duty and pleasure to pay such tribute.</P>
      <P>They have had a very difficult task to perform.  They have been daily exposed to human hardship of the worst kind in our society and they have met this challenge with the highest possible integrity.  In the main, they are a body of men who have shown themselves to have experience and understanding in relation to the various problems they have met with on a daily basis.  It is a harrowing experience for us as Deputies to meet the type of cases that home assistance officers have to meet and deal with on a daily basis because they, as distinct from us, meet such cases daily and deal with their problems daily.  This must, in some way, affect them and affect their attitude to human life. Their attitude has not been found wanting in any respect.  I felt I should pay that tribute that is properly due to them.</P>

      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Andrews in what he has said about the officers who are already engaged in operating this scheme.  I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary briefly what is the position of part-time officers, people who have been engaged part-time. There are four that I know of in my own county who are not full-time officers but are employed on a part-time basis.  As far as I am aware they have no pension rights or superannuation scheme to avail of.  What will the position be when this Bill becomes law?  Will they be allowed to continue to hold their position?  It is only right, because they have been working for a long period with the local authority, that their rights should be protected.</P>

We were fortunate to have had such dedicated men as home assistance officers. They gave a valuable service working under difficult circumstances in trying to implement the terms of an ancient piece of legislation.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Gallagher I should like to state that there will be no change in the position of these officers.  Their position is not threatened in any way by the transfer. In order to try and ensure a smooth transition from the present arrangements we will engage in discussions with representatives of the home assistance officers when this Bill is passed.  A working party is engaged in discussions to ensure a smooth transfer.  That party is also concerned with such matters as careers structure, methods of recruitment and methods of training after recruitment.</P>

      <P>What has happened is that the Minister has been led astray by thinking in terms of the inheritance tax and failing to appreciate in this connection that a gift tax was something different.  I may be completely wrong but I seem to discern the thinking behind this as follows: if a death were to occur before five years had elapsed there is the possibility of defeating in that case the rule which provided that all gifts within five years of death were to be brought into account.  I can see, therefore, that an aggregation to deal with that case is fair, just and equitable.</P>
      <P>In so far as inheritance tax is concerned an aggregation of this sort would appear to be justifiable.  What is not appreciated here is that we are bringing in not only an inheritance tax, which substitutes for the death duty code and improves it, but also the gift tax <i>inter vivos</i> which is something which was unknown to the law before the passing of this Act and is deemed, and always will be deemed, to be unknown to the law until the intention is disclosed, in other words, on the date set by this Bill&mdash;28th February, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go anterior to that with the gift tax <i>inter vivos</i>, where no death intervenes, to capture the gift, as it would have been captured in the case of death duties, is introducing an element of objectionable retrospection and setting a precedent here that is disturbing. We have become accustomed to taxes being made retrospective but they were usually made retrospective <Col N="1659" /> in a definite way and for a definite purpose.  The effect of this is to make a tax retrospective on something which was untaxable and in contemplation of law, whatever about rumour or general talk outside, could not have expected to have been taxed in 1969.  That is the reason I consider this aggregation in the case of all gifts objectionable. If, for instance, paragraph (a) were deleted, the aggregation might be defensible, because paragraph (b) refers to any taxable inheritance taken by that donee, as successor, from the same disponer on or after the 1st day of April, 1975.  That would simply mean that a case can be made for the aggregation; but in respect of the other I urge the Minister to delete paragraph (a).  It will not mean much to him in money; it means some will get away with it.  But, even if it operated in favour of a few, the principle of surprise retrospection is disturbing.  I use the words &ldquo;surprise retrospection&rdquo; because it would be reasonable to suppose&mdash;and I think a court would so hold&mdash;that in the continuation of the scheme, or the changeover, a loophole for benefit to people for five years under the death duty code would be covered.</P>
    <P>With regard to a gift which was absolutely free in 1969&mdash;and which would still be free if not for this Bill &mdash;while there was a possibility of it being captured on a death, if no death intervened you could have been confident in 1969 that no tax or tax liability would in any way attach to the gift.  With that distinction there is a difference in the quality of the retrospection involved in this section in the two cases.  I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider the matter in that light.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were always at risk of paying estate duty.  That is one <Col N="1660" /> aspect of the matter.  What matters is ability to pay tax.  A person who received £100,000 on 27th February, 1974, and another £100,000 on 1st March, 1974, would have the same capacity to pay tax as the person who received £200,000 on 1st March, 1974. Therefore, it is reasonable to look to the accumulation of gifts which people have received over a period and compare their capacity to pay as a result of those gifts with the capacity of those who receive a similar amount after the date in question.  We are not doing something which is unknown elsewhere I would refer the House to a recent study by Stanford, Willis and Ironside on <i>An Accessions Tax</i> published by the English Institute of Fiscal Studies in 1973.  The accessions to tax set out there are more extensive than our acquisition tax, but the principle we are dealing with here, that of aggregation, is valid to both taxes.  They argued that there should be aggregation of benefits received for a period of at least seven years.  In fact, they recommended up to ten years before the commencement of the new tax and the reason they offered for this approach was to ensure that taxpayers would be taxed according to their taxable capacity and also to avoid a serious shortfall in revenue especially in the early years.  In considering a person's taxable capacity they considered, and I consider, that gifts taken in a reasonable period before the commencement of the tax should be aggregated, not to tax the gifts themselves but rather to determine what is the rate appropriate to a gift which may be made subsequently and which, together with the previous gifts, would put the recipients in a position to pay a higher rate of tax than they would pay if they received only a small amount.  The decision to aggregate gifts taken in the five years prior to the White Paper published on 28th February, 1974, but not to tax them, was taken for the reasons to which I referred.  The tax will certainly be small in any event because of the exceptionally generous thresholds to the immediate family, by whom most inheritance gifts are taken, and if there are persons outside these thresholds and within the immediate <Col N="1661" /> family they are people of not inconsiderable substance and they are people who will have taken possession of considerable benefits, benefits which would have accrued to them within a period of five years.  It cannot be seriously suggested that there are elements of hardship or inequity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They will pay no tax whatsoever on early gifts.  They will simply pay tax on later gifts which are topping up and they will pay a tax only on the topping up of the early gifts which bring them above certain thresholds.</P>
      <P>Now, if people have received gifts in the five years between 1969 and 1974 and received nothing after 1974, they will not be asked to pay tax.  This is clearly evidence that there is no element of retrospection.  We are not going back to tax those gifts and it is only where people receive something subsequent to the introduction of the capital acquisitions tax that they will be asked to pay anything at all.  The question of retrospection certainly does not arise.  What does arise is that we are providing a measure of the ability of people to pay a tax, having ascertained their ability by looking at the accumulation of gifts they have received.  We say that is the appropriate way to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I am mystified.  Earlier in the debate the Minister referred to the necessity to project the tax base and in the quotation he gave just now there was a reference to a shortfall in revenue.  I am mystified by this because what we are dealing with here is a new tax, a gift tax applicable as on and from 28th February, 1974.  There could be no shortfall in revenue from that if it is applied to all gifts coming within the terms of the Bill which occurred on or after 28th February, 1974.  There cannot be any question of protecting the tax base in so far as the base is related <Col N="1662" /> to gifts occurring on or after that date.</P>
      <P>Now it is not by accident that the five-year period appears in this section. Quite clearly that period is related to what Deputy de Valera was talking about and that is the provision in the death duty code whereby a gift made more than five years before the death of the donor was free of duty.  If the donor died during the five-year period there was a graduated scale of duty payable depending on the length of time the donor lived after he gave the gift.  Deputy de Valera suggested that the aggregation was fair enough in regard to those kinds of gifts.  I go even further.  If the Minister wanted to have in this Bill a provision the effect of which was that in the case of such gifts there would be no escapable duty or tax&mdash;whatever you like to call it&mdash;and that the same amount would be paid if the death duty code had not been suspended, I would go along with that fully without any difficulty.  But that is not what the Minister is doing.  Whatever way he puts it he is engaging in retrospection and I propose to demonstrate that to him by asking him to consider the following: if a gift were made of £x in 1969 and a gift were made of £y in 1975, under this section the amount of gift tax payable is calculated by referring to the sum of x+y.  If, on the other hand, a gift of £y had been made in 1975 and no previous gift had been made the tax payable would be calculated in relation to £y, not to £x+£y and it would be a different rate.  There is no way the Minister can argue that that means there is no retrospection simply because the tax is levied on £y.  If there is a different rate of tax levied on the same amount of gift, depending on whether or not there was a gift made before 28th February, 1974, surely it is obvious that the amount of tax is calculated in reference to and is controlled by a gift made before 28th February, 1974, and, if that is so, how can one describe it as anything other than retrospection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider very strongly the suggestion we are making and he can do what we suggest either in the aggregation way Deputy de Valera suggested or even a straight <Col N="1663" /> continuation of liability for such gifts as would have existed under the death duty code&mdash;it will run out in a few years anyway&mdash;and we would certainly support that.  But do not arrange affairs, as they are arranged in this section, so as to increase the liability to tax based on things that occurred before 28th February, 1974.  That is retrospection.  It is dangerous.  It is unfair.  It is a very dangerous precedent to introduce. The Minister should not do it. As Deputy de Valera pointed out, there is probably not very much involved anyway but, even if there were, it would not be justified.  It is a most dangerous thing for the Minister to do.  If his concern is to ensure that these people who would have had to pay under the death duty code, who may still well have to pay on gifts where the donor dies within five years, then provide for them, make them liable, make them pay up.  We have no objection to that, but do not, by introducing the concept of gifts made earlier, in fact introduce retrospection.</P>
    <P>There is, in my view, no reason at all if you are going to go back why you should stop at five years.  The Minister talks about the ability of people to pay.  If the Minister wants to be logical and assess people's ability to pay, then relate it to the wealth tax.  Their ability to pay can be determined in that way. Surely the Minister can see this is not really relevant.  It is a question of adhering to a principle and not allowing people to escape the liability they would have had if the death duty code were in operation in regard to such gifts, but do not introduce retrospection, which is what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>I urge him very strongly to consider the dangers implicit in this section as drafted.  We will support him if he wants to ensure that people who would have been liable under the death duty code will have the same liability until the death duty code runs out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to <Col N="1664" /> thank you for permitting me to raise this matter on the adjournment because it is a matter of some importance and carries not merely implications for education but also economic and social implications.  The format of Question No. 10 on the Order Paper of Tuesday, 18th November, is:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Education if he will make a statement on the Government's policy concerning (a) the publication of textbooks in Irish (b) the publication of library books and general information books for schools in Irish and (c) the commitments of previous Governments on an Irish encyclopaedia.</P>
      <P>On the textbook question, there are various private companies publishing textbooks in Irish and there is An Gum which is the Government agency for publications in Irish.  There is a serious problem with regard to the private companies because of the Minister's failure to raise the grants to the private companies to keep in touch with the increase in the cost of living, to counteract the effects of inflation.  This inflation affects the publishers, who have to pay higher wages in accordance with the various national wage agreements, and a very important factor in this industry of publishing is the cost of paper which in one year alone increased by 102 per cent.  We must remember that the market for books in Irish is a small one and taking this into consideration and the high inflation rate of recent years, it is essential for the Minister and his Department to realise that the private companies will no longer be able to publish if realistic grants are not available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality of books is an important matter in this regard.  There is a company&mdash;in fact there is more than one company&mdash;engaged in this work and producing work of a very high standard indeed.  The old black and white textbook is no longer foisted on all our children.  We have a company providing two, three and four different colour books.  In many instances these books are very attractive indeed and cry out by their very attractiveness and by the efficiency with which they are put together for realistic assistance from the Department of Education, and nobody can <Col N="1665" /> say that at the moment the financial assistance is realistic.  There should be a review at least once a year, in the economic circumstances prevailing, so that the aid will be an encouragement to the companies to keep publishing Irish books.</P>
    <P>Irish artists are employed also in the decoration of books, and again there are artistic, social and economic considerations as well as educational ones in this.  You may remember the Scandinavian Report&mdash;in fact I see it is referred to by Ciaran Kennedy, the director of the ESRI, in an article in the Central Bank Report for this quarter&mdash;by the Scandinavian Art and Design Inquiry team we had here a long number of years ago, who recommended that the designs that are best in Irish designing are native designs. If we have had any strength in the arts in the past&mdash;and we were weak in many aspects of the arts&mdash;we did have strength in book illustration, and the Minister's realistic paying of grants will help to develop a strong book illustration team in this country.</P>
    <P>As well as the textbooks, library books in Irish are very important, ones giving general information, books on the environment and so on. I understand that many thousands of pounds worth of books in this category were imported for use in our Irish primary schools following the establishment of the new curriculum for these schools.  If the Minister does not want whatever is being done in this area to die he should go to these people, not wait to be asked, even despite the straitened economic circumstances which he urges so often as a reason for not spending money, and say: &ldquo;This is something I want to encourage.  I am prepared to review grants.  I am prepared to help, but above all I am prepared to allow you to plan ahead&rdquo;&mdash;because you cannot just switch on and switch off this industry as the Minister wishes or wills.  It is important to realise that if work is suspended now&mdash;and work will be suspended if realistic grants are not paid&mdash;it will have an effect in 25 years' time rather than next year, so there is no excuse for breaking the sequence.</P>
    <P>I had a letter from the Minister in <Col N="1666" /> August outlining the grants for 1975, among them £20,000 for Irish reading material.  These grants, which were additional to the library grants the payment of which was suspended this year, are for the purchase of additional readers in Irish and of library books in Irish.  Even that small amount is £9,000 less than was given for nine months last year: £20,000 for 12 months this year, £20,000 for nine months last year.  The general library grant of £165,500 was dropped.  All this carries very serious implications for the publishing of Irish books.  The book I have here is of the kind I am referring to.</P>
    <P>The third point is the commitment of the previous Government in relation to an encyclopaedia.  This was to be a 16-volume work with about 150 pages in each volume.  The previous Government gave a general sanction for the work.  Again, this involved a very high standard of illustration and of encyclopaedic articles of interest that were short and to the point.  The art work was superb.  There was no dullness about it.  Indeed, the Minister and his administration have said that one of the chief aims with regard to the Irish language would be to make it attractive. If the Minister wishes to avoid the charge of being a hypocrite he must realise that this is the kind of work he should be helping in order to promote the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I am not holding a brief for any company but I am talking about companies in general who are engaged in this work when I say that they may not be engaged in it for very long if they are left in the lurch by the Minister. I understand that the company concerned had already spent £83,000 on this work, employing editors and artists and developing a team and writers.  Everything was going well until January, 1975 when the Department shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider his moral obligation in this regard, a moral obligation flowing from a general consent by the last Government to this work and to the subsidisation of it.  I ask him also to consider his obligation to the Irish language&mdash; a serious obligation&mdash;and not to fail <Col N="1667" /> in this by discouraging this work.  I think the Minister will agree that the work is well worthwhile.  There is nothing cheap or shoddy about it so I ask him to deliver the goods in regard to it.  It is the kind of work that would promote the reading and the use of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>There is much complaining about the cost of books.  If the Minister subsidises, a certain pressure in this regard will be removed but that is not the angle I am going on.  If he does not subsidise I am afraid that publication will cease altogether and that would be a very serious consequence.  There is no reason why there should not be a free scheme for the medium and that the books be purchased for the people who need them.  As a nation we behave in a niggardly way regarding the purchase of books.  We do not spend enough on reading matter.  While we spend £200 million per year on drink we spend only about £3 million on books and that includes all text books.</P>
    <P>In addition to text books there are being used extensively in our schools monthly magazines, four or five of which are in Irish and three of which are in a mixture of Irish and English. These are attractively produced.  The subject matter is attractive, too but the Minister must make a realistic assessment of what it costs to produce these books and he must decide if they are worthwhile, if they are doing a good job in the schools.  He is aware of the pressure on the schools from the various publishing companies which have huge markets and which, consequently, are in a position to produce books and to spend heavily on their production.  Editors and translators must be employed and sustained for all these ventures.  If a team is built up but must then be disbanded, it would be impossible to reorganise it.  There is no point in saying that in times of an economic recession, this is the first area which must get the knock.</P>
    <P>If we subsidise these works we are investing for the future.  There is no excuse for anybody saying that we must give the money first to social welfare.  I maintain that the highest investment in social welfare is investment <Col N="1668" /> in education because this helps social mobility.  The highest form of that investment should be in what is our own language which we consider to be i mbaol i láthair na huaire.</P>

Cén fáth gur éirigh sé as?  An raibh eagarthóirí i measc na ndaoine a d'fhostaigh an tAire?  Cén tuarastal a bhí fógraithe aige nuair a bhí sé ag lorg na ndaoine sin?  Cén tuarastal atá acu i láthair na huaire, na daoine atá aige?  An bhfuil sé sáthach árd chun na daoine cearta, na daoine leis na cáilíochtaí a bhailiú chuig an obair seo?  An bhfuil an tuarastal seo ceangailte le tuarastal gráid ar bith san Státseirbhís?  Má tá, an bhfuil sé sin ag cur isteach ar an obair, ar an iarracht atá an tAire agus an Roinn ag déanamh chun na daoine seo a fháil?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate arises from the question put to me by Deputy Wilson in relation to the Government's policy concerning the publication of textbooks in Irish and the publication of library books and general information books for schools in Irish.  The Deputy also inquired about the commitments of previous Governments on an Irish encyclopaedia.</P>
      <P>I explained in my reply to the question that my Department are involved in the publication of textbooks on two levels.  They provide a back-up service for private publishers through the provision of standardised terminology, editorial service and grants towards the cost of printing, publishing, editing and translating or writing textbooks, and the Department also publish their own textbooks. It is in this broader context that the matter of the publication of an Irish encyclopaedia also arises for consideration and I feel, therefore, that I should first give a summary of the measures taken in the last two years in relation to the general matter of publications in Irish.</P>
      <P>The first matter is that of staffing. One of my first actions on becoming Minister was to announce a major development and expansion scheme for the provision of fully trained editorial staff in sufficient numbers in the publication branch of my Department. To date, four competitions have been held by the Civil Service Commission and a further competition will be announced this day week.  Five new assistant editors have been appointed to date.  It is hoped that this imminent competition will yield better results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department published nine textbooks in the past two years.  Only <Col N="1670" /> three were published in the previous two years.  More important, though, 22 textbooks are now in the course of preparation and will be coming out at intervals between now and the end of next year.  Private publishers publish textbooks with the aid of grants from my Department.  Fifty-three texts were published since the inception of the scheme in 1968.  I hope the rate will improve greatly as a result of the recent generous increase in the grants scheme, 25 per cent in printing grants and 33? per cent in editorial and other grants as well as the increase of 10 per cent as from 1st January 1974.</P>
    <P>Additional assistance is given to private publishers in other ways.  The terminology committee provide terminology where it is not already available to the publishers.  Editorial advice given includes the examining of samples of translations and day-to-day advice as it is required.  Advice is given on which books are suitable for translation or whether proposed original books will be suitable.  In regard to library books, the grants scheme operated by my Department does not cover assistance to private publishers who wish to publish general reading matter in Irish intended as library material for children.  Financial assistance for such publishing may be obtained under the grants scheme operated by Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge which comes within the functions of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  One publisher, however, is publishing what is called the Irish Environmental Library Series and the first of these books has been accepted by my Department for inclusion as an additional textbook in environmental studies in the list of books approved for use in national schools and it has been regarded as eligible under my Department's grants scheme for translation into Irish.  Two more such books have recently been examined and will be similarly approved by my Department.</P>
    <P>An interesting development that has also been undertaken is the publication by my Department of fullcolour children's books in Irish.  Four such books have been published <Col N="1671" /> within the past year and two more will be published by the end of this month.  These form part of a general programme which envisages the publication of at least ten such books per annum.  They have been very well received by both reviewers and booksellers. My Department are continuing to publish works of general literature in Irish and also music.</P>
    <P>The question of the encyclopaedia was raised by Deputy Wilson.  I should like to say, first of all, that he seems to have moved from his statement in regard to the commitments of previous Governments in regard to this project to one announced by him this evening as a general sanction&mdash;whatever that may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said a moral commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a moral obligation following from a general consent.  May I outline the facts?  In November, 1971, a publisher submitted proposals to the Department for the production of an encyclopaedia in Irish for the 10-15 age group.  The encyclopaedia was to appear in 16 volumes at the rate of two volumes per year from 1974 onwards. Financial help of two kinds was sought from the Department: first, that the Department would purchase 6,000 copies of each volume at a price of £3 per copy for distribution free of charge to primary and postprimary schools and, secondly, that a special subsidy scheme would be devised somewhat akin to the scheme in operation under which the publication of Irish reading material is aided.  No State money was to be payable until the first volume was published and expenditure was to be phased over the eight-year period 1974-1982.  The total cost of the project at that stage, November, 1971, was estimated at £329,000.  This estimate was subsequently revised on a number of occasions.  In February, 1972 it was £425,000; in December, 1973 it was £628,000 and, I understand that a current estimate would be £1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions on the project took place between officials of my Department <Col N="1672" /> and the publisher.  The Department were in favour in principle of the production of such an encyclopaedia but at no stage did the Department have authority to place a contract for its production.  The company were not accordingly authorised in writing to proceed with the work nor was any formal contract drawn up. Nevertheless, the company appear to have gone ahead with extensive preparatory work and in January, 1975, my Department found it necessary to write to the company pointing out that there was no financial allocation in the Department's Votes for this project and that no further commitments should be made in relation to the production of the proposed encyclopaedia.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson quoted a figure of £83,000 as representing expenditure incurred by the company on this project to date.  The publisher has been the principal beneficiary for many years from the grants scheme for the assistance of publishers in producing textbooks in Irish.  The information available to my Department is that well over half of this figure relates to the notional concept of opportunity costs and does not represent actual expenditure incurred by the company on this project.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson also took no account of the fact that much of the material collected in connection with this project was also used in other ways, for example, in the production of a series of individual Irish readers.  The growth in cost of this project since it was first mooted must necessarily cause the position to be re-examined and as I indicated in reply to Deputy Wilson's question yesterday, it is not possible to enter into any firm commitment of financial assistance from the Department at this stage.  Moreover, this particular project and the expenditure upon it must be considered in the context of what is being done in relation to textbooks and other reading materials in Irish and the most desirable distribution of the available funds as between the various activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to Questions Nos. 268 and 269 which it is proposed to take together is as follows.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping are required, under established Government policy, to maintain a strategic reserve fleet of about 150,000 tons deadweight for the purpose of meeting essential shipping needs in a national emergency.  The company are authorised to acquire and operate tonnage in excess of this figure, but only so far as this can be done on the basis of profitable operation. Apart from the strategic requirements, the company is anxious to extend, if possible, the opportunities for skilled employment for Irish men and women aboard its vessels.  At present 500 people are employed in the company's ships.</P>
      <P>It is part of the company's method of achieving profitable operation to continually replace older and less economic vessels with new vessels and, as I told the Deputy in reply to a question on 30th July last, the company had submitted proposals for the replacement of some of their older ships.</P>
      <P>In formulating their proposals the company found that vessels of a specification drawn up by them could be constructed in Japan at a particularly favourable fixed price.</P>
      <P>If the company had not been able to negotiate the very keen price and acceptable financing arrangements available in Japan they could not have contemplated placing an order for new ships at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cost of the ships is approximately 40 per cent below European or world prices.  The prices are fixed and are not subject to the kind of escalation clause on which shipbuilders throughout <Col N="1559" /> the world insist nowadays to offset the effects of future inflation.  By the terms negotiated, Irish Shipping will be enabled to finance the purchase of the ships from its own resources. Extended credit over a period of seven years will be made available to the company for the purchase.</P>
    <P>After examining the proposal and following consultation with the Minister for Finance, I conveyed my approval to the placing of an order with the Japanese shipyard and the order has been placed.</P>
    <P>In arriving at what was a particularly difficult decision, particularly in the context of maintaining employment at Verolme, I took into account the fact that if Irish Shipping place orders for ships at rates which are uneconomic in comparison with those at which their competitors can order, then they will have difficulty in chartcring the vessels on viable terms.  The result must be loss of business, with consequent reduction in employment on the company's vessels.</P>
    <P>With regard to the possibility of redundancies at Verolme Cork Dockyard, I am, of course, deeply concerned to ensure that all practicable steps are taken to avert such an eventuality.  In this connection negotiations are, I believe, in progress about the ordering of a fishery protection vessel for the Naval Service.  They are hopeful of getting a fair share of the work arising from the Marathon platforms in the Kinsale Gas Field.</P>
    <P>So far as concerns my own Department, the B &amp; I Company have made tentative plans for the acquisition of another car ferry but no firm proposals have yet been made to my Department.  The placing of an order for such a vessel would be subject to my approval and would have to be considered in the light of the financial situation of the company.</P>
    <P>I would certainly hope that the vessel could be built at the Cork Dockyard.</P>
