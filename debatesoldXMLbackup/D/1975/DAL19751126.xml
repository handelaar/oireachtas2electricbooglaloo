      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will have a better system adopted for early appointments at clinics in the Clare area of the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the question relates to those clinics which are operated as part of the community care programme.  The provision of these services in the area referred to is a matter for the Mid-Western Health Board.  They have indicated that they have experienced difficulties in recent months due to personnel problems resulting from vacancies and absence due to illness. Steps taken by the board to resolve these problems are at an advanced stage and when they are completed the position should be much improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>This reply is exactly similar to one given six or eight months ago.  I am sure the Minister is aware that the situation has disimproved.  In the matter of dental treatment, no anaesthetist whatsoever is available.  However, that is not relative to the making of appointments.  For eye clinic appointments there is a waiting period of 12 months and the period is longer in such chronic surgical cases as hernia. One patient told me he was awaiting an operation for one-and-a-half years and he asked me if I could possibly arrange to have his operation carried out in this land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy and all the people in that area that I share their anxiety.  However, it is only fair to say with regard to ophthalmic clinics, to which the Deputy referred specifically, that the <Col N="169" /> major problem is the illness of the doctor who did most of the work. The health board are about to advertise.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a general practitioner in the Ballyconnell area is a matter for the North Eastern Health Board.  They have informed me that a post was advertised and following a subsequent interview a candidate was recommended. The health board were in the process of appointing this doctor but he informed them in a letter dated 20th October that he did not wish to take up the appointment.  The board have now readvertised the post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the doctor in his letter give the reasons why he was not able to take up the position, seeing he had entered into competition for the appointment in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that I should say the vacancy was advertised and only one doctor replied.  He was interviewed on 18th June and the board recommended him for the post. He had service as a general practitioner. Arrangements were made for his medical examination on 31st July but he did not attend.  He was asked on a number of occasions subsequently to undergo a medical examination but he did not do so.  On 16th October he indicated that he had decided not to accept the appointment. The board wrote to him immediately in an effort to persuade him but he replied by letter of 20th October, which was received only on 28th October, that he had decided not to accept the post.  The health board decided to readvertise for a <Col N="170" /> doctor and it appeared on the Sunday papers of 2nd November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the action he proposes to take as a consequence of the 1974 annual report of the National Drugs Advisory Board which commented unfavourably on extravagant claims for the efficacy of medicines advertised to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will note that the Report of the National Drugs Advisory Board for the year 1974 to which he refers, as well as commenting on the position in regard to advertising, goes on to indicate that the board, at the request of the Minister for Health, are pursuing their considerations of this problem with a view to furnishing recommendations to him.  I understand that discussions with the interests involved are continuing.  The board will in due course report to me on the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in the light of the proposed EEC directives concerning materials and objects designed to come in contact with food, which have been formulated by the Commission, he will, as an interim measure, make regulations with regard to the use of cadmium <Col N="171" /> which is often used in enamelware to give colour and which can, in certain circumstances, be poisonous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the possible dangers to health from the intake of cadmium from enamelled tableware and food sources has been under consideration both by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Food Advisory Committee.</P>
      <P>As a result of information obtained from them, I am satisfied that there is no general public health problem involved but I am keeping the matter under review in the light of EEC and other developments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of children attending national schools situated in the proposed Dublin, Finglas, constituency; and the number of whole-time dentists allocated to attend to their dental requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Dental services for national school pupils in the proposed Dublin, Finglas, constituency are the responsibility of the Eastern Health Board.  There are 11,980 children attending national schools in the area. Dental services are made available for these children by four whole-time dental officers of the Eastern Health Board at three health centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that that represents half the number which has been suggested as the ideal number?  A ratio of 1,000-1,500 per dental officer has been recommended but the Parliamentary Secretary has told us that there are only four such officers for 12,000 children.  Will he accept that the scheme is only half adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I accepted that the scheme was not as good as I should like it to be and I repeat that now.  However, when one takes the average for the country, the Finglas area is not doing too badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that the World Health Organisation have recommended <Col N="172" /> that children should get priority with regard to dental treatment irrespective of where they live?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary accept that in their endeavours to provide this service the Eastern Health Board have been thwarted by the Department in so far as the Department have refused to provide for the additional officers who would be required?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what has happened, the position at the moment is that only half a service is being provided.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that there is a good case for his getting some of the money which his Minister has in order to provide this vital service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare why a person (name supplied) has been refused unemployment assistance since 12th February, 1975 despite his appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned had his qualification certificate, possession of which is a necessary requirement for entitlement to unemployment assistance, revoked by decision of a deciding officer with effect from 12th February, 1975.  The deciding officer held that he had not furnished full particulars of his means and consequently had failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to assistance.  He appealed against this decision and in connection with his appeal, he was afforded further opportunities on a number of occasions to furnish the required information.  He <Col N="173" /> did not do so however and by decision of an appeals officer given on 21st October, 1975 the deciding officer's decision was upheld.  The applicant has been notified of the appeals officer's decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not accept that here we are dealing with an unemployed man who has seven children under 16 years who are dependent on him?  This unemployed man has no other source of income.  An older son of the applicant took conacre and the conacre and the stock on the land is being attributed to the applicant by officials of the Department.  This is completely incorrect and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would get this message across to his officials or the deciding officer or appeals officer who may be dealing with this matter.  I realise the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us that there is no appeal against a decision by a deciding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has indicated in the last part of his question, the Minister has no jurisdiction over a deciding officer or an appeals officer.  The facts that are available to me are that this man refused to disclose facts or to co-operate in trying to establish a full account of his means.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that, in the circumstances, it would not be possible for an appeals officer or a deciding officer to make a decision in his favour.  If the necessary information and co-operation were forthcoming it might be possible that this man would qualify.  I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the applicant in this case conveyed to the pension officer what he told me, namely, that he had no property or income.  The situation is that the social welfare officer, or whoever is responsible, decided that he had property.  What more can an applicant do other than to state the facts?  In this case the Department do not believe him.</P>

The information available to me is that he was given a number of opportunities to do so but he still refused.</P>

(b) The amount of benefit paid to employers from the fund during the years 1972, 1973 and 1974 was £284,000, £302,000 and £507,000 respectively.

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that insured workers who have returned from Britain cannot claim unemployment benefit although they are in full credit as regards British social insurance; if the authority for the regulation making it mandatory for these people to have at least one Irish insurance stamp on their return before they can qualify for insurance benefit is in accord with EEC regulations on reciprocity of social insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  In accordance with EEC regulations an insured worker with the necessary record of British insurance who has become unemployed in Britain and who has been entitled to unemployment benefit there for at least four weeks, can, on returning to this country, continue to receive benefit for up to three months provided he registers for employment here and satisfies the usual conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An unemployed person who has not registered for employment in Britain and who has no record of insurance here or whose record of insurance here is insufficient in itself to give <Col N="177" /> title to benefit, must, as provided by EEC regulations, first obtain insurable employment here, which involves payment of at least one contribution, to enable his Irish and British records to be combined for the purpose of establishing entitlement to benefit, unless he falls into one of the special categories of seasonal workers, frontier workers and international transport workers who are exempted from this minimal requirement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if it is a fact that all workers returning from England who have been employed in England, who decide to return home and who register for unemployment benefit, having full contributions in Britain, are not entitled to benefit until they have a minimum of one insurance stamp?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this always been in force or is it only since the introduction of the EEC regulations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I think it is in force under a reciprocal arrangement which was made and was in operation before our entry into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It never operated here before.  Anyone who came home with full insurance contributions in Britain could establish his right to unemployment benefit in this country, without having at least one stamp.  All it necessitated was the giving of the British insurance number to the employment exchange who would then establish his right to unemployment benefit and make payment after a few weeks, without having the one stamp.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking if this has been in operation only since the introduction of the EEC regulations.  It did not exist before and I have absolute proof of this.  Is it an EEC regulation which has worsened the conditions of workers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is covered by regulations under the EEC regulations, but I could not tell the Deputy whether it was embodied in the previous regulations and reciprocal arrangements which were in existence for a number of years before our entry into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In a situation like that, will the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the EEC regulations are making life a little more difficult for Irish workers returning from Britain?  Can anything be done to alter or modify these regulations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Here is a situation which has arisen only since the introduction of the EEC regulations which is certainly making the situation of Irish workers a lot more difficult.  There are many thousands who have come back and this gives them no hope of ever getting employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In such a situation, would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that there is a need to provide them with unemployment benefit which is rightfully due, they having so many contributions in Britain?  They would be in full benefit in Britain, had they stayed there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people with 20 years' contributions in Britain come home and they cannot claim benefit because they must be employed for at least one week here.  That never existed <Col N="179" /> before and I am asking if anything can be done in relation to that very serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <P>As the Deputy should know, statistical information is supplied to Deputies from the office of the Taoiseach.  The position as far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned is that due to the way the Department was neglected during the previous Administration, no statistics or very few statistics, could be compiled, no research could be engaged in and only quite recently have we managed to get a sufficient allocation from nil to £20,000 to devote to some research in areas which directly affect recipients of social welfare.  We now have Fianna Fáil Deputies who were responsible for this situation being created in the first place looking for details for which they did not provide machinery or the wherewithal so that these could be available to the Department.</P>

He was not entitled to benefit as, according to the records of my Department, he had no contributions in the 1974 contribution year which governs his claim.  As he stated that he had worked in Northern Ireland, his insurance record for 1974 was sought from the Northern Ireland Ministry. This record was furnished on 21st August, 1975 but was insufficient to qualify the claimant for benefit.  The claimant was so informed and he then indicated that he had had a second insurance card for part of the year 1974 which he had surrendered to a local office in Northern Ireland in August, 1975.  On investigation, this was confirmed by the Northern authorities and as a result, the claimant qualified for benefit, payment of which was issued to him on 29th October, 1975.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the position overall of insured persons has been worsened since the entry into effect of the EEC regulations dealing with social security for migrant workers on 1st April, 1973.  Before that date this country had reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom on matters relating to social insurance but with no other State.  Since 1st April, 1973, however, the regulations of the EEC dealing with social insurance for migrant workers have been applicable to all the member States and in consequence an insured worker can now have his working career in any of the member States of the EEC taken into account for benefit purposes.  This could not have been done before 1st April, 1973 and the present position is, therefore, a very clear and positive advance in this respect.  Difficulties can, of course, arise in individual cases.  In particular the determination of pension claims can take longer under the more complex EEC rules and if the Deputy has any case of undue delay in mind I will be glad to look into it on receiving particulars from him.</P>

      <P>If an insured worker came home from Britain having had up to 20 years contributions paid there, then registered for unemployment benefit here because he could not get employment, and he could not receive unemployment benefit, would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that his situation was made worse since this new regulation was introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, if a person in the position the Deputy describes, with 20 years British coverage, registers and draws unemployment benefit for a period of four weeks in Britain, he can then automatically qualify for benefit here.  In <Col N="190" /> the absence of that qualification, it is necessary that one contribution at least be made here before the two, British and Irish, contributions can be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>In view of what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, would he advise the British Ministry of Health and Social Security that Irish workers who have been rendered unemployed in Britain and who do not register for unemployment there but who, instead, come home are disqualified from receiving such benefit? Would it not be advisable for the Parliamentary Secretary to inform the British Ministry of Health and Social Security that workers in England should be informed of that fact because they are not so informed?  They can only join the ranks of the 107,000 unemployed here but without benefit. In a situation like that, would it not be advisable that Britain should tell these workers that they must register in Britain?</P>

      <P>This is a very serious matter for the country.  Since the EEC are dictating terms to us here, at least we are governed by the regulations, and we are told the Community is regarded as one country now, should not a person automatically qualify in any one of the other member countries without any restriction?

Many drawbacks that a small number of people only saw at that time have only now been confirmed.

      <P>As I explained in the original reply, the overall effect of this arrangement, that broadens out among the other eight member States of the EEC, is to the advantage of workers returning here from countries other than Great Britain.  Such workers would have been unable to get any credit for benefits they might have accumulated in other countries, members of the Nine.  The situation now is that such benefits can be, and are, taken into consideration.  Therefore, viewing the matter in its broader terms, it is to such workers' advantage that this arrangement is in operation.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, I have expressed my dissatisfaction with the amount of material included in the social action programme that deals with people outside the immediate work force and matters that can affect such people.

It is not my fault that I was left with totally inadequate resources as far as the Naval Service is involved.  At the same time, as far as our resources can go these waters are being well patrolled.

      <P>Use as appropriate is made not only of helicopters but of fixed-wing aircraft for this purpose but the Deputy is fully aware that the <Col N="196" /> legal position at present does not allow arrest on the basis of observation and identification.  You have to have hot pursuit which means that you have the vessel which is offending in sight at all times and having arrested the vessel you must then bring it to port before you have a prosecution.  Maritime law is not my responsibility.  It is my responsibility to give maximum protection to Irish fishermen within my resources and within maritime law which this country did not make.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>It is not proposed to provide for the payment of allowances to the widows of special allowance holders.  As I indicated when concluding the debate on the Supplementary Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions on the 5th November, 1975, there is a basic difference between military service pensions and special allowances and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to provide for allowances along the lines indicated by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is a means test which means that a special allowance is given by virtue of the fact that the recipient has no means other than the old age pension?  In deference to men who gave their services when they were needed would the Minister not now consider the matter, particularly having regard to the fact that the fund is building up, if my information is correct?  There is no extra cost to the Exchequer because there is a fund there and the money is transferred <Col N="198" /> immediately and would the Minister not now consider that these widows who are left worse off because of their husbands demise are entitled to some form of assistance by way of allowance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mistaken. The Deputy asked me if I was aware, as of course I am, that there is a means test as far as special allowances are concerned.  The position is not as the Deputy says it is.  There is no such fund.  If one were to grant the minimum military service pension to all the widows of special allowance holders, the cost to the Exchequer is estimated at £546,000 for a full year and the cost of granting them half the deceased husband allowances would be £465,000 a year.  As the Deputy will understand, military service pensions are like any other pensions, such as civil service pensions and so on, issued in respect of service given and the policy has been to give widows a portion of their deceased husbands' pensions. When the holder of a special allowance dies, the widow may even be better off because the special allowance holder will not, unfortunately, at that stage require sustenance and she is in no worse position than any other widow.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to imagine how this Bill can be made to work in any practical way.  In my opinion it is a theoretical legalistic approach to the problem of bringing violence in the North of Ireland to an end.  Attempts to operate it can only damage our institutions and possibly bring humiliation upon us.  To resolve this problem we, in Fianna Fáil, in a recent statement recommended that a court for the whole island be set up with proper guarantees for the rights of all the people.  This can be the first step in the process of bringing about acceptable order and restoring peace in the North.</P>
      <P>The first major breach of law in this century occurred in 1912 in north-east Ireland when a minority there prevented the implementation of home rule in Ireland and compelled Britain to give way by inciting a mutiny in the British Army.  This was followed in 1914 by the illegal importation of arms into the North of Ireland by the Protestant Volunteers while British law stood by and thus made Britain a party to illegality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> It was this disregard by Britain for any kind of law in Ireland and the injustice of it towards the nationalist population that drove English liberals, like the late Erskine Childers, senior, to engage in similar activities on behalf of the less-favoured Irish. Illegality began under British law in Ireland and can be seen to have continued in the North under British authority after 1921.  We have seen repetitions of the same kind of illegality erupting in the North, frequently with the connivance of the forces of law and order in pogroms against the minority there in 1922, 1935 and 1969.</P>
    <P>The advent of television exposed the true nature of violence, illegal and institutional, in the North of Ireland. Subsequent events brought about the suspension of Stormont and the negotiations resulting in the Executive experiment in 1974.  Unfortunately, as we are only too well aware, violence had taken root on all sides principally because the original illegality permitted in Ireland under British law was never dealt with and exists yet.  There have been many efforts to bring about a political settlement in the North but all sides on this House have come to appreciate that militant elements on one side or the other can be most effective in preventing agreement as can political intransigence.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have called consistently for an end to violence on all sides so that a political settlement can be worked out in an atmosphere of peace.  Our record in this respect is both good and consistent but good political efforts have, as in the past, been frustrated and brought to naught.  However, positive political endeavour must be pursued despite the setbacks of recent years.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale Agreement, of which this Bill is an unfinished leftover, was a good effort towards creating stable and acceptable political institutions in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, though, at Sunningdale it was not found possible to reach agreement on security and policing.  That problem was sidetracked <Col N="238" /> into a commission in the way that difficult political problems often are.  The commission reported in 1974 after extreme loyalists had brought down the Northern Executive.  The destruction of the Sunningdale effort after only eight months was another example of British failure to be seen to support the rule of law.  In this case illegal action by extremists defined Britain and succeeded.  As a result, moderate politicians, both nationalist and unionist, who had had the courage to compromise and attempt a worthwhile experiment were let down by Britain and many of them, especially on the unionist side, have since left public life.</P>
    <P>If the Northern Executive had been able to continue its role and if the findings of the Law Commission had been the subject of evaluation by the parties involved directly, I believe that their judgment would have ensured the emergence of a realistic understanding of the basic problem of security and policing.  In the event neither the views of the representatives of the minority in the North nor of Fianna Fáil here were sought.  Consequently, we have before us now what we regard as an impractical Bill which is taking up the time of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>It is inappropriate to try to deal with the problem of violence and security by way of a Bill of this kind, a Bill that cannot be effective.  Also, it would be wrong to ask the security institutions of our sovreign State to engage in a legal involvement of this kind.  I say this because of the unstable, politically unacceptable position that exists in the North.  I consider the Bill to be even more undesirable in a situation where political elements there are refusing to come to terms with one another.</P>
    <P>The Government are asking the Dáil to involve our Garda and Defence Forces with British forces which this State is at the moment charging before the International Court on Human Rights.  The Government are asking this at a time when the British have admitted that some of their military personnel are being investigated for, allegedly, planting <Col N="239" /> evidence on arrested persons in the North.  I submit that such involvement on our part would bring our institutions into disrepute.  We have put forward an alternative solution to this problem which, if it were accepted and put into operation, should help to bring to an end violence in Northern Ireland.  I appreciate fully some of the arguments that have been put in relation to this question but as I understand the position we are the sovereign authority for the Twenty-six Counties and Britain is the sovereign authority, as recognised internationally, for the area of the United Kingdom.  Therefore, it is within the power and the competence of the British Government to enact any legislation they wish relative to the area of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  It is almost wholly in the North of Ireland that the violence is taking place.  While I would support any practical and, of course, constitutional means to help to bring violence to an end, I would submit that so far as the Republic is concerned the means for dealing with illegal elements and subversives, as contained in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, go further than any democratic conmunity has gone in this regard, certainly than any I know that is as democratic as our State is.  I might add that the measures contained in that Act go further than anything that has been adopted in Britain.</P>
    <P>The seeds of violence arise from the undemocratic situation that was created in Northern Ireland and they continue to thrive there.  I believe that one of the solutions is to convince intransigent politicians that they must sit down together with their fellow elected representatives and agree to create acceptable institutions.  I also believe that this can be done without the surrender by anyone on any side of aspirations or traditions.  I believe that there is an obligation on people, politically elected, to represent the Six County area of Northern Ireland, to provide structures that can be, in reason, supported by all elements of the population that live in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="240" /> Before the adjournment of this debate last Thursday I said&mdash;I would like to repeat it now&mdash;that the first section of the statement made by my party on Northern Ireland totally rejected the use of force as a means of achieving unity.  All of us know that until there is an end to violence there can be little hope of achieving reconciliation on this island.  I totally repudiate the violent deeds that are being committed in the name of Ireland.  Those who have committed these acts have no mandate.  I believe that those who support and encourage them have equal responsibility with the participants.  There can be no benefit to Ireland from such brutal and inhuman actions causing similar and even more inhuman actions such as we have seen in recent years.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat something I said before the Adjournment last week, that the statement on the northern situation issued by my party recently has been the subject of misrepresentation and hasty judgment. When Deputy Harte spoke last Thursday he said that Fianna Fáil had called on Britain to withdraw from Northern Ireland.  He also said that Fianna Fáil had called for a declaration of intent by Britain to withdraw. If the Deputy was referring to the statement issued by Fianna Fáil, that statement did not call for British withdrawal nor did it call for a declaration of intent.  The word &ldquo;intent&rdquo; was not used in our statement.  In my opinion, having experience of a very deep and personal nature, going back over the past eight or nine years, of the Northern situation and going back much further than that to my childhood, when I was in Belfast during a pogrom in that city, and certainly in the light of my assessment of what can make people react, there can be in certain circumstances connotations of threat in the word &ldquo;intent&rdquo;, whereas the word &ldquo;commitment&rdquo; used in the document issued by my party can be seen by reasonable people as an undertaking or a promise to fulfil a moral obligation.</P>
    <P>I believe our recent statement can be seen to be consistent with a statement by Mr. de Valera in this House in 1949.  I should like to quote from <Col N="241" /> Volume 115 of the Official Report of the 10th May, 1949, column 813.  The debate was on Protest Against Partition. Mr. de Valera, in the course of his speech, said:</P>
    <P>If this thing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>meaning partition</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;is to be ended peacefully it should be ended by British action to start with.  Britain has done this thing and Britain ought to undo it. They have the power to do it.  If they really want to, they can tell this minority in our country, that is not a fifth of the population of this country and not a fiftieth of the population of Britain, &ldquo;We are not going to support you in your claim for privilege.  We are not going to permit the small minority of the two peoples to continue to set the two peoples by the ears and to stir up and continue the old antagonisms between them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. de Valera went on later in his speech to say:</P>
    <P>I tried in my time to secure from a British Prime Minister speaking for the British Government and the British people a declaration to the effect that they wanted this Partition of our country to end: that they desired it to end: that they would use all their good offices to bring it to an end, and they would use their influence to bring it to an end.  If they were sincere a declaration of that sort would not be too much to expect.  We have never got that.</P>
    <P>So far, I have heard very few people except within Fianna Fáil discussing our statement in context and on its merits.  Coalition spokesmen should study the statement carefully and in an unbiased way before they contribute to the debate on this Bill.  If not, I fear they may run the risk of becoming politically irrelevant.  They should seek better advice than they appear to be getting from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  What has happened in the past few weeks in regard to our statement is that some politicians have been so blinded by their prejudices that they are prepared to use any means to discredit Fianna <Col N="242" /> Fáil.  It is prejudice of this kind which perhaps blinds Coalition politicians to the realities of Irish politics.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could not get to the Press quickly enough to say that our statement put Fianna Fáil in line with the Provisional IRA.  I read in a newspaper that statement the day after our statement was issued, and in the Dáil last Thursday the Minister said that Deputy Lynch's recent statement, according to Mr. Gerry Fitt, had placed Fianna Fáil in the Provisional camp.  The Minister conceded that Mr. Fitt's reaction might have been too emotional.  How right the Minister was.  Even the best of us can lose our heads at times.  When the Minister spoke on Thursday he quoted from the transcript of a radio interview I had with Radio Éireann.  The Minister seemed to think that there was something inconsistent about what I had said and what now appears in our statement.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have any experience of being interviewed know that it is the practice of radio interviewers to put difficult questions to the interviewee and, of course, it is the duty of any person being interviewed to behave with prudence and not to allow himself to be trapped into saying something he ought not to say, especially if it happens to relate to anything like the tension-filled atmosphere of the North of Ireland.  On that occasion, as the Minister quoted, I was asked if I favoured a British statement of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland.  Apart from the obvious fact that off the cuff, out of context statements can do damage, the date of that interview was 9th September last.  As I am sure anyone who reflects will recall, during the previous three days there had been very crucial meetings between paramilitary groups and the Loyalist Convention parties in the North of Ireland. The possible, though only faintly possible, success of the Convention was at stake.  An irresponsible or foolish remark could have done harm in the emotion-filled atmosphere of that time.</P>
    <P>In addition, some months before, I had advised, and if my recollection <Col N="243" /> is correct I had stated publicly, that the Convention parties should be left to themselves to see if they could come to agreement.  I had also recommended the end of October as the best time to issue an up-dated statement of Fianna Fáil's attitude towards the Northern situation.</P>
    <P>We all know, goodness knows we have had to learn the hard way, that foolish talk engaged in here and outside this House in different parts of the country can do damage.  I have side on a number of occasions that it is very easy to talk if you are far from the North, perhaps to talk at the expense of some unfortunate person's life.  On the other hand, a time comes when a serious obligation rests on people, particularly those elected. Many of us in the past few years have done everything we could and have talked to as many people as were willing to talk to us in order to try to calm the situation in the North of Ireland and bring people to agreement, have made efforts, not entirely because we here may happen to speak frequently of an ideal, but because of common humanity, because of the injustice to people on both sides of the Northern divide, those who do not want to be engaged in and dragged into conflict, who do not want to lose their lives, as lives are being lost there&mdash;it is because of that situation that at times it is necessary to speak in the hope that someone will listen and in the hope that those listening will believe one is trying to be responsible and trying to fulfil a serious obligation.  When the attitudes in the Convention were clear and before the issue was sent to the British Parliament, we believed that the Opposition here should make known their attitude and views quite clearly; sometimes the Government are not free to talk.</P>
    <P>The drafting of our statement commenced much earlier than people think and on the occasion of the interview on 9th September last I was not prepared to allow the interview to lead me into premature statements regarding the attitude of Fianna Fáil towards the Northern situation.  To <Col N="244" /> me the Fianna Fáil document is a clearly thought-out statement, consistent with the aims and ideals of our party.  It represents a general consensus of the thinking of the front bench and of our parliamentary party. A good deal of time was given to discussing it and, while there was healthy discussion, there was no basic or fundamental disagreement on our statement.  There was complete agreement on the need for clarification of our attitude, particularly in the light of the serious disagreement emerging from the Convention&mdash;because that disagreement I believe&mdash;and most of my colleagues share this belief&mdash;can have very serious consequences not alone for the minority and the majority in the Six Counties but also for ourselves and for the people of Britain.</P>
    <P>There was agreement in our front bench that Britain, with whom the final decision rests because she has the authority with regard to the North of Ireland&mdash;whether we like it or not &mdash;should be left under no illusion regarding our attitude towards the Northern problem.  I do not wish to take up too much time in the House over a statement issued by us but sometimes one finds oneself in a situation where it is necessary to clear up confusion.  There was some difficulty due to a by-election in Mayo.  The timing of our statement related to the Convention and was intended to be issued at that time.  If I remember correctly, that tentative decision was taken long before a vacancy arose in the constituency of West Mayo. However, the by-election made it difficult to communicate in advance, which one likes to do, and in this case the final draft was not passed until the afternoon on which the statement was made public.  Perhaps because of those circumstances, some of those who spoke too hastily on radio or to the Press may be excused.  Others tried to make as much mischief and confusion as possible for political motives.</P>
    <P>My party leader has referred to efforts to compare this party&mdash; which represents almost the entire Opposition here at the present time&mdash;as <Col N="245" /> being, as some foolish people have suggested, on the side of or in line with the so-called Provisional IRA. Deputy Lynch has said that this should be treated with the contempt it deserves.  I have lived in Ireland for a long time and I know the foolish things people can believe.</P>
    <P>To me it is inconceivable that anybody would attempt, as has been done in the past few weeks by some elements in the community, to equate this party with any of the militant elements who are preventing political agreement and progress, not alone in the Six Counties but throughout the land.  It is those violent elements, who believe they have the right to be a law unto themselves, who are blocking the progress of this nation, that is of all the people of Ireland.  Whatever may be the political fortunes of the various political parties, for the sake of the people who live in the whole of Ireland, I hope at least those who are involved in constitutional politics in the Twenty-six Counties will refrain from mischief-making which could have very serious consequences for other people who live in the North, because if people began to believe that a huge constitutional party like the present Opposition party had anything to do with the sort of thing that is going on, not only in Northern Ireland but in Britain, the consequences could be serious.</P>
    <P>I have said that we believe there would be an obligation on us to make things clear in relation to the situation in the North in the light of the experience since August, 1969, to go back reasonably far.  So far as we in Fianna Fáil are concerned, the position as we see it now is as follows: during this present year, tremendous efforts to reach political agreement have been made by the hard-pressed representatives of the minority within the Six Counties; intransigence and fear&mdash;unwarranted fear but fear nevertheless&mdash; amongst the majority in Northern Ireland have frustrated the best efforts of those elected politicians who were trying to reach agreement.  Now we see what amounts to total intransigence emerging from what is described as the loyalist or UUUC side of the Northern Convention.  The issue is now going <Col N="246" /> from the Convention parties to the Westminster Parliament and it is at that point that we have felt obliged to make our attitude towards the Northern problem clear, to all British political parties, to the British Government and to British politicians who are elected on the island of Britain.  If continuing intransigence means that there can be no hope of a political settlement between Northern political elements, then we have the right and the obligation, I believe, to bring the original infringement of democratic rights in Ireland into open debate, not in order to frighten anybody but in order to make some effort to break this log-jam which is preventing the sanity of political agreement.</P>
    <P>The problem of Northern Ireland itself stems from the original wrong to which Britain was and is a party. In that sense, it is obvious where the solution lies, and I am not talking about sudden withdrawals or any of the kind of things that people try to frighten people with.  The reason an open debate on this question is necessary and can be useful at this point is that things have changed since 1921.  In 1914 and subsequently, I believe that it suited British interests, and probably her strategic position, to be a party to the unnatural and undemocratic division of Ireland which gave permanent electoral power to Unionists in the north-east.  I have said before and I have made no secret of my views, even in talking to Northerners of all points of view, that it is a fallacy to talk about majority right and democratic right in a situation in which the original majority was created by drawing a border around the Six Counties, instead of nine, ten, 12 or 15, and I have said on occasions to some of these people that if they had had the sense of discipline and the common sense to have treated the national minority which is part of the national majority within the Six Counties in the same way as they themselves would have liked to have been treated in a united Ireland, if such a thing existed, the Northern problem would have ceased to have been a problem long ago.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that sort of action <Col N="247" /> was not taken and we still have the problem to which speakers on both sides of the House referred, of unreasonable fear and suspicion.  We still have the situation in which there is a vested interest virtually, a political vested interest, amongst Northern Unionists and Loyalist politicians to persuade their following that there is a threat of some kind from what they call the South.  All of us know that no elected representative of this part of Ireland supports violence or is prepared to support violence.  Yet one finds oneself from time to time in the situation in which it can take literally hours on end to persuade somebody that things are as they are here and not as they believe them to be.</P>
    <P>However, I am speaking mainly of the change that has taken place since 1921.  I believe that today in the mid-seventies it no longer suits Britain to bear responsibility for the Partition of Ireland.  On the contrary, her immediate and long-term interests would be much better served by encouraging an end to division.  We believe that if Britain does that it will help people who are in entrenched positions in the Six Counties, particularly heavily populated loyalist areas and the politicians representing people in those areas, to take a fresh and more normal look at the situation in what, after all, is for them and for us a native land.</P>
    <P>At this point I believe we are right to make our attitude clear, not in any forceful way but in the normal, political democratic way.  If we were to deny our own aims and aspirations which are peaceful ones because elements that have no right to engage in physical force are doing so we would be guilty of cowardice.  We must try to get Britain to make it clear to northern politicians that she no longer needs to have people in the northern part of Ireland claiming that part of Ireland for Britain.  We are trying to look a little ahead and get some intelligent political thinking and planning going and get into a dialogue, if possible, with politicians, elected personnel of the Unionist tradition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="248" /> One can talk indefinitely and make condemnations of violence.  It does not seem to make much difference: perhaps some of us are listened to. From experience we have seen that violence begets violence and if people take the right to kill into their own hands they are automatically causing other deaths because each action leads to a reaction.  We have seen inhumanity and barbarism.  All I can say to these people is: you cannot support inhuman action and then hope to be human again next week, or next year.</P>
    <P>Of the Bill itself I would say that attempting to patch up the rule of British law in Northern Ireland without a <i>quid pro quo</i> which would put the problem where it has always belonged, namely, in the context of the whole island of Ireland, will not only fail for the same reasons that Stormont failed but I believe it will further confuse the political process necessary to reconciliation. I think it would thus aggravate the festering wound of political instability that exists in the North.  This Bill may in the long run risk increasing terrorism possibly including a spill over into the South because of its unworkability and its failure to come to terms with the need for a realistic, legal solution for the whole of this island.</P>
    <P>The Leader of our party has put forward an alternative.  I think that alternative should be explored if only in the light of the fact that this Opposition Party has said that it genuinely believes that this Bill is not the way to go about the job.  The alternative should be considered by the Government despite the fact that the suggestion has come from the Opposition side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Attorney General (Mr. Costello) Declan Costello">

      <P>Only a very small part of the remarks made so far in this debate by the spokesmen for the Opposition have dealt with the allegation that the Bill now being considered is unconstitutional; the criticisms of the Leader of the Opposition take up only two columns of the Dáil Debates; the Opposition spokesman on Justice did not refer to the subject at all.  The failure to adduce any detailed reasons to support the allegation of unconstitutionality means that a reply to <Col N="249" /> this part of the Opposition's case against the Bill need not take up too much of the time of this House.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the Bill now before the House infringes Article 3 of the Constitution is based, as I understand it, on the following argument. It is pointed out that Article 3 provides that the laws enacted by the Oireachtas are to have the like area and extent as the laws of Saorstát Éireann; that the laws of Saorstát Éireann only extended to the Twenty-six Counties, that the Bill we are now considering extends, as appears from its Long Title the criminal law of the State to acts done in Northern Ireland; that clearly, therefore, this Bill contravenes the provisions of Article 3 of the Constitution.  It is important to understand precisely what this contention is.  It is not that the Oireachtas has power generally to legislate with extra-territorial effect but has no such power in relation to Northern Ireland.  It is not that the Oireachtas has power to legislate with extra-territorial effect in respect of its nationals abroad, but has no such power in respect of aliens.  It is, quite simply, a contention that the article precludes the Oireachtas from enacting legislation which would make certain acts done outside the State offences under our domestic law.  It is an assertion that the Oireachtas has no power to legislate with extra-territorial effect.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that the Bill now before the House infringes Article 3 is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of a common-place principle of international law; on an argument which ignores the effect of the last five words of the section (which expressly refer to power of the Oireachtas to legislate with extra-territorial effect); on a misreading of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every sovereign independent State has power to legislate with extra-territorial effect.  International law makes a distinction between the jurisdiction which a State has to enforce its laws within its own territory, and the jurisdiction which a State has to prescribe that certain acts done abroad are contrary to its domestic <Col N="250" /> law.  Two quotations from recognised authorities will explain the distinction. The first is from O'Connell &ldquo;International Law&rdquo;, second edition, page 602:</P>
    <P>A State has jurisdiction primarily, though not exclusively, in a territorial sense, but it also has a jurisdiction over persons which is not restricted territorially.  In most, though not all instances, this personal jurisdiction is founded on the fact that the subjects of it are nationals of the acting State. Though they may be physically within the territorial jurisdiction they may not only be subjected to the laws of the national sovereign but also proceeded against with respect to their breach.  Should they be at the relevant time physically within the territorial jurisdiction of another State they may be subjected to the laws of their national sovereign, but the latter has no jurisdiction to enforce those laws. When speaking of jurisdiction, then, one must be careful to distinguish the jurisdiction to enforce from the jurisdiction to prescribe. The former is inherently territorial, the latter inherently personal. Whereas a State may not act within the territory of another State it is by no means true that it may not catch persons within that territory in the net of its legislation.</P>
    <P>The second is from Schwarzen-berger &ldquo;International Law&rdquo;, Third Edition, page 185:</P>
    <P>Failing permissive rules of international customary or treaty law to the contrary, a State may not exercise its jurisdiction either outside its territory or in the territory of another State....  Inside their own territory, however, States are free to act as they please unless international law sets limits to their freedom of action.  This even implies that the legislation of a State or judgments of its courts may extend to persons, acts or property outside the State's own jurisdiction. So long as the actual exercise of jurisdiction in concrete instances takes place within the territory of <Col N="251" /> the State concerned such activities are lawful.  In the formulation chosen by the World Court in the Lotus Case (1927) international law does not prohibit a State from exercising jurisdiction in its own territory in respect of any case which relates to acts which have taken place abroad.</P>
    <P>By this legislation the Oireachtas will not be enforcing its laws outside the State's territory; it will be prescribing that certain acts done outside its territory are contrary to its domestic laws; and persons who infringe the law which the Oireachtas will enact will be proceeded against if they are within the jurisdiction of the State.  What the Oireachtas will do in this piece of legislation has been done on several occasions in the past.  Section 3 of the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962 provides that if any person, whatever his nationality, commits whether in the State or outside the State a grave breach of certain articles of the Geneva Conventions scheduled to the Acts he shall be guilty of an offence, and when the offence is committed outside the State he may be proceeded against in any place within the State. Section 38 of the Extradition Act, 1965, provides that where an Irish citizen does an act outside the State which constitutes an offence for which he would be liable to extradition but for the fact that he is a citizen he shall be guilty of a like offence and be liable on conviction to the like punishment as if the act had been done within the State.</P>
    <P>Section II of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1973, makes it an offence, subject to certain qualifications which need not be referred to now, for a person on board an aircraft in flight anywhere to seize it by force and imposes a punishment of life imprisonment. What is now claimed is that the Oireachtas has not the power to do what it did on previous occasions. What is now suggested is that not only is the present Bill unconstitutional, but previous legislation by which the Oireachtas legislated with extra-territorial effect was unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>The argument is, as I have said, based on a misunderstanding of the <Col N="252" /> right which all sovereign States have to legislate with extra-territorial effect. It is also based on a reading of Article 3 which ignores the last five words of the article.  Opposition spokesmen have quoted in the course of their remarks only portion of the article.  The article provides that the laws enacted by the Oireachtas &ldquo;shall have the like area and extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann&rdquo; and it goes on to add &ldquo;and the like extra-territorial effect&rdquo;.  Thus the article explicitly provides that the laws which the Oireachtas will enact are to have the same extra-territorial effect as that enjoyed by the laws of Saorstát Éireann.</P>
    <P>No one has suggested that Saorstát Éireann had not power to legislate with extra-territorial effect.  Its right to do so was beyond question. If it had, then this article specifically provides that the Oireachtas established by the 1937 Constitution had the same power.  Only by ignoring the last five words and by pretending that they do not exist can it be suggested that this Bill contravenes Article 3. This article was, in fact, defining the territorial limit of the State by reference to the area of jurisdiction of its laws.  It is clear that the last five words of the article were inserted to avoid the very suggestion that is now being made and by the explicit reference put beyond doubt the power of the Oireachtas to legislate with extra-territorial effect.</P>
    <P>An examination of the Bill establishes quite clearly that no attempt is being made to enforce the laws of the State outside its jurisdiction.  Section 2 will make it an offence for a person to do in Northern Ireland an act which if done in the State would constitute one of the offences specified in the Schedule and such person can be proceeded against in respect of such offence only in the State.  Section 4 will make it an offence for an Irish citizen anywhere outside the State unlawfully and maliciously to cause an explosion as specified in the section. Again, the offender can only be proceeded against in the courts of this country for an offence under this section.  This Bill, therefore, when enacted will permit the exercise by the State of its jurisdiction to try <Col N="253" /> persons who have infringed our law by committing acts outside the State's jurisdiction forbidden by it.</P>
    <P>The implications of the Opposition's interpretation of the article are startling, and help to establish its invalidity. If the Oireachtas established under the 1937 Constitution had no power to legislate with extra-territorial effect, then the powers of the present Oireachtas are more restricted than those enjoyed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State.  It is inconceivable that this was the intention of the framers of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If the power to legislate with extra-territorial effect does not exist, not only is the legislation to which I have referred unconstitutional, but also the government of the day had acted wrongly in authorising the signing and ratification of the conventions referred to in those statutes, as the Oireachtas had no power to carry into effect the international obligations undertaken in them to take jurisdiction to try offenders for certain breaches of the conventions committed outside the jurisdiction of the State.  Nor is the State competent to enter into future international Conventions which would impose an obligation on this State to try persons who breach the convention outside the territory of this State. Furthermore, the interpretation now urged would result in our courts having jurisdiction to try certain offences if committed outside the territory of the State provided the offence was one created by an Act of the British Parliament which is still law by virtue of Article 50 of the Constitution.  This anomalous situation would result because such laws were not enacted by the present Oireachtas, which has no power, according to the argument to legislate with extra-territorial effect but by a Parliament that had such powers. It must be obvious that an interpretation which would produce the results to which I have referred must be an erroneous one.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think Deputies should bear this further fact in mind.  In considering the constitutional objections raised to this Bill it should be remembered that the Bill gives effect to the proposals of the Law Enforcement Commission, which are detailed in <Col N="254" /> chapter 4 of the commission's report. The commission considered a proposal, termed the &ldquo;extra-territorial method&rdquo; by which additional extra-territorial jurisdiction would be conferred upon the courts of each jurisdiction.  This proposal is summarised as follows&mdash; (Paragraph 17):</P>
    <P>Under this method each legislature would confer upon its own domestic courts jurisdiction to try under domestic law certain offences when committed in the other part of Ireland.  These offences will be set out in the Schedule, and the legislation would provide that these offences when committed in one part of Ireland would be offences under the law of the other part.  The domestic court of one jurisdiction would not have any judicial powers in the other.  The only way in which a court would exercise this extra-territorial jurisdiction would be trying a person, arrested within its own territorial jurisdiction, for a scheduled offence committed in the other jurisdiction....</P>
    <P>This method has been adopted in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>In the following paragraph the report outlined procedures which could be followed to give effect to the principle proposed.  In paragraph 32 the members of the commission expressed the opinion that the extra-territorial method could help to solve the problem of bringing to trial those accused of politically motivated crimes of violence and added &ldquo;We are agreed that there are no legal objections to its validity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This House can weigh the views of the distinguished members of the commission as to the legality of their proposals against the arguments of those who challenge the validity of the Bill.  Any reasonable examination of those arguments will leave Deputies in no doubt as to who is right.</P>
    <P>It has, further, been suggested that the Bill infringes Article 38 of the Constitution which permits the establishment of the special courts in the circumstances set out in subsection 3 of the article.  It is, apparently, claimed that the special courts established under this article could have no jurisdiction <Col N="255" /> to try offences committed outside the territory of the State.  The lack of jurisdiction arises, it is claimed, because special courts can only be established in circumstances which relate to conditions within the State.  Accordingly, such courts cannot try persons for acts which are committed outside the State.  In relation to this argument it should firstly be pointed out that the Bill gives no jurisdiction to a special court to try any offence.  The Bill proposes to create a number of offences but there is no requirement in the Bill that a person charged with any offence under the Bill should be tried before a special court.  The Bill does, of course, provide machinery for taking evidence in Northern Ireland in the event of a trial before a special court, but in no way enables a trial before a special court to take place.</P>
    <P>If it is unconstitutional for a special court to have jurisdiction to try a person in respect of an act committed extra-territorially, such unconstitutionality would not arise from any provisions of the Bill now being considered. A moment's thought will demonstrate that the decision of a Government which would give such jurisdiction would be perfectly valid.</P>
    <P>The steps relating to the establishment of a special court under the provisions of the 1939 Act and the granting of jurisdiction to such a court should be recalled.  Firstly, Part 5 of the Act must be brought into operation by a proclamation of the Government made after the Government are satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order and that it is necessary for this part of the Act to come into force.  Such a proclamation was made on 26th May, 1972.</P>
    <P>When the Act is in force the Government may declare certain offences to be scheduled offences.  It does so when it is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to offences of any particular class.  An order was made scheduling certain offences on 30th <Col N="256" /> May, 1972.  The special court will then have jurisdiction to try such scheduled offences.  If this Bill is enacted, it is quite easy to imagine circumstances in which the Government could quite properly conclude that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in the Republic in relation to the offences contained in this Bill.  Terrorists who carry on their illegal activities throughout the whole island of Ireland are just as likely to intimidate a jury trying here one of their members for an offence committed in Northern Ireland as for an offence committed in the Republic and the inadequacy of the ordinary courts to secure the effective administration of justice and preserve public peace and order here could be shown to exist irrespective of the place where a member of a terrorist organisation commits the wrongful act.  Neither the Bill before the House, therefore, nor any Government order which by declaring all or any of the offences under the Bill to be scheduled offences gives jurisdiction to a special court to try the alleged offender, contravenes Article 38.</P>
    <P>Neither the mover of the motion before the House, the Leader of the Opposition, nor the Opposition spokesman on Justice who followed him adduced any arguments in the course of their remarks to support that part of the motion which claims that the Bill infringes the European Convention on Human Rights.  To ascertain what possible basis there could be to justify that part of the Opposition motion it is necessary to refer to what the Opposition spokesman in the Seanad said.  It would appear that reliance is placed on Article 6 an article which lays down certain minimum rights which a person charged with a criminal offence has.  The rights of a person charged with an offence under this Bill and which are specified in the Convention are fully protected by the Bill and by the laws of the State.</P>
    <P>The Convention provides that an accused has the right to &ldquo;defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing&rdquo; (sub-clause (c) of paragraph (3) of Article 6); and further, that an accused person <Col N="257" /> has the right to &ldquo;examine or have examined witnesses against him&rdquo; (sub-clause (d) of the same sub-clause).  If evidence is taken in Northern Ireland under section II of the Bill the accused has the right to be present whilst this is being done. If he does not avail of this right, counsel and solicitor on his behalf are entitled to be present on his behalf at the taking of the evidence. The accused or his legal advisers, are entitled to cross-examine any witnesses. The suggestion of incompatability between the Bill and the Convention can only be made by those who have not read the two instruments, or by ignoring those parts of the Bill which do not support the allegation which suggests incompatability. The absence of argument to support this part of the Opposition's motion is a tacit and eloquent acknowledgement of its invalidity.</P>
    <P>An argument based on Article 5 of the Convention fails to take into account the nature of bail in this country and the effect of the provisions of the Bill.  This article declares that every arrested person is entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.  If it should happen that a person accused of an offence under this Act is granted bail and if evidence under the machinery of section II is being taken, he can choose to be present when evidence is being taken.  If he decides to be present, he will, in effect, be surrendering to his bail in the ordinary way as when a trial takes place.  If he chooses not to be present, he will remain on bail.  In either event no infringement of the article occurs.</P>
    <P>The degree of consideration that the Opposition has given to the legal aspects of this Bill can be measured by two small but significant aspects of the debate so far.  The Minister's opening speech in this debate referred to portion of the judgment of the Chief Justice in the Haughey case.  The part quoted related to the opinion expressed by the Chief Justice that in a criminal trial evidence must be given orally, but that a statute might authorise otherwise.  The Leader of the Opposition who followed the Minister said at <Col N="258" /> column 1731 of Volume 195 of the Official Report that he had not had an opportunity to check what the Chief Justice had said and that later speakers would have an opportunity of examining the Minister's contention against the report.  The quotation given by the Minister to this House had, in fact, been given also by him in the debates in the Seanad at column 395 of Volume 81 of the Official Report.  It is, I think, a fair comment to say that it does not demonstrate a very great level of research into the legal problems which the Opposition purport to find raised by this Bill if the Leader of the Opposition is taken by surprise by a reference to an important legal authority which had been quoted several months previously in relation to the Bill.  Secondly, I think reference should be made by me to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition took some time off to criticise the drafting of this Bill and to point to what he termed at column 1721 of Volume 185 of the Official Report of the Dáil as a &ldquo;glaring error&rdquo; in section II. That section begins by referring to the trial by a special court established under Article 38.3.1 of the Constitution, and it was claimed that such courts are not established under Article 38 but by the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  The criticism is a minor one but that it has been made is revealing.  The draftsman followed the normal drafting precedents&mdash;a precedent to be found in a later section of Article 38 itself if trouble had been taken to examine the article.  That section employs the very words which are now described as a &ldquo;glaring error&rdquo;. Section 6 of Article 38 provides as follows: &ldquo;The provisions of Articles 34 and 35 of this Constitution shall not apply to any court or tribunal set up under section 3 or section 4 of this Article.&rdquo;  As the Constitution refers to a court set up under section 3 of Article 38, it is hard to justify criticism of the draftsman who in this Bill referred in a similar way to such courts.  If Members wished to see further precedents for the method here adopted they could consult Article 37 of the Constitution or section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1939, or section I of the Imposition of Duties <Col N="259" /> (Confirmation of Orders) Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>Other points made in opposition to this measure have been dealt with by other speakers from this side of the House.  I wish, therefore, briefly to make only a couple of further comments. An all-Ireland court could be a most useful institution.  It is one which it is hoped may in the future be established in this island, just as it is hoped that a Council of Ireland will also be established.  But no evidence has been adduced to show that such an institution can now be established or that, at any time in the past, were the authorities responsible for the administration of justice in Northern Ireland willing to co-operate in its establishment.  In the absence of such an institution the alternative facing the government and now facing this House is to leave the <i>status quo</i> untouched, or to bring in a measure such as is now being considered.  The Government did not wish to allow the present situation to remain uncorrected.  In this connection, it was not dictated to by the British Government; neither is it engaged in pandering to ultra loyalist opinion.  It is simply acting out of a sense of what is just and proper.</P>
    <P>It is said that the provisions of this Bill will, in fact, never be invoked.  I hope this prophecy will turn out to be right, for it will mean either that the IRA will at last have seen, after more than 1,300 deaths and thousands of maimings if not the immorality of the campaign they are waging, at least its futility; or, alternatively, that this Bill will have effectively deterred their members from seeking sanctuary in this part of Ireland, a sanctuary to which they are not entitled either under our Constitution or in international law and which the vast majority of the people of this island believe they should not enjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, if this Bill is not to be invoked, as the Attorney General suggests, would it mean either of the alternatives he presented?  Would it not be something we would all welcome if this were to be the case?  May I suggest to the Attorney General and to the Minister that we have had a precedent in this <Col N="260" /> connection which I doubt they would suggest means either of those happy events to which the Attorney General has just referred in closing?  I refer to the order made by the Minister in relation to the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, when he introduced the order in 1973 on the basis of extreme urgency, the order under which people could be tried here for murder committed in the North of Ireland.  The urgency of the case and the need to deal with the situation was the basis of the Minister's argument. Since that order was introduced to give effect to the provisions of the 1861 Act has there been any proceeding arising out of it?  If there has not, does that mean that murders have not continued to be committed in the North of Ireland and, if that is the case, does that not indicate that the Minister and the Attorney General, who are now presenting this Bill on the same basis of urgency and need as they presented the order under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, are as wrong as we have been saying consistently in their reading as to what this Bill will do and enable them to do as they were almost two years ago?</P>
      <P>If the Minister can tell me when he comes to conclude that, in fact, that order introduced on that basis has been in any way effective, I shall be very glad to be convinced.  The reality is, however, very different, indeed, and it is that unfortunate reality, we believe, is now behind the effectiveness of this Bill as presented to this House.  I do not have to go any further than the Minister's introductory speech.  I quote from column 1680 of the Official Report for Thursday, 20th November, 1975:</P>
      <P>This provision will, by the way, be additional to the provision in the Bill making murder committed in Belfast an offence under our law, irrespective of the nationality of the offender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should it be necessary for the Minister to include such a provision if what was then presented to us as being both urgent and effective has to be incorporated now in this Bill on the same basis.  At least it leaves it <Col N="261" /> open to the suggestion that if that order was so clearly ineffective then the incorporation of a similar provision in a similarly ineffective Bill will do nothing to heal the problem with which all of us are so concerned.</P>
    <P>Might I preface my remarks by saying also that this Bill derives from the Sunningdale Agreement and subsequently from the Law Enforcement Commission Report which was presented a considerable time ago.  The Bill is before the Dáil finally, having been introduced in the Seanad, a move against which we expressed strong views at the time on the basis that this House was the place where a Bill of this importance should be initiated. However, now that it is before us, may I ask the Minister and the Government why they are allowing only two hours for its debate in this week?  Is this an attempt to give an impression that there is an obstructionist filibuster on the part of the Opposition or anybody else who would be represented as delaying the passage of the Bill?  Two hours of a sitting week hardly indicates a great degree of urgency on the part of the Government. This situation calls for some explanation, when other business which, on the Government's argument, cannot rank as important as this, is being processed through the House.  Lest there be any impression that the Opposition are in any way obstructing or filibusting on this Bill, let me say that we have no such intention.  Our opposition to the Bill is based on the clear principles as enunciated in our amendment to it.  I wonder if, next week, the Government will choose merely to allocate a further two hours to discussion of the Bill and to follow the same pattern the week after.  I would remind anyone who might get the impression that the Bill is being delayed, that such delay is due entirely to the Government.</P>
    <P>I shall come now to what are the real issues in this Bill.  The Attorney General has dealt with one subsection of one section of the issue&mdash;the question of constitutionality&mdash;but the real issue is the issue between an all-Ireland court and the proposals before the House.  It is important to reflect on the consideration given by the commission to an all-Ireland court and to ask the <Col N="262" /> Government to explain the reason for presenting the Bill now in the light of what the commission said.  Following the Sunningdale Agreement of December, 1973, the commission reported in April, 1974, and said at paragraph 9, page 12 of their report:</P>
    <P>We deal with this method very briefly, because we are agreed that it is not practicable to deal urgently with the problem by this means.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference presented to the commission was to bring forward an immediate and urgent solution, but because of what followed it might not have been practicable for them to deal urgently with the problem within those terms.  However, had they been informed that they would have had at least six months to consider the question and that their proposals, which would involve a referendum, would involve another six months the situation might have been different.  But they dismissed it only on the basis that it was impracticable in view of the urgency attaching to it.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The method was interpreted by the Commission as involving the creation of a special uniform code of substantive law and legal precedure to deal with politically motivated crimes of violence, the institution of a new and separate court to administer that code, having jurisdiction over the whole island, and the appointment of judges to that court by a procedure to be agreed between the Governments. It was clear to the Commission that the method possessed certain advantages: for example, the court's ability to sit anywhere in the island and its jurisdiction over the whole island....</P>
    <P>This is a provision which this Bill does not contain but I shall deal with this aspect of it later and help to clear up any misunderstandings which the Minister may have in relation to the attendance of witnesses either at an all-Ireland court or at the courts envisaged in this Bill.  The paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>... would solve problems with regard to the attendance of witnesses.</P>
    <P>Apparently, the Minister does not <Col N="263" /> agree with that.  I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>Moreover, full uniformity in the law to be administered has many attractions.</P>
    <P>I suspect that both the Minister and the Attorney General would accept fundamentally that principle.  Then the commission comment on the reasons for dismissing the idea and they say:</P>
    <P>However, the setting up of such a court would require amendment of the Constitution of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have accepted always that such a court would require an amendment of the Constitution.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>This could be brought about only by a referendum, which would be attended by inevitable delays and by uncertainty as to the result.</P>
    <P>In commenting on the inevitable delays they were speaking as jurists.  I would accept their comment in that regard except to say that what they meant by delay has to be considered relatively, because we have had experience of referenda being introduced and passed by way of legislation within from four to six months.  I have no doubt that in relation to a Bill of this kind the same could be done had the Government a degree of urgency, concern and determination.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comment as to the uncertainty of the result of such a referendum, I do not think any Member on any side of the House would have any doubt but that our people, if asked to vote for an amendment of the Constitution which would allow for an all-Ireland court which could deal effectively with this continuing and dreadful problem of violence, would vote overwhelmingly in favour of such a proposal.  The time scale for the commission was a matter of months but a couple of years have passed since then.  They decided that in view of the urgency of the problem further consideration of the proposal was precluded.  If time had been a less important factor the question of an all-Ireland court would have called for more careful and detailed examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> In the event, since time has been a less important factor, where is the detailed and careful examination that the commission of representative jurists and judges from here and the United Kingdom expressed?  What detailed consideration has been given to that alternative by the Government? The Minister was referring to the all-Ireland court when he said at column 1677 of the Official Report of 20th November, 1975:</P>
    <P>Are we then to say that, as we cannot get agreement on what we think the best or the ideal solution, we will do nothing in the meantime to see to it that fugitive offenders are brought to justice and that we will continue to tolerate the present scandalous position?</P>
    <P>I take the Minister as acknowledging in that that the best solution is the all-Ireland court and it is because he says it is not on at the moment that we then have to consider his alternative so that the scandalous position he refers to will not continue.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House are totally united in what this Bill purports to do if, in fact, it could be an instrument to that effect, namely, the eradication of violence and the consequences of violence on this island and particularly in the sorely troubled northern part of this island.  All of us are united in that despite some what I may regard as sad and unworthy imputations from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with regard to views he suggested were held on this side of the House.  One sometimes wonders how somebody such as the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who presents the case for reconciliation and understanding on this island, can do that in the light of the presentation he makes in this House of his determination to create divisions in this part of the island.  I would be the last to judge any other individual but there must be a consistency in human action, human behaviour and human tolerance.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has consistently expressed his views, not least on a television programme last night which to a very considerable extent exposed his attitude for what it may really be: <Col N="265" /> motivated, as far as this element is concerned, rather by opposition, entrenched antagonisms and bitterness, for some reason best known to the Minister, to this party rather than anything else.  Therefore, the question of this side of the House and that side of the House coming together to work closely has certainly been gravely undermined.</P>
    <P>Whatever I raise here is not raised by way of an implication on the Minister in the House, the Attorney General or the vast majority of the Government.  Surely the vitally important thing, before any co-operation can take place, before any common policy may emerge in any areas, is that people can learn to respect and trust each other.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was quoted in <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of last Sunday as saying that one of his primary intentions is to permanently weaken the power of Fianna Fáil.  When the Minister says such a thing how can we, whatever our differences with the Minister or the Government may be at the moment, in honesty and sincerity say we can have any common cause with a man who is so vindictively motivated against us?  I wish it was not so.  I wish the Minister could be a little more objective and a little more tolerant so that the example he sets could be applied to our own behaviour, our own words and our own actions in this House.  If we want to give an impression of sensitivity and concern, let us do so in the knowledge that you cannot say one thing in relation to the North and act in a totally different and inconsistent manner in relation to your fellow Irishmen in the South and expect to be believed and respected.</P>
    <P>I found the Minister's contribution on this Bill frustrating and sad.  Contributions of this nature will set back the kind of co-operation we can undertake together.  As the Leader of this party has said and as has been said from the other side of the House, all of us share in the horror and revulsion at what has happened on this island, North and South, over the last few years but it is not confined to those years.  We would be less than <Col N="266" /> honest and frank if we so confined it. Murder of individuals from whatever background and in whatever office in London, Birmingham, Belfast, Derry or Dublin is still a blot on the common name of humanity that we all share together.  We on this side of the House totally reject, as we have consistently done, anything of that nature done without motivation which is said to be in the interests of reconciling Irish people and above all, which is excused with reference to Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Even the latest spate of killings in the North and in England&mdash;we have had some terrible examples here although not in scale as constant as what has been suffered there&mdash;make it all the more important for us to ensure that we get at the roots of this continuing sore and not just deal with the symptoms, as the inclination has been in the last few months by this Government especially.  Law and order may evoke a certain response from the community but the symptoms only are dealt with.  Law and order ensure that we will not negotiate through the barrel of a gun; we will stamp out the terrorists and so on.  However sadly misguided we may be, whatever the blot on our whole society, North and South, this may be, nonetheless, the situation derives from our society and more particularly from the political history of this country and from the political injustice of Partition.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I abhor the violence. This party has consistently stated this.  It is made all the worse for being backed by authority and institutional Government&mdash;the circumstances of the last 50 years which, if not the sole factor for bringing about that violence, has been in a very real way in the North of Ireland a major contributory factor.  Until we get at the roots of those problems and the problems which have been allowed to exist in the North during all that period and look at the institutions through which that institutionalised violence has been effected, then we will not achieve what all of us want to achieve, the eradication of violence. We will not be able to persuade the wayward and sadly misguided people, who at the moment in many parts of <Col N="267" /> this country are involved in violence, that this, even by their standards is inconsistent with what their fundamental aim would be and that we could be big enough, confident enough and strong enough to bring them back into a society which all of us, North and South, could be proud of.  When I resume on this debate I hope to deal in greater detail with the practical provisions but at this stage I thought I would reiterate what has been said on this side of the House.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;the placing in Japan by Irish Shipping Limited of an order for two large ships and asks the Government to ensure the continued employment of workers in Verolme Dockyard.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I want to put a few questions to the Minister for Transport and Power.  I regret his absence now but I presume he will be here to contribute to the debate.  I want him to state the exact date when this particular order was placed by Irish Shipping with a Japanese yard; to state the contracted delivery date of each of the two vessels; to state the official contract price&mdash;up to now we have had only speculation, and as the money is coming from public funds, <Col N="268" /> this is important&mdash;and to state, in addition, if orders for two further vessels are being considered by Irish Shipping.  When will the order for the fishery protection vessel be placed? Does it have to be only one vessel? Why not six, particularly at a time when we could give employment at Verolme and when our fishermen are screaming for protection off our coasts?  Would he not consider the appointment of an all-party committee of both Houses to act as watchdogs over all the affairs of State companies?</P>
      <P>Being a Corkman, the Minister must surely be aware of the job losses and lack of confidence in Irish Steel Holdings at present and the lack of confidence setting in among the work force in Verolme.  We heard from the Minister for Labour last night a pathetic case, making no effort to justify the placing of these orders abroad at a time of economic stress and high unemployment, and let me emphasise that the present economic climate bears no relation to the booming one that existed in the good days of 1970 when Irish Shipping placed orders in the Upper Clyde and when unemployment was only half what it is today.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary last night tried to justify this.  Why could not our banks be asked to finance the deal with Verolme as was done with B &amp; I, or have our Labour Ministers become afraid to order the banks to provide finance for the protection of jobs for Irish workers?  I repeat our demand for the cancellation of the order and I expect the Labour Party Members to support our motion as they were instructed to do at last weekend's conference. I expect they will observe that instruction just as they appear to be observing the conference decision on the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill.  No formula of words, no playing with words, will forgive them for their betrayal of Irish workers if they do not support the demand for cancelling the present order.  If they do not, they are betraying the Irish worker.  They are plastering over the cracks in the promises they made, which we doubt.</P>

I have with me the unrevised transcript of last night's proceedings in the House, and Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned that it is unrevised.  It is a short quotation. Finally, he said: &ldquo;The Minister should not draw me too far.&rdquo;  I do not know which Minister he was referring to. I will say just this about it: if Deputy Fitzgerald thinks there is any evidence of impropriety, then he owes it to the House to explain it because by and large the levels of propriety in the civil service and State companies is very high and any impropriety should be pursued without pity.  If he has not got any evidence, then, as the Minister for Transport and Power said last night, he is casting a slur not on any individuals but on whole institutions. I hope someone on that side will take that choice before the debate finishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="270" /> The real issue today is based on a balance of interests.  It is necessary to balance the interests of the Verolme workers in the appropriate part of the works where there are 800 employed. I want to emphasise that they are workers with a variety of skills, some of them plumbing, some of them woodworking, some of them in the furnishing and finishing of ships.  It is also necessary to balance the interests of Irish Shipping which are significant employers, though, perhaps, not necessarily large enough, and earners of foreign currency for us with very little import costs except for particular purchasers.  They provide a net gain for our balance of payments.  I will not enter that in detail because it is for the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>The third thing that has to be put into balance is the demand for the use of public money in the interests of the Irish people.  It is inescapable that money used for subsidies in one way is not available for subsidies elsewhere and, therefore, a choice has to be made as to the best way of locating the financial aid you have got to give.</P>
    <P>Let us look at these three interests in order, and if I put them in order, I must put the Verolme workers first. They certainly want security of employment and I do not think there is any division anywhere in the House in regard to our commitment to safeguard that for them.  They also want the full range of shipbuilding skills to be developed in that shipyard.  They also want a shipyard which is viable, not the obligation of viability in the middle of recession but which is viable by ordinary common-sense criteria in the long term.  This is not a place where the Government should be called on to put in money decade after decade.</P>
    <P>I think the 1970 decision was a reasonable one, but had some of that money been put back into Cork it could have structured a growth over the present size of 1,200 workers, with 800 in shipbuilding, but you cannot have very sudden and dramatic expansion in employment in a shipyard without running the risk of much more dramatic and even traumatic contraction in other industry, especially <Col N="271" /> with the way world shipbuilding is at the moment.  It is not just that we want jobs now.  Both sides of the House, and the workers themselves, want security in the future in a shipyard which is viable and competitive.</P>
    <P>They are looking to the time&mdash;and OECD are in the course of setting the close date of 1978&mdash;when subsidies to shipyards in the OECD countries will be outlawed.  That will not come easily but the effort is there and we must build viability for them in circumstances where, at this moment, there are two Community countries giving subsidies to shipyards, namely, the Italians and ourselves.</P>
    <P>That is the interest of Verolme and the interest of Irish Shipping.  We see two countries in Europe that are roughly comparable to ourselves with enormous amounts of revenue and employment and a great increase in their national horizon by the possession of great shipping fleets, namely, the Greeks and the Norwegians. Located as we are, it is absolutely correct for us to have that kind of perspective for Irish Shipping.  It is a high source of employment and revenue and it is available for the soul of an island country to look beyond the boundary of the land and look to the ocean as we have done for millennia, but as we do not do sufficiently now.</P>
    <P>At this moment with 500 people it is a valuable source of income and employment.  Surely we are also committed to its growth and its success? Surely we know that in the world at the moment there is intense competition and that certain freight rates have fallen very steeply?  Surely we know we should have a shipping line that runs according to the general economic criteria of profitability in the world?  Therefore, if other things permit it&mdash;I emphasise that because all of what I am saying is based on two specific assumptions about other orders for Verolme, for Cork, which I will mention later; if those assumptions are not fulfilled my whole argument falls but at this stage I am anticipating those assumptions&mdash;it is desirable that Irish Shipping should have the ships at the lowest possible cost <Col N="272" /> so that they will have the highest possible competitiveness and require the smallest possible amount of public subvention and earn the largest amount of money for the State.  That is desirable from their point of view.</P>
    <P>Let us turn to the Irish people generally.  We have many calls on the available State moneys for rescue in the first place and, secondly, for industrial promotion into jobs that are stable and that will grow in the future.  If we divert £2 million or £4 million or any other amount into a place we do not have to put it, then we cannot put it somewhere else.  For example, if we divert £4 million at £4,000 a job it means that there are 1,000 industrial jobs we do not get.  That is a harsh choice but it is the choice that faces people who have to make decisions about resource allocation.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the three interests, all of which are relevant.  The question that faces people who must make rational economic decisions is how to reconcile those different interests to the maximum advantage.  How do you guarantee you do not build false economics into a shipyard or a shipping line so that they will be a continuous drain in the future?  We need to reconcile interests and to optimise advantage.  Those two things are easy to say but they are damn hard to do.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I take it we would have consensus that bulk carriers are necessary, that we should allow the Irish Shipping fleet to grow beyond the needs or the requirements of strategic considerations into something greater than our national needs, ploughing the oceans of the world, earning revenue, gaining skills and giving employment to Irish people. I take it we would have consensus that if we can get very good value, as we can, without any drain on Irish capital resources and without damaging Verolme, that we should do it.  I take it we would have consensus that we should do it quickly so that we get Irish seamen under Irish skippers employed on these ships earning money.  I take it we are agreed that the better the value <Col N="273" /> the ships are, the more chance they have of earning money and, therefore, freeing revenue for other things. If we can get very cheap ships, which we can, without any call on the State's resources, which can be employing people and making profit very quickly, then if other considerations are met we should do it.</P>
    <P>What are the other considerations? They are that the future of Verolme is not thereby damaged.  What is in those two bulk carriers?  There is about one year's work.  Let us say this about bulk carriers; they are very simple ships.  They are floating tin boxes, usually with bought-in engines, bought-in navigational equipment, radios and so on.  With regard to the parts that push the ship around, communications and so on, there is not much labour by the shipyard involved here because all that material is bought-in.  There is welding and painting and, of course, the more capitalised one is for that the more cheaply it can be done.  If the iron and steel manufacturers are on an immense scale&mdash;as are the Japanese, with huge economies of scale&mdash;one can get the raw material cheaply and process it very cheaply.  Incidentally, it is an illusion to think the Japanese yards are cheap labour yards.  That may have been so in the past but it is not the case now; they are trading on very high productivity and very high capital.</P>
    <P>There is about a year's work in the bulk carriers.  There is little more than a year's work in the car ferry.  The bulk carriers are certain to be loss-making. The car ferry is highly specialised with a great deal of carpentry, plumbing and central heating, and this is where the Japanese advantage of high productivity is minimised. For a car ferry Cork is as good as anyone else but for bulk carriers, great tanks made like sardine boxes, it is not as good as anywhere else. With the facilities they have they must choose between the bulk carriers and the car ferry.  The question for them is, which?</P>
    <P>Nobody is talking about the fishery protection vessel.  Certainly we want one and we can build it in Cork without <Col N="274" /> any question because it is strategic to do so.  I agree that after we have one we should have others, not just for fishing, but, hopefully, it will be for protecting the drilling platforms and rigs on our Continental Shelf. However, the question boils down to the following: would we rather restrict these workers, not to have work for the electricians putting lighting into the cabins, not to have work for the plumbers installing sanitary equipment, not to have work for the carpenters? Do we just want work for the welders, making a damn great tin box, or are we willing to have a diversified shipyard with high skills, without employment and not loss making? That is the choice.</P>

      <P>It is the condition of my colleagues and I supporting the ships going to Japan.  We will stand or fall by the &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;.  If those things are met, I am saying the senior management of Verolme are satisfied to see the bulk carriers going to Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley last night suggested there were no subsidies.  This is not true.  There is a subsidy scheme, although there are tremendous efforts by OECD and the Community to get rid of it.  We operate a subsidy scheme and I am surprised the Deputy did not know that.  In 1974 I set up a shipbuilding advisory team to prepare a report and this resulted in the suggestion that we strengthen Verolme's capacity in regard to ship repairing and other engineering work.  We are at the stage that we have a memorandum for decision as a result of the initiative taken more than a year ago. <Col N="275" /> That is evidence of the recognition of the need to help Verolme, which I affirm.  I affirm absolutely that without the alternative work, the sending of the bulk carriers out of Ireland is completely unacceptable.  If the alternative work is there and if a choice must be made, the best interest of the Verolme workers&mdash;apart from the country generally and apart from Irish Shipping&mdash;is to do the interesting work which is not loss-making and not to be forced to do the dull work which is loss-making.  That is the technical conclusion of the experts there. Deputies on the other side may not like it and may think that this is a lovely opportunity to thump the Government, but if they consider those articles they will see that the sort of emotional stuff I heard Deputy Fitzgerald finish with is inappropriate, and in fact&mdash;I know what the workers of Verolme think as I know what the delegates to my party conference thought on Sunday&mdash;is not corresponding with the real interests of the Verolme workers which are as I have indicated and I sustain this Government's decision and consider it a correct one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrosnan" hpid="Mr. Brosnan Mr. Brosnan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on this sorry affair are already well known.  I have aired them and they have been aired by others on a number of occasions since the night I made the statement in Cobh about ten weeks ago. Incidentally, that statement was denied by Irish Shipping the following day and denied by implication a few days later by the Minister for Transport and Power.  There is no doubt at all that the placing of these orders in Japan in the current economic situation of this country was inexplicable and indefensible, and nothing that has been said or done by the Government or by any of their spokesmen since, and I listened to the Minister for Labour last night and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce this evening, has succeeded in dispelling the doubt, the suspicion, and the mystery surrounding this transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate and spontaneous reaction, of the workers in the Verolme <Col N="276" /> Dockyard and, indeed, of the people of Cork generally and of the whole country was one of shock and shame, of frustration and anger, and this was clearly demonstrated on last Friday night by the size and the mood of the protest march through the city of Cork.  I am sorry the Minister for Labour is not here to hear me assure him that neither I nor anybody on this side of the House either inspired or organised this demonstration in any way.  There were Deputies present from Fianna Fáil and there was also a Deputy present from the Fine Gael Party.  Naturally, of course, there was no Deputy present from the Labour Party, for the very simple and good reason that there is no Labour Deputy in north-east Cork or in the city of Cork, the two constituencies most affected by this shameful transaction. Perhaps that may have something to do with the defence, or the attempted defence, of the two Labour Ministers &mdash;Labour and Industry and Commerce &mdash;of not sending this order down to Cobh where they had no hope, no possibility, of gaining any political advantage for their party.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night, the Minister for Labour tried to imply that he and the Government were justified in placing this order in Japan for the reason that a similar order was placed during the Fianna Fáil regime in 1970. This reasoning is also shared by Sinn Féin and for his information they have now levelled this criticism which he used here last night in the argument he put forward against both the present Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce now saying that decision was a reasonable decision&mdash;these were his words a few moments ago&mdash;in 1970, but the Minister for Transport and Power, as did the Minister for Industry and Commerce, failed to distinguish between the real situation in 1970 and the situation today.  As Deputy Fitzgerald pointed out, the unemployment situation was completely different.  The unemployment figure for the whole country was much less than half the figure it stands at today and none of <Col N="277" /> this unemployment affected Cobh or the Cork city area.  I should say that at this moment the unemployment situation in Cobh is pretty bad.  Perhaps the Minister for Labour did not know that since July, 1974 up to now, over 500 workers have left, have been made redundant or have been dismissed from Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>On that occasion Verolme Dockyard were asked to quote for the ship but as was pointed out last night, their books were full and they could not do so.  There was a deadline for delivery and they could not quote but they were given the opportunity to do so. On this occasion I doubt if they got any opportunity to do so.  They were asked to quote, but I think it was merely a matter of going through the motions and it would appear from what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said&mdash;he let the cat out of the bag&mdash;that he set up an advisory committee last year which apparently went into the pros and cons of this particular kind of shipping and apparently decided there and then, long before Verolme were asked to go through the empty, foolish and stupid motion of quoting for ships which were already decided on&mdash;where they were to be built, the make, shape and size of the ships&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brosnan</NameTxt>
      <P>Time was of the essence in the contract of 1970; it is <Col N="278" /> not of the essence in this contract and the Minister for Transport and Power in a very lengthy reply to questions put down by me and in the many statements he has made on this matter never suggested that time was of any importance and that there was a delivery date.  He said repeatedly, and it was reiterated here by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that the only determining factor in this case was cost.  I do not accept, and I am sure nobody here does, the arguments advanced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I should like him to put these arguments to the experts in Verolme Dockyard and ask them to debate them with him.  It is no use now because the contract is placed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald also wanted to know what was the real deal.  Was it a package deal for four ships, not two?  I should like to know and I am sure the people of Cobh and Deputies would like to know if it was a package deal and what has happened to the option for two more ships.  If these options are now being cancelled, what bearing, if any, has that on the price of the two ships to which we are apparently committed?  The Minister for Transport and Power had the benefit of the Clyde experience.  He was forwarned; he knew what happened then and even if it was a bad deal, that is no reason why it should be repeated by him and this Government. Perhaps it is the antipathy of Fine Gael which has been demonstrated frequently that was responsible.  Deputy O'Malley read an extract from the Official Report last night which showed that any financial assistance over the years to Verolme Dockyard was bitterly opposed.  I am sure the Minister remembers when one of his colleagues who was then a Deputy for Cork City nearly lost his seat over it.  I hope the same does not happen to the Minister on the next occasion. The Minister is a decent man; he is beloved of the people&mdash;at least he was&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is not the antipathy of Fine Gael perhaps it is the indifference of Labour to their workers in Cork City for the reason I have already suggested, that they have no political interest there and never will have.  Perhaps it is the attitude of Irish Shipping who have repeatedly refused to have any serious consultation with Verolme Dockyard about the building of ships.  Of the 12 vessels comprising their present fleet only two were built in Cobh.  Of the B &amp; I fleet of ten vessels only two were built in Verolme Dockyard.  I do not know why this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Placing this contract in Japan may be another link in the chain of events or attempts by the Government to downgrade Cork.  They lost by the Minister for Local Government turning Cork City into a five-seat constituency.  They lost in relation to Fota when the Minister for Finance refused to consider the purchase of these lands for the people of Cork on the basis that this was only a parish pump matter.  The same thing happened or is about to happen with the Minister for Education.

      <P>Now it is Japan rather than Dublin versus Cork.  The then Minister for Transport and Power was alarmed about the situation and he received a deputation in Leinster House in November, 1971 comprised of members of management and workers from the dockyard who debated the matter with officials of the Minister's Department.  An undertaking was given by the Minister that never again would his Department even consider the building of ships for any State or semi-State body without having prior and full consultation and dialogue with the native dockyard.  In pursuance of that undertaking a meeting was held some time afterwards between the Minister and representatives of management and Labour in Cork dockyard.  The Minister also gave an undertaking at that time, which he honoured as far as he was able, to set up some sort of advisory or consultative committee to advise on a naval policy generally.</P>

    <P>He gave that undertaking in the Dáil, as reported in the Official Report of the 20th January, 1972, when it was proposed that all shipping and fishing interests&mdash;An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, B &amp; I, Irish Shipping, the Minister for Defence and any others interested in shipping or marine activities would be represented. Of course, the Verolme Dockyard was also to be represented.  The Minister was never afforded an opportunity of implementing that policy.  It was pointed out that long-term planning and continuity of employment were essential and that the best way that could be achieved was through consultation with all of those interested.  I shall be asking the Minister <Col N="281" /> to consider that matter in the near future, with representation by Verolme (Cork) Dockyard, on this advisory board and also on the boards of Irish Shipping and of B &amp; I.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce mentioned that the cost was a very important factor.  He mentioned also the priority of the 500 employees of Irish Shipping.  I know a fair number of those workers I am sure the Minister knows them also&mdash; and they would much prefer to work and make their living on ships built in Ireland.  If the Minister's argument holds good, how can that be reconciled with the promise made last evening by the Minister for Labour that a ship would be built for the B &amp; I in the immediate future?  If cost/profitability is of that importance surely it should apply equally to the B &amp; I?  If Irish Shipping wants to make a profit, surely the B &amp; I should also.  If the Minister can get a cheaper ship for the B &amp; I on the same arguments advanced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is he again prepared to get it from Japan, the Upper Clyde or somewhere else?  If he is, what is the use of listening&mdash;as we did last evening&mdash;to the Minister for Labour giving this promise of immediate employment in the Verolme (Cork) Dockyard?</P>
    <P>The same promise was made by a member of the Minister's party in Midleton almost two months ago when he said that work would commence on a ship for the B &amp; I and a naval vessel in the immediate future. These orders have not yet been placed.  I have made inquiries as to how long it would take to build a ship, as proposed, for the B &amp; I.  Even with the best will in the world on the part of the Minister, with the co-operation of Irish Shipping and with finance being available, I am convinced work could not commence on that ship within a year and the probability is it would not commence under 18 months.  It has been admitted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, at any rate, that it is likely that, unless orders are placed, there will be redundancies at Verolme at the end of next year.  It is a well-known <Col N="282" /> fact that the naval vessel will give only between ten and 12 weeks' employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald posed a number of questions to the Minister, only some of which I heard.  I want to pose others, the answers to which I submit this House and, indeed, people outside it are entitled to receive.  We all want to know how many ships were contracted for in the first instance.  Was there an option for four ships?  Was there an option for two more ships? Of course, this was the case in the Upper Clyde contract in 1970.  Irish Shipping seem to have a predilection for repeating themselves.  If the option must now be cancelled, what will that cost us?  I should like to know also the exact date on which preliminary discussions commenced in relation to this contract.  We should also like to be given exact figures and to know the names of some of the naval and nautical experts who advised the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could be told also when the Minister for Transport and Power first heard about this contract.  Was he presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> situation? I should like to know when agreement was reached.  I now want distinction of dates between agreement being reached and the exact date of signature of the contract.  Indeed, perhaps, it has not yet been signed. I should like to know the date on which Verolme were asked to quote for the ship and what was their figure as compared with the Japanese one, with the options, if any, and without them if there were none.</P>
    <P>We now call on the Government to cancel these contracts.  I am sure the Minister sought legal advice on the matter.  I should like to know what is the situation if these contracts are cancelled.  Do they carry a penalty clause?  What damage would we be liable to pay?</P>
    <P>I understand that there is some body to be established to look into the affairs of semi-State bodies.  Can the Minister assure the House that this body will be given retrospective power to inquire into the whole of this contract? That is the only way the doubts and suspicions about this matter can be dispelled.</P>

      <P>Just to satisfy Deputy Brosnan on the last point he raised about the sub-committee of this House looking into the affairs of semi-State bodies, that will require legislation and the powers that committee will have will be those determined by this House.  Therefore, he shall have a chance of contributing to that debate when it comes before the House.</P>
      <P>Obviously this is a very vexed and &mdash;for the far side of the House&mdash; very emotive question.  Frankly, I must admit that, for me, it was a very difficult question.  I am not in the least unconscious of the location of the Verolme Dockyard.</P>
      <P>It was very difficult for me to come to the decision I had to.  I think the decision I came to was the correct one.  I made my recommendation to the Government and put the case before them.  They are not unconscious of the Verolme Dockyard and its contribution.  A number of Deputies on both sides of the House and the Minister for Labour referred to what I think is the most important job the dockyard does, namely, in training.  It is very important.  For me, it was a particularly difficult decision but it had to be faced.  I suppose the easiest thing for me would have been never to have heard of the ships from Japan because nobody would have known anything about it and the dockyard would have been looking for the work which we now propose to see that they get and there would not have been this ri-ra and this political hulla-balloo about it.</P>
      <P>We frequently get advice from the other side of the House to take unpopular decisions and, if we take what is on the surface deemed by people who have not examined the case that I intend to put before the House an unpopular decision, they complain about the decision we take.  You cannot have your cake and eat it.  Deputy Fitzgerald spoke last night.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to it.  It is quite serious, this insinuation by Deputy Fitzgerald that there was some kind of a backhand&mdash;&ldquo;bonus&rdquo; was the word, in fact, he used&mdash;in connection with the placing of this order.</P>

There were questions down to me certainly by Deputy Brosnan and Deputy Cronin &mdash;I am not sure about Deputy Fitzgerald&mdash;for answer in this House. Those questions came up for answer on 13th November when I answered questions here for half an hour or 40 minutes relating to my Department. The questions had been postponed by Deputies Fitzgerald and Brosnan who obviously had not the interest to come up from the West Mayo by-election, which was over at that stage, to pursue their questions in the House.  They knew exactly the time and the day on which those questions would come before the House because on the previous <Col N="286" /> Thursday, 6th November, I had answered the first question down to me. Therefore under the system of rotating questions, I would be the first Minister to answer questions in the House on 13th November.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat for an hour-and-a-half without interrupting anybody. I expect the same courtesy. Deputy O'Malley quoted from the Dáil Debates of 1963 when the present Taoiseach referred back a Supplementary Estimate for the dockyard in Cork and said that this was proof that Fine Gael were against the dockyard. If the Deputy looks at the Dáil Debates of 30th October, 1969, that is, some five or six years later&mdash;Volume 241, columns 2309 to 2311&mdash;he will see that on that day Deputy Barry Desmond had a question down to the <Col N="288" /> then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is the present Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, Deputy George Colley, about the Verolme Dockyard, its capital structure and so on.  I asked a supplementary question of the then Minister which was as follows:</P>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been some concern in the public mind because of the name association with the firm on the Continent and this shipbuilding yard?  Would he make a statement pointing out that the Government here are in full control of this yard and have only a tenuous connection with such shipbuilding yards in other parts of Europe?</P>
      <P>The then Minister, Deputy Colley, replied as follows:</P>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy when he says that the connection is tenuous but there is a connection. The yard in Cork is very much more independent of the continental firm than it used to be.  Having regard to the report relating to the situation of the continental firm it is true, as the Deputy says, that some concern was expressed.  However, I am satisfied from my investigations that there need be no apprehension arising out of the reports in relation to the Cork dockyard.</P>
      <P>So, I was not the only one or the Fine Gael Party were not the only ones concerned.  The then Minister for Finance was concerned and events subsequent proved it because the Irish Government had to take equity in the Cork dockyard because of the situation that developed between 1963 and I think it was 1967 or 1968&mdash;I am not sure of the date&mdash;when the dockyard was reformed with 49 per cent Irish participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to these two ships ordered in Japan by Irish Shipping, Irish Shipping is a company set up in the early years of the war to give us the strategic level of tonnage to allow us in times of war to import and export our goods.  At that time it was established that the tonnage should be 135,000 tons, the deadweight necessary for our purposes and anything above that should be operated on a <Col N="289" /> commercial basis by Irish Shipping. They have been extraordinarily successful as a company.  Results over the last number of years have been very, very good.  They hardly trade at all into Irish ports.  They earn 95 per cent of their revenue and make their profits in the Pacific and other parts of the world.  If they want to survive in that area of competition, they must purchase ships at competitive prices. There are 500 people employed in Irish Shipping.  I would like to see them carrying 1,000,000 tons as opposed to the 235,000 tons they carry now.  Obviously, there are financial constraints.  The capital involved in shipbuilding is very large.  It is the kind of capital it is difficult to lay one's hands on.  It is very hard to make a profit on because of high interest rates.  Irish Shipping are extremely competent in the kind of trading in which they are engaged. They have one of the most modern and competitive fleets in the world and it is in the interests of this country that they should be kept in this position.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on Thursday, 30th November, when news broke that Irish Shipping were purchasing two ships in Japan in a leading article, while naturally worried about unemployment in Verolme Dockyard, said:</P>
    <P>Firstly, it must be placed on record that Irish Shipping Ltd. has a splendid overseas record in regard to cargo carriage.</P>
    <P>Later, the article says:</P>
    <P>There is also another intriguing side to the controversy.  Why did the Government give the go-ahead to Irish Shipping?  They were obviously aware of all the nuances of the situation, including the &ldquo;poor politics&rdquo; inherent in such permission. Yet they did go ahead.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances the contracting by Irish Shipping, a group from a comparatively poor country, for two ships from wealthy Japan is a matter for concern, especially in these tough economic times.  The only way that the deal can be justified in the public eye is by a clear-cut <Col N="290" /> and detailed analysis of the contract and the reasons for its signing</P>
    <P>I propose to give those reasons now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two ships involved and the price for each is £5.7 million.  The original negotiations started in July last.  I cannot give the precise date.  The contract was signed on 14th November.  Peculiarly enough, this was after Members were not here to ask questions.  The first ship will be delivered next September and the second some months later. These two ships will be earning revenue for this country and for Irish Shipping 12 months in advance of the time at which they could do that had the contract been given to the dockyard in Cork.  The money to finance the ships is being provided as to 30 per cent by Irish Shipping paid in four 7½ per cent portions on the date of the signing of the contract, the laying of the keel, the launching of the ship and delivery.  The balance of 70 per cent will be lent to the shipyard by a Japanese bank and that loan will be taken over by Irish Shipping when they take delivery of the ships.  The money is at 8¾ per cent and will be repayable over seven years.  There is no escalation clause.  In other words, if materials or wages go up in the meantime before the delivery of the ships the price remains as negotiated last Friday week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a sterling depreciation clause?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The repayment is in Japanese yen so, in effect, there would be a sterling depreciation clause.  The Verolme Dockyard contract was payable as to 70 per cent in Dutch guilders, so depreciation would apply there and, the balance of 30 per cent had an escalation for wages clause and the delivery date was later.  I do not want to seem to knock Verolme Dockyard but, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce said, Verolme cannot compete with Japan in the building of what he described as large sardine tins&mdash;they are really only Meccano sets with an engine knocked <Col N="291" /> in and off they go.  The building of a car ferry in Verolme is far more complicated. More workmanship is involved and more craftsmen are employed in it.</P>
      <P>Last year Irish Shipping earned £8 to £10 million in foreign currency.  In the last three months of 1970 90 per cent of orders for bulk tankers went to Japan.  This is the league in which Irish Shipping are playing.  This is the competition they have to meet and, if they cannot meet it, they must lay up their ships and lay off their crews. That is something one must take into consideration, always with the proviso, of course, of full employment in Cork dockyards.  That proviso is always there.  It would have been far easier for me to say to Irish Shipping: &ldquo;No ships.  Go away.  I do not want to hear from you.&rdquo;  Had I done that, I would not have had to face this debate. When one is a Minister one has to do things that are in the national interest even if one is the recipient of some occasional local flak as a result.</P>
      <P>This was the right decision for Irish Shipping and for the country because the earnings of Irish Shipping play a very important part in balancing our balance of payments.  Last year Irish Shipping earned £2 million in Japan. They are moving into tough times. There is a slump.  There are always peaks and valleys in shipping.  It is cyclical.  This is a slump period and there are more ships than goods to be carried.  Competition is keener.  In these circumstances Irish Shipping must be preserved in a competitive position.  I believe we made the right decision in allowing Irish Shipping to purchase these ships in Japan and remain competitive.</P>

      <P>The Opposition mistake words for action.  The difference between them and us is that we take action while they talk. That is why they are in Opposition and why we are here and will continue to be here.  Regarding the position of Irish Shipping if the contract for the building of these two vessels had gone to the Cork dockyard and it, at the same time, B &amp; I and the Department of Defence were seeking to have their ships built at the Cork dockyard, there would be an overlap of facilities.  I have no doubt as <Col N="293" /> to which choice Cork dockyard would make in that case: they would choose the Department of Defence boat and the B &amp; I Car Ferry because that is where they see the use for their craftsmanship and skill.  They know that it is much better for them to get the contract for the fisheries protection vessel and for the car ferry than to get the contract for the two tankers.</P>
      <P>In referring to what was said by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think there was a genuine misunderstanding on the part of Deputy Brosnan.  The Minister referred to a study which was conducted within his Department on the rationalisation of the yard and said that the principal aim of the resulting plan, for which the IDA are prepared to give a grant of £1.128 million, is to build facilities which will enable Verolme (Cork) Dockyard to increase their activities in the offshore construction industry as well as in ship repairs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald said last night that subsidies had been made available by the previous Government for the building of ships in Cork dockyard.  That is not true.  What the Deputy might have in mind is the restructuring of the capital of Irish Shipping which took place at one time, but that is something different.  The Deputy may have in mind the 25 per cent shipbuilding allowance which was available to Irish owners from 1969 to 1971 when it was withdrawn.  In order to qualify for this 25 per cent of the cost of a vessel, an Irish owner did not have to build ships in Ireland.  Indeed, both B &amp; I and Irish Shipping availed of the concession while the vessels concerned were built outside the country.  The previous Government never gave a subsidy to Irish Shipping to build ships at Cork dockyard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In tabling this motion our purpose was to have this question debated so as to ascertain why Cork dockyard did not get the order for these two vessels.  We were hoping to persuade the Government to rescind the order placed with the Japanese.  It is our opinion, as well as the opinion of most people in the country, that this situation should never have arisen.  I fail to see how anyone could excuse this action on the part of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have heard the three Ministers concerned trying to explain the decision. Last night the Minister for Labour gave assurances to the workers in the Cork dockyard; but in view of the experience we have had in recent times in relation to assurances given by Minister colleagues of his, what credence can these workers give to any such assurance?  To give one example, when there was a takeover by Golden Vale of the milk plant of the Limerick and Clare milk suppliers, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries gave an assurance to the people concerned that there would be no redundancies but that assurance has not been adhered to and the people who visited the Department with me last week got proof of this.  What good are assurances of that kind to the workers in Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce talked to us about security of employment and told us why subsidies were not on.  He told us that a very important factor in regard to the contract was that of the lowest possible cost.  Throughout his entire contribution he continued to repeat <Col N="295" /> the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;.  The only other man in history who got away with so many &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; was Rudyard Kipling.  He said in one of his poems:</P>
    <P>If you should keep your head when all around you are losing theirs...</P>
    <P>One &ldquo;if&rdquo; which the Minister mentioned must be a very ongoing one. This was that, if the order materialises for the protection vessel, everything will be all right.  I recall that during the North-East Cork by-election last year the Minister for Defence gave a press conference at which he said that the order for that vessel was being placed but no such order has been placed yet.  When we consider that there are 107,500 of our people unemployed we should be talking, not in terms of maintaining employment, but of increasing employment.</P>
    <P>There has been mention from both sides of the House of subsidies being one way of ensuring the contract for Cork, but subsidies are not the only way of ensuring that the Cork dockyard could compete for this order. Therefore I intend putting forward another proposal, one which it is not too late to consider.  A simple exercise in financial leadership from the Government or from the Minister for Industry and Commerce or, in other words, a nudge from them, could have assured Cork of the order.</P>
    <P>All that was needed was a prompt from the Government.  They could have got Irish Shipping and one of the big banking groups, the AIB or the Bank of Ireland together and they could have hammered out a very successful financial arrangement.  Under the Japanese arrangement the cost of the vessels is £11.8 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is £11.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is approximately that sum.  I took the figure of £11.8 million and the loan was somewhere around £8 million.  The interest on £8 million at 8¾ per cent per annum is £720,000. The deposit required to bridge the gap to the total cost is £3.8 million which <Col N="296" /> had to be found by Irish Shipping. Interest on that would amount to £450,000 per annum.  You must add to those two figures the annual exchange provision because of the continual fall in sterling.  This is now running at 29.7 per cent which is almost 30 per cent.  A total of 20 per cent of that rise came in the last two years.  It was quite small before that. There must be an annual exchange provision because the money is payable in yen.  Therefore, we must add £830,000.  That brings the total cost to Irish Shipping per annum, without talking of payment of the capital sum, to £2 million per annum.</P>
      <P>There is a precedent for Irish Shipping getting together with the AIB or the Bank of Ireland because the B &amp; I did it with AIB in the past. The total cost at 25 per cent, according to the figures the Minister for Labour gave last night, would be approximately £15.2 million for amortising and all this type of business in financial circles.  There would be a minimum write-off against tax on profits by the bank in question who would be the owners of the vessels. If they put up the £15.2 million, they could remain the owners.  They could have a leasing system with Irish Shipping. They could lease the vessels to Irish Shipping and they would continue to be the owners.  In the year of completion they could write off 15 per cent of that £15.2 million against their tax which would leave a net cost of £7.6 million.  One needs to compare that figure with the £11.8 million which requires a repayment of £2 million from Irish Shipping without any capital repayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There could be a very attractive leasing arrangement made to cover the £7.6 million over ten years when there is £2 million to play with. The present arrangement, so far as we have been informed, compared with what I am now proposing virtually doubles the annual cost to Irish Shipping and the Cork dockyard still get no jobs out of it because they are still in Japan.  In the proposal I have outlined Irish Shipping would still have their vessels, Irish seamen would have their jobs at sea, Irish <Col N="297" /> shipbuilders would have a few years of secure expanding employment and the Irish banks would not be deprived of their profit.  While they were fulfilling a very useful purpose, they would also be making a profit.  We are not out to take their profits away from them if they give the facility which they gave in the past.  Our balance of payments would have benefited from the hard currency earnings from the operation of the vessels, as I admit they will still benefit.</P>
    <P>We now find that Irish Shipping are burdened with foreign borrowing, making good the drop in the pound between it and the yen.  Last Friday Irish shipworkers marched through Cork.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently visited Japan in an effort to woo them in here with industry. We have now seen that anti-Japanese sentiment is building up over this shipping deal.  The Minister came back and told us he had firm orders of £250,000.  Who was this supposed to impress?  One would not get a broken down thoroughbred stallion for that.</P>
    <P>Since the Government came into office in 1973 they have shown an inability to make every possible contribution to the economic and industrial welfare of the country.  They always seem to find the wrong thing to do. On this occasion they have also found the wrong thing to do.  During the course of his contribution the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the Verolme Dockyard could not get the contract for these two bulk carriers, which he described in great detail, as he said it would interfere with their building of the car ferry. I cannot see how they can be competitors for the building of a car ferry against the Japanese if they cannot be competitive for the building of those two vessels.</P>
    <P>We mentioned a subsidy last night and I have put forward figures in relation to how it could be done.  As I said, it would cost Irish Shipping 50 per cent of what it is costing them under the Japanese deal.  When the AIB did a similar deal with the B &amp; I <Col N="298" /> in the past there were special tax provisions for shipping at the time, which were set aside in the budget of last year or the year before by the Minister for Finance.  On that occasion the AIB were able to claim 140 per cent write-off under the terms of the special tax provision for shipping. Even without that, the cost of the ships could be reduced by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is no reason whatever for not rescinding the order which we were told tonight was signed on the 14th November.  The Government and the Minister for Transport and Power had the power to place the order.  They also have the power to rescind it and to secure the employment of the 1,200 workers in Cork.  They have told us how important it is to expand this dockyard.  This is a way they could expand employment and cut down the staggering figure of 107,500 unemployed which we now have.  The Government have let this opportunity pass by like many other opportunities.  The Government have repeatedly used financing from non-sterling resources despite the clear proof that the continuing devaluation of sterling creates increasing difficulty with the cost of interest payments and eventual capital repayment.  During the past weekend we heard talk about the massive budget deficit of nearly £300 million. This is an occasion where they could at least right certain things which are wrong in the country.  They could have placed the order at 50 per cent of the cost if the order was placed with Verolme if they had gone about it in the proper way by involving one of our two major finance institutions. They failed to do that.  Not only could they have maintained employment but we would not now have the spectacle of workers marching through Cork.  On the other hand, the shipyard would have been expanded.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the shipyard should and would be expanded &ldquo;if&rdquo;,&mdash;&ldquo;if&rdquo; all the time. We ask the Minister to rescind the order and to do something worthwhile for the Verolme workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Report dated the 31st July, 1975, of the Tribunal appointed on the 4th July, 1975, pursuant to Resolution passed on the 3rd July, 1975, by Dáil Éireann and on the 4th July, 1975, by Seanad Éireann, be referred for consideration to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and for report thereon to the House.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that on 2nd July last Deputies Robert Molloy and Brendan Crinion alleged that the Minister for Local Government had a business connection with a County Meath builder named Robert Farrelly, otherwise James Farrell, and made three specific allegations about ways in which this connection operated. Similar allegations had been made in this House as long ago as the 12th December, 1974, and notwithstanding emphatic denials by the Minister, both Deputies Molloy and Crinion confirmed the allegations on 2nd July, 1975, after the Minister had made personal explanation to Dáil Éireann denying any association with the builder in question.</P>
      <P>You will recollect, a Cheann Comhairle, that in the circumstances the Minister asked you to refer the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  You did so but the Committee reported that it was unable to investigate the matter because Deputies Molloy and Crinion refused to make any statements before the Committee.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, on the 3rd July, 1975, a motion moved by me to set up a Tribunal of Inquiry was passed by Dáil Éireann and on the following day by Seanad Éireann.  You will also recall that, on the 4th July, Deputies Molloy and Crinion made personal explanations, in this House, in which they withdrew unreservedly the allegations made by them concerning the Minister and the builder in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> The report of the Tribunal of Inquiry was made on 31st July last and is now before us in print.  I would like to record my appreciation of the expeditious manner in which the members of the tribunal conducted their investigation.</P>
    <P>Under Standing Order 73 of this House the Committee on Procedure and Privileges are charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with the function of considering and reporting, when requested to do so, as to the privileges attaching to Members. Accordingly, I am of the view that because of the implications of this matter the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be asked to consider the report of the tribunal and to report thereon to this House.</P>
    <P>I now move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the purpose of this party to oppose the Taoiseach's motion but I feel I should make some observations on it and to raise the question as to its purpose.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about the allegations having been made by Deputies Molloy and Crinion.  On 3rd July in this House, as is stated in paragraph 13 of the report of the tribunal appointed by the Taoiseach, Deputy Molloy said he was satisfied that the allegations made to him by two men on whose information he had relied were incorrect.  In the circumstances he withdrew unreservedly the allegations made concerning the Minister and Mr. James Farrell and he wished to apologise to both men for any distress caused resulting from his statements in the Dáil.  Deputy Crinion endorsed what Deputy Molloy had said. He withdrew unreservedly the allegations he had made in Dáil Éireann about the Minister and Mr. James Farrell.  He wished to apologise publicly to both of them for any distress caused to them resulting from his statements in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of that we were rather surprised that the Taoiseach persisted in going to the Seanad with the motion requiring approval to set up the tribunal.  It is difficult to understand why the matter must now be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in the light of the <Col N="303" /> total withdrawal of the allegations in this House by the Deputies concerned and the manner in which they publicly apologised for any distress caused to the Minister and to Mr. Farrell. I think it was a manly withdrawal and a manly apology and it is difficult to appreciate and understand why this matter is being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall, as I already mentioned, that the time-scale of this was that on 2nd July last, the Deputies made the allegation. The allegation was denied and on 3rd July, the next day, I moved a motion.  On the following day, after the motion was moved, the Deputies withdrew the allegation.  Prior to that when the matter was before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, they refused to give any evidence.  I think if the Leader of the Opposition or any Deputy is in any doubt, he will see that the sequence of events was quite remarkable.  On the 2nd the allegation was made and the Minister denied it; on the 3rd the Dáil passed a motion to set up the tribunal and on the 4th, after the allegation had got considerable publicity, Deputies Molloy and Crinion said that their informants were not able to substantiate the claim they had made.  Surely it is obvious&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Deputies who have spoken from both sides laid particular emphasis on the pollution of the environment and the Minister said that an inter-departmental committee had been set up to investigate what should be done and to co-ordinate the work of the various Departments involved&mdash;Industry and Commerce, Local Government and Transport and Power.  On the day we were discussing this, we saw a report in one of the daily papers to the effect that 61 lakes and rivers were polluted and reference was made in the article to the public apathy in the matter. Mr. Morrow, general manager of the Inland Fisheries Trust, said that what was really needed to cope with pollution was a serious commitment and action by the Government and the public authorities to lead the public out of their apathy and to bring a halt to the unlawful dumping of waste.  I would appeal to the Minister to see to it that there will be no delay in the production and implementation of the committee's findings.  The situation is particularly serious this year especially with the drop in water levels which is more pronounced than it was during years when we had wet seasons.  When we learn that 61 lakes and rivers are polluted, it is a very serious matter and it should be attended to without delay.</P>
      <P>Comments were also made regarding the bringing to the attention especially of schoolgoers the matter of pollution and if there were a programme in the schools in relation to pinpointing the dangers to our environment of pollution generally, it would be a commendable step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I wish to refer to is the dispute between Aer Lingus and the travel agents with regard to package tours.  This situation is very much to be regretted and it is in the interests of the tourist industry, on which both these sections are dependent, that it be brought to a speedy and amicable conclusion.  I ask the Minister to use his good offices to encourage <Col N="305" /> an early settlement of this dispute.  I think negotiations are going on.  Both benefit from each other in this case and I am sure would like to see a quick ending to it.  Another matter is the withdrawal of Aer Lingus from the transatlantic service. One is disturbed on many counts when one reads that Aer Lingus are considering withdrawing from the Atlantic routes.  It was a long, tough battle to get those routes established and they carried a good deal of prestige. It would be a backward step if Aer Lingus were to drop out of the Atlantic trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I also want to mention the disappointment at the efforts of our largest towns in the Tidy Towns competition which did not even warrant a prize being awarded in the large town section.  We realise that large towns have particular problems but the results were disappointing in that no prize was awarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section says that the money should be spent on capital projects.  Deputy Leonard mentioned the serious position regarding lake pollution.  There is a very serious problem in that regard in my own constituency and there is an opportunity for capital expenditure in order to cope with it.  I know a principle has been established that the polluter pays. In the area of one of the most popular trout lakes in the midlands, Lake Sheelin, there are very large pig units near the lake.  The &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle may be good because it makes the polluter careful but I think there is an onus on the Department of Transport and Power, as the Department responsible for tourism, to engage in some research and development in this regard so that there may be a possibility of building purification plants at the major rivers and rivulets that flow into a lake.  I am thinking particularly of Lake Sheelin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two industries involved here, the farmers&mdash;they are good <Col N="306" /> farmers who are developing this very important industry&mdash;and the hoteliers. The capital projects as regards the hoteliers involved providing more accommodation.  Bord Fáilte seem to be satisfied that that part of the job has been reasonably well done.</P>
    <P>Here are two important industries and there must be some way in which capital expenditure will solve this dilemma because there is no point in the confrontation that is developing in the region between the agriculturalists and the hoteliers and guesthouse owners. There is a serious pollution problem and I think Bord Fáilte should see if they could erect purification plants at major inlets into lakes to save lakes such as Lake Sheelin for fishermen. That area attracts visitors from Germany, Holland and so on.  There is pollution of the lake and a smell of pollution which was very serious this summer and visitors actually complained that they could not stand the smell or large pig units.  The Minister's Department may have the facility for study and the means to erect purification plants or to produce a type of chemical that will deal with the problem.  Confrontation will only breed bad feeling in the locality.  We are talking of the Department of Transport and Power and money available for projects of a capital nature and there should be a possibility of spending money on purification plants and &ldquo;desmellification&rdquo; plants&mdash;pardon the coining of a word &mdash;to cope with this serious problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard spoke of 61 lakes being polluted and quite a few of those are in the midlands.  There is no point in having the knowledge if remedies are not applied.  I agree with Deputy Leonard that propaganda in schools and so on is important and in that region one of the best Macra na Tuaithe clubs in the country won first prize in Ireland for a project connected with this problem.  But knowledge is not enough: money must be spent to solve the problem and I recommend the Minister to ask his Department to do some research on this project.  Both industries are valuable to the area and capital expenditure may be able to help in this regard.  It is essential that something <Col N="307" /> be done before the problem causes serious disruption in the community.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have been responsible in the past for developments regarding piers and boat accommodation.  On the western, or Finea end of Lake Sheelin there is a river bank area that needs development and some not-too-expensive capital projects could improve that end of the lake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the views of my colleagues in regard to the pollution of lakes but I would like to extend the subject to include some of our valleys which are being used for refuse dumping&mdash;not indiscriminate dumping: what I have in mind are proposals coming from various local authorities to dispose of refuse.  The only system they seem to evolve is: &ldquo;We have a valley there into which we will push rubbish.  We hope to get many years out of it and in the end we will have a flat terrain which we can turn into some kind of park&rdquo;.  Meanwhile many beauty spots will be destroyed.  This is a particular problem in a valley between Dublin and Wicklow, the valley of Ballymahon.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to encourage the board to use some of this money to investigate, along with other Departments, the possibility of other forms of refuge disposal other than dumping because these valleys are tourist attractions and their beauty is well-known.  The present system is a very negative one, that of simply levelling them off.  If this is continued, where will we end up?  Will it mean that the bigger the valley we can find the better because, in time, we will have merely flat areas?  Perhaps the Minister through his Department, could instigate some form of survey into incineration or compaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be allowed draw a parallel.  We have seen many forest walks developed and capital expended on them.  Have we ever considered some form of nature trails in many of our valleys that would show a lot of our flora and fauna?  Instead of our valleys being used for other purposes we should be considering capital outlay on their improvement, perhaps in some form of adventure trails or of leisurely walks to make our people more conscious of the beauty of their surroundings. Rather we see our valleys being used for the purpose of dumping refuse.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we might have a dual approach made by the Minister and the Department, with the expenditure of capital, in an endeavour to make these valleys more accessible to the public, and make the public more aware of their attractions.  Also, with a view to preserving the very existence of these valleys, perhaps the Minister would act, in conjunction with other Departments, with a view to considering other systems of refuse disposal such as incineration or compaction.  We are told the cost of these would be extremely high.</P>

      <P>I want merely to make a few observations on this Bill.  Without going beyond paragraph (c) of subsection (1) it occurs to me that development of such things as camping and caravan sites could be included in these development works. Private enterprise has done some work in this respect, as, indeed, have the office of Public Works.  It seems to me that a properly planned series of camping and caravan sites on a fixed tour to be recommended by Bord Fáilte would be most desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Bord Fáilte have already provided tourist roads. I have travelled along some in the west where they have been provided and have proved very successful. Certainly, I have been very happy to motor along them.  Indeed, some roads have been constructed by Bord Fáilte on old tracks.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister says, I imagine that such roads as the Rosslare/Dublin, Rosslare/Cork or Rosslare/Kilkenny would be proper to the local authorities and the Minister for Local Government.  But I am speaking of scenic roads as yet inaccessible to modern transportation. I should like to see the work done in this regard extended.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate if there are any such plans, because I believe this type of capital expenditure is most desirable.  Furthermore, while I was in the Office of Public Works, we were concerned with the construction of fishery harbours for the fishing industry.  No provision could be made by that Department for landing places for pleasure craft.  If Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works engaged in work on these fishery harbours got together in every case to ensure that, while the Board of Works are carrying out the major construction&mdash; while their men and machinery are there&mdash;landing places were provided for pleasure craft it would be of tremendous advantage to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that the vast majority of motoring tourists who land in Rosslare are inclined to head for Cork and the Ring of Kerry.  Were Bord Fáilte to issue appropriate leaflets and erect proper signposts some <Col N="311" /> beautiful tours could be arranged around the midlands&mdash;say, Kilkenny Castle, the Rock of Cashel, Holy Cross Abbey, Cahir Castle and other monuments of interest in that area, a most suitable historic and scenic tour could be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether capital would have to be expended in grading all places that sell food.  It is something that has been in the offing and it may not be applicable under this Bill.  I am wondering also if the amount to be provided under this Bill is sufficient.  If we are entering into the construction of scenic roads, or the improvement of some roads on new, suggested tours, a great deal of money will be required.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point I wish to make which has to do with coast erosion.  There are places where amenities such as golf courses are being undermined and going into the sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this one reference.  The Coast Erosion Acts are so cumbersome that very little <Col N="312" /> work is being done.  This is an area in which Bord Fáilte might consider spending capital moneys to protect amenities which are being washed into the sea.  I would ask the Minister to look into that aspect.  It is something I could not deal with when I was in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to second what Deputy Wilson said regarding making finance available to prevent pollution.  I appreciate that the Minister has shown concern about this and indeed has said that there is &ldquo;co-ordination of Departments&rdquo;&mdash;I believe those are the words he used&mdash;to deal with this problem.</P>
      <P>When one gets down to specific problems it is very confusing for a public representative who wants to bring particular problems to the attention of a Minister.  For example, if I could be specific and mention Lough Corrib, both Deputy Molloy and I have got the reply from the Office of Public Works that it is not their responsibility. We do not know whose responsibility it is.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know.  If this is what is meant by &ldquo;co-ordination of Departments&rdquo; I do not believe it is effective.</P>
      <P>The Foras Forbartha report has shown that there is some enrichment in the lower lake of Lough Corrib and the problem is highlighted by the fact that Galway County Council have appointed four technicians to deal with the problem of preventing pollution. I hope they will be able to achieve something.  The problem remains that there is silting in the lake and we do not know whose responsibility it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Peat silting is causing a problem in the Shannon and the Suck.  Although Bord na Móna accept that there is pollution there and are doing all they can, I am surprised that the Minister did not refer in his speech to the EEC dimension in this.  There is this dimension in that a second environmental research programme will be beginning shortly from 1976 to 1980.  The Minister did not refer to the fact that proposals could be made by interested organisations and personnel.  Surely Bord na Móna would be able to submit a project and have the scientific <Col N="313" /> opinions and brains available to enable them to do so.  I would ask the Minister to consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>The problem of pollution has been highlighted particularly in Galway in these two areas.  The fact that so many people are speaking about pollution shows the concern there is about the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with capital expenditure under the Bill, grants could be given to State bodies to deal with pollution.  I refer to the body referred to by Deputy Kitt&mdash; Bord na Móna.  The Minister said in his Second Reading speech that there is no pollution by Bord na Móna. I want to make it clear that we are all in favour of the expansion of Bord na Móna but we have to strike a balance between keeping the environment clean and the expansion of industry.  It is the view of a great many people that Bord na Móna are not doing all they should do to prevent peat silting in the Shannon and the Suck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see capital expenditure by State-sponsored bodies on research. If settling lakes were made by Bord na Móna before development of bogs the silt would settle and less of it would go into the major rivers. That is a matter that should be considered <Col N="315" /> in order to satisfy people who want to see Bord na Móna develop our natural resources but do not want rivers and lakes to be polluted.</P>
    <P>Pollution is a very important question. If private enterprise and farmers are required to take certain measures and to expend money on the prevention of pollution State bodies should also be required to do so.  People who have studied this matter are of the opinion that State bodies are not doing all they should do in this matter.  I should like some of this capital to go towards the prevention of pollution by State bodies.</P>
    <P>I mentioned on Second Reading that the grants for extension of accommodation for farmhouse holidays should be restored immediately.  This is very important to the tourist industry in the west.</P>
    <P>It is held that Bord na Móna are causing pollution.  The Minister says they are not and that they are doing all they can.  It is held that they are not.</P>

      <P>Section 2 is the operative section in so far as it provides money for an important industry. Every Deputy on this side could list very necessary works to be carried out from the point of view of amenities and I would like the Minister to explain what he expects can be done with the paltry sum he is making available. This is one of the most important industries we have.  We are scourged with unemployment and the forecast for 1976 is gloomy indeed. People are beginning to wonder whether they will be able to exist when the new range of increased prices comes into being.  The Government have obviously taken the result of the Mayo by-election as the green light and they are now determined to scourge the people further with price rises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are expecting the Government to put millions into the development of this important industry.  That investment would take some of the 107,000 off the dole queue because <Col N="316" /> they could engage in very necessary works which would improve the industry and help to pull the country out of the depths to which it has sunk.  Will the Minister explain why only this paltry sum is being provided?  Every Member could enumerate hundreds of necessary development works.  This money would not touch the fringe of one tourist county.  The country needs a real injection to improve the ecoomy. This action demonstrates very clearly the fact that the Government have no intention of making any serious effort to do something worthwhile for the economy and that on the eve of what may well be the most disastrous year the country will ever face. Here, I am quoting everybody, including the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>All that is being made available is a paltry sum which will barely take up the slack to which this Government have contributed.  We must look like fools knowing that the economy needs a real injection in one of the best industries the country has, an industry that contributes to our balance of payments, an industry which would take thousands off the dole, thousands who could engage in useful work, something the country sorely needs at present.  Is it not a mockery to come in here and talk about a few pounds to deal with pollution of waterways and so on?  The whole thing is a farce.  Thank God, in the west we have been endowed with the raw materials that make a good tourist environment.  We have the amenities given to us by God.  How is it the Government, who pretend to be concerned about the serious state of the economy, a state to which they themselves have contributed, could not do more than announce new ESB and postal charges?  Perhaps the Minister is marking time.  Perhaps when the new year comes we will have £100 million extra to do something for an industry that can contribute so much towards restoring the economy to what it was a few years ago.  Perhaps there is some plan.  Perhaps some research has been done and there will be a regional programme.  If there is nothing other than what is in the Bill we are just wasting our time.  We are <Col N="317" /> witnessing the cynicism of the Minister and the Government.  They are not even scratching the surface of the problem.  The Minister cannot take any kudos from this.  The few pounds being provided here would not even do the few things at parochial level about which Members have spoken. Unless the Minister can give us more reassuring information this whole thing is a farce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle pointed out, many of the contributions so far have been outside the scope of the section.  I have taken particular note of what was said about pollution and I have made it clear in a number of speeches recently that I am concerned about pollution because it can endanger tourism.  Our waters, our rivers and our lakes are attractions.  There are people who want to holiday in boats and fish in rivers and lakes and I am concerned to ensure that our waters are properly preserved.  I am anxious standards should be restored.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leonard referred to the inter-departmental committee.  That committee will report not just once. It will be a continuing process.  The committee will co-ordinate the efforts of the other Departments involved and get whatever needs to be done done as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also referred to Aer Lingus and the Irish Travel Agents' Association.  I prefer to stay out of this.  The two bodies should get together and resolve their difficulties. I understand they met last week and were meeting again today.  I do not know with what result yet.  I agree that Aer Lingus should stay on the Atlantic.  For prestige reasons it is essential they should.</P>
      <P>Many of the matters mentioned by Deputies can be dealt with.  This money is not being provided for the Department of Transport and Power. It is money being voted for Bord Fáilte and Bord Fáilte will spend it in consultation with the local authorities, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Lands.  Many of the projects mentioned can be fitted in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said the amount was paltry.  I do not think £4.75 <Col N="318" /> million is paltry.  Were I to look for £100 million I am sure Deputy Brennan would follow me into the Lobby to vote for the extra taxation. Money does not come out of thin air.</P>

      <P>No.  This is the amount the board estimate they will need.  Frequently there are arguments in this House to the effect that semi-State companies should be given £X and not have the Ministers concerned coming back to the House seeking more money.  I do not subscribe to that argument because I believe that we should have debates here as often as possible on semi-State companies and that Ministers should come before the House frequently seeking extra money when the affairs of the various bodies could be debated. Bord Fáilte estimate that the figure being sought here will be sufficient for their needs during the next two to three years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity afforded by this Bill to draw the Minister's attention to problems similar to the one mentioned by Deputy Kitt.  I am concerned about the condition of the river Corrib and of Lake Corrib and of the difficulties that exist in relation to tackling these problems.</P>
      <P>In particular there is the difficulty regarding responsibility for the work that is needed to deal with the problems.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of some of the matters I mention and ascertain who is responsible for dealing with them.  He might be able to tell us, too, whether Bord Fáilte will provide for this work any of the moneys being voted to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> Lake Corrib has been affected slightly by some form of pollution. This is nothing serious apart from the question of the enrichment of the lower lake which was referred to in the recent Foras Forbartha report. This enrichment is causing excessive growth of weed and plant life and the growth, in turn, is creating the further problem of silting.  This lake is a shallow one so that the silting is causing grave concern to the tourist interests in the whole region as well as to the clubs and associations who promote the use of the Corrib for recreational purposes and for those who participate in all kinds of water sports. The silting is most serious at the point where the lake flows into the river.  The problem has become so bad that passage of keel boats from the river to the lake is very difficult. Were it not for a commercial concern who operate a water bus between the city and Annaghdown, many local people believe that it would be impossible for a water boat to make its way from the river into the lake. The action of the propellors of the water bus helps to keep the silt clear in one small central channel.</P>
    <P>As this growth in weeds restricts seriously the movements of all boats on the surface of the water, fishing is affected, too.  The problem has reached an alarming proportion and the tragedy is that there is nobody dealing with it.  The matter has been raised at meetings of Galway County Council in whose local authority the lake is.  They have certain responsibilities in this regard but the county manager has stated that he has no statutory authority for the expenditure of any moneys on the clearing of silt from the lower lake.  The Office of Public Works who carried out a major drainage scheme in the Galway area some years ago and who have been maintaining it since, have informed me by letter that they had no responsibility in the matter, that they are obliged only to comply with certain Acts and that under those Acts their responsibility does not extend to the removing of silt of the type I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another authority with certain responsibilities <Col N="320" /> in the area is the Corrib Navigation Board but they claim that this problem is not their responsibility, that they are responsible only for the navigation channel which, as I have explained, has been kept open as a result of the action of one boat.  Any deviation from that narrow channel would put a boat in difficulty.  Lake Corrib is one of the finest lakes in Europe but it is deteriorating rapidly. In these circumstances I am making a special plea to the Minister, having regard to the concern expressed by him on several occasions both in this House and outside it and having regard, too, to the statement made by Mr. P.V. Doyle as Chairman of Bord Fáilte.  He indicates in their annual report that the board seem to realise at last that this is an area where they must become active, where they must show an interest and make a financial contribution if many of the pollution and silting problems are to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Lake Corrib is dying a slow death which is being watched in great silence by the public bodies.  I hope that the Minister will have this whole matter examined and that he will allocate to Bord Fáilte a proportion of these moneys for the purpose of dealing with this problem.  The work will involve heavy capital expenditure because of the heavy machinery that will be required to carry out the work successfully. If any action taken by the Minister achieves such an outcome, he will get the appreciation he deserves from all concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a similar dilemma in respect of the rivers that flow through Galway city.  Again, nobody has responsibility for dealing with the situation and public bodies there are reluctant to spend their funds in case they are surcharged for spending money on works in respect of which they have not statutory authority.</P>
    <P>Galway was built on a series of rivers many of which are underneath the buildings but some of those that are exposed and which flow freely through that old and beautiful city are going into decay because of excessive weed growth.  I ask Bord Fáilte to interest themselves in this problem <Col N="321" /> and to have it attended to fairly soon. That is the main point I wish to make and if it is dealt with we shall all be very grateful to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Such items as amenities and expenditure of a capital nature are included here.  I cannot let this occasion pass without making a special plea to the Minister to look into the position of the Connemara Golf Club, a club that was built mostly from funds collected locally and which is the major tourist amenity that has been provided locally&mdash;everything else was natural.  The local people showed great initiative in making this lovely golf course at Ballyconnelly.  I have been amazed that during the past two-and-a-half years the Minister has refused to make grants available to help this club remain open, especially in view of the need in the area for that type of facility where practically the whole population are dependent in varying degrees on tourism.</P>
    <P>I understand, too, that the Minister has refused to sanction a grant to the Oughterard Golf Club which is a very similar case to the one at Ballyconnelly. Yet, not so many months ago we read that the Taoiseach attended in Westport at the opening of a golf course to which Bord Fáilte gave a grant in the region of £200,000.  Nothing like that is required for the Connemara Golf Club at Ballyconnelly.  I appeal to the Minister, when these funds are at his disposal, to pay the grants that are morally due to the Connemara Golf Club and also to pay the grants to the Oughterard Golf Club, which was put there because of the encouragement of Bord Fáilte. Since the golf course was first thought of the idea was pushed ahead by representatives of Bord Fáilte.  I understand that not one penny of a grant has been paid.</P>
    <P>The Connemara and Galway people have tried to provide those golf courses to help their own tourist amenities.  In recent years people have been going for a more active type holiday.  When local people, through financial sacrifices, are providing those facilities it seems very strange that Bord Fáilte are not participating in those developments.  The local people <Col N="322" /> in Connemara have done far more than Bord Fáilte have done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>What part of this increased capital investment will go towards the development of fish rearing stations, fish development stations, salmon hatcheries and projects of this kind?  The fishing industry is playing a vital part in relation to tourism. While we advertise that fishing is available, it is well-known that salmon stocks are in danger.  It seems a waste advertising that salmon fishery is available if the stocks are depleted and if no capital investment has been made by Bord Fáilte and other responsible bodies to restock salmon fisheries.  Will any part of this completely inadequate capital be put into the provision of salmon rearing stations and salmon hatcheries in order to press on with the further development of our salmon and trout fisheries?</P>

      <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Daly salmon stocks and salmon fisheries are the responsibility of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  Bord Fáilte could not use the money from this fund for that.  With regard to what Deputy Molloy said, I am not quite sure about Lough Corrib.  One of the questions which comes to mind is how did the silting occur?  What prevented the lakes silting for thousands of years?</P>

They would be very concerned to see that the lakes are suitable for fishing and also that they are not silted up to make them unusable for boating.</P>
      <P>As regards the Connemara Golf Club, they got a grant from Bord Fáilte and also got a grant from the fund administered by the Central Development Committee in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know as I have not the figures here.  I know <Col N="323" /> they got two grants.  Bord Fáilte have told me that some years ago because of their interest in golfing and setting up a circuit of golf courses of championship level around the country they provided golf course funds.  They have now stopped because they feel that there are sufficient golf courses in the country. I will speak to them again about this.  I admire the spirit of the people in Clifden and around that area who made this golf course.  I am not a golfer but I understand it is one of the finest golf courses in the country and a real challenge to golfers.  Bord Fáilte have officially closed the fund out of which they helped golf courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bord Fáilte decision to officially cease paying grants to golf courses was made before the Connemara Golf Club received their grant.  They already have paid a grant subsequent to their decision not to pay grants.  This was done because of a decision made during the time of the last Government when the Minister intervened in the matter.  That is publicly known.  That grant was not adequate and subsequent grants are warranted.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister met a deputation from the Connemara Golf Club last year.  They are in a very serious financial position, which is nearly as bad as the one the Tánaiste seems to be in.  They are carrying very heavy bank overdrafts and very heavy commitments to the loans despite the fact that over £20,000 was collected locally in a very poor area. The people concerned with this golf course have told me that they got nowhere with the representations made to the Minister.  The Minister has plenty of money available under this Bill to meet the small needs of the Connemara Golf Club so he should take them out of the financial straitjacket they are in.  If this golf course does not get some help it will have to close.  The banks are keeping it open.</P>

I <Col N="324" /> am concerned with such an area 20 miles from Galway and also the same distance from Ennis where the people went to a lot of expense to buy land to develop it into a golf course.  They did this on the assumption that they would get a grant from Bord Fáilte.  It is beside Lady Gregory's place at Gort.  Am I to assume that Bord Fáilte will give no further grants for golf courses?  I hope this is not the case.</P>

We certainly assumed there was no problem about getting a grant because nearly every golf course around the country, which was in an area like the one I am talking about, got a grant.  If no more grants are to be provided by Bord Fáilte, I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter in relation to this particular area.</P>

They are getting the blame for the pollution in Lough Corrib.  We should really be talking about preventing the pollution and trying to learn a little more about it because we do not seem to know a lot about it at the moment.  I suggest that research projects be undertaken so that we can learn a little more about pollution.  In this way we would not be blaming the innocent people.</P>

      <P>In order to qualify for a grant for reconstruction a hotel must be classified by Bord Fáilte and be in a position to produce audited accounts but the Minister should recommend that in certain areas not <Col N="325" /> traditional tourist areas&mdash;I am speaking about premises that cater for visiting anglers&mdash;money should be made available without such people having to comply with all the regulations. While I admit we have a lot of accommodation available for tourists, there are many people who would be interested in improving their premises with a view to catering for visiting anglers.  A large contingent of seasoned anglers arrived in my county recently and they could be accommodated in the type of premises I have in mind.</P>

The fact that there is not a top hotel in the lakeland region has been mentioned by the Deputy but Bord Fáilte would not establish such a hotel from the ground up; a proposal would have to be put before them by somebody else before they would help.</P>

Section 11 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, provides that the remuneration and allowances paid to the board's officers and servants shall be determined by the board.  The effect of this section is to exclude from the provisions of section 11 of the 1939 Act the determination of the remuneration and allowances of the board's chief officer.  In future his remuneration and allowance will be determined in accordance with section 4 of the Bill. Having catered for the determination of his salary in section 4, you must have another section to exclude him from the 1939 Act which determines how it shall be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Richard Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to section 5 (2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, Chapters II and III of Statute CIV of University College, Cork, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st August, 1975, be and are hereby disallowed.</P>
      <P>This motion is being introduced because certain sections of Statute 104 made by University College, Cork, are not, in the opinion of the Ministers of the Public Service and Education, in accordance with the terms of the national wages agreement, 1974.  In addition to proposals to increase the salaries of certain staff, with effect from 1st March, 1975, under the terms of the national wages agreement, 1974, it is proposed in Chapter II of Statute 104 to increase the children's allowances of certain staff with effect from 1st March, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Chapter III of the statute it is proposed to increase pensions first with effect from 1st December, 1974, and further with effect from 1st March, 1975.  With regard to the proposals to increase children's allowances, it is necessary to point out <Col N="331" /> that children's allowances are not allowances in the nature of pay and cannot be regarded as entitled to be increased under clause 3 of the national wages agreement, 1974. Clause 3 of that agreement applies only to increases in basic rates of pay.</P>
    <P>In the matter of pensions, the practice in other parts of the public service is that pensions are received annually on 1st July by reference to pay rates on that date.  As the major portion of university funds comes from the public purse the universities are expected to conform to public service standards in all aspects of pay and remuneration.  In fact, the university staffs themselves request parity of treatment with the public service in the case of anomaly or other special increases.</P>
    <P>The authorities of University College Cork were informed through the Higher Education Authority of the views of the Ministers of the Public Service and Education in regard to the need to revoke the appropriate provisions relating to children's allowances and superannuation contained in Statute 104, or to introduce an amending statute.  The college stated in reply, however, that it had been the practice for many years, because of the long period necessary to process statutes, to pay salary/wage increases and consequential pension increases from the due dates or as soon as possible thereafter and that such payments are made in advance subject to the subsequent validation of the relevant statutes.</P>
    <P>Once previously&mdash;on 4th July, 1974 &mdash;I introduced a motion disallowing statutes of University College Cork which dealt with pensions.  During the discussion of the motion in the House on that occasion I said that I am always willing to enter into discussions with the governing body of University College Cork, to enable a scheme to be drawn up which would satisfy the requirements of comparability with other parts of the public service and, in so far as this can be achieved, the desires of the governing body.</P>
    <P>I am glad to learn that University <Col N="332" /> College Cork, has recently suggested that the method of review to be applied to pensions in the future be discussed with the Higher Education Authority and that in such discussions the issue of children's allowances could also be considered.  I welcome this suggestion.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I have no option but to introduce this motion that</P>
    <P>pursuant to section 5 (2) of the Irish Universities Act, 1908, Chapters II and III of Statute CIV of University College, Cork, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st August, 1975, be and are hereby disallowed.</P>
    <P>May I add for the information of the House that a letter was received from the Higher Education Authority this afternoon in which it was stated that the authorities of University College Cork have suggested that discussions might take place at an early date in relation to the procedures to be followed in connection with these matters in future.  The suggestions made will receive careful consideration in my Department.  In the meantime, however, I have no option but to take the present action in the case of Chapters II and III of Statute CIV of the College.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Opposition I want to register a strong protest at this whole procedure.  As the Minister stated, UCC as well as the other colleges and the universities always related their pensions to the salaries of the corresponding staff, and this I think is a headline which the Government could follow.  I must say this is in keeping with a certain harshness that I find creeping in, particularly in the Department of Education and the Minister for Education. It was evidenced in the Minister's treatment of the untrained teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The colleges are perfectly right in relating pensions to salaries and I cannot see how the Minister for Education and his fellow Minister should not take them as a headline with regard particularly to pensions.  It is <Col N="333" /> essential in a period of rapid inflation&mdash;we are in one at the moment&mdash; that people on fixed incomes from pensions should not be left out in the cold.  That in fact is what the Minister and the Department are doing by removing this statute from UCC.  Substantially, the salaries are obviously in accordance with the national wage agreement, but the Minister has made no great play in his statement with regard to salaries.  He simply has not approached the salaries issue at all, and that is the substantial part of this statute.  What it means is that the Minister is imposing a time lag as far as pensions are concerned.  He said that 1st July is the relevant date.  That means that if they were not adjusted by 1st July, 1975, they must wait until 1st July, 1976, and in an inflationary situation that is simply unjust.</P>
    <P>What happens to a pensioner in the meantime?  Here we are not talking purely about academic staff, because retired janitors, porters and secretaries are all involved.  What happens to a person on such a fixed income with inflation rising rapidly?  What happens to him in January when he cannot write a letter without putting a 9p stamp on it?  What happens to him when his telephone charges will rise astronomically?</P>
    <P>This is all evidence of the harshness which is creeping into the administration and is particularly applicable to the Department of Education.  Apparently Dublin University is not obliged to go through the same process as UCC, UCD and UCG.  What has the Minister done about salaries, pensions and allowances in Trinity College? Has he received similar provisions from UCD and UCG?  Why is it that Cork seems to be the only college up for the hammer?  Is it not true the Minister has representations from the other two colleges as well as UCC to save a situation which had been happening for some time and sent the statute up to be put before the House here in due form, but did UCD and UCG send it into the Department of Education?  Are these proposals lying in the Department of Education untouched? Is it not sharp practice on the part of the Department of Education <Col N="334" /> to keep them coming before the House?</P>
    <P>I should like answers to these questions because there is evidence of undue harshness on the part of the Department of Education in this respect as in others.  How long according to law can the Department sit on proposals like this?  How long will they be lying in the Department before they are assented to or brought before the House for annulment?</P>
    <P>I submit that if the Minister and the Department of Education and other Ministers wanted a headline they could have taken it from UCC.  I am concerned particularly for the pensioners. It is not fair practice to keep pensioners waiting for long periods for <i>pro rata</i> increases in their pensions. The Minister belongs to an Administration that claimed they would indulge as never before in consultation and by implication they criticised the previous Administration for not doing so.  Is UCC at the moment adopting this practice to avoid the foot dragging in the Department of Education? Is there a case of foot dragging in regard to the other two colleges?</P>
    <P>I started off by saying I protest at the whole procedure.  There is a little bit of nit-picking in the Minister's speech about children's allowances and the time for the admission of increases in pensions and superannuation. This is not sufficient.  If UCC&mdash;this is not contained in the Minister's script&mdash;has stated it is willing to go into consultation with the Higher Education Authority about procedures, I am sure it will be making a case that it is willing to go according to established procedures according to the statute if their statute is not allowed to grow whiskers in Marlborough Street before coming to the House for assent, or refusal if it comes to that.</P>
    <P>As a famous Spaniard said, our universities are supposed to be tempies of reason.  If UCC in due form prepares a statute, such as Statute 104, and sends it up, it deserves better treatment than the Minister is giving it and that he gave the last one as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> The Department over which the Minister presides had built up over a comparatively short period a reputation as &ldquo;the Department of action&rdquo;. This kind of handling of a situation in relation to the staff and retired staff, both academic and unacademic, in UCC is an example of messing, the same kind of messing as we have witnessed not merely from the Minister for Education but the Government on the proposals in relation to higher education, the National Institute for Higher Education in Limerick, the National Physical Education College in Limerick and the National Council of Education Awards.  It is on a par with all the messing that is going on in that Department, where there was action when the late Donogh O'Malley was Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope we are not going to have a rosary of motions by the Minister to annul statutes.  We had one last year and we have one this year.  The tragedy is that some pensioners may not live until the Minister sees fit to allow the pensions to be increased. This farce may turn out to be an annual affair.  Perhaps some good will come from the discussion with the Higher Education Authority.  I do not think University College, Cork, are to blame for what is happening.  I do not blame them for adopting the procedure they have adopted in this case because if, as I suspect, UCG and UCD have sent proposals to the Department in a different way and if they are held up there, I do not blame UCC for doing the job the way they think it should be done.</P>
    <P>I want to protest at the whole procedure. I protest particularly on behalf of pensioners who, if the delay is very long, will not be alive to enjoy a properly deserved increased pension related to increased salary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It strikes me as extraordinary that we have a situation where the Minister for Education, the man who committed himself early on to being a person who could be met and who could discuss problems with people in the educational field, should admit in his speech that at no stage was he in direct contact with the UCC authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="336" /> As Deputy Wilson pointed out, the Minister had a motion before the House last year and now there is this motion.  It was introduced in the House at approximately 9 p.m.; we have a deadline for dealing with this matter and, in a kind of guillotine manner, the House is being asked to approve this motion without a sufficient opportunity of discussing it.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's speech there is the bald statement that the authorities of UCC, with whom obviously the Minister has been in dispute since he came into office, were informed through the HEA of his views and those of the Minister for the Public Service.  Quite frankly, I consider this is a despicable and dictatorial attitude by the Minister for Education. We have the almost unparalleled arrangement where the Minister for Education, on his own behalf and on behalf of the Minister for the Public Service is asking the Dáil to disapprove of sections of this statute.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister may say that the appropriate authority for dealing with this matter are the HEA. Earlier today we had a situation with regard to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The National Prices Commission were the appropriate authority to deal with something he announced yesterday but he went over their heads and ignored their views when he announced extra taxation measures.  Here we have the situation where the Minister for Education has put the blame for the rejection of the pensions proposals and the children's allowances proposals in Statute No. 104 on the HEA.  As the responsible Minister he is asking us to approve the non-sanction of those proposals but for some reason or other he has refused to communicate directly with the UCC authorities.  He may say he did communicate directly with them but he did not say that and I do not see why he should specifically spell out that the HEA are the means of contact.</P>
    <P>In the final part of his speech he said he was glad to learn that UCC had recently suggested that the method of review be discussed with the HEA.  Even though it was not in <Col N="337" /> the speech he circulated he mentioned that some kind of letter had been received this afternoon by the HEA asking for very early discussion on this matter.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a peculiar non-contactability about the Minister for Education in relation to this matter. We cannot possibly support proposals in a statute that would be in breach of the national wage agreement but we think it is a rather extraordinary statement from a Minister in an open Government, where we were given to understand that the doors were open at all times, and nowhere more open than in the Department of Education. The Minister has admitted that it was necessary only once before to introduce a motion disallowing statutes of UCC and that was almost one-and-a-half years ago.  Apparently the sour grapes are such that there has not been any direct communication between the Minister and the UCC authorities.</P>
    <P>We are asked to approve the disallowance of Chapters II and III of Statute No. 104.  That covers the disallowance of the provisions made for increases in children's allowances. The Minister went into details why that was not covered under clause 3 of the national wage agreement but we are disallowing Chapter III of the Statute where it is proposed to increase pensions first with effect from 1st December, 1974 and further with effect from 1st March, 1975.  We are disallowing the proposed increases in Chapter III because the motion proposes to disallow Chapter III in its entirety but, at the same time, the Minister concedes that under the terms of the national wage agreement there is the arrangement where pensions are reviewed annually on 1st July by reference to pay rates on that date.</P>
    <P>Arising from the disqualification of Chapter III, I want the Minister to indicate whether that means that where pensioners in other sectors of the public service qualified for revision of their pensions as from 1st July last that there will not be an increase for the pensioners attached to UCC to which they were legitimately <Col N="338" /> entitled on 1st July last.  If Chapter III is being disallowed, I take it it means there will be no increase for pensioners at all since the statute of 4th July, 1974 was disallowed at that time.  I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny that pensioners who in accordance with the Minister's statement would and should have qualified for an increase in pension from 1st July last will now be debarred from obtaining that increase.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister therefore if he considers it fair that he should come into Parliament tonight and ask Parliament to disallow the legitimate increases in pensions to which pensioners attached to University College, Cork are entitled.  Is he going to say that because of the non-agreement of the college authorities before now to discuss the matter, their unwillingness to discuss it with the Higher Education Authority&mdash;I will not say their unwillingness to discuss the matter with him as quite obviously the Minister is unapproachable in this regard because he makes it quite clear from his short speech introducing the motion that the appropriate body with whom the college authorities are to deal is the Higher Education Authority&mdash;the Minister shakes his head in disagreement. I am sorry; I note that in his speech he said &ldquo;I am always willing to enter into discussions&rdquo;.  I have being doing him an injustice.</P>

I want to ask the Minister as man to man, he knowing that he was coming into a confrontation situation, that there was a termination date which puts us in the position that the Taoiseach had to come into the House at 25 minutes past 8 o'clock and ask the Dáil to sit until possibly 2 o'clock in the morning to finalise this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because I have been told that this must go through <Col N="340" /> tonight, and we now discover there are four more days and the Dáil will sit tomorrow.  The Minister told us the reason we waited until tonight was that he could not take the motion because he had to go to a dinner. I might say that it is not my function to amuse the Minister or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because it is a very serious matter and another indication to me of a continuance in its own way of Government blundering. We have a situation in which the Minister has to come in here with the Oireachtas mallet to reject proposals, and at the 11th hour, he tells us that he is willing to have discussions with the governing body of University College Cork.  Since this statute was laid before Dáil Éireann on 21st August last, has the Minister, directly as Minister, through the Secretary of his Department or through his private secretary, communicated with the authorities of the college asking them to meet him to review this situation?  Will he say whether the directive went from his office to the Higher Education Authority, saying in short: &ldquo;Will you rap these fellows on the knuckles and bring them into line&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is high-handed of the Minister to adopt the line he is adopting here.  I accept what he says in relation to Chapter II and in relation to Chapter III, but could the Minister not have endeavoured before coming in here to refuse, to annul or to disallow Chapters II and III, to get on to the Cork authorities and say to them &ldquo;If you force me to disallow Chapters II and III of Statute No. 104, it will mean that the unfortunate pensioners covered by Chapter III will not receive the increase in pensions to which they are legitimately entitled as from 1st July last.&rdquo;  I have no knowledge of who constitutes the University College Cork authority.  I am not an informed source in this regard, but as a man far removed one of the thoughts that struck me when I heard the Minister's statement was that he was disallowing benefit to pensioners to which they were entitled, but that there was even the possibility that the authorities of University College Cork might not have been as worried as <Col N="341" /> they should have been about their pensioners.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is a battle being waged by the Minister through the Higher Education Authority with the authorities of UCC.  There is the question of people who will benefit through children's allowances but the real sufferers arising from the passing of this motion tonight, as presented to us by the Minister for Education, are the people who have finished their time, people who are not directly concerned with UCC at present, people who have given a service in the college, people to whom graduates all over the world must be grateful for services rendered.  Perhaps some of those are in this House&mdash;or should be&mdash;tonight and those people are being asked to approve a motion refusing to give a justified rise to pensioners who qualify for it, just like everybody else in the public sector on 1st July last.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, in order to meet my views in this regard, will be able to say when replying that he is in a position, through the Higher Education Authority to make arrangements so that those pensions will qualify and will receive before Christmas the increases to which they are entitled from 1st July.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite obvious from the discussion that some Deputies opposite do not understand some of the matters which are the subject of the motion before the Dáil.  Let me clarify the position by stating that section 4 of the Irish Universities Act, 1908 provides for the making by governing bodies of the National University of Ireland and of constituent colleges at Dublin, Cork and Galway of statutes for the general government of the university and scholarships.  The section states that such statutes:</P>
      <P>... may regulate any matter relating to the government of the university or college (including the appointment and remuneration of officers) or otherwise concerning the university or college so far as that matter is not regulated under this Act or by the charter of the university or college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="342" /> Section 5 (1) of the Act provides that when any statute has been made under this Act, a notice of its having been made shall be laid as soon as may be before both Houses of Parliament. The remaining subsections of this section as adapted contain provisions in relation to the disallowance of a statute in whole or part so that there is in fact legislation covering this whole question of disallowance.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my opening remarks, Statute 104 of University College Cork was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in August, 1975 and will become law on 30th November unless disallowed.  The statute provides for increases under the national agreement 1974 in the stipends of the president, professors, readers, certain lecturers and officers of the college effective from 1st March, 1975; for increases in the children's allowances payable by the college and for increases in the pensions payable to retired participants in the college pension scheme effective from December, 1974 and March, 1975.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the Minister for the Public Service, and the Minister for Education object to that part of the statute relating to increases in children's allowances on the ground that children's allowances are not allowances in the nature of pay and cannot be regarded as entitled to be increased under clause 3 of the national wage agreement. Deputies opposite who spoke on this matter did not clearly convey to me what their view was of clause 3 in so far as it relates to the matters under discussion.</P>
    <P>Clause 3 of the national wage agreement applies only to increases in rates of pay.  Children's allowances do not move with basic pay in other parts of the public sector.  The universities are expected, at least on this side of the House, to conform generally to public service standards in such matters and not to introduce conditions more generous than in other parts of the public service.  I take it from the remarks made opposite that the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party feel that University College Cork should receive generally more favourable <Col N="343" /> terms than the rest of the population.</P>
    <P>I also pointed out that I objected further to that part of the statute relating to increases in pensions on the grounds that the statute introduced superannuation conditions which are more generous than those applicable in the public service generally.  Again, I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies whether they wish me to allow more favourable conditions for those in University College Cork than for the public service generally?  I have pointed out that public policy in relation to pension increases in the public service is that pensions are revised annually on 1st July and the Minister for the Public Service and I would be very concerned if one particular area of the public sector should be more favourably treated than others in this regard.  In view of the massive involvement of public moneys in universities it is only reasonable to expect that they should conform generally to public service standards in such matters as superannuation.</P>
    <P>Last year I introduced a motion in Dáil Éireann disallowing superannuation provisions made in statutes at that time.  The reason for this extreme action on the part of the Government was that these statutes would have introduced superannuation conditions which were more generous than those applicable to the public service generally.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to pensions parity is unchanged since then.  Have Deputies opposite any views on that? In normal circumstances we would see grave objections to better pension terms for this college than for the rest of the public sector.  In the present serious economic and financial situation we find that the college proposals for pension increases are even more unacceptable.  I have already pointed out that the college had been asked through the Higher Education Authority to revoke or annual by amending statutes those parts of Statute 104 which relate to increases in children's allowances and pensions. The college indicated however, that <Col N="344" /> it is opposed to taking such action.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor was eloquent in suggesting that I should deal directly with UCC.  If the Deputy is serious in his suggestion, then he wishes to downgrade the Higher Education Authority set up under his own Administration in 1971.  The HEA are the body who advise the Minister generally in relations with university colleges.  The HEA also have involvement in fund allocation and is in the closest contact with the universities.  I cannot accept the stated invitation and the implied invitation in other cases, of the Opposition that I should ignore the HEA which they themselves set up, in dealing with the university.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Lalor was having it both ways when he castigated another Minister for not doing precisely what I have done in this case. He cannot have it both ways.  Is it fair, he says, to disallow this statute? Of course, it is fair.  It is fair for the very reasons I have stated, that if I did not do this, then I would be condoning&mdash;and so would the Minister for the Public Service&mdash;preferential treatment for one section of the public sector.  I am amazed to find Deputy Lalor, a previous Minister, suggesting that, in fact, university college staffs should be more favourably treated in the matter of pensions and children's allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should check the record.  I did not say that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. Richard Burke Mr. Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Richard Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the whole import of the Deputy's remarks because, to disagree with me in regard to this disallowance is, in effect, to state that.</P>
      <P>I think Deputies opposite do not understand what is involved here. The suggestion that I have never been in touch with University College, Cork is to ignore totally the situation in regard to the HEA.  The HEA is the body which deals with these matters and I am quite prepared to deal with the universities, in respect of funding matters in regard to pensions, salaries and so on, through the HEA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was castigated also by Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party for waiting <Col N="345" /> until the last minute.  Another interpretation of that would be that the last minute gave an opportunity to people who I have already indicated showed an unwillingness to do so and also afforded an opportunity to the people in University College, Cork to amend the statutes.  But no such indication was conveyed to me. Therefore, the Opposition's whole stance on this is specious.  I ask the Dáil to disallow sections 2 and 3, to which I have referred, for the reasons I have indicated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>No, merely questions: do not children's allowances move in other sectors the Minister mentioned? I should like to know under what criteria they do move because from the way the Minister was talking one would gather that, in fact, they did not move at all.</P>
      <P>Did the Minister hear my question about University College, Dublin, University College, Galway and Trinity College?  If he did, he chose to ignore them.  Is there a better system for dealing with these relevant questions in the other two colleges?  If there is, what is it?  And why is it that it is only University College, Cork that is falling foul of the Minister?  Will the Higher Education Authority in future deal with pensions and allowances and only the Higher Education Authority? Those are questions I asked the Minister to which I did not get answers.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister also how he can come in here and suggest that this part of the House is being unjust <i>vis-à-vis</i> the rest of the community in dealing with the pension of Mary Goode who get £153 per annum and Mary Creedon who gets £142 in the present inflationary situation.  I think the Minister has a brass neck.</P>

      <P>Let me briefly say in respect of one pertinent point made by the Deputy that if any other university college conferred similar increases in children's allowances and pensions, as has been conferred by this statute, and if it came before the Oireachtas I would have to treat it in exactly the same way. There is no differential treatment.</P>

Does this mean that pensioners will not now be eligible for any increase as from the 1st July last because of the disallowance of chapter 3?  Replying, the Minister said that particular chapters can be disallowed in whole or in part.  Does this mean that pensioners will not receive any increase in their pensions as from the 1st July last?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 14 and 15, to delete the definition of &ldquo;rebroadcast&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House is very familiar, perhaps, indeed, over-familiar, with the history of this matter.  Section 6 of the Bill would have given the Minister power to direct the rebroadcasting of outside services.  This was intended to <Col N="349" /> give power to rebroadcast BBC 1 if that was what people, especially those people in the single channel area, seemed to want.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, there was considerable discussion about what people did want and I agreed to put the matter to the test of an opinion survey which was set up jointly by RTE and myself.  I also agreed that RTE should have an adequate opportunity to explain to the public the merits of its proposals of a second RTE service which would consist for about four-fifths of its time of broadcasting of programmes originating outside this country and mainly in Britain.</P>
    <P>When the opinion survey was carried out, it became clear that a clear majority of the sample taken favoured the RTE 2 as that concept was explained to the people who participated in the sample.</P>
    <P>I had undertaken before the survey was carried out that if it gave a clear result I would be guided by that result. It did in my opinion give such a clear result and I, accordingly, recommended to the Government that the second channel, the material for which is now being put in place, should be entrusted to RTE for use for the second RTE channel as described by it, as explained by it in its pamphlet <i>The Second Channel</i> and in its material submitted to the people who participated in the opinion survey.</P>
    <P>The Government are now committed to that and there is, therefore, no further need for the powers contained in section 6 which would have been necessary, in the opinion of the Government, were it clear that the demand was, in fact, for the retransmission of an outside service.</P>
    <P>The deletion of the section and the consequent amendments do not necessarily and logically follow from the Government decision.  It would have been possible to decide to give the second channel to RTE and nonetheless to retain these powers as possibly of service on some future occasion.  I decided not to act in that way, partly because of the objections that had been <Col N="350" /> raised to these particular powers in the Seanad and elsewhere and partly because I wanted to leave no doubt in the minds of the public or of the House of the Government's entire good faith in abiding by the best expression of public opinion on this matter which it could obtain.  It is for these reasons that I commend to the House the deletion of section 6 and the amendments consequential thereon, all of which are of matter which would have been necessary if section 6 was required and none of which is necessary if section 6 is removed.</P>
    <P>So, as Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Opposition spokesman on this, has indicated, it is all essentially a matter of section 6.  The amendments are consequential and technical matter and what we are really concerned with is the deletion of section 6.  As the opposition in the Seanad and in the country also took very strong exception to section 6, I would hope that its deletion will not here be an extremely contentious matter.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We are fully in agreement with taking the Minister's amendments together because it is obvious that some of them are of a very technical nature and they all have a bearing on the deletion of section 6.  I can assure the Minister that we welcome the deletion of section 6.</P>
      <P>Since the Bill was first introduced in the Seanad we have objected at all times to section 6.  In the protracted debate in the Seanad it was brought to the Minister's notice in no uncertain fashion, by various speakers, that this party objected to the fact that the Minister was taking this right unto himself to direct the authority to broadcast an outside broadcasting programme. In the past number of months we have put it forcibly to the people and to the Minister that we believe that a second Irish broadcasting channel is the best and most favourable type.  We made our views known over the past five months since the Bill was first introduced.  We could never agree to the handing over of a broadcasting station to an outside broadcasting company.  That is what the Minister proposed to do.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Excuse me&mdash;a broadcasting channel&mdash;to an outside broadcasting company.  The Minister was taking this right unto himself and he expressed the view on a number of occasions that the programme he would like was BBC 1.</P>
      <P>Not alone did we on this side of the House express dissatisfaction with the Minister's proposals but various organisations throughout the country, trade unions and the various organisations attached to the Minister's own party, expressed dissatisfaction and objected to the fact that the Minister was taking this right and giving the additional channel which is being built at this time to be utilised by BBC 1.</P>
      <P>The Minister carried out a survey on the matter and put it to the test. The result of that survey has proved conclusively that the Minister completely misjudged the pulse of the people.  That survey was conclusive evidence that the participants rejected the Minister's proposals as regards the rebroadcasting of BBC 1 and came down in favour of an Irish channel, in favour of RTE 2.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had got the pulse of the people and of his own backbenchers before the Bill was drafted, the Bill as introduced would not have contained section 6.  No one in this country would dream of handing over this valuable asset to an outside broadcasting company.  At the moment there is a considerable amount of money being spent on the second channel.  Before it is fully equipped the second channel will cost an amount in the region of £4 million.  This is taxpayers' money or money raised by loan on behalf of the taxpayer to be spent on buildings, installations and equipment for the second channel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was misguided in including a section such as section 6 in the Bill.  We put forward our proposals. <Col N="352" /> RTE in their own right, put forward their proposals.  We know now the result of the survey.  We put forward proposals for the retention here of the second channel.  We proposed the establishment of a programme council.  It was our intention to give representation on that council to that part of the country which is commonly called the single channel area.  We have several other amendments tabled to the Bill.  We propose enlarging the authority.  RTE made a strong case for control of the second channel.  They pointed out to the Minister in no uncertain fashion the adverse effect there would be on RTE were control to be vested elsewhere. There would be redundancies if the Minister went ahead with section 6 and handed the second channel over to the BBC.  All these points were made even before the survey was carried out and the Minister should have realised the serious consequences there would be within RTE had the survey gone in the Minister's favour.  Everyone is, I think, delighted the survey did not go in the Minister's favour.</P>
    <P>RTE also pointed out the fall in revenue that would inevitably take place if BBC 1 were broadcast in its entirety.  The Minister should have taken account of all these important factors before ever the survey was carried out.  These were factors which would affect the livelihoods of those at present employed in RTE.  The Minister's insistence on this particular section had the effect of weakening confidence.  I welcome the deletion of this section.  I said initially it should never have been there and we pointed that out on several occasions.  This survey was carried out in the single channel area and it was quite obvious early on in that area that the people were not prepared to hand over the second channel to BBC 1 when it was explained to them that this would not really give them any choice.</P>
    <P>We would like to see, and I hope the authority will consider this, a selection of programmes from BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV.  I believe RTE can provide this.  Our proposal contemplated <Col N="353" /> 20 to 25 per cent of home-produced programmes on the second channel.  These programmes would generate employment for actors, writers, technical staff and so on.  We believe studios should be established in the south and west.  This would be a move towards diversification, a move away from the Montrose complex. Whether one likes it or not, there is a feeling in the country that RTE is Montrose orientated.  I do not believe that myself and I have said so but, if the proposal we put forward to establish studios in Cork, Galway, Limerick and elsewhere were implemented, that feeling would no longer exist.  I think RTE have this in mind. I think they will make progress in studios elsewhere than in Montrose.</P>
    <P>These are very important factors which should be taken into account. The country is in a state of economic crisis.  The time has come to boost <Col N="354" /> morale.  Every semi-State body has difficulties.  Introducing this kind of section in a time of economic depression would only result in more redundancies.  We can ill afford that sort of evolution at this time.  Broadcasting BBC 1 would mean that people would get the same kind of programmes as they get at the moment because 40 per cent of RTE's programmes are broadcast from BBC 1.  RTE 2 will give a wider choice.  I should like RTE 2 to give quality programmes.  If I were to make a choice the last thing I would do would be rebroadcast BBC 1.  I believe BBC 2 produces better quality programmes.  So does UTV. There is a wide choice.</P>

    <P>So far as my Department are concerned consideration of the measures which will be necessary to ensure compliance with the EEC directive on waste is proceeding as part of a general review of the waste disposal functions of sanitary authorities.  The provisions of the directive have been brought formally to the notice of the sanitary authorities and, as a first step, I have requested them to consider what they can do at this stage towards advancing the aims of the directive in their areas. I have also made a number of suggestions <Col N="200" /> in this regard and have asked for information on the local arrangements and problems to facilitate the consideration of such further control measures as may be necessary.</P>

    <P>For many years past it has been the policy of my Department to discourage the use of organo-chlorinated pesticides generally in agriculture where suitable alternatives exist.  As a result their use has been progressively declining.  There are, however, some limited uses for which no satisfactory substitutes have yet been found but as there is no experimental or medical evidence that the handling or usage of such pesticides is injurious to man, it is considered that until suitable replacements are discovered <Col N="205" /> the benefits of their limited use in agriculture exceed the somewhat remote risks involved.</P>
    <P>So far as my Department are aware mirex is not used in this country.</P>

    <P>The European Council (of the heads of Government) did not draw up rules on the improvement of living and working conditions at the meeting of December, 1974.  I assume that the questions relate to the decision to set up the European Foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions.  Agreement in principle was reached at the Council of Social Affairs Ministers on 17th December, 1974, on a draft regulation to set up this foundation.  On 10th February, 1975, the Council decided to site the <Col N="210" /> foundation in Ireland.  The regulation setting up the foundation was formally adopted by the Council on 26th May, 1975.</P>

      <P>Vinyl chloride is not manufactured or polymerised in this country.

Inspectors of my Department have tested the atmospheres of such factories and so far all tests have proved negative. The indications so far are that our workers are not in danger, and that the existing provisions of the Factories Act, 1955 afford adequate protection having regard to the nature and extent of present industrial activity.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy's statement as to lack of progress made at the conferences which have been held on the law of the sea.</P>
      <P>The first UN Law of the Sea conference held in Geneva in 1958 was largely successful in the circumstances of that time and made considerable advances in adoption of four conventions on the complex subject of the law of the sea, including the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>This convention was signed on behalf of Ireland in 1958 and consideration was subsequently given to its ratification.  After careful examination of the convention it was considered that it contained provisions which might be interpreted as precluding states from establishing an exclusive fishery zone apart from and extending beyond the territorial seas. It became clear at a later stage that states which might have been expected to invoke these provisions to our disadvantage had established their own exclusive fisheries apart from the territorial sea and/or were parties to the London Fisheries Convention of 1964 which provided for such an exclusive fishery.  However, preparations for the third conference involving <i>inter alia</i> a general review of the law of the sea had by then commenced and it was decided to wait the outcome of the conference and its effect on existing conventions before becoming party to any convention on law of the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> As the Deputy must be aware, in view of the relevant European Community provisions on fishing it is not possible to give the assurances he asks. Under the Accession Treaty Ireland has been allowed to derogate from the obligation to afford equal conditions of access to fishing grounds to vessels from other member states until 31st December, 1982.  The Government will of course make every effort within the Community and in the context of the conference to ensure adequate opportunities for our fishermen not only to maintain but to expand their activities in the future, in particular by negotiating the most favourable terms for when the derogation expires in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 237 and 240 together.</P>
      <P>The position in July, 1973 was that no directives had been adopted by the European Communities to provide for the rights of establishment and freedom to provide services in the member states.  Since then, there have been a number of important developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two significant judgments have been delivered by the Court of Justice.  The first of these judgments was delivered on 21 st June, 1974 in the Reyners case (case No. 2/74), when the court ruled that Article 52 of the EEC Treaty concerning right of establishment is a directly applicable provision. The second judgment of importance was that delivered on 3rd December, 1974 in Case No. 33/74 known as the van Binsbergen case.  This case concerned the applicability of Articles 59 and 60 of the EEC Treaty.  Articles 59 of the treaty provides that restrictions <Col N="216" /> be progressively abolished during the transitional period in respect of nationals of member states who are established in a state of the Community other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.  Article 60 states that a person providing a service may temporarily pursue his activity in the state where the service is provided under the same conditions as are imposed by the state on its own nationals. The Court of Justice in its judgment ruled that Articles 59 and 60 of the EEC Treaty have direct effect and therefore can be relied on before national courts.  This is to say that beneficiaries under Articles 59 and 60 have the right of appeal to court if governments in the member states do not implement the provisions of these articles.</P>
    <P>It follows from the Reyners and van Binsbergen judgments that any Community provisions which relate exclusively to the abolition of discrimination on grounds of nationality have become superfluous.  Community action is still required, however, to secure the mutual recognition of qualifications among member states. The Commission and member states are working on a number of draft directives concerning mutual recognition of qualifications in the various professions.  With regard to the specific professions mentioned by the Deputy, the present situation is that the Commission is preparing draft directives on mutual recognition of auditors' qualifications; it has forwarded draft directives relating to qualifications of architects and lawyers which are currently under discussion in the appropriate Council working group.  Most important, two directives concerning mutual recognition of doctors' qualifications were approved by the Council at its meeting on 10/11th February, 1975 and were formally adopted on 16th June, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to criticisms of the decision to allocate part of the reserves of natural gas from the Kinsale Head field for the generation of electricity. The Deputy will appreciate that following the energy crisis of 1973-74, it was essential, having regard to our heavy dependence on imported oil, to ensure the greatest possible security of our sources of energy supply.  The allocation of approximately 72 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to the ESB will enable the board to provide generating capacity of about 500 megawatts that would otherwise have to be provided on the basis of imported oil.  This diversification in the fuel sources of the ESB, on the basis of our own natural gas, will effect a considerable improvement in the security of the board's generating capacity and will be a valuable safeguard against the effects of any future interruption in oil supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further consideration is that the enormous investment required to bring the gas ashore, and the need to remunerate this investment as early as possible at economic rates, made it imperative to find a ready market <Col N="220" /> with a high rate of offtake from the outset.  A market of this order could be provided only by allocating the gas to large-scale users such as the ESB and NET.  The demand for town gas at the current levels would not provide such a market and a rapid expansion of the gas industry to meet the scheduled date of delivery onshore would not be feasible.</P>
    <P>If there should be further finds of natural gas in substantial quantities, careful consideration will be given to all potential uses of the gas before decisions are taken as to the allocation of the gas.</P>

      <P>The answer to Questions Nos. 276 and 277 which it is proposed to take together is as follows.</P>
      <P>While I am not aware of any undue public alarm concerning the use in motor vehicles of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), I understand that research in Holland has shown that the use of LPG in motor vehicles does not constitute a particular hazard provided always that the appropriate equipment is properly installed and maintained.</P>
      <P>Regarding the use of LPG in public service vehicles to avoid lead pollution, the Deputy will be aware that many of the country's public service vehicles are propelled by diesel which, like LPG, is a lead-free fuel.  With regard to petrol driven vehicles, the question of change over to LPG is being kept under review, but information available at the moment suggests that conversion to diesel usage is more economical than conversion to usage of LPG and also that large scale conversion to LPG will lead to scarcity. It is not my intention, therefore, to take any measures designed to bring about a greater use of this product in motor vehicles, the main attraction of which would appear to be the fact that it is not at present liable to excise duty&mdash;a situation which is unlikely to be maintained in the event of any large scale change over from petrol to LPG.</P>

      <P>The volume of total OECD exports grew at a rate of only 7 per cent in 1974 as against 15 per cent in 1973.  In volume terms OECD exports are expected to show a decline of the order of 6 per cent in 1975 as compared with 1974.</P>
      <P>As might be expected Irish exports have also felt the effects of the recession and while they have continued to grow in both value and volume terms the rate of growth has slowed.  Our exports in value terms for the period January to October, 1975 grew by 28.1 per cent.  However, it is expected that the overall growth rate for 1975 in value terms will be of the order of 25 per cent.  Allowing for price increases this indicates a moderate growth in volume terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that by specifications the Deputy has in mind the standards specified in EEC directives.</P>
      <P>Irish manufacturers are consulted and kept informed throughout the process of the drawing up of European specifications of relevance to them in order to ensure that they are aware of the implications for them.  Their interests are taken into account in the formation of Ireland's attitude to each specification.  Should manufacturers need to adapt their plant equipment to meet the specifications the normal range of re-equipment grants is available to them from the Industrial Development Authority.  Technical advice can be had from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
      <P>The EEC directive in regard to aerosol dispensers was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 20th May, 1975.  Irish manufacturers, through the relevant trade association, were consulted during the examination of the draft directive.  Member states have 18 months from the date of notification of the directive&mdash;21st May, 1975&mdash;to bring into force the provisions necessary to ensure compliance with the directive.</P>

      <Col N="225" /> In accordance with the EEC Environment Programme the European Commission is pursuing studies on the pollution arising from certain industrial activities such as the iron and steel industry, petrochemicals and non-ferrous metals and in connection with fluoride and phosphate mineral resources. These studies cover world resources, geochemistry, environmental pollution, production, consumption and future needs on both world and Community levels.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the fact that Ireland as compared with the rest of the EEC has a very small portion of its labour force, 19 per cent, employed in manufacturing industry, and that the services sector is proportionately on a par with the rest of the EEC and in view of the decline in agricultural employment, he is satisfied that in order to absorb an expanding labour force, employment opportunities must be provided in manufacturing industry and if he is satisfied that Government policies are achieving this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of employment opportunities in manufacturing industry, as well of course as in other industry and in services, has been recognised by the Government as necessary, to absorb the expanding labour force and to relieve unemployment, and Government policies have been designed to achieve these objectives.  While these policies have been successful in securing the creation of substantial new employment opportunities in the last few years, the world wide economic recession has resulted in a large number of redundancies in existing employment. There is therefore a net decline in employment in manufacturing industry in the current year.  Every effort is <Col N="226" /> being made to remedy this situation by assisting firms that are encountering difficulties, and by urgently seeking new investment, both by Irish firms and foreign firms.  I am confident that as soon as economic conditions improve, we will return to the position where there is significant net job creation each year as a result of the Government's policies.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> The Land Commission carried out an inspection of the property referred to some time ago with a view to determining whether acquisition proceedings should be instituted. The case was held up owing to a difficulty in regard to title to portion of the lands.  This matter has now been resolved and it is expected that a decision as to acquisition will be made known shortly.</P>
