      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: No. 8 and, in No. 8, Vote 9 and Vote 42 (resumed).  By agreement it is proposed to pass the Office of Public Works Estimate without debate.  Questions will be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 5.0 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, in case there is any misunderstanding, I know the Whips have agreed that the reason for passing the Office of Public Works Vote without debate is because of the urgency of providing money for that particular office but that there is agreement that the debate will resume at an appropriate time after the completion of the Transport and Power Estimate debate on a Token Estimate for the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave under Standing Order 30 to move the adjournment of the Dáil for the purpose of discussing an important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the unprecedented increases sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in CIE passenger fares and freight charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for giving me notice of this matter yesterday evening.  I have considered the matter in the light of Standing Orders Nos. 30 and 48 and also the fact, as I have ascertained, that the decision to permit the increases <Col N="1454" /> in CIE fares was taken by the Government.  Standing Order 48 is quite specific: No Member may anticipate the discussion of any subject of which notice has been given and the Ceann Comhairle shall have regard to the probability of the matter anticipated being brought before the Dáil within a reasonable time.</P>
      <P>Under the Order of Business today, the main item, apart from Questions, is the Transport and Power Estimate which includes a substantial provision for CIE.  This Estimate, therefore, gives the House an opportunity today to discuss the CIE fare increases, approved by the Government, and due to come into effect next Monday.</P>
      <P>I may add that the informal committee on the reform of Dáil procedure recommended that any matter under Standing Order No. 30 should meet a number of criteria, one of which is that the matter is likely to develop significantly before the Dáil will have an opportunity of discussing it.  In this instance, I do not consider that this criterion has been met because, as I have indicated, the Dáil has in practice an opportunity to discuss the matter today on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  Indeed, a number of hours may be utilised today for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>You will notice, Sir, that the notice I gave did not refer to CIE policy.  It referred to the question of the sanctioning by the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the proposed increases.  This is a different Minister and a different Department. What we wish to discuss was the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was prepared to sanction an enormous increase in transport costs, both for passengers and freight, at a time when our inflation rate is the highest in Europe.  I do not think a discussion of matters of that kind is appropriate to the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power and, while I and none of us on this side of the House wish to quibble with your ruling, I must say that we protest most strongly at this ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was put down yesterday as a Private Notice Question by <Col N="1455" /> Deputy Barrett to the Minister for Transport and Power on the basis on which you have discussed it now in the ruling you have given.  I deliberately changed it to be a matter entirely within the competence of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; it is a question of sanctioning enormous increases which are having an appalling effect and creating more and more inflation at a time when inflation here is the highest in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Deputy disagrees with me but I am quite satisfied that the Estimate for Transport and Power is a proper vehicle for debating the matter.  I should add that I have indicated, and I am sure Deputy O'Malley heard my comment earlier, that this decision was not a decision by a particular Minister, the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Transport and Power.  It was, I understand, a decision by the Government as such.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>A decision by the Government on a matter of this nature is taken only when brought before the Government by the appropriate Minister. The Minister initiates the action taken by the Government in a very formal and set procedure.  While the ultimate responsibility rests with the Government the initial responsibility rests on the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this instance.  We are not debating the Estimate for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking for a debate now on a matter appertaining to the confidence and to the domain of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that is an inordinate price rise that will affect the people of the country right across the board, that will seriously affect the standard of living and will again give an impetus to the already too much spiralling inflationary process in this country.  It will have a disastrous effect on our economy.  May I say that there <Col N="1456" /> has been a tradition in this House among the Oireachtas staff, over which you preside, that if there is any easement of Standing Orders or procedures that easement is to be given in favour of the Opposition.  That is a long-standing tradition.  I deplore that you were at such pains here to express that easement in favour of the Government, and in favour of avoiding a debate on this crucial issue here this morning.</P>

      <P>There are many people in the country who unfortunately think that this Parliament is irrelevant and a farce.  If there were ever grounds for believing that, surely they have them in what has happened here this morning and in your decision.  If the Parliament of this country cannot debate in an orderly way, with the permission of the Chair, a most appalling increase in charges for public transport over the length and breadth of this country, why are we here?  What is the point of having us here?  Is it not reasonable for people to have contempt <Col N="1458" /> for us as an irrelevant institution?</P>

      <P>The situation, as I understand it, is that the Office of Public Works will need this money before June or at the very beginning of that month.  There will be absolutely no objection whatever to debating the Estimate, as it comes, provided we could be sure that we would find time to debate it adequately and finish with it before the end of this month.  There is no certainty of that, and accordingly I got agreement from the Opposition that this would be passed without debate and we would instantly put in a £10 Estimate to enable the Office of Public Works to be fully debated.  We were willing to put that in this morning.  The Parliamentary Secretary is here with his speech and can start this debate now.  We are willing to change the Order of Business this minute if it will suit the Opposition.</P>

      <P>The conversation between the Government and myself took place on the basis that I sought agreement because I understood the money was required before June or at the latest at the beginning of June <Col N="1462" /> just as every Department needs money and must get it voted.  If there could be any certainty that we would find time for an adequate Estimate debate &mdash;we have found very little time for Estimate debates since last Christmas because there was so much legislation &mdash;there would have been no reason to adopt this procedure but since we cannot be sure that a full Estimate debate can conclude by the end of this month this proposal was made by me and accepted by the Opposition but if they want a full debate they can have it immediately, starting now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening I tried to highlight the social and economic advantages of developing the large tracts of virgin bog in the west of Ireland. I pointed out the area of bog available for development and the many advantages that such development would bring to the west of Ireland, the employment it would give and the effect it would have on the morale of the people.  The survey carried out shows its suitability.  The development of those bogs has been under consideration for a long time. It is now time to act.  Their development is now being forced on us by economic circumstances but there may be a silver lining to the hardships caused by the increase in oil prices if we relearn the lesson preached by Griffith and de Valera, that it makes sound sense to spend a £ at home in Galway or any other part of Ireland rather than in the Persian Gulf.  There have been enough economic upsets in the past ten years throughout the world to convince anybody that with recurring cycles of scarcity and abundance, with fluctuations in prices of basic <Col N="1464" /> commodities, there is merit in a policy of developing what is ours.  By developing our bogs we not only make sure of our power supplies but we help our balance of payments and bring a measure of prosperity and happiness to areas that need it.</P>
      <P>Today, when even the Americans are turning to their native coal seams for power, we should look to our native resources.  The potential of our bogs is realised by Bord na Móna. What we need now is the will to harness such a native resource and to develop it to its maximum.  By doing this we provide ourselves with a cheap source of power.  We give a massive injection to the economy of an area of high emigration, we raise the morale of the people of the west of Ireland and all the time we are working towards providing a pool of land for the next generation to make farms viable.  We realise that today this costs money.  It is time the Government gave this massive injection of money to Bord na Móna to allow them to develop bogs in the west of Ireland and to give new life and employment to the people in that part of the country.  The Government have power to waive the interest rates due to the State for moneys lent to Bord na Móna.  I understand that the Turf Development Act, 1970 which permitted this waiver of interest rates has expired.  Naturally, if Bord na Móna have to pay this massive interest rate back to the State it will deplete their funds but the Government have power to extend the time of the present Act and to waive interest rates due to the State from Bord na Móna.  Such an act would relieve the bord of part of their responsibility to the State and it would enable them to develop the bogs in the west.  The Government have a duty to help them in this respect. If they have to pay this huge interest rate, it will deplete their funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned the problem of access roads to bogs.  Since the huge increase in oil prices domestic demand for turf has increased.  People who were inclined to use oil for heating when it was cheap would now use turf if access <Col N="1465" /> roads to bogs were made and maintained. I would ask the Minister to ensure that sufficient money is made available for this purpose.  There may be a difference of opinion as to whose responsibility such a scheme would be. The Minister for Transport and Power has a definite duty here.  He and the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce should ensure that the bogs are developed and that access roads are brought to a good standard.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the Land Commission had responsibility in this respect and a minor relief scheme grant was given every three years for the maintenance of these roads.  It is a pity that that was not allowed to continue.  Minor relief schemes provided valuable employment during the winter months and contributed to the maintenance of the roads.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have made and that he will play his part in ensuring that the bogs I have referred to in Galway and other western areas will be developed to the fullest possible extent.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Barrett's call for the establishment of an oil refinery.  This is of vital importance if we are to solve our energy problems.  I understand that Whitegate is capable of refining only 50 per cent of our oil requirements and that the remainder has to be imported, which leaves us at the mercy of the multi-national oil companies, and we know how little they care about us in time of crisis.</P>
    <P>There are great prospects of oil being discovered off our shores, and this should be an encouragement to the Government to build a refinery, otherwise any oil that is discovered would have to be sent abroad to be refined and then shipped back again.  This would add to the cost of the oil and would increase the price to the consumer, about whom we should all be concerned.  There is a very strong case for the establishment of another oil refinery.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ESB, rural Deputies occasionally come across cases where a special service charge is imposed.  In <Col N="1466" /> some cases the charge can amount to £1,000 and more.  I have known one case where a service charge of £1,200 was demanded.  I realise that the ESB are carrying out a development programme area by area, but there are cases where people who live a distance from the public road are deprived of electricity supply.  The Government have a duty to come to the assistance of these people and to ensure that they get a supply of electricity to which they are as entitled as the person who is fortunate enough to live beside a main road or in a town or city.  There is no reason why people should be penalised because of the place where they live.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to have the special service charge included in the monthly bill rather than payable in a lump sum.  This facility was afforded some years ago but I understand that it has been discontinued.</P>
    <P>In certain areas people complain that the supply is not sufficient to enable them to work milking machines and other equipment.  The ESB have a duty to ensure that the power is sufficient for the operation of modern appliances which make life easier on the land.  The ESB have a clear duty to ensure that transformers are erected that are capable of supplying the necessary current.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about conservation of electrical power but in many public buildings one notices lights left on day and night, and street lights in many towns are left on at all times of the day and night.  Somebody must have the responsibility to see that the lights are switched off at the proper time and that every effort is made to save electricity.  Public bodies have a duty to give a lead in this respect.</P>
    <P>A great deal of criticism was expressed this morning in regard to CIE fares.  It would be wrong of me to conclude without referring to them. These increases in fares will affect every man and woman in the country in some way.  It is disastrous that at a time of rampant inflation the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have sanctioned such a huge increase in fares, bus fares by 33? per cent and rail fares by 25 per cent.  This will add <Col N="1467" /> to the huge burden of costs on industries. It will make life more difficult for them to maintain employment, particularly in the west of Ireland where the finished products have to be transported to the east for export or to some other distribution centre.  I have made the suggestion here before that industries in the west should be subsidised or that their products should be transported free, in order to help to maintain employment.  Trains often travel from the west half empty and I do not think it would cost CIE any great additional amount to facilitate industries that are hard-pressed at the present time.  I want to protest at the huge increases in train and bus fares.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion I referred to the rail service on the western line, particularly the Westport line, which is the one that I use almost every week coming to Dublin.  Super-trains are running on other lines but I have not seen any super-train on the Westport line.  I am glad that the Minister is here this morning.  I have mentioned this matter to him before.  I hope that within the next few weeks a super-train will be operating on the Westport line. Other Mayo Deputies agree with me that we are entitled to the same facilities as are available to people from other parts of the country.  I have travelled on these super-trains.  They are very comfortable.  I hope that in the near future people from Mayo and that part of North Galway who use that line will have a super-train available to them.</P>
    <P>The catering service available on those lines could be improved.  I know it is not possible to do everything at once.  Perhaps if we get the super-trains I mentioned our problems will be solved.  I hope the Minister will look into those points and that he will give us the same facilities which have been afforded to other citizens in other parts of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to say that our area is the major tourist centre. This means a lot to our economy.  We have a lot to offer.  We have a way of life which foreigners like.  We have a tranquil way of life.  Tranquility is <Col N="1468" /> needed nowadays and we have it to offer at no charge.</P>
      <P>I have often raised here the question of weather forecasts.  We hear about &ldquo;rain now moving from the west&rdquo; when, more often than not, we are basking in sunshine.  That type of forecast tends to drive people away from the west.  This affects tourism in our area.  In Dublin there is the facility of a six-hour weather forecast.  In a major tourist area I do not see why we should not have the same facility on the telephone.</P>
      <P>I hope that peace will soon prevail in the North, and not merely because of the way it is affecting us but generally speaking.  At the same time it does affect tourism.  We should hope and pray that peace will be restored before very long.</P>
      <P>Many years ago I warned the House about our use of oil.  We are putting all our eggs in one basket.  I asked why CIE had done away with all their steam engines and I was told that was progress and forward thinking.  I said that if there was an oil crisis in the morning they would not be able to shunt or go forward.  Have CIE made any provision to meet a real crisis? Thank God we are surrounded by water as the song says.  I hope we are surrounded by oil as well, but that is in the long-term.  We have seen advertisements about tigers in our tanks, but now we have not even got a mouse in our tanks.</P>
      <P>Another thing which strikes me is the question of waste.  Heat is wasted in cooling towers around the country at turf-burning stations.  Why not use it to heat adjoining houses and provide domestic water or central heating?  Why not consider kiln drying of corn and grain?</P>
      <P>We hear a lot of talk about oil rigs. The Killary area in Galway would be very suitable for an oil rig.  I understand people were interested in this. If the facilities are offered I should like to see full co-operation coming from the Department of Lands, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Transport and Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1469" /> There should be more co-ordination. These Departments are so isolated that they have to write letters to each other instead of picking up the telephone.  In the Killary area we have the deepest water off the west coast.  You can launch out your oil rigs.  It may be said that if we build up a labour force of a couple of thousand men we may end up in a Klondike situation, but we should make hay while the sun shines.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers who talked about the use of turf.  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries hire turf-cutting machines and the Department of Transport and Power use turf-cutting equipment through Bord na Móna.  There is need for more co-operation and co-ordination in getting things moving.  Having an open fire is an Irishman's way of life. In our town we have what are known as Molloy's follies.  He was the Minister who built houses without chimneys, and people are crippled with the cost of heating them with either oil or electricity.  They are running out of those houses because they cannot afford to stay in them. People cannot sit around a radiator. There is nothing like an open fire.</P>
    <P>Talking of waste, we see bulldozers knocking down buildings and the finest of firewood and timber being sent to dumps.  Something should be done about this waste.  Last year a lot of low quality coal came into the country, coal of a very low calorific value.  Anything is good enough for us.  We have enough stones without importing coal dotted with stones.  The Minister should examine the price of turf briquettes.</P>
    <P>Have we turned our backs on the question of harnessing the tide?  We have been thinking too big and we appear to have a nuclear mentality for the generation of energy but every nook and cranny along our coastline could be harnessed.  Off the west coast there are many places suitable for this. I am aware that the improvement of roads to bogs is a matter for the Department of Local Government but the Minister for Transport and Power should prepare a crash programme for the purpose of opening up our bogs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> Many sea and river craft now in use are made of plastic and under certain conditions are dangerous.  The inflated craft used by children at seaside resorts are also dangerous.  On many occasions they were swept out to sea.  Can the Minister do anything either to prevent or control the use of such craft particularly where there is a danger of children being carried out to sea?  Are the canoes used on our rivers and lakes equipped to cope with an emergency so as to ensure that when the occupant gets into difficulty he will not drown? Is there a control on these craft and who is responsible?  Too many have lost their lives when using such craft.</P>
    <P>Our total dependence on oil has caused the greatest headache we have had for many years and in my view it has arisen because we were too lazy to cut a few sods of turf.  Thank God I say the day when people made their own slanes.  During the war years it was not possible to purchase a tyre for a bicycle but I made a solid tyre out of a lorry tyre.  I got to my destination but I wonder if the challenge was put to the youth today would they be able to face up to it.</P>
    <P>Every aspect of our energy should be probed.  Some things may appear small to the Department but little things mean a lot.  We should reopen the roads to the bogs but I wonder if we have the turf-cutting equipment to meet the great needs of the day. Another problem is that many houses do not have fireplaces in which to burn solid fuel.  I do not want to see any more of &ldquo;Molloy's follies&rdquo; as we had throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister treated the energy crisis as his first priority because this affects our lives. It is now clear that we must be self-sufficient in the refining of oil.  If we were we could reduce considerably our national oil bill of £200 million per year.  This party's spokesman on Transport and Power put forward the suggestion that another oil refinery should be established so that we would be self-sufficient in years to come and I hope this will not be ignored.  I had hoped that the Minister would give us details of a comprehensive and far-reaching <Col N="1471" /> energy policy but he does recognise the importance of development of our turf resources.  One of the biggest underdeveloped bogland areas in the country is in my constituency, the Derryfodder bogland area which comprises 14,000 acres and stretches from Ballyforan to Ahascragh and from Glenamaddy to Creggs and Mount Bellew.</P>
      <P>The Minister should provide the money necessary for the development of this area.  He should ensure that a power station is built in the Ballyforan area.  The erection of such a station would be in keeping with the ESB's programme to maximise the contribution of native energy sources. A station in that area would provide much needed employment.  To build a power station in a bogland area would be more economical in the long-term, especially in view of the great transport costs involved in bringing milled peat to the existing stations in the midlands.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider making grants available for the development of bog roads.  The only scheme at present in operation for the improvement of such roads is the local improvements scheme but not enough money is made available to the county councils to repair them. This is frustrating and hindering development.</P>
      <P>Joint development of the bogs in my constituency by Bord na Móna and the ESB would provide employment for those living in Ballyforan, Ballygar, Athleague, Taughmaconnell, Ahascragh and Lecarrow. Approximately 500 people in those towns receive unemployment assistance and there are many small farmers who could avail of part-time employment.  I hope there will be proper planning in the development of all bogland areas.  The environment should be protected also.  I should like to compliment Bord na Móna on availing of the services of the Inland Fisheries Trust to monitor the operations in my constituency in order to protect the fishing interests there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister <Col N="1472" /> did not see fit to deal with the affairs of CIE since December when this House approved an additional subvention to meet the company's deficit.  The decision to develop an over all railway system may be good but it has caused alarm in many western towns.  The people feel that their railway stations may be downgraded in status.  Because of the social and industrial needs in the west these stations should be upgraded.  I am glad CIE have arranged discussions with the trade unions and I hope they will listen to the local bodies.  The increase in the price of petrol last December affected all rural workers but CIE should have taken the initiative to promote their services.  If the Government are serious about tackling inflation they should not have sanctioned the recent increase in CIE charges.  During the present by-election campaign in Galway I met many young people who were thinking of giving up their employment because of the travelling costs involved in commuting to their jobs.  Some help should be given to these commuters.</P>
    <P>In the west of Ireland there is a great demand for transport.  As a result of a survey carried out by the Tuam Town Commissioners and the Tuam Community Council it was established there was a great demand for direct public transport to Dublin and Galway and a need for a daily bus service to Galway for workers and students.  There is a similar need for transport in other areas.  For example, there is need for a service from Loughrea via Craughwell to Galway. I have written to the area manager of CIE suggesting that this service be provided and that it should leave Loughrea at a suitable time for workers and students who attend the schools, college and the university in Galway.  As many Deputies have pointed out, there may be a need for smaller vehicles or minibuses, providing a better and more economic service.  There have been many complaints about school transport and there has been overlapping in many areas.</P>
    <P>The general public are not sufficiently informed about existing passenger <Col N="1473" /> and commercial services provided by CIE.  This indicates a failure on the part of CIE to sell their services to the public, but the onus is on them to seek business.  In the aftermath of the oil crisis the resultant rise in the price of petrol put CIE in a more advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> private transport.  This should be of particular advantage to railway passenger and commercial services.  A recent survey in America disclosed that railways there are enjoying an unexpected revival because of that country's energy problems.</P>
    <P>Air transport must be improved if we are to help tourism.  There seems to be a division of aims in Aer Lingus between what is good for the company and what is good for the country, and this will have to be resolved.  Sometimes Aer Lingus have put the interests of the company before those of the country.  This will keep tourists away from Ireland when we desperately need foreign currency. It must be remembered that earnings from tourism filter through the economy. If hotels are full, this benefits not only the hotel industry but it also increases employment.  In addition, hotels and restaurants will buy larger quantities of food and this will benefit local traders, farmers and the community in general.</P>
    <P>It appears that tourism as an industry is in danger of being forgotten. The earnings from tourism are vital. While Irish people holidaying in Ireland help to circulate money and also cut down on money spent abroad, the national problem cannot be eased by the movement of money from one part of the country to another.  We need foreign tourists bringing foreign currency into the country.  The arrangements for the tourists should be geared to meet their demands rather than creating activity and then hopefully looking for a market.  What is needed is more authority for the regional boards and more information regarding the needs of foreign tourists. Then a decision should be made on what aspects of the potential market are best suited for the areas involved.</P>
    <P>For instance, research might be carried out to examine the question <Col N="1474" /> of the vacant cottages which dot the countryside.  If grants were made available to repair and restore those cottages they would prove relatively easy to rent through the regional boards.  The success of rented cottages in groups has been proved in various parts of the country.  The attraction of the single cottage in areas of great beauty might even be more desirable for European and American holiday-makers. The problem is to find places that are not overcrowded.</P>
    <P>It is vital that Bord Fáilte give more authority to the regional boards because these people know the most suitable arrangements to support in their own area.  If marketing research reports from Bord Fáilte were added to local knowledge we might achieve results far in excess of anything done in the past.  Bord Fáilte have done great work for the west of Ireland and the area manager, Mr. Lally, and his staff are to be congratulated on their efforts.  Tourism is our third largest industry but there is a danger that we will price ourselves out of the market.  In a 42-page speech, the Minister devoted only four pages to tourism. He does not appear to give it the attention it deserves.</P>
    <P>Hoteliers, particularly the owners of small hotels, are facing many problems with regard to rising prices. Increases in the price of petrol, cigarettes, drink and food as well as electricity charges have had an impact on hotel charges.  All of us have felt the impact of the ESB charges.  It is ironic that although the Minister asked us to conserve energy and promoted an advertising campaign to that effect, he now tells us that because there has been a down-turn in demand we will have to pay more. The Government are not clear about their policy and the public are confused about how they can co-operate with the Minister.</P>
    <P>New ideas are called for as regards transport energy and tourism.  Because a project may have been successful in Europe does not guarantee its success here.  What has been found successful on the east coast of Ireland may not be successful on the west.</P>
    <P>I believe we should cultivate native <Col N="1475" /> and local resources in the various areas and all that is indigenous to those areas.  I hope the Minister will listen to Deputies on both sides of the House, to area managers and interested bodies, in putting those ideas into effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I first take the opportunity of complimenting Deputy Kitt on a speech which I believe may well have been his maiden one. I compliment him on his presentation and wish him well in his sojourn in this House.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power and of referring straight away to the Minister's speech, a large portion of which is concerned with the issue of energy, which is very topical at present.  Obviously it is topical because, for a small country such as ours, a situation in which there is an increase in cost to the nation of an additional £130 million as a result of what is termed the oil crisis is indeed a crisis for this country and is the major factor in the entire issue of inflation and all aspects of the economy about which we are disturbed at present.  Whilst there is a good deal of pessimism abroad throughout the Western world because of this issue, we need to emphasise the positive and look at the areas in which opportunity lies for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to the question of oil resources off our own shores.  With the opportunity that this Estimate presents to us, it is important to comment on the distinct possibilities there are for a contribution to the Exchequer from Irish off-shore oil.  I realise there were frustrations for some time because the relevant Minister had not published the terms on which licences might be issued. However, having said that, he had problems which affected more than his own Department; they were matters which affected the Department of Finance, the Attorney-General, very substantial matters requiring fundamental consideration. The basis on which licences are being <Col N="1476" /> granted has struck a very fair balance, taking into account the interests of our people, at the same time pitching it in such a way that opportunity is presented for commercial activity at a substantial level by the necessary interests.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out also&mdash; again, relative to the off-shore oil issue&mdash;that sometimes the Government were being blamed for the fact that oil is not physically coming on-shore in this country at present as it is in Norway or in Scotland in the North Sea venture.  In this regard it is important to point out that oil is physically coming on-shore in Scotland and in Norway at present as a result of decisions made by the relevant Governments eight, nine or ten years ago.  Therefore, from the point of decision by Government, through all the stages of research and development until ultimately oil flows is a matter of years.  The present Government are in no way responsible for that fact.</P>
    <P>Having said that, it is time we took an optimistic stance and informed the general public of the enormous possibilities existing.  For example, I believe the public should be aware that, in Norway&mdash;which is on the Gulf Stream, on the Continental Shelf; which is a small country with a population somewhat equal to ours&mdash;the value of off-shore oil and gas to the economy is estimated to run at a level of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the gross national product of the country in a couple of years' time. This is the most colossal single input into that economy.  In Britain, a country of vast resources at present experiencing serious difficulties, the contribution of North Sea oil holds out enormous possibilities.  Where we are concerned&mdash;some people who know about oil suggest there is not the scope here that exists in Norway and Scotland.  But it is important to put certain matters into perspective. We need to find merely a fraction of the discoveries of Norway and Scotland to have a most dramatic effect on our economy.  When we take into account the much smaller gross national product of this country, the <Col N="1477" /> situation is such that we would merely require approximately one-fifth of the volume of oil which it is estimated exists off the Norwegian coastline for a similar input here.  If this development continues&mdash;as seems likely at present&mdash;in a couple of years' time we shall see the commencement of possibly a very happy adventure which could be of the most enormous import to this country, will allow the Government to use this resource very sensibly&mdash;initially, presumably, to offset the weakness in the balance of payments as a result of the deficit from the fuel crisis but, additionally, to capitalise on it in a different sense &mdash;in export industries, directing refined products for export and export industries in the petro-chemical area. Indeed, the prospects are such, that where Britain is concerned, it is estimated that in perhaps five or ten years' time Britain, from the North Sea, would have the capacity to provide western Europe with half of its entire oil needs at 1980 levels.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the midst of all the gloom at present it is necessary to be positive, to look to our opportunities and grasp the significance of this question of off-shore oil.  I am particularly happy that this type of activity is happening in the west and south-west of the country because, as it continues to develop, it will be a very useful shot in the arm to proper development of regions within the country.  I am not too worried that possibly we have been a little slow in tackling this matter.  It is in a different category from any other types of industry, in that it is a wasting resource; there is just so much of it there.  It is arguable when one should start and finish.  Having regard to the inflation that has occurred, if we can now get this off the ground we are not, in any sense, too late.  We have the particular advantage here of having seen the experiences in Scotland, the North Sea, off the Norwegian coastline; having seen many of the mistakes made in regard to designs of rigs, work procedures, and in particular, in regard to safety procedures, because in that respect we have seen, in both of those countries, a considerable loss of life. It would seem to me that there is great opportunity open to us at present <Col N="1478" /> for a lesser level of expenditure on research and development because so much more knowledge is available in fairly similar waters.  Additionally, on the safety factor, we have a great deal to learn.  I hope that this new chapter will be of major benefit to us.  Estimates exist in regard to the actual resource. My view&mdash;and I think it is the view of many people&mdash;is that one simply does not know what is under the ground until one commences drilling. But even if we discover an oil resource at a minimal level&mdash;as I said earlier&mdash;relative to our gross national product, in itself, that can be very significant and it is possible it may be very much more than we imagine at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the approach of the Government and the Minister, who discussed the setting-up of a National Gas Board.  Also, in the oil area, I welcome the fact that a similar type of board is envisaged and will be set up by the Government for over-all supervision of our proposed oil activities in the nation's interest.</P>
    <P>While still speaking on the subject of energy, I should like to join Deputy Hussey and Deputy Kitt in speaking about turf and bogs.  In terms of energy, it seems to me that turf is still a very substantial resource here, particularly in the part of the country in which I live.  But certain anomalies exist at present.  We are told that energy is very important, that it must not be wasted.  We are told we must use native resources in industry to the greatest extent possible.  But the anomalies are that we are not tackling it to the degree we should be doing.  I realise that Bord na Móna has a scheme for the development of bogs for fuel purposes.  I realise they announced a programme last year of planning an expenditure of over £20 million.  In so far as my constituency is concerned, might I say we are not satisfied&mdash;the announcement by Bord na Móna applies practically entirely to the Midlands and other parts of the country but apparently they do not have any plans for development, of any significance, for bogs in the west.</P>
    <P>There may be good reasons for this <Col N="1479" /> from their point of view.  Possibly some of them do not lend themselves to the degree of mechanisation possible in the Midlands but there are vast expanses of bogs in counties like Mayo, like Ballycroy and Erris, which are starved of development.  You have these energy resources in the bogs and a high level of unemployment and we should be capitalising on these bogs to a greater extent, thereby bringing about a reduction in our balance of payments because of the greater use of native fuel.</P>
    <P>There are two specific points.  There is a measure of mechanisation available. The Sugar Company in Tuam has developed machines for cutting turf in bogs like these.  Unfortunately the number is very limited and they are not available to those who would gladly use them.  This should be a top priority if we are serious about getting our bogs cut and creating more employment opportunities.  We should get down very rapidly to increasing the numbers of these machines and disseminating more knowledge about such machines among the general public in the areas to which I refer.</P>
    <P>Concomitant with this are bog roads.  There is not a sufficient level of investment to build these roads or, having built them, to maintain them at a reasonable level.  By default, therefore, turf is not being cut in some areas because it is not possible to utilise tractor transport on the roads.  If native fuel is a priority then these roads are very important.  I know that under the local improvements scheme local authorities may spend part of the fund on such roads. However, pressures are great in other areas.  In Mayo there is a very high proportion of roads which come under local improvements schemes.  They lead to private dwelling houses and they are obviously of the highest priority.  There are applications in the local office for roads and drainage schemes amounting to something like £1,500,000 and the country got only £100,000 for the whole of this year. There is a case for having another look at bogs, at the development of <Col N="1480" /> machines for cutting turf and the building up of roads.  Funds for these purposes will have to come from an entirely different source if we are to get the growth that seems to be feasible.</P>
    <P>I know the ESB are keen on Carnsore Point as the site of the proposed nuclear power station.  I am aware that investigations are taking place.  I am also aware that there has been substantial objection by the community in that area.  I do not know what the present position is or whether the station will be sited in that area, but I should like to mention that there was interest in this power station in the Bangor Erris area.  That interest is still there if there is any change of plan with regard to Carnsore Point.</P>
    <P>Numerous representations have been made for an extension to Bellacorrick power station in North Mayo.  It has been said that this is not feasible because of the amount of bog available. Some local people dispute this view.  The matter is worthy of re-examination.</P>
    <P>Rural electrification constitutes a special problem in west Mayo.  The population is limited and there are vast expanses of land with very few houses.  Most areas have been successfully connected but there are a few outlying districts in which electricity has not been provided and in which it is becoming increasingly difficult to provide it because of the economics of the situation, especially having regard to inflation.  I discussed the matter with the Minister in relation to Ballycroy.  There the people got quotations for connection.  There were no fewer than three charges involved and they were all extremely high.  Some were at a level of £1,000 per house.  The land is poor and incomes are low and the charges quoted are beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  Presumably inflation will go on escalating and these people will obviously never have electricity.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me that he is at present examining the position and the examination is nearing completion. <Col N="1481" /> If electricity is to be provided in these areas it will require very substantial subsidy.  That might well be in the national interest.  There are very few areas which have not been connected and, if this area continues to be neglected, there will be a festering sore.  Electricity is a basic commodity. We are looking to the future and it has to be remembered that young people in this consumer society will not live in these areas unless their living standards equate in some degree with those of the rest of the country. If something is not done the Minister and his successors will have an insuperable problem on their hands.  We should take the bit between our teeth and subsidise electricity connection in these areas by means of a crash programme. Socially that would be very good policy.  It could lead to further development.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister his responsibility for CIE.  However, we are all aware of the level of inflation and we are all aware of the losses incurred by CIE over the years.  The losses at the moment are really staggering, but there are good reasons for these losses.  Public transport is an essential social service.  The board of management is a good board.  The level of employment is high.  Because of inflation losses have escalated and considerable disquiet has been caused. In the private sector if industries, services and shops had to face this type of escalating costs situation survival would not be possible.  I do not know what the answer is.  I do not envy the Minister.  The Opposition will attempt to make capital out of the issue, as they tried to do this morning, but it is political capital in the sense that they do not have any solution to this problem and it is good fun in opposition to attack an area about which there is disquiet.</P>
    <P>I believe part of the answer to lessen the level of public disquiet is a different method of parliamentary control of the semi-State bodies.  I believe this is basic to the particular issue we are talking about.  Over the years we have seen a very high growth in the proportion of activity in the <Col N="1482" /> national budget in relation to semi-State bodies.  I imagine this has gone to an infinitely greater degree than was envisaged by the Governments of the time such institutions were started. It has reached a stage where there is a very high level of activity in semi-State bodies and we have the present inadequate method of parliamentary access to information for debate so that power in many important areas of this country resides outside the House.</P>
    <P>I believe this is a basic and fundamental problem.  Where the National Coalition Government are concerned one of the major reforms which they can effect is a speedy implementation of the view articulated by the Minister for the Public Service when he spoke about the issue of semi-State companies, their place in society and their method of responsibility to the people. I believe it is essential to pursue this matter vigorously.  Obviously the means by which this work can be done is the creation of sub-committees of the House.  We should have them for different areas of responsibility where semi-State bodies are concerned.  Such sub-committees would engage in dialogue with the chief executive officers of the semi-State bodies on an annual basis.  If we get this type of <i>rapport</i> going between the semi-State bodies and the Dáil such dialogue would show that justice is seen to be done.  I know that justice is done at present because there is a high level of efficiency in many semi-State bodies but at the same time the possibility of parliamentarians questioning, engaging in such dialogue and probing in areas where there is public dissatisfaction would be of immense benefit to the parliamentary system.  I believe this is a matter which should be pursued vigorously.  I believe we should be able to get beneath the surface to a much greater degree than merely reading the annual reports and occasionally questioning particular Ministers or having limited opportunities on Estimate debates.  It would be of great benefit to everybody.  If the public are disturbed about certain issues there is a forum where such discussions can take place.  The fact that <Col N="1483" /> such a committee system exists might prove to be a limiting factor in the running of such State bodies.  This should be pursued for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus are under the Minister's responsibility.  We sometimes see semi-State bodies assuming functions in something for which in many cases they were not originally designed and which do not relate to their terms of reference.  In some cases such developments are useful from a commercial point of view but I believe we are beginning to lose parliamentary control if this can run amok and if we see such developments happening without the type of dialogue I am speaking about.  Aer Lingus have been extremely successful. They have been able to offset the problems they have had during the year, in common with other airlines in Europe and the world, by a successful programme of investment based on foreign borrowing, to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>If such a semi-State body are getting involved outside the country, in external borrowing and in ancillary activities, which do not relate to their primary functions, this is something which is part of the business of the House.  The House and the people could be very usefully served by the committee system to which the Minister for the Public Service previously referred.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to Bord Fáilte.  I would like to compliment them for the report they issued for the year ending March, 1974, and for the factual manner in which they presented it.  Unfortunately in some instances there are cases where the gloss is a little bit too bright and we are not getting beneath the surface and questioning sufficiently the flaws in the particular area of responsibility. The report of Bord Fáilte is in a different vein.  It looks at the whole issue of the environment, hygiene, standards, the matters of importance which we have to sell and the areas in which there is disquiet. It is an excellent production.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat prejudiced in favour <Col N="1484" /> of the board because I come from a part of the country where tourism is of vital interest.  It is of greater interest than in many other areas of the country.  We do not have the farmlands of the south or the industrial development in parts of the east or south.  In the midst of the beauty of west Mayo tourism is a very important arm in our economy.  I would like to compliment Bord Fáilte for the work they have carried out in liaison with their regional officers and with the local interests and the various tourist associations.</P>
    <P>A major project in Westport is the new golf club, which has been supported by Bord Fáilte, and which the Taoiseach is coming to visit next month.  This development is a great act of faith in the future.  I believe it will be a tremendous boost to a very substantial area around the town of Westport.  Whilst costs have been high we got in before the very high level of inflation.  Land was bought at a reasonable price and the project in question would probably have cost at least double or even treble what it did cost if it were started now.</P>
    <P>While speaking about Westport there are one or two things I would like to have looked at in the context of the town.  Bord Fáilte in their report referred to the necessity of giving priority to marketing.  They spoke about our environment, scenery and the fact that this is basic to tourism but there is another side to this.  There is more to tourism than scenery, lakes, rivers and mountains. I remember at a market research survey in New York a couple of years ago, conducted on behalf of another European country, many Americans were asked why they were coming to that country.  They were given a list of 50 different items which contained items in their capital city, matters relating to their poets and authors and scenery, lakes, rivers and mountains.  Surprisingly at the bottom of that list was scenic beauty and highest on it were matters which were indigenous, such as possibly West-minster Abbey in London or the Louvre in Paris, and specific matters of entertainment such as, Bunratty, <Col N="1485" /> in County Clare.  I believe you need to build up your centres, you need to provide entertainment and you need this catalyst to develop tourism at a greater level.  Westport is a growing tourist centre which a decade ago started very successfully an international sea-angling festival which attracts people from all over Europe. We have a major golf course which will prove to be one of the best five or six in the whole country.  We have an annual horse show which is the largest in Ireland outside Ballsbridge. Westport is a touring centre between Connemara and Achill and is on Clew Bay with its 300 islands.  In the bay itself there are enormous possibilities for sailing development and water skiing.  I would like to see the board looking at the town a little further with a view to arranging in conjunction with local interests better forms of entertainment.  We have seen the Bunratty development in Clare. We have seen similar developments in north Clare and west Galway and we have seen support by the board in Tralee for native entertainment.  I would like to see them specifically looking to Westport because it is a town that has all these other features but needs this type of facility to round off what has already been happening there.</P>
    <P>I know there is a conventions bureau which is doing very useful work in attracting conventions to this country but I would like Bord Fáilte to take a look at Westport in this regard because the town, on its own initiative, has been attracting a number of annual conferences of Irish organisations.  I would like the board to look at this question and to the needs of people who attend the conventions in regard to facilities, audiovisual aids and matters such as that.</P>
    <P>The third point I want to mention in relation to the area refers to Clew Bay and its possibilities for sailing. The board have supported a small venture regarding dinghy boats and sail training.  I gather that the Glenns, the sailing people who have been in Baltimore in west Cork, are now coming up and have bought part of one of the islands, which is an excellent <Col N="1486" /> development.  This bay with over 300 islands which provides the most sheltered water between Donegal and west Cork and is of all the points on the west coast, one of the nearest to Dublin, offers tremendous possibilities in the water sports area which should be investigated.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the Erris region, Belmullet in particular because interests there have expressed the view that a tourist resort hotel should be built in the vicinity which has been promoted by the local development association.  It is in the centre of an enormous area the size of County Louth and, looking at the resources that there are in the region in terms of hotels and comparing it with any other part of the west coast from Donegal to west Cork, it is the least developed.  I know that due to the restraints on the kitty at present the brakes have had to be put on, and very reasonably, because we have had over-hotel development in many parts of the country.  The emphasis of Bord Fáilte in giving priority to marketing and putting the funds into marketing in the short term is very sensible, but I would make the plea to the Minister and to Bord Fáilte if a sensible project is put forward from the north Mayo region, which is an enormous region, to look at it as an entirely different issue because of the need for home holidays, for the rental of cottages, people coming back from England, the holding of functions which at present are going to towns 50 and 60 miles away.  It is in a different category examined by any standards of national priority, and, again, if the project is sensible they should look at it as an exceptional project and judge it on its merits rather than in terms of a blanket national policy.</P>
    <P>Having referred to Bord Fáilte's priority for marketing, with which I agree, I should like to compliment the Minister on his activity with the board. Ministers can spend a great deal of time in their own country, attending functions and generating a great deal of publicity which may redound to their personal advantage, but much work is done outside the country which is unsung and about which people <Col N="1487" /> know very little and which is a hard grind.  I would like to compliment the Minister.  He was criticised today for the brevity of the section of his speech dealing with Bord Fáilte, but I would like to compliment him on the personal initiative he has taken in spending a very considerable portion of his time in the last few months travelling outside the country in the interests of Bord Fáil, emphasising the advantages of holidaying in this country.  He has done an excellent job in that area.  His very presence on this type of work is an effective answer to anybody who suggests that the Minister or the Government are not interested in tourist development.</P>
    <P>I am interested to note in Bord Fáilte's report the degree to which the campaign in Britain was successful.  In a sense we should have been doing this much earlier.  It is a little sad that it was only with the down turn in tourist revenue as a result of the crisis in the North that we began to look to the terrific opportunities there were in encouraging our own people in Britain to come here to a larger degree.  Prior to that we tended to take our own people for granted.  They swelled the tourist revenue and the tourist statistics but we tended to take them for granted. Possibly it was the crisis that provoked the board to become more active here, but at least it is happening, and I am glad to note the degree to which the board has tackled the English market and the degree to which they have been supported by the regional offices and representatives of tourist groupings in the different towns.  This has proved very successful, but it is also important in areas that do not directly relate to tourism.  The people in Britain are very much our people.  We have a responsibility to them as we do to the people who live in this country.  Greater rapport and greater communication is helping and has proved to be very beneficial.  I witnessed in London at one or two dinners and functions arranged for Mayo people the in-depth work being carried out by the board, by Aer Lingus, by B &amp; I and other agencies.  They are to be complimented on that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1488" /> Air travel has been mentioned.  If there is to be a substantial increase in tourism in the west it will be of vital importance to get some air links moving in.  We are saying this against a background which is not very successful because some ventures which have taken off the ground have not been that successful.  At the same time the priority in the west is high because we are probably the most remote from any large airport and the standard of our roads is poor by international standards. Until we reach the stage where we can fly, possibly on a chartered basis, medium to small aircraft, we are missing a large sector of the market. The airport in Castlebar has done useful work but the length of the runway is not sufficient for the type of planes about which I am talking.  I would welcome a further review of the situation by the Department of Transport and Power to see what can be done or if it is possible to have a type of development there which can tap the market which at present we are not getting.  Unless we can get people in promptly to see the beauties and to engage in the activities we have, there is a large part of the market we are simply not tapping and that, by default, is possibly going to Spain, France or Germany.  I know it is a difficult time to talk about expenditure and development, but that does not take away from the fact that in its own right the investment in question can lead to substantial developments taking place.</P>
    <P>The services of the Meteorological Office were referred to.  As a constant user of the office I would like to compliment them.  They have been providing an excellent service and tend to be remarkably accurate.  The service they provide for aircraft and for shipping has been most valuable and tends to be under-rated.  Deputy Coogan of Galway referred to the constant repetition of the expression &ldquo;Rain spreading from the west&rdquo;, which annoys many people where I live.  I wonder if different phraseology could not be used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Rain going towards the east&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have the <Col N="1489" /> authority of the Minister for that. I look forward to the weather forecast tonight.</P>
      <P>In reference to CIE, we have been talking about costs escalating to a colossal degree.  We should also refer to the service given.  The service on the Cork and Limerick lines is superb. The same cannot be said about the service to the west or specifically about the trains that run from Dublin to Westport, to which Deputy Hussey referred.  He is a commuter on this line and I travel on it at times.  I must agree with Deputy Hussey.  The standard is not good.  We do not have a super-train on that line.  We are told that that is because we do not have the business that would justify it. CIE might provide one such train once a day in both directions on that line.  That is not too much to ask when other lines have regular use of such trains.  I would like the Minister to ask CIE to provide at least one super-train once a day, in both directions, on the line to the west.</P>
      <P>Last year Deputies from the west had an interview with the General Manager of CIE and were told that while we did not have the super-type of train, there were on the line modern carriages that were identical to those on the super-train apart from the fact that they are not air conditioned. That is not true.  In some cases the carriages on this line have been abominable, have been dirty. There is disquiet and discontent about the type of carriages on this line.  I do not think that the CIE personnel at local level in Westport or Castlebar are to blame for the situation.  They are obviously at the mercy of the decisions made in Dublin.  I would ask CIE to give a better standard of service and better carriages.  At the rates being charged the general public are entitled to a better service.  To ask for one super-train once a day in each direction is looking for only one-third of the super-trains that are available. Pending that, we want carriages of high standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIE hotels sector gives rise to a certain amount of disquiet because of the losses which we see.  The annual report, page 10, refers to this sector. <Col N="1490" /> It refers to the fact that hotel and catering sales have risen by £3 million, which is an increase of 17 per cent. They state that the hotel operations in isolation are up by £1.8 million, which is an increase of 13 per cent. In the next line we read that the loss is up from £424,000 to £588,000.  It is inconsistently reported because we do not see the percentage there.  The percentage loss is up by practically 40 per cent.  In one breath they speak of percentage increases and when referring to the loss they do not give the percentage.  This is the type of thing I am getting at when I suggest the desirability of Parliament exercising greater control in this area and the setting up of a committee system in which we can engage in dialogue and tease out the problems that are causing concern.</P>
    <P>I have a little note here about North Mayo and Ballycastle where a number of thatched cottages have been built.  I spent Easter there with my wife and family.  They are a tremendous success and a great boost to the local economy.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to compliment the Minister on his very comprehensive report on the work which he is doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody said that the Department of Transport and Power is one of the most important Departments because of its control over a number of State companies which have a big bearing on the life of the people.  That was brought home very forcibly during the oil crisis, which was the greatest disaster that occurred in this country for some time.  CIE, Bord na Móna and the ESB are very important State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with our spokesman on Transport and Power that we need another oil refinery.  Deputy Barrett has done a great deal of research in this subject.  An agreement is supposed to be signed on our behalf with other countries which may leave us in a weaker position to negotiate directly with oil producing countries.  I have already referred to the danger of this agreement.  Deputy <Col N="1491" /> Barrett has proved conclusively that it is possible for us to get crude oil in here and if we had sufficient refineries oil would be available at a cheaper rate and we would not be at the mercy of multi-national oil companies as we have been.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter to the Minister by way of Parliamentary Question and otherwise and I must say he acted.  I ask him to watch these companies.  A feeler is being put out in regard to the supply to small petrol stations.  If their supply was curtailed the situation could be very bad.  During the oil crisis many of the oil companies gave preference to their own stations and did not give the recognised quota to the small petrol stations.  I would ask the Minister to keep a careful watch in this regard. The suggestion has been put out that the small tank will not be supplied. This would be discrimination against the small man.</P>
    <P>The oil crisis taught us a very salutary lesson about fuel.  We are not serious in the attempt to get fuel from the bogs.  An advertisement is widely publicised, &ldquo;Burn energy wisely&rdquo; and a torn £1 note is depicted.  There is no need to press people to burn energy wisely.  Energy is so dear that they will do that themselves without being told to do it.</P>
    <P>We have the bogs but we have no way of getting the energy out of them. I would prefer to see the money spent on telling us to burn energy wisely being spent on taking the energy out of the bogs.  Every time we put up schemes for bog development they are turned down because they are too expensive for the local government LIS scheme.  The Minister should discuss this with the Minister for Local Government.  A special fund should be set up to give grants for bog development. This is the native energy. This is the cheapest energy.  People who were using oil and coal for heating are going back to turf if they can. These bogs need to be drained and they need roads.  If we were serious we would have a special grant for bog development.  I could not over-emphasise this to the Minister.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> I should also like to comment on the proposed development by Bord na Móna.  To my mind Bord na Móna are doing a great job.  We expect a major development around Ballyforman and in all the bogs in Galway, and we even expect a power station. I understand that Bord na Móna's overdraft is to be curtailed.  I should like the Minister to tell me have Bord na Móna got enough money to carry out their expansion programme?  You cannot expand without money.  Factories have closed down recently. Many people have become redundant around the Banagher area and they look for employment with Bord na Móna or the ESB.  I should like the Minister to assure us there is not a scarcity of money and that this company will be able to carry out their development programme.  If this is not done, there will be a great deal of unemployment in these areas.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of Bord na Móna was referred to by a Deputy.  I used to have a row long ago with a certain very important man who was a director of the Sugar Company on the development of virgin bogs.  I always thought it was too costly.  Some farmers I know cut off the top of the turf and then treated the cutaway. It does not cost very much to maintain it in good order then.  The policy of the Sugar Company was to develop virgin bogs.  They did so with reasonable success but the amount of artificial manure needed made it an uneconomic proposition.  There is virgin bog around my area and it is too hard to grow crops.  Also you have to watch the weather.  If the year is wet you have to have steep drains and if the year is dry the top of the land dries up.  It just was not economical.  Things have changed and for heat and electricity now our native peat seems to be the answer.  No amount of money should be spared in getting home-produced energy.  If we do not do this there will be a great deal of unemployment.</P>
    <P>I understand that money from the regional fund has gone into the Department of Finance.  I thought that when we got this money it would be used to develop bogland and carry out <Col N="1493" /> drainage work in the west instead of going into the Exchequer.  It may be providing grants for existing projects. I understood it was for new development in the western region.  So far as I can gather the money has gone into the Exchequer and we do not know whether new projects will be financed out of it.  This fund could be usefully used for doing this.  The Minister should see to it that the ESB and Bord na Móna are not short of money to pursue their development plans.</P>
    <P>A particularly sore spot with regard to the ESB in rural areas is the charge for connecting to new houses.  Everything is against the person who wishes to build a house in rural Ireland.  The planners are against those people and the ESB, by their excessive connection charges, are also against them.  I know of young men who have returned to their native townland after spending many years in England and America with the intention of erecting a house adjacent to their ageing parents and they have been charged anything up to £1,000 for the ESB connection.  That excessive charge is one that those building houses never budget for.  I have asked the ESB to accept payment for such charges by instalments&mdash;for instance on the two-monthly bill&mdash;but they insist on a cash payment.  Grants for those building houses in rural areas amount to about £1,000 but those grants go towards paying for the electricity connection. The charge for connection is so high that it is preventing people erecting houses in rural areas.  The Department should provide a special subsidy for rural connections.</P>
    <P>The recent increases in the CIE charges was the greatest mistake ever made.  That company provides a social service and, consequently, must be subsidised, but a committee of this House should examine the operations of the company.  The best chance CIE ever had of increasing the revenue from the road passenger service was last December when petrol was increased by 15p per gallon.  However, the company did not take advantage of that situation.  I find that a number of the bus services, particularly <Col N="1494" /> in Galway, do not suit the workers or students.  If those services were run at a time to suit the workers the revenue would be greatly increased because many people cannot afford to use their cars.  Workers in Loughrea who travel by car to Galway city daily to work have told me that they would use the bus service if it operated at a suitable time.</P>
    <P>The charges for transporting freight should have been kept at the minimum. Had this been done CIE would have achieved one of their ambitions &mdash;to get most of the goods traffic. Those who say that CIE should be done away with because they cost the State money are not sincere because that company provides an essential social service.  I am against the proposed reorganisation of CIE in regard to the freight service.  That plan envisages reducing the amount of traffic through Ballinasloe and I understand this will mean that 30 men will be made redundant.  I cannot understand why this station, the central point for goods traffic from many western counties, will be reduced in importance. It has been stated that this reorganisation is in the interest of efficiency, but I have always found that such plans result in a less efficient service. Madame Roland said: &ldquo;Oh, liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name&rdquo; and my paraphrase is: &ldquo;Oh, efficiency, what horrible crimes have been committed in thy name.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should look into the whole energy situation, CIE, the possibility of establishing a second oil refinery and support my Party in their demand for the scrapping of the energy agreement which was debated in this House.  He should ensure that there is no scarcity of money for the Bord na Móna and ESB development plans.  If he did away with the advertising campaign to burn energy wisely &mdash;people do not have to be told to do this now because electricity and oil are so expensive&mdash;he would have money for such developments.  The Minister should forget about the CIE reorganisation plans, and in regard to CIE charges, he should ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to have a bit of common sense.  By increasing <Col N="1495" /> those charges CIE are putting people away from availing of their services. I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Chair the ruling given this morning by the Ceann Comhairle that it is in order to discuss the increased charges in the road and freight section of CIE.  This covers increases in a variety of other sectors, for foodstuffs and for other items that would normally be dealt with on the Estimate of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  This morning the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order a specific matter raised in this House, but I take it it is in order to proceed on the basis indicated by the Ceann Comhairle and that I shall not be ruled out of order when I deal with the increases that will take place in foodstuffs and other items as a result of the freight rate increases.</P>

      <P>I shall refer to the increases that will take place because of the increased road freight charges. I should like the Minister in his reply to tell us if the Government have appointed a receiver and, if so when he will move in to take over the Government. In the recent past we have heard the story of failure by instalments, told by Minister after Minister.  This alarming situation was revealed by the Taoiseach and his Ministers when they spoke about the economy.  We will have to ask each Minister the true state of the economy and how he fits in to this situation.  We have heard many tales of woe and many reasons for the increases.  If we are to believe what the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Finance and Industry and Commerce have said, every job is in danger&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The substantial increases imposed by CIE, on the order of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, will affect the livelihood of many people who are now in employment. They will join the long dole queues.  What can the people look forward to when they hear that the ESB will increase their charges in the very near future?  All they can look forward to is a cold and hungry future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be much more courageous if the Taoiseach told the people of the problems that exist.  He should tell the House the truth, that they have no money, and then we could discuss how we might help.  What has happened is that each Minister has told us things are all right.  Recently the Taoiseach and some Government Ministers met the captains of industry&mdash;probably they have more information on the situation than have Members of this House&mdash;and it is up to him and his Ministers to reveal the facts.  At some stage the Government will have to tell the nation.  Perhaps they will do as the former Coalition Governments did&mdash;<Col N="1497" /> desert the nation in the middle of the night&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate refers to a variety of matters and the Ceann Comhairle has given me permission to discuss matters that will be affected by the fare increases.  I am pointing out that there will be a cold and hungry future for many thousands of people in addition to the 103,000 unemployed and the 25,000 who are living below the poverty line, a figure given to us by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  The unemployment queues will extend because of the vicious increases imposed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. It is a pity that Minister is not present to hear what I and other speakers have to say.  He is the man responsible.  One Minister after another is trying to cover up, but ultimately they will have to face up to their responsibilities.  If the device used this morning is an effort to cover up for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and to transfer the question to the Department of Transport and Power it will fail.  Other speakers will expose the facts and will show how prices will be affected because of the increases granted.  It is about time the Government acted with some sense of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The country is being put in pawn. We have not been told the true story, but I suppose Members will be the last to be told.  I am sure that when the captains of industry met the Taoiseach recently the question of freight charges, the increase in fares and the ESB charges were discussed.  The question we must pose to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, through the Minister for Transport and Power, is: why is the increase so great?  Without being given an acceptable explanation, we and the rest of the country are entitled to conclude that the economic and financial affairs of the country are beyond the control of responsible Ministers.  It would appear that the whole financial situation, as revealed from day to day, is beyond the understanding <Col N="1498" /> of the Government.  We have further proof of this practically every week by the imposition of increase after increase, some of them cleverly shrouded, some unidentifiable at present but which will reveal themselves in a positive way in the future.</P>
    <P>Only a few months ago when this House approved a massive subsidy of £14 million for CIE, we thought that was an indication that there was a realisation of the actual situation in relation to CIE, of the social and economic necessity for its subsidisation to enable it to continue through the very difficult period it was facing.  As members have correctly pointed out, CIE provides a very useful service.  But, again, I must refer to the miscalculation of the Government in a matter of two or three months.  This is a clear indication of the inefficiency of Ministers, of the Government, of their advisers, or whatever may be the combination of groups that presents to this House a picture of the situation in relation to CIE, or indeed any other concern.  If such people are unable to project beyond three months, then it is indeed a sorry state of affairs for the 103,000 plus unemployed at present.  With the increases about to be levied on the already very high fares and freight charges, are we to conclude that the Exchequer is so bankrupt that the situation is like a fairytale where the Minister for Transport and Power goes to the cupboard and the cupboard is found bare?  Old Mother Hubbard has let the Government down again.</P>
    <P>Some time ago we experienced the levying of fuel price increases.  When the Minister for Finance introduced the infamous 15p. on the gallon of petrol, one of his arguments at that time was that public transport would not be affected. That was a statement of fact by the Minister for Finance at the time; that was the voice of collective responsibility of the Government&mdash;that such increases would not affect public transport. Ministers cannot see further than their noses at present.  And they are asked to project a policy for the future of this nation.  Where do we stand?  We know now that the Minister for Finance, who has been wrong so many <Col N="1499" /> times, cannot project beyond the end of his nose and, indeed, the same goes for other Ministers.  All the other reasons advanced at that time may be regarded as senseless in the light of this final insult.  It is an insult to the intelligence of this House that the situation was handled in that manner.</P>
    <P>Mention must be made also of the untruthful disclosures to the House, and this was an untruthful disclosure, because now we know the facts of the situation&mdash;that public transport is affected by fuel increases.  We know that every passenger will pay an additional, substantial portion of his pay packet on fares.  Indeed, one wonders now if the National Pay Agreement will stand up at all.  Certainly, one must ask oneself that question if this type of concealed price increase situation continues in the future.  How long will workers trust the Government, or indeed anybody, when they read statements by Ministers and indeed of some Deputies, even some on this side of the House, who believe the Minister for Finance and believe the voice of collective responsibility over there?  I would ask the Minister to indicate very clearly to us, when replying, how the miscalculation arose.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fare-paying passengers in the public transport system, every retailer, wholesaler will be affected also&mdash;and these people must be dealt with in depth in relation to these increases because every manufacturer whose goods are carried by CIE is asked to undertake this increased burden which, in turn, will be passed on to the consumer.  I wonder do the Government realise the effect of permitting such increases, do they care, or is it that they need money so urgently because the Exchequer cannot meet the Budget subsidies and the Government are forcing CIE into a position where immediate increases are found necessary in order to increase its cash flow?  Is that the situation&mdash;thereby maintaining sufficient liquidity to prevent the complete breakdown of the finances of CIE and dire resultant consequences for its workers?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> We have been misled all along the line.  Again, through the Minister for Transport and Power, I should like to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who sanctioned these increases, to give us some clear indication in future as to the appalling resultant situation.  Will the Minister peg prices?  Will he give the same promise in relation to prices as did the Minister for Finance in relation to public transport?  Will the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicate that there will be no price increases now as a result of the latest ones permitted to CIE?  Since this Government came into power, and even before, they indicated that they could do wonderful things in relation to all sorts of reductions and situations relevant to price increases.</P>
    <P>Of course, this morning we were told it was a Government decision. Was not that a marvellous statement &mdash;a Government decision?  As if we did not know.  The Labour Party are as much a part of that decision; the Cheshire cats we saw grinning here this morning&mdash;referred to the other day in the papers&mdash;who sneer and jeer every time the Government are questioned; the Minister who, with his bully-boy tactics, tries to shout down members of the Opposition seeking clarification of matters, and he is called a responsible Member of the Government.  I am referring to the Minister for Local Government. When we tried to get clarification this morning, we saw the sneer and grin on the face of the Minister for Local Government.</P>

Therefore, I feel I can discuss every member of the Government in addition to the wider matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must remember that this is an Estimate for a particular Department. When the Ceann Comhairle rules that a Deputy may discuss increases in CIE fares, that does not mean a Deputy can go over the whole range of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Chairman, I agree that that is so.  Nevertheless, when one takes into consideration that we were told this morning&mdash;as a back-up to the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;that this was a Government decision; that it was not merely a decision of a particular Minister, that opened up the field to the wide area we can now discuss in relation to CIE fares.  The Government Minister most provocative this morning was the Minister for Local Government, with his Cheshire cat-like grin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>That is unparliamentary language, and I think the Deputy should confine himself to the Estimate before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get back to the fare increases, which are not part of the Estimate.  It is merely a concession we were granted to discuss them and their implications here. People generally will suffer because of this vicious 33 per cent increase in bus fares.  Those living on the perimeter of this city will have to meet this additional 33 per cent&mdash;the housewife travelling to the shops, the workers to their jobs, the sick and disabled to the dispensaries and the hospitals and the unemployed to the labour exchanges.  Labour and Fine Gael collectively have decided to nail the workers, the housewives, the sick and the disabled, the weakest sections in our community.  The Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce do not live in Ballymun or Ballyfermot.  They do not have to use public transport. They have their Mercedes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate thing is that people living on the north side and working on the south side and <i>vice versa</i> will have to meet these increased fares.  More money will be extracted from their pay packets, money given with one <Col N="1502" /> hand under a national pay agreement and taken away with the other hand in increased fares and increased prices generally.  Every effort is being made to extract the last halfpenny from the workers.  These increases will lead to a reduction in the housewife's shopping basket, small as that basket is at the moment, and more people will find themselves on the poverty line or below it.</P>
    <P>The Government are not facing the reality of the situation.  If they were we would not have these vicious increases.  We have a 33 per cent increase in fares, a 25 per cent increase in freight charges, 15 pence on the gallon of petrol and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has increased postal charges.  The Government have no understanding of the position.  They have never gone hungry.</P>
    <P>This is only the beginning.  In one report we got it was stated that the average increase in electricity charges to achieve a balance would be 15.8 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy give the source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a booklet from the National Prices Commission, No. 38.  It states that the ESB submitted an application for an increase in electricity charges from the April-May billing period to yield an increase in revenue of £14 million during 1975-76. To achieve this an average increase in electricity charges of 15.8 per cent would be needed.  We know what happened last year.  First, the NPC gave them an increase and then the Government decided to give them a further increase.  We may have another instalment here again.  Those living in electrically heated houses can look forward now to a cold and hungry future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industries will be affected by the increased freight charges and they will pass those increases on to the consumer. That will mean more out of the wage packet of the worker.  It was a sad day for workers when this Government came into power.  It is only now they realise the inefficiency <Col N="1503" /> and ineffectiveness of the Government in the management of the country. Perhaps it is a good thing to let supporters of Fine Gael and Labour see how ineffective and inefficient they are.  For months those engaged in the education of our children have been left dangling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Ceann Comhairle, the decisions made are made on the basis of collective responsibility.  We were told that this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  It is an all-embracing situation.  The Ceann Comhairle's decision has opened every Department to criticism, every Department responsible in any way for increased costs on the people.  School children who do not have free transport will have to pay increased fares. In many cases for months past parents were not able to make up their minds about their children's education.</P>

      <P>I am indicating that school children will now have to pay higher bus fares.  Even the children are caught in this particular net.  Once again I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce, through the Minister for Transport and Power, because that is the way we have to go on this occasion, through one Minister to another, why those increases have to be imposed now.  We have the school children, the disabled, the unemployed, the housewife and workers who will be affected by this increase.  The increases will not be forgotten too soon by the workers of the country or of the city who have been victimised all too often in the past.  The farmers who utilise CIE will also be asked to pay increased charges of 25 per cent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably did.  Those farmers will be asked to pay increased charges.  Again it was the collective responsibility of the Government, of which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is a member. I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, through the Minister for Transport and Power, why was he a party to such a vicious increase in freight charges which will affect the farmers of the country?  We are told they are very badly off and that they are crippled with overheads.  If they are using CIE services they will be further crippled by the increase of 25 per cent in freight charges.  Are the Government trying to divert the farmers away from CIE?  Is this an effort to break CIE, to divert the farmers, the wholesalers and the retailers away from them and cripple them for good? Is this a device to wreck CIE for good?</P>
      <P>This could well be a concealed reason for giving those increases.  They are increases which the Government know cannot be paid in some cases and will not be paid in others.  I do not believe any responsible Minister dealing with any particular Department would be a party to such a vicious increase in the hard times that now face the farmers.  We are told this in Brussels and elsewhere by the various Ministers.  Does the same position apply when at home or do they speak with a different tongue when abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small farmers will suffer and the industrialists, who are producing goods for export and who avail of CIE's services, will not be as competitive in the international markets as they were. This increase will affect the workers and as a result of it the dole queues will be lengthened.  The 103,000 which are unemployed will be increased to a much higher figure in the near future because of those increases.  Industrialists who are using CIE may be put in the position that they are no longer competitive.  Is this an effort to divert industrialists away from CIE so that the freight section is closed down and we end up with an electrified suburban rail service?  Is this to be the CIE of the future?  Are the Government <Col N="1505" /> really concerned about CIE?  If that is the collective wisdom of the Government a very serious situation is facing the country.</P>
    <P>The wholesalers who use CIE are bound to pass on the increased freight charges on foodstuffs to the housewives who will have to pay increased food prices.  Families will be carrying the can in relation to commuting to work, bringing the children to school, shopping, going to the dispensary or hospital or even the labour exchange. Those increases will be felt by all.</P>
    <P>The price of farm produce, which is transported by CIE, will be increased in the near future because the increased charges will be passed on.  Two questions must be asked.  Is all this an effort to wreck CIE totally?  Is it an irresponsible action of the Government? Have those increases been granted without a true assessment being made?  Three months ago the Government asked for an extra £14 million for CIE.  We thought that would protect them for quite a long time.  Can calculations only be made a month in advance?  The workers of CIE must be protected.  If the Government feel that a national transport system is not necessary they should say so instead of trying to wreck it.</P>
    <P>The workers living on the perimeter of Dublin, as a result of the CIE increases, will find their transport bill has gone up by 33 per cent in the near future.  This is as a result of the collective responsibility of the Government who strike at every single member of a family.  The 33 per cent increase to each member of a family will be a very hefty bill to pay.  This is a covert effort to syphon off from farmers, industrialists, retailers and everybody commuting to and from work sufficient money to enable CIE to keep going. The Government will not be able to get away from their responsibilities because not alone will those increases affect every member of a family but the electricity charges, which will take place tomorrow to the tune of 15.8 per cent, will add another heavy burden on them.  The ESB have indicated that those increases are necessary.</P>
    <P>We can look forward to a cold and hungry future.  Is this all the Government <Col N="1506" /> have to offer or is this the reason an effort was made to conceal the true situation this morning, when Deputy O'Malley endeavoured to raise this question so that it could be debated in full?  If this debate had been allowed we would have been able to examine all aspects of the matter instead of having them tagged on to the debate for the Estimate for Transport and Power.  We now have to address the Minister for Industry and Commerce through the Minister for Transport and Power.  The food prices that will be increased show clearly that the future will be a hungry one when those increases are taken in conjunction with the increased ESB charges.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, on the Order of Business this morning you were reminded by Deputy Callanan, who was strongly supported by Deputy Lynch that a Member of the House occupying the Chair yesterday had disallowed attempts by Opposition speakers to raise the matter of CIE charges.  You promised to look into the matter and I just wish your indulgence for a moment to say that since then I have looked through the carbons of yesterday's Transport and Power debate and I observed that Deputies O'Leary, Connolly and Hussey all dealt at length with this topic.  I found no trace in the carbon reports of yesterday's debate that they were interfered with by the Chair or any occupant of the Chair.  The carbons are not always reliable and it may be that I have missed something that you, Sir, have since been able to find but I would be grateful for your view on this because it is part, in the form in which it was raised this morning, of an attempt by the Opposition to make out that they are being muzzled if not by us, Sir, then by you.  Both suggestions are equally unfounded and disgraceful and I would like, Sir, if you would let the House know whether you have been successful in the meantime in finding any trace <Col N="1507" /> of what Deputy Callanan, mind you, did not say he himself had heard but evidently had been asked by someone over there to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, compensation by the Department is at market value rather than at replacement cost.  The owner of cattle is free to look for a licence and sell his own cattle directly, but my information is that extremely few people avail themselves of this.

      <P>The EEC Commission decided two weeks ago to admit between May and September a quota of 67,500 head of young cattle, mainly for Italian feeders.  My delegation voiced its very strong objections at the Council of Ministers' meeting last week to the resumption of any such cattle and beef imports into the Community while ample Community supplies are available and recourse to intervention purchases continues to be necessary.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the review has particular reference to the effect of our beef intervention and slaughter premium systems in supporting the prices of cattle at the different stages of production; and the review body is to report on possible modifications and improvements with a view to ensuring that there is an equitable distribution of the benefits of the systems among all producers of cattle.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal representations were received but my Department were aware from contacts with the Commission that the large proportion of Irish beef slaughterings continuing to be put into intervention at this time of year was a matter of some concern to the Commission. I and my Department were also becoming very concerned at the apparent lack of adequate efforts to develop commercial beef sales as against offerings to intervention, as well as the possibility that over-use of the intervention system would be bound to create not only physical storage problems but pressures for altering the system to our disadvantage in times of seasonally high supplies and weak market conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission <Col N="1522" /> of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the Press reference of Monday 28th April to a Brussels report of the destruction of intervention beef.  I have no information about the beef referred to as no Irish intervention beef was involved.  The Press article of Sunday 27th April referred to Irish beef in two specific instances which were without foundation; and the English butcher mentioned has since written to the London Office of C.B.F. stating that he was misquoted. My Department also issued a denial to the Press.  As I mentioned in my reply to a Question by the Deputy on 22nd April, there have been some instances in which beef offered to intervention was not up to the required standard.  Investigation of complaints about beef stored in intervention or sold out of intervention has been taking place in eight instances. It is not practicable to indicate the tonnage but the individual complaints relate to small lots.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this country's reputation as an exporter of high quality beef will not suffer by reason of these isolated complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the officers of the Department have to pass the meat while it is going through the factory and before it goes into intervention? Why is the Minister saying it has only just come to his notice now when those agents were investigating the position?  Should the Minister not have seen this long ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept that in view of the fact that we slaughtered more than one million cattle, a figure never reached before, which required the degree of inspection, and that we took in more than 500,000 cattle into intervention, it would be impossible to expect that everything would be 100 per cent at all times.  Some small things might slip here and there but I still hold that Irish processors are as good as any in Europe.  I believe we are processing beef longer than any other member States for the American trade and doing it extremely well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

The Commission's decisions to resume certain imports were examined by the Council last week, as I have indicated in my reply to another question today by Deputy James Gibbons.</P>

Where does this information come from?  I understood from the literature supplied to me that they received this information from this management committee, but the Minister's statement seems to suggest <Col N="1525" /> that there is still another group in the Commission's office dealing with this problem.

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Supplies of Third Country, including Polish, pigmeat entering the EEC are subject to a monetary compensatory charge when the importing country has a revalued currency, such as Germany and the Benelux countries, and to a monetary compensatory subvention when the importing country has a devalued currency, such as the UK, France and Italy.  On the other hand, a levy is charged on supplies of Third Country pigmeat entering the EEC, based on the difference between world feed grain prices and EEC feed grain prices plus a 7 per cent protective charge.</P>

    <P>In the year ended 31st January, 1975, grant payments to farmers arose almost entirely under the former farm buildings, water supplies and land project schemes.

    <P>An area of west Limerick, including that in which farmers are entitled to unemployment assistance on the notional income basis, was examined. It was found that the area could meet the population criteria and that a considerable part of it could be regarded as physically handicapped.  In relation to the economic criterion, the average income per male worker engaged in agriculture was found to be above the national average instead of appreciably below it as required by the directive.  For this reason, it was not included in the submission. However, following recent representations by farming organisations and other interests the position of this and one or two other areas in the country will, as I have previously stated, be looked at again.  This further assessment <Col N="1533" /> would aim to define more precisely the parts of the west Limerick area which might be deemed to be genuinely physically handicapped and to produce more refined economic data with a view to justifying a submission to the Commission.</P>

      <P>The prospects for the production and sale of butter at a lucrative price in 1975 are quite good and it is expected that our total production will be marketed at satisfactory prices and without recourse to intervention selling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of skim milk powder, supplies are at present in excess of commercial demand and the prospects for the coming season are not very encouraging.  It is expected that a considerable proportion of this year's output will have to be sold to intervention in this country as well as in other Community states.  Total intervention stock of skim milk powder held in the Community as at 23 April, <Col N="1535" /> 1975 was 491,803 metric tons.  Prospects for the sale of full-cream milk powder, production of which in Ireland is relatively small, have improved with the recent substantial increase in the level of the export subsidy granted by the EEC Commission. In the casein sector, world demand at the existing level of prices is weak and some of the major producer countries hold large unsold stocks.  The prospects, therefore, for the production and sale of this commodity at lucrative prices are poor at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The recorded increase in the value of imports is attributable to the following exceptional circumstances:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In the dairy sector a quantity of skim milk powder valued at £1.6m exported to the USA during 1974 under a quota system had to be returned to this country as the quota had been filled by the time of its arrival.  Its re-import took place in February 1975 and it was subsequently exported to another destination. In addition, due to a transport strike in Northern Ireland in the early part of this year a certain quantity of milk was diverted to creameries here.</P>
      <P>In the egg sector the increase was due to resumption of imports from Northern Ireland which had been prohibited from November 1973 to November 1974 because of outbreaks of Newcastle disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to net fishing as distinct from rod fishing.  While the official netting season in the Erne estuary extends from 1st March to 19th August each year it has been found necessary in recent years, in the interest of the conservation of the stocks, to prohibit netting until a satisfactory escapement of salmon upstream had taken place.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

The fishermen are satisfied <Col N="1541" /> that a very big number of salmon enter the estuary and not all of them succeed in getting to the upper reaches of the river because of this dam; those who do not get up go back to sea again and it would be in no way contrary to conservation rules if fishermen were allowed even one year's fishing in the estuary on experimental grounds.

      <P>The Minister introduced legislation last July to postpone elections to the fishery boards.  One reason for that postponement was because the Minister hoped to have the report <Col N="1543" /> of this commission and to embody some of the recommendations.  Does the Minister now propose to further postpone the elections, and what is the position about legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, in view of the fact that there may be shortages of skilled manpower in several areas in the future, he will make further moneys available to AnCO to help them to expand the facilities they now offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1548" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Exchequer allocation for current expenditure by AnCO for 1975 is £5 million.  This represents an increase of £1 million over the amount provided for in the printed Estimates for 1975 and compares with £2 million for the nine-month period ended 31st December, 1974.  This provision for industrial training is the highest ever since the foundation of AnCO.  Allowing for grants from the European Social Fund, AnCO should have a total of £9 million for current expenditure in 1975. For these reasons, AnCO will be able to provide training for about 7,000 during 1975, including adults and apprentices, as compared with 4,500 in 1974.</P>
      <P>AnCO collect, through their training advisers who visit firms on a regular basis, data on manpower according to skill level, and on categories in which shortages are likely to arise.  AnCO have, therefore, incorporated into their planning, the objective of providing training in skills which are particularly suitable for expanding sectors of industry and offer best prospects of long term secure employment.</P>
      <P>Further more, it is proposed to set up a unit within AnCO which will be responsible for the provision and interpretation of information on manpower training needs and in determining the likely skill requirements in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that extra moneys have been made available this year, has the Minister seen reports to the effect that the reason why we have this massive unemployment situation is that there are still industries and trades experiencing a shortage of skilled personnel?  Will he consider further extending the advantages to this organisation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that over the entire country there is still a shortage of skilled categories in particular industries. The answer there, of course, is more a long-term creation of extra skills rather than the training course <Col N="1549" /> we are engaging in during the present year.  I made it clear, in opening the Dundalk Training Centre, that we were looking at the unemployment situation and would invest more than we are at present investing in the training area to use up any of the available unemployed.  Our strategy in this period of down-turn for the economy is to ensure that more money than ever before is spent in training our manpower so that we will be in a position to avail of all the opportunities open to us when the economy picks up again with the other economies of our trading partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's statement that he intends setting up an organisation within AnCO to identify the requirements and skills, would he not agree that if there is proper liaison between the national manpower service and AnCO this would fulfil the requirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy will appreciate, more than most in the House, since he occupied the position I now have, that there is necessity for an even more careful scrutiny of our requirements in the area of skilled manpower.  The Deputy is right in pinpointing the necessity for continued liaison between the training authority and the manpower service that obtained in his time.  I think it obtains now but I still believe it may be necessary to make that even more effective in present circumstances by the establishment of this unit, which the authority intend having.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may not have particulars for this question. Is the in-company training still continuing? Is there any success with it? This is based on the company levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this is not related to the question but it is still going on.  We are constantly, as in his period in office, reviewing the effectiveness of the company levy.  As he knows, there are various theories about its effectiveness, whether or not it should be revived.  There is no final answer to that one yet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether, in respect of the EEC criteria for training grant assistance, there will be funds available in this field in view of the fact that Government agencies have refused to provide the £-for-£ matching which is required by the European Social Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the regulations of the European Social Fund grants are payable to private firms towards training costs, subject to a number of conditions, one of which is that equivalent grants are paid to such firms from public funds.  The social fund grants may apply to various types of training costs, including instructors' salaries and expenses, trainees' remuneration and expenses, rental or depreciation of materials and of buildings used for training purposes and certain types of teaching equipment.</P>
      <P>The equivalent grants to industrial firms for this purpose have been payable in Ireland by the Industrial Development Authority.  Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, training grants payable by the IDA are limited to the amounts of trainees' remuneration and expenses and of similar costs relating to instructors, advisers, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to go back to the basic question.  Is it true that there have been complaints that State funds are not matching the EEC funds for these training programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility in this area is between the Industrial Development Authority and my Department. It may not really answer the national interest that there should be any change in our own position in relation to State funds in this area.  Our general approach is that we have obtained more than our fair share of the money available under the social fund.  It is true that there is a slightly larger area of coverage under the social fund than under State schemes. I simply say to the Deputy that he should examine the matter a little further since he put down the question which is a very interesting one.  It appears to me the national interest is <Col N="1551" /> better served by the present arrangement. In fact, it suits our purpose better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have misunderstood the situation and I would like to get the matter clarified.  Is it not true that the EEC Social Fund requires the matching of pound for pound?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Has this not actually been complied with by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, in all matters relating to the EEC it is a contest between member countries and what the fund permits. I believe we are conforming to the rules governing the fund, getting more than our fair share of it.  The present arrangements suit our purpose in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister elaborate on what he means by getting our fair share of the fund? Surely his approach should be that we would never get enough, that we should always be looking for more?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <P>I have strengthened the industrial inspectorate and more inspectors are in the process of being recruited through the Civil Service Commission.</P>
      <P>I am up-dating codes of safety regulations so as to cope more effectively with the ever changing needs of the occupational safety situation which are brought about by technological innovations in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am enforcing, by court action where necessary, the statutory occupational safety provisions.  My inspectors are available at all times to give <Col N="1552" /> advice and assistance in the matter of industrial safety.</P>
    <P>The number of premises, consisting of factories, mines and quarries, on the register of the industrial inspectorate in 1974, was approximately 18,000, with an employment content of around 200,000.</P>
    <P>During 1974, approximately 22,000 visits were made by inspectors, giving satisfactory coverage in the case of factories, mines and quarries.</P>

      <P>The number of accidents certainly increased but the number of fatal accidents decreased satisfactorily last year, from I think 35 to 22.  The increase in the number of accidents is due probably to several factors.  There has been an increase in the number of industrial accidents every year since we have kept records. There are a number of theories as to why this should happen&mdash;such as the expansion of industry or changes in technology.  The number of inspections has been increased and the number of fatal accidents is down.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of Government commitment in this area is summed up in terms of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, which gives women the right to equal pay to come into effect at the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> To complement this legislation, in the current session, I will be introducing a further Bill to provide equal opportunities for women in employment.</P>
    <P>Other measures recommended by the Commission on the Status of Women have already been taken by the Government. The social welfare code has been greatly improved.  Mothers are now paid their children's allowances as of right.  Deserted wives are dealt with in a much more humane way. The unmarried mother who keeps her child is now entitled to a welfare allowance.  An allowance is made to the wives of long-term prisoners.  The removal of the means limit on insurability means that most women are now covered for maternity benefit. Married women may avail of their pre-marriage contributions to qualify for unemployment, disability, dental and optical benefits.  Women employed in private domestic service or in agriculture are now eligible for unemployment benefit on the same conditions as other insured workers.  An allowance is now paid to single women between the age of 58 and pensionable age who are in poor circumstances.</P>
    <P>Procedural legislation has been passed for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders between this country and Britain.  In the area of taxation the working woman's allowance has been increased.</P>

      <P>As I have explained, I did not suggest any particular form of advertisement.  We just indicated the purpose of the unit and the Civil Service Commission applied the usual age and other requirements for personnel of this kind, as they would in relation to any other part of the public service.  Personally, I think the question of age in advertisements is a matter that should be reviewed but as I have explained it is primarily a matter for the Civil Service Commission as to how they produce details in advertisements of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

      <P>What they were after was some seniority at the youth end and not extraordinary age at the other end.  The whole question of age in advertisements is a matter that should be examined.  We have under consideration in my Department the question of whether we should have legislation to govern not only State advertisements but private employment advertisements also because in this country we are apt to dismiss perfectly worthwhile workers at one end and to deny young workers at the other end. It is a large question.  I am on the Deputy's side in terms of reform in this area and I hope I will have his support if I produce legislation in this area at the end of the year.</P>

      <P>92 private firms hold licences under the Employment Agency Act, 1971.  In addition, my Department are in touch with 40 other firms which they consider come within the scope of the Act.  A small number of agencies appear to have some association with agencies operating in other countries but their applications for licences met all the statutory requirements.  Under the Act a licence must be granted to an applicant who meets the statutory requirements.</P>
      <P>Licensed agencies are inspected by officers of my Department and these inspections have shown that the agencies generally comply with the provisions of the Act.</P>
      <P>On the basis of present information, I have no grounds for adopting further measures to regulate the establishment and operation of these agencies.  Very few complaints have been received against them and these are fully investigated.  However, the Act is a comparatively new one and the position of these agencies, in relation to placing people in employment and providing temporary workers on a contract basis, is being kept under continuing review.  I am also, of course, keeping in touch with international developments about the regulation of these agencies.</P>

        <i>Cavan):</i> So far as the Land Commission are aware, this property was advertised for sale extensively in 1969 but there were no takers at the time.  A short time later a Mr. Joseph Neylon purchased the Island.  In 1973, Mr. Neylon sold the island to Mrs. Hufty of Washington, D.C., in a private sale.  Mrs. Hufty decided to take the purchase in the name of her company, Vancouver Delaware Corporation.  An application was made for the consent of the Land Commission under section 45, Land Act, 1965, to enable the property to be purchased in the name of the company. In support of the application it was stated that the purchaser's sole purpose in buying the island was to own it for its intrinsic beauty and tranquility and the object would be to maintain it as such.  It was stated at the time that she had no immediate plans but that she would contemplate putting a residence there.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission obtained reports from their local officers in the matter and in view of the importance of the island as a habitat of the Barnacle Goose, which is a protected species in this country, they also consulted the Forest and Wildlife Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having fully considered all aspects of the case, it was decided in April, 1974, to grant consent to the sale.  The consent was given in the knowledge that the Forest and Wildlife Service had informed the planning authority <Col N="1567" /> of the significance of the island for wildlife and had requested that it be consulted in the case of any development proposed for the island in the future.  In conveying their consent the Land Commission drew attention to the importance of the island from the wildlife point of view and the likelihood in the future that the Forest and Wildlife Service would be pursuing this interest.</P>
    <P>The price which Mrs. Hufty agreed to pay for the island is a confidential matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Very few complaints in respect of Irish <i>au pair</i> girls abroad come under the notice of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The volume of complaint is so small that there would seem to be no need, at the moment, for such a circular to the post primary schools.</P>
      <P>Irish girls going abroad for <i>au pair</i> placement, who consult my Department, are advised to insist on a written agreement with their host families before they leave this country. Provisions which might suitably be included in an agreement are suggested to them and they are provided with a copy of the model agreement embodied in the European agreement on <i>au pair</i> placement of the Council of Europe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Because I have been given responsibility for the consular section of the Department.  Deputy Gibbon's suggestion might be feasible and I was about to say, in the context of the next question, that something like this might be considered, something which would stop short of issuing a circular.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if the charter relating to <i>au pair</i> exchanges has been ratified; if not, why; and when it will be ratified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Agreement on <i>au pair</i> placement has been ratified by four of the 18 member states of the Council of Europe, namely, Denmark, France, Italy and Norway.  Ireland has not signed or ratified the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before Ireland could sign and ratify the agreement a number of problems would have to be resolved.  These involve other Government Departments. <Col N="1573" /> as well as Foreign Affairs and have been under consideration inter-departmentally for some time.  Signature of the agreement must await the outcome of the deliberations.  Ratification should be possible, if and when the agreement is signed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to give that undertaking.  The Deputy may be aware that the charter he referred to requires the setting up of a public authority to supervise the operation of <i>au pair</i> girls in this jurisdiction.  That is something which would require the consultation of several Departments. The Department and the Government have no objection in principle to the conditions proposed by the charter but the machinery which the enforcement of the charter would need requires consultation between Departments and that is still in progress.  There is no objection, in principle, to the adoption and ratification of the charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if UNO reports are available in relation to the deaths of Irish soldiers serving with UN Forces; and if reports of political decisions and the factors which led to the involvement resulting in loss of life will be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In every case where a member of the Defence Force dies while serving with a UN peace keeping force or observer group the Secretary General of the United Nations informs the Government of the circumstances <Col N="1574" /> of the death.  It has been the practice to make this information public when it is received.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1958 when Ireland first took part in United Nations operations of this kind a total of 35 members of the Defence Forces have died while serving with the United Nations.  Of this number 17 were killed in action; 11 died in accidents; and seven died from natural causes.  The latest occasion on which an Irish soldier died while on UN service was in 1971; the most recent death in action was in 1967.</P>
      <P>As to the political decisions and other factors leading to the involvement resulting in loss of life, the initial decision to establish a UN force or observer group is, of course, taken by the appropriate UN organ&mdash;generally the Security Council; and the decision on our side to respond to a request from the UN Secretary General to contribute Irish officers or men to such a force is in the first instance a matter for the Government.  Since 1960, however, as the Deputy will be aware, the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) (No.2) Act 1960 make it necessary to obtain the advance approval of Dáil Éireann for the dispatch of a contingent to serve with the UN&mdash;unless the numbers involved are less than 12 or the contingent as a whole is unarmed. This has been done in all cases as required.</P>
      <P>Once a contingent or group from the Defence Forces has been sent to serve with the United Nations the day to day conduct of the mission at an operational level is a matter for the United Nations&mdash;that is for the Secretary General and his advisers acting under authority of the appropriate UN resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time the Secretary General publishes as a public UN document a general report on the operation of forces over a particular period.  This report would refer where relevant to casualties suffered by the force or group in the period in question. The number of such progress reports to date is quite large but if the Deputy is interested in a particular issue I could have the matter checked <Col N="1575" /> so as to obtain for him, or refer him to, any such report which may be relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will information be made available to Members?  This has been a grey area over a number of years and there have been complaints that people have been unable to obtain information.  When I asked the question in relation to political decisions, I meant the politicians on the ground in the Congo at that time. Were the armchair generals responsible for the death of the Irish soldiers?  I want to examine the reports that are available to clarify the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are UN reports but the Deputy will appreciate that with regard to individual deaths where there is an inquiry it will not necessarily be the case that the report will be published.  The reopening of the issue might distress the family concerned.  If the Deputy has any problem with regard to a particular instance, I would be happy to talk to him about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact I am trying to ascertain is whether some of the deaths were a result of political decisions made by civilians rather than by the military.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course such matters are under the control of the Secretary-General and his advisers who are civilians but at the operations level the individual officer in charge has to take decisions.  However, as in all cases of military forces operating under civilian control, the civilian authority has the ultimate responsibility.</P>

      <P>Article 7 of the draft convention on the holding of elections to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage, which was adopted by the Parliament itself at its plenary session held on 14th <Col N="1577" /> January, 1975, provides that the Parliament shall draw up a proposal for a uniform electoral system by 1980 at the latest.  Pending entry into force of this uniform electoral system, however, the draft convention provides that the electoral procedure should be governed by the domestic provisions of each member state.</P>
      <P>The draft convention in the form of a resolution adopted by the Parliament is now before the Council of the European Communities and in line with the expressed wish of the heads of Government as stated in point 12 of the communiqué issued at the end of their meeting held in Paris on 9th-10th December last, it is hoped that the Council will act on the Parliament's proposals in 1976.  Pending full consideration by the Council of the Parliament's proposals, and the possible outcome of consultations between the two institutions on the various provisions contained in the draft convention, it would be premature at this stage for me to make a statement on the manner in which I consider direct elections to the European Parliament should be conducted in this country.</P>

The figure of 13 is contained in a recommendation of Parliament to the Council of Ministers who have not yet considered it, never mind accepted it.  It would be premature at this stage to take any decisions until we know what the Council decide.  I understand that our committee on EEC secondary legislation are examining this matter and the House will wish to have their views and recommendations before considering the matter further.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In principle I would see no objections to elections to the European Parliament being held on the same day in all member states provided, of course, that such a date was acceptable to all the member states.  The draft convention on direct elections adopted by the Parliament on 14th January, 1975, provides that the first elections to the European Parliament shall be held on the same day in all the member states, and not later than the first Sunday of May, 1978.  The draft convention also provides, however, that any member state may decide to hold the elections one day earlier or later than the fixed date or to spread them over two consecutive days including that day.  As the Deputy is aware, the draft convention is now before the Council and undoubtedly the question of whether elections to the Parliament should be held on a fixed date or dates in all the member states is one which the Council will consider.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question I do not see how the possible holding of elections to the Parliament on the same day in all the member states could in any way affect the constitutional right of the Taoiseach to advise the President to dissolve the Dáil at a time when the Taoiseach considers it most suitable and, accordingly, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of sectarian assassinations, which the Government regards with the gravest concern, has been raised with the British authorities on numerous occasions since we took office.  It was raised directly by me most recently during my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Merlyn Rees, in Dublin on 19th April last when I pointed out our concern at the horrifying continuation of and recent increase in sectarian killings.  Attention has repeatedly been drawn to the scale of the problem in the areas referred to by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the British authorities at present are genuinely and deeply concerned about the problem and are endeavouring to deal with it.  I am not satisfied with the success rate in this regard which over the whole period has been extraordinarily low.  The position in that particular area, as indeed in Belfast, is extremely serious.  It is something which we will continue, and have indeed continued since I saw the Secretary of State, to press.  Even in the last few days there have been further representations on the subject. Additional action is being taken but we cannot be satisfied until the people concerned have been found and dealt with, and the whole process has been stopped.  I must say there is, as yet, no sign of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the action is clearly insufficient when sectarian murders are continuing on the scale at which they are continuing.  Having said that, there are obvious difficulties of getting the necessary evidence to deal with them, even obvious evidence, because of the conspiracy of silence that seems to exist in some areas in even establishing a moral certainty as to who is responsible.  It is a problem which requires a very considerable diversion of resources towards this area, for which we have been pressing and which certainly has been taking place in recent times. We must hope that this will yield early results.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The full text of article 9 of the draft convention on direct elections to the European Parliament, which was adopted by the Parliament itself at its plenary session of 14th January, 1975, states, and I quote:</P>
      <P> 1.  Elections to the European Parliament shall be held on the same day in all the member States.</P>
      <P>2.  Any member State may, however, decide to hold the elections one day earlier or later than the fixed date or to spread them over two consecutive days including that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1583" /> 3.  The Council shall make arrangements in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14, to ensure that the election results are declared at one and the same time. </P>
    <P>As the Deputy is undoubtedly aware the provisions of the draft convention at the present time represent the proposals of the Parliament only, on which the Council is expected to act by 31st December, 1976.  There is therefore plenty of time for the member states to make the appropriate amendments to the existing provisions of the draft convention taking into account factors such as the one raised by the Deputy, if this is considered necessary.  In any event provision for amending the draft convention already exists under article 14 should it appear that further measures are required to implement direct elections to the Parliament and that the necessary powers are not provided for in the draft as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously to the Deputy, this is a hypothetical question and the conditions in which the decision would have to be made are not fully known.  However, as I also said to the Deputy at the time, it seems clear that the consequences for us of British withdrawal would be aggravated if we ourselves were also to leave the Community.</P>

      <P>The Government's position is well known.  Where we have made it known publicly at various times, in various countries, it made a considerable impact on opinion.  This is true not merely in Britain, when publicity was given to our view, but also in France and Germany.  There is no doubt that the Government's clear statement of intention has had a significant effect and has been very welcome in countries on the Continent as well as in Britain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <P>I really do not think that would be appropriate because the Government's decision in a formal sense on a matter of that kind can be taken only in the light of all the available facts, which would include of course the terms and conditions on which Britain would have commercial relations with the Community. It is our assessment that we do not envisage any circumstances in which the right answer would be for us to leave.  I think a formal decision cannot be taken on a hypothetical question.  I do not think any Government can, or should, take any formal decisions on hypothetical matters.

      <P>Although hostilities in Cambodia and South Vietnam appear to have ended, the situation in those countries is not yet wholly clear as new Governments have not yet been formally installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand however that the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the United Nations agencies most directly involved in humanitarian relief work have been in contact for some time with the Government of North Vietnam and that they are also establishing contact with representatives of the new authorities in South Vietnam and Cambodia.  The Secretary-General has <Col N="1586" /> repeatedly expressed his concern for the welfare of the civilian population and has offered maximum assistance on behalf of the various United Nations agencies.</P>
    <P>From our contacts with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, with a representative of whom I had discussions yesterday, we understand that the humanitarian work being conducted by the United Nations relief agencies will focus on three aspects:</P>
    <P> 1.  Assistance on an emergency basis to relieve distress among people in the area who have been displaced or otherwise affected by recent large-scale population movements;</P>
    <P>2.  A long-term resettlement programme for refugees within Indochina;</P>
    <P>3.  Help towards resettlement of refugees who have left Indochina. </P>
    <P>I feel sure that the Secretary-General and the United Nations agencies concerned will work through the contacts they have established to implement these programmes fully and, in these circumstances, I do not feel it is desirable to make further representations to the United Nations on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>While I welcome what the Minister has said, I think he will recognise that my question goes a little beyond that&mdash;resettlement and assurance of guarantees.  I should just like to make it clear that it is because of what one might call the rather unusual circumstances of the emergence of those two new Governments&mdash; we have not had situations like this for quite a considerable time&mdash;and not simply because those are the two countries concerned.  I would have thought that probably it would be in the interests both of the new Governments and the United Nations to establish some norm whereby in accordance with the Government's expressed intention, the refugees might even return and normality be established as soon as possible.  That could be done to ensure that people <Col N="1587" /> would not be either afraid or intimidated.  Surely there should be some consultation in these unusual circumstances.

Every effort is being made to deal with the different aspects of the problem to which the Deputy referred.  Certainly the situation is unusual.  It seems to be somewhat different from the fragmentary reports we have as between Cambodia and South Vietnam but it is one which will require a very major effort to resolve all the different aspects, including aid to the areas that have suffered during the war and the very complex problem of dealing with the refugees, which is by no means a simple one.  On that we have had consultations not merely with the United Nations but with other Governments as well.</P>

      <P>I take it the Minister agrees that in the new situation such as exists in those two countries now it is important that the United Nations should retain the closest possible contact, not just to provide against poverty or distress, but also to ensure, as far as they can after consultation with the new Governments, protection of fundamental rights and the right to life as well.</P>

      <P>There is the difficulty that neither North nor South Vietnam are members of the United Nations so the United Nations role is necessarily confined there to a relief role.  There are particular difficulties there, but I agree with the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether the case presented to the Law of the Sea Conference in Geneva by the Irish delegates which includes claims to exclusive fishing rights up to 200 miles is being made jointly with other EEC countries; if so, whether these countries will have access to waters off this country's shores from January, 1983; if not, whether Irish fleets only may fish within this limit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>All member states of the EEC except Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany and Italy accept the concept of an exclusive economic zone 200 miles in width.  In that zone the coastal states would have the right to manage the living resources and to exploit them to the maximum of their capacity, subject to rights for neighbouring states who traditionally fish in the zone to continue to do so <Col N="1590" /> on the basis of regional or sub-regional agreements.  The coastal states' rights as regards management and exploitation are, in all proposals made at the conference, directed towards conservation and rational exploitation. There is agreement among all the Community states, except Britain, that the fish which the coastal state cannot take in the zone, should be available to the fishermen of other states on the basis of a predetermined priority.  The question of access by fishing vessels of member states to fish in each other's waters is not a matter for the Law of the Sea Conference. After the expiry of the period of derogation, Community vessels will have free access to all Community waters as Community rules stand at present.  This position is, of course, accepted by all member states.  A set of draft articles was transmitted by eight of the member states to the chairman of the Second Committee together with a covering letter on the 30th April, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This means that countries which are using suction methods of extracting fish and factory ships will have free access to all the waters within the 12-mile limit which are now our own preserve and we run the risk of finding ourselves in the same situation as France and Belgium and parts of Germany which have discovered that they have no fish left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>As rules now stand, there will be for member states total access to each other's waters at the end of the period of derogation.  I emphasise &ldquo;as the rules stand&rdquo;.  I have no doubt the rules will be looked at again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to urge the Government to resist something which existing rules may oblige us to accept.  The Deputy may be interested to know that eight of the nine member states submitted to the Law of the Sea Conference at the end of April of this year and they drew up draft articles governing the fishing regime and these draft articles cover four fools-cap pages.  I do not want to weary the House reading them out but I am quite willing to do so if the Deputy wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These articles are the basis of the question and I am fully aware that the fishery waters around France and Belgium have been denuded of fish and, if these vessels are allowed free access, they will denude our seas of fish.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary will the Government resist this possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I quite understand the Deputy.  He referred a moment ago to Russian and Japanese ships.  The proposal from eight of the Nine States is that, after the expiration of this derogation period, access to fishermen of other nationalities should be on the basis of a system of priorities and a system of priority is actually proposed in one of the articles.  That does not apply to fishermen, of course, who are members of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no longer economic to fish in the waters off the coasts of France and Belgium.  If we allow other nations to fish in our waters we may find ourselves denuded of fish with consequential massive unemployment and waste of a massive investment in our fishing industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>Deputy P. J. Lalor gave me notice of his intention to raise the subject matter of Question No. 19 which appeared on the Order Paper for the 25th February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1593" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank you for giving me permission to raise this question at this time.  It seems a rather extraordinary request from me in the light of the reply to my question. On the 25th February last I asked the Minister for Education:</P>
      <P>Why his Department have refused to issue tickets to two children aged 5 and 6 years in County Laois who travel four miles to Portarlington school and who should qualify for tickets on the same basis as other families who live further from the school and have this facility.</P>
      <P>To that question there was a satisfactory reply.  The Minister stated that, having considered the inspector's report in the matter, he had decided to allow the children in question free transport to the national schools in Portarlington.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately since last Monday morning not alone has that transport been withdrawn from those children but it has been withdrawn from a total of 23 children who up to now were carried by this bus service.  I was contacted on that day by representatives of the parents of those children and told they were notified by CIE that the bus would not be calling to collect their children in future but would be travelling as far as the crossroads known as Cushina Hill Crossroads, two-and-a-half miles from Portarlington.  Up to now this school bus travelled roughly four miles out to the Bord na Móna office.  It appears to me that in an effort to realise some type of specific economy at this crucial stage a directive has been issued by the Department of Education to CIE to restrict this service. The outcome is that none of the 23 children who were up to now served by this bus service, was in school on Monday last.  I do not know what the position is today but I have no reason to believe there has been any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bus which travelled four miles to a Bord na Móna office and served 23 children has now been withdrawn. The effect of the success that appeared to have been achieved by my question of 25th February last and, as <Col N="1594" /> was indicated by the Minister in his reply, achieved by a question by my colleague, Deputy O. J. Flanagan on 23rd January and representations from my colleague, Deputy Connolly, has been nullified.  We were all satisfied that the matter was satisfactorily resolved.  The overall outcome of the issue of those two tickets is that the service has been withdrawn from 23 children, including the two children who got the service arising out of my question.  All those children have tickets but they have been told that they must travel to Cushina Hill Crossroads.  Some of them have to travel six miles and others have to travel shorter distances.  All those families are at least one-and-a-half miles away from this crossroads.  They include the Murray children, on whose behalf I was fighting previously. Then there are also the Bloomer, McHale, Bryan, Lawlor and Fitzgerald families.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the Parliamentary Secretary is here to deal with this question and I hope he can give some sort of rational explanation.  I am not looking for a rational explanation for the withdrawal of this service, I am trying, on behalf of the parents of the 23 children involved, to get a restoration of the service into this area.  The two children, who were the subject of my question on 25th February, are not the furthest away from Portarlington school.  They live four miles away from Portarlington and 3.78 miles from Walsh Island School, a rural school.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that the Department are trying to introduce a system in which all those children will be forced to go out of their own parish to the rural school at Walsh Island. Westward from the point where the bus used to come is the Monevane river which marks the boundary of the parish of Portarlington and that of Walsh Island.  All the children in the parish of Portarlington have been going to Portarlington school.  They may have been a fraction of a mile nearer to Walsh Island school but the families from this area have traditionally sent their children to Portarlington school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> There are new families in that area because this is part of the Bord na Móna development.  All of those children have been going to Portarlington school for years.  The parents of the children who have been settled in that area for a period have been going to Portarlington school.  The majority of those children belong to families who have recently arrived in that area. They are all in the parish of Portarlington and are entitled to a school service. All those children have to travel roughly one-and-a-half miles to Cushina Hill Crossroads to meet the bus.  They have to join in with the remainder of the 23 children.</P>
    <P>I contacted the CIE district manager's office at Athlone, which is the office responsible in this area, and I was told last Monday that there was nothing they could do about it, that they were acting under instructions from the Department of Education. They were asked if there was an available spot to turn at Cushina Hill Crossroads. When they said that a bus could turn safely at that crossroads the CIE office were told the service was to be restricted to there.  No pupil is picked up in the two-and-a-half mile trip from Portarlington to Cushina Hill Crossroads so all of the 23 children from this area have to walk to the crossroads to be collected.</P>
    <P>I am protesting about this and I hope I will not get from the Parliamentary Secretary an explanation which says: &ldquo;We have a transport service passing that area which goes to Walsh Island school and all those children must now go there.&rdquo;  They would be going out of the parish and they would further tax what I understand is an already over-crowded school.</P>
    <P>I was prompted to raise this matter on the 25th February by a letter from a parent published in the <i>Evening Press</i> on the 10th February.  The parent had not been in contact with me before that.  He wrote the letter because of his frustration with the school bus service. Apparently because of his success in getting tickets for his two children all the neighbouring children have now lost the service.  This is what I am protesting <Col N="1596" /> about now.  I was hoping to raise this question yesterday evening when Deputy Connolly could have joined me because he is more <i>au fait</i> with the situation in the area. He was frantic about this, too, having been approached by a number of parents.  I do not think there is any need for me to put Mr. Murray's letter, which appeared in the <i>Evening Press</i> of 10th February, 1975, on the record. That was originally my intention if the question I tabled on 25th February had not been successful.  The man criticised the Department of Education and the Minister for Education.  There was an overall criticism of the bureaucratic system.  I do not agree with that in this case.  The Department of Education are possibly being forced into the curtailing of the school transport service because of the scarcity of cash. The Minister of Education came into this House on a number of occasions and said that the Exchequer had been drained dry, that there was no money available.  Yesterday he got headlines for promising to spend an additional £8 million on secondary education.</P>
    <P>I cannot see how it adds up to £8 million but many people seem to be extraordinarily pleased with the promise.  National school pupils, particularly national school pupils living four miles from their school, who were provided with this service initially by the former Government, should not have the service withdrawn at this stage simply because of the scarcity of money.  I can see no justification for ordering the bus to stop at Cushina Hill Crossroads.  All I can do is to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to restore the service that was provided up to now and have the bus run to the Bord na Móna office.  The bus itself comes from Portlaoise which is quite a distance from Portarlington and it would be extraordinary if its driver was ordered to stop 1.6 miles short of the point where it has stopped up to now consequently discommoding 23 young children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic rule in relation to school transport is that transport is provided for a child to that child's nearest <Col N="1597" /> school.  The reason for that rule is that if it were to be departed from on a general basis one could theoretically justify buses going all over the country, criss-crossing and meeting one another on the roads going in different directions.  This would obviously cost a great deal.</P>
      <P>There would also be the difficulty that smaller rural schools could become run down because if parents thought they could get a bus to come to their door to take their children out of the rural school district into a school in a big town it would, perhaps, encourage more and more parents to take this option.  This would lead to the running down of small rural schools and a consequent loss of teaching posts in those rural schools as well as incurring considerable expenditure in having buses going longer journeys.  This is the basic rationale for this rule that transport is provided only to the nearest school.</P>
      <P>The position is that in this area of Walsh Island and Portarlington there has been traditionally a service which did not conform to this basic rule. How this came into being is a good question because it was at all times outside the rules as they obtain but come into being it did.  It entailed what is really duplication in the very exact sense of the term&mdash;two buses passing along the same stretch of road going to different schools.  The child in question had not got this service to Portarlington while others had it. When this child applied it was found that he was nearer to Walsh Island and apparently a full-scale investigation was put in train.  In view of the fact that other children were getting this concession, albeit irregularly, it was felt that at least the child in question should get the same treatment. This, basically, is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard about Deputy Lalor raising this matter on the Adjournment only today and I have not had the opportunity of personally investigating this latest development to any great extent. <Col N="1598" /> I would ask the permission of the Chair for time to investigate this further and not to give a final pronouncement at the moment.  I am sympathetic to any family who have come to expect a particular service, although they were never entitled to it and have arranged their lives around it.  I can see that there are hardships involved in the withdrawal of that service.  What you never had you never miss but what you have had you do miss.  I appreciate the point that Deputy Lalor is making.  I cannot anticipate definitely the outcome of my further investigations into the matter but I can tell the Deputy and the House that these investigations will now be instituted with the utmost speed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Parliamentary Secretary has said and the fact that he has been aware of the position for only a short while but the Parliamentary Secretary will be aware that my up-to-date information is back-dated to Monday last when the news broke and my understanding is that at that stage the children were not going to school&mdash;all 23.  It is not a question of one family; it is a question of a number who have had this service from the time it was incorporated.  I have no doubt that the Parliamentary Secretary will be receiving representations from all my colleagues.</P>
