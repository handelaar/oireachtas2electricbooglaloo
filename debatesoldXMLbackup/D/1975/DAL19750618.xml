      <P>Last night we were dealing with this amendment to section 3 (2) of the Wealth Tax Bill.  I was interrupted at various stages of my contribution last night.  I remind the House that we are dealing with this specific subsection.  It might be as well to read it out so that we can bring it back to where we started from.  Section 3 (2) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, the taxable wealth of an individual other than an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the valuation date <Col N="784" /> shall comprise only the property situate in the State to which he is beneficially entitled in possession on that date.</P>
    <P>I said that the purpose of the amendment in the name of Deputy Colley was to give an undue preference and to discriminate in favour of foreigners as against Irish nationals.  One must remember that section 3 does not deal with companies.  It deals with the possible taxable wealth of individuals, namely, shareholders.  I cannot see the sense of Deputy Colley's amendment 2 (c) which is related to those cases where the IDA have given a grant or undertaken to give a grant or subvention prior to the 5th April, 1975.  If the amendment was taken on its face it would mean that even if £1 was given to a company in which there was a foreign shareholder, and it was given by the IDA, the foreign shareholder would be exempt from tax.  As I see it, that would be the effect of the amendment.  That exemption would last for all time.  There is no time limit and no qualification whatever on it.  I do not think the Opposition spokesmen realise the fact that there was no stopping line in the running of this amendment.  It will be given <i>carte blanche</i> forever to certain people.</P>
    <P>What would happen if those shares were transferred to another firm?  It would mean that those specific shares in such a company would always be exempt from wealth tax if they were held by a foreigner.  It would mean that it could lead, if foreigners took shares in every IDA promoted company, such as a company promoted prior to the 5th April, 1975, to where the entire wealth of those people would be exempt from wealth tax. They would be in a special group and they need not necessarily be people who had originally put up finance in the original investment.</P>
    <P>This is my reading of the effect of this amendment.  I do not think that Deputy Colley intended that but I think this is the plain reading of the amendment as it stands at the moment.  I do not think this House would be blessed by the public if that exemption were given and if these people were put in that particular <Col N="785" /> category but Irish nationals had to pay tax.  There does not seem to be any reason for giving that type of exemption.</P>
    <P>Further on in this section we will be dealing with the question of being resident.  Favourable treatment is being given to foreigners relating to their investments in this country. Indeed, it stabilises an uncertain situation that existed heretofore in this country.  When we go into the section later on I think it will be found that the treatment meted out to foreign investors in this country for the purpose of wealth tax is a great deal more favourable than has been given heretofore on the matter of income tax.  It clarifies the position. Up to the present there has been no real statement of what the situation is.  Reliance was always upon a nebulous situation varying in each case but at least there are rules attempted to be laid down later on in section 3 which will make things far more secure and better delineated from the point of view of foreigners investing money in this country. Indeed, one can tell them after this section is passed what their position is.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Ruairí Brugha argued in reference to the floating of companies or business enterprises in this country, particularly if one was talking to foreigners and trying to tell them what their position would be under the tax laws.  I think the Deputy was making the case that this was going to raise a further problem from the point of view of a person assessing his financial position for the purpose of making an investment in an Irish business.  It is very much clearer and more certain to any investor to know that there is a 1 per cent charge beyond a very large threshold, that is, only 1 per cent on the net above that threshold.  Prior to that we had a situation in which the knife would fall at any time.  A person who had invested in property in this country as a foreigner found himself facing a very big death duty.  I think the Minister has given the rate for death duties as something in the region of 41 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy mentioned that point because I would have forgotten it otherwise. If you look at the returns of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to death duties and you assess where the largest amount was taken, and define the various groups on the sizes of the estates, you will find a very large proportion was taken from the higher level, an unduly high proportion.</P>

      <P>A case was made by Deputy Colley last night.  He waved a piece of paper at me, an extract from a local paper in Wexford.  I would imagine it is one of the few occasions when the local press thought I was worth reporting.  I do not know when it was.  The Deputy could probably tell me.  Deputy Colley was saying that in the higher bracket people with bigger estates would not have to pay death duties because they had discretionary trusts and non-trading companies.  I referred to the fact that these peaceful pigeons were sitting very nicely in their dovecotes until Deputy Colley put in a section in the Finance Act a few years ago which caused utter chaos among these dovecotes.  Many of these people had to start all over again in their machinations to protect themselves from death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a situation could arise whereby it would be impossible to unscramble these schemes but it might be difficult for some people to understand them when sumpt names were being used for the purpose of avoiding taxation liability.  I think that is obvious enough to anybody with any intelligence.  We see in this Act a real and proper effort being made to get behind the smokescreen of false structures. I would imagine that when this Bill was first put in print certain people dashed to their so-called tax wizards to create schemes of structures to avoid being brought within the net. <Col N="787" /> The genuineness of the transaction will be the virtual test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that were so, it would be very important under this section but the Deputy must know that the Minister says that is not the attitude being adopted in this section in relation to foreign shareholders.  You have no regard to who is the genuine owner: if it is a trading company, you forget who is the genuine owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that in relation to shareholding in a company, that is dealt with&mdash;who is the registered shareholder.  That has always been the case.  What I am talking about is where there is a facade dealing&mdash;and there are such reported cases&mdash;it means that the people behind the facade, notwithstanding the structure they have set up, have been made liable.</P>
      <P>There is a reported case in English law which runs parallel to our interpretation of taxation actually reported in the public reports.  I also think there is a section in one of our Finance Acts which gives the Revenue Commissioners power to look behind the facade and to look at the real transaction. It is possibly in relation to stamp duty.  It is important because principles are established by evolution: they just do not happen overnight.  The principle I am referring to in relation to this Stamping Act was I think in the 1950s.  The decision in the English courts was in the 1940s.  One is going back 20 or 30 years for that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well established in the death duty legislation and, indeed, in the capital gains tax legislation it is also incorporated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but what I am saying is that the principle was already there in law without it being in an Act.  This is important and this is what many of the slick boys in the taxation advisory world do not realise and have not realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It became very apparent, as this debate was progressing, that the real pressure for amendment of the Bill, after looking at the Minister's amendments, is coming from a certain select section of society who have indulged in <Col N="788" /> various taxation avoidance measures for the purposes of death duties.  I would not leave it as simply as that. In my opinion, many of these schemes were motivated by the desire to avoid paying income tax at the higher rate. Before this wealth tax was introduced the Minister reduced the higher rate of income tax from 80 per cent to 70 per cent.  This is relief for a person in that bracket.  This is lost sight of by many of the people who are wailing about this very small charge of the wealth tax on this small group.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the justification for it. I should like to hear Deputy Colley explain the time limit behind his amendment.  It only appeared last night and I referred to the fact that it was for all time.  I should like to know what his views would be on the dealings in the shares in a company, even though the subsequent purchaser of shares in such a company had never taken the risks at the foundation of the company&mdash;the transferee who comes in and buys shares.  Is that person to get the benefit of the exemption Deputy Colley seeks?  It does not make sense.  There seems no justification for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some significance that Deputy Esmonde who spoke on this amendment last night and again this morning did not once advert to what the amendment is designed to do. I made it clear that the actual wording of the amendment was not something I was wedded to but that the principle of it was a matter that I thought was of grave concern.  I did not hear Deputy Esmonde once talk about the fact that it is designed to exempt from wealth tax the shares in companies in respect of which the IDA have given grants or have given written promises of grants prior to 5th April of this year.  Deputy Esmonde did not once refer to the significance of that&mdash;that it is designed to ensure that we cannot be accused of breaching in any way undertakings given by the IDA on behalf of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For Deputy Esmonde to suggest that the amendments put down here&mdash;other than the Minister's&mdash;including this amendment, were put down on behalf <Col N="789" /> of a select few who have been indulging in tax avoidance is really too naïve and too inaccurate for Deputy Esmonde: it does not do justice to him.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of more importance is the Minister's statement on this matter last night.  It seems to me that the Minister is suffering from three major misapprehensions. The first is that he has clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of everyone concerned that non-Irish, resident shareholders in companies which have assets in this country will not be liable to wealth tax.  A discussion on that will take place on the section rather than on this amendment but the Minister will have to do a great deal more explaining before he can convince me that is the position.  I will have some questions to put to him about it.</P>
    <P>Even if it is so, it brings us to the second misapprehension under which the Minister is labouring and one to which he has referred on a number of occasions.  That is where he points out that the wealth tax applies between the shareholders and not to the trading company, as though this meant that it would not affect the trading company, that it would not affect its operations, that it would not affect its overheads and would not affect the employment it can give.  It is time the Minister gave a little thought to this problem. Clearly when he is arguing that it is not going to affect companies and, therefore, not going to affect employment, he is implicitly admitting that if it were to do that, it would be a matter of some concern.  Surely if he thinks about it he will realise that companies do not exist in a vacuum.  Factories do not exist in a vacuum.  They exist because individuals have decided to invest their money, in some cases to risk their money.  In the case of factories, they exist because, not alone have people decided to invest their money, but other people have decided to invest their work and their skills.  It is individuals we are talking about and unless the Minister can clearly demonstrate that this wealth tax, in its operations in so far as it is levied on shareholders and companies, will not affect the operation of companies and the <Col N="790" /> provision of employment by those companies, it is simply a red herring and it is misleading to talk as though the wealth tax were not going to affect trading companies.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that, of course, where shareholders are affected as a result of the wealth tax it is virtually inevitable that it will affect the company.  As I demonstrated on a previous occasion, it is not merely the amount of wealth tax that is involved but frequently what is involved is the wealth tax plus income tax on that amount.  That sum is, in fact, going to be withdrawn from the company's profits if it has profits but that leads to another point which we will deal with later.  If they have not got profits, the wealth tax will still have to be paid.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister not to introduce that red herring again unless he is prepared to demonstrate clearly and beyond any shadow of a doubt that the imposition of wealth tax on shareholders in companies cannot and will not in any way affect the operations of the companies and consequently the employment of people in those companies.</P>
    <P>The third major misapprehension under which the Minister appears to be labouring is, perhaps, even more serious, that is, that when on this side of the House we complained of discrimination against Irish people in connection with the same thing but on the basis of an explanation the Minister gave, and complained that an inhibition was being provided under this Bill on foreign investment in Irish industry, the Minister said we were being inconsistent.  I want the Minister to think very seriously about this because it goes to the root of our objection to this Bill and it is very relevant to this amendment.  Take first of all the proposition that we should not in this legislation discriminate against Irish people.  Is there anybody in this House who would object to that proposition?  Deputy Esmonde was, in fact, putting forward that proposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the effect of your amendment.</P>

    <Col N="791" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, that proposition on its own, I would suggest, nobody in this House would dispute. Let us take the other proposition and see if anybody would dispute that. The other proposition is that we should not by the effect of this Bill inhibit the investment in Irish industry by people abroad.  Is there anybody who would object to that proposition? I do not think there is.  If there is, they should be consistent and let us get rid of the IDA and stop all these grants and tax concessions we are giving, to be consistent.  Nobody in this House has ever said that, to my knowledge.  So the propositions we are putting forward are not inconsistent. If they are not, what does that mean?  It means that the Minister finds himself, in order to try to defend this Bill, in the position of saying you must choose between either discriminating against Irish people or inhibiting investment from abroad. This will be more clearly demonstrated, in fact, on the section.  That is, in effect, what the Minister is saying to us, that we are inconsistent because we claim on the one hand that there should not be discrimination against Irish people and on the other that there should not be inhibition of investment from abroad.  The logic of all this is that we are not being inconsistent in saying that because, as I have tried to demonstrate, everybody would agree with the two propositions.  The fault lies in the Bill and in the concept that you should apply a wealth tax to productive assets.  That is where the real inconsistency arises and all the other problems stem from that concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the kind of thresholds that were provided here were not provided in other countries under their wealth tax systems for the benefit of foreign investors.  That may well be so but to me it betrays again a mentality which I find very disturbing, a non-recognition of the position of this country&mdash;not any other country, but this country&mdash;of the need in this country to encourage investment from abroad as well as at home in Irish industry, of the whole necessity for the operation of the <Col N="792" /> IDA. If ever it was clear that this was needed it should be clearer than ever today with unemployment at 103,000 and, seasonally corrected, it is rising fast.  Was there ever a clearer demonstration of the need in any way we can to provide jobs and not to put any inhibition in the way of providing jobs?  Yet the Minister tells us other countries do not have these high thresholds.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister knows potential foreign investors are not interested in whether this Government or any other Government in this country propose to be nice or generous to them.  They will do the sum, and that is all.  We are competing with other countries and it is useless of the Minister to tell us that other countries who are not vitally concerned to get foreign investment as we are do not give such concessions. That is not the point.  The point is, are we by imposing wealth tax in this way going to inhibit in any way the possibility of investment from abroad in Irish industry?  That is the real question that we should be answering.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the alleged inconsistency on this side of the House demonstrates very clearly that what is basically inconsistent is the concept involved in this Bill of applying wealth tax to productive assets.  It is that concept that has got the Minister into the situation where he is asking us to choose and he himself has to choose, as will be even more clearly demonstrated on the section, between either discriminating against Irish people or inhibiting foreign investors.  In fact, he appears to have chosen to go on the basis of, as he thinks anyway, not inhibiting foreign investment but discriminating against Irish people.</P>
    <P>Because of the concept of this Bill he really has not any choice.  He has to choose one or the other.  We did not bring in this Bill and we are not going to choose.  We are in favour of both propositions, that you should not discriminate, that you should not inhibit foreign investment.  That is our position but it is not the Minister's and it is not the position of those who are supporting this Bill.  They have got themselves <Col N="793" /> into a position where they have got to choose between those two propositions.</P>
    <P>This amendment, apart from the other aspects that it raises, is primarily designed to ensure that we demonstrate in this House that we are not prepared to allow even a semblance of a suggestion to arise that we are going back on any arrangements made by the IDA with investors.</P>
    <P>I do not think that there should be anybody in this House who should object to that proposition.  As to the wording of the amendment, I am not unduly concerned about that but I am concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have said on a number of occasions including just now and the Deputy heard me, I am not tied to the wording of this amendment but I am concerned and I have asked Deputy Esmonde, and anybody on that side of the House, to say whether or not he is prepared to enact legislation in this House which will, putting it at its mildest, at least give a semblance of breaking agreements made by the IDA with foreign investors.</P>

He tells us that because he is admitting that there are foreign investors here who are going to be affected by the wealth tax.  That is the first point. Whether that number is small or large it is the first point.  The Minister has admitted that there are foreign investors who are going to be affected by the wealth tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that argument which is rather specious, if I may say with respect to the Deputy. Is the Deputy aware that presumably it is proposed to impose inheritance tax and gift tax under capital acquisitions tax?  It is misleading to talk about the wealth tax as a substitute for death duties because it is not.  We are talking about the level of money that is involved here, about the exemptions. We are talking about cases that are going to be caught by the inheritance tax and the gift tax, so it is useless to say that death duty has been taken away.  But that is not what this is all about.  When these investors invested here death duty was in operation, wealth tax was not and inheritance tax was not.  To come along now and impose a new form of capital taxation and one must look at the whole package, because that is what they are looking at, to do that in such a way as to make investments of people from abroad liable, as it is proposed to do here in this section, to wealth tax is I suggest a breach of the undertaking, but more important it is believed to be a breach of the undertaking.  That is the real point that I am trying very hard, perhaps unsuccessfully to get across to the Minister particularly.  This is not a question of debate in this House: it is not a question of whether on parsing or analysing a particular <Col N="795" /> section it can be shown that foreign investors are going to be allowed or not going to be allowed.  That is not what it is about.  What it is about is the demonstration clearly and beyond all doubt to any potential investor here that there is no intention whatever in this House of going back on any agreements made.</P>
      <P>Deputies may get up and argue that there is not any going back and I argue the opposite way but I can tell the House that we are wasting our time.  This is not what the attraction of industry from abroad is about.  It is based on confidence, not on the small print in this Bill.  It is based on the feeling which they have been able to have up to now that when they have gone through all the details with the IDA, when they made inquiries from other industrialists who had set up they could then do a deal and be sure that that was going to be stuck to.</P>
      <P>Any Deputy in this House who is in contact with people who have invested here from abroad, or perhaps others who might be thinking of it, must be aware that there is a very widespread feeling among such people that the arrangements made in the past are being gone back on.  I repeat it does not matter from the long-term point of view.  It is irrelevant whether that feeling is right or wrong.  It is there. We have got to dispel it in this House. I suggest that the best way to dispel it, at least to show that whatever new arrangements may be made with new people that is a new deal, but the best way to dispel it in regard to the past, and this is the important thing, is that we should be demonstrating clearly that there is no going back on arrangements, is something on the lines of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said on a number of occasions that I am not tied to the wording of this amendment.  Deputy Esmonde feels worried about the wording of it.  Of course the spirit of this is with the deal made primarily with the individuals.  That is what I am concerned about, because they are the people who make the decisions, it is not trading corporations who make decisions, it is individuals.  I am primarily <Col N="796" /> concerned with the reaction of individuals.  If the Deputy wishes to ensure that this proposed relief from wealth tax in this case would apply only so long as the shares were held by the individuals who held them at the time the deal was made, I would not object to that at all.  I am only concerned with the principle.</P>
    <P>I hope the Deputy can understand what is involved here.  In my view it is vital to the future prospects of industrial development here.  I must say I am very concerned at the apparently cavalier attitude adopted by a number of Deputies and Ministers on the other side of the House to this vitally important matter.  You cannot fix this in small print.  You cannot measure this in money.  This is the intangible.  This is confidence.  But it is the most important thing for the development of our economy and it is the most important thing as between the IDA and potential investors.  We have built this up over many years.</P>
    <P>We must not throw it away because we will never recover it if we throw it away.  Who is going to suffer for that?  What are we going to get out of it?  The total estimated yield of the wealth tax is £1½ million.  The amount involved in this must be infinitesimal. But what are we going to lose?  If we lose and throw away this feeling of confidence there are thousands of people who would get jobs at some time in the future and who will not get them unless we are extremely careful to retain that confidence and not to undermine it.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister that it is not a question of whether his interpretation or my interpretation is right.  That is not the issue at all. The question is what do potential foreign investors believe and how are they best assured, if it is the Government's intention that persons who mainly deal with the IDA should not be subjected to wealth tax?  If that is the Government's intention what is the best way of making that clear?  If it is not the Government's intention, if it is their intention to subject such people to wealth tax, then that should be clearly stated.  We should not be <Col N="797" /> told about thresholds and that trading corporations are not affected, that people who hold shares in trading companies abroad, which in turn control corporations here, will not be affected.  None of that is relevant to this issue if, in fact, the Government's intention is to apply that tax to the assets of investors from abroad who have invested here.  If that is the intention we should be clearly told so that we know where we stand.  But to try to suggest that those people will not be subjected to wealth tax and, at the same time, to refuse to make that clear beyond any doubt is merely getting the worst of both situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not made it quite clear to us and, more importantly, to potential investors what the Government's intention is in this matter.  Is it intended that persons who invested in this country in the past on the strength of undertakings with which the Minister will be familiar, given by the IDA will be subjected to wealth tax?  Is the Minister saying: &ldquo;Yes, they will and that is no breach of the arrangements made.&rdquo;  If that is what he is saying, let us argue that case and not confuse it with the question of non-liability.  If that is not the case the Minister is making then let him accept this amendment, or something very similar to it, so that there is no doubt in anybody's mind where we all stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a great deal to be gained by doing this but there is even more to be lost by failing to do it. When the Minister was replying last on this matter he spoke about individuals but he did not advert to either investment companies, private non-trading companies or discretionary trusts&mdash;the former more likely, but the latter also a possibility.</P>

I am not concerned with the precise wording of this amendment, but I am concerned with the principle involved and what it is trying to achieve.  No amount of debating in this House will alter the effect of what we are doing on the minds of potential investors and on the effect that may have, if we do the wrong thing, on the creation of jobs.</P>

      <P>There are a few remarks I should like to make in regard to this section to which Deputy Colley has addressed himself at length. My remarks are by way of preface. Where wealth tax is concerned, of course, it is in a capital taxation area and it can give rise to a great deal of valid criticism.  There are many areas in which we might have agreed reservations but, on this section, which we have been debating since last night and again this morning, the Opposition have gone overboard with unrelated sweeping criticisms of an entirely generalised nature.  This attitude is not particularly helpful.  In talking about this section, as it relates to foreign investment and industry, if there is a question of a feeling abroad, in a literal sense, that the Government are using penal capital taxation which will reduce the level of investment, then the speeches and attitude of the Opposition to this section are merely adding fuel to one or two possible flames.  Indeed, certain speeches from the Opposition benches are tending to create a problem which does not exist at the moment.</P>
      <P>Last night we heard speeches about foreign investment and one Deputy insisted on talking about this Government imposing capital taxation on foreign companies.  The Deputy completely ignored the fact that, for a start, wealth tax is assessed on the individual company and not on the public company, the limited company or the multi-national company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not had time to check out the statistics with the IDA but, where foreign investment in manufacturing industry is concerned, the proportion of development in the hands of private <Col N="799" /> individuals from outside the country must be quite small.  Deputy Colley yielded on the point that the amount from this particular section in terms of taxation will be infinitesmal.  This is the inescapable reality and it is a complete exaggeration of the position to say foreign investment will be frightened out of the country as a result of this legislation because, in critical areas, such as those of substantial capital investment, these investors and financial controllers tend to read the small print in the same way as we are doing.  The decision is not a split decision; it is not an off-the-cuff decision as, perhaps, the decision to take a holiday in the country would be.  We know the difficulties Bord Fáilte have had in recent years because of the trouble in the North in trying to attract tourists here.  But this would be a surface judgment.  It is an entirely different matter where manufacturing investment is concerned.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the IDA are on record as saying that, despite all the problems in the North, despite the supposed penal nature of mining legislation which, we were told two years ago would scare off manufacturing industry, the mining legislation at that time has had a zero effect in this area of capital investment in manufacturing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>An effort should be made to set out the picture.  There had already been a wealth tax in existence in the form of estate duty, which is, in effect, a wealth tax.  The retort of the Opposition when we make this statement and refer to estate duty taxation is a facile rejection by telling us you can make provision against estate duty. It is equally possible to make provision against wealth tax because even in a tiny proportion of cases where foreign investment in this country is in the hands of individuals, possibly in a family situation, there is nothing to stop these people in arranging investments in limited companies in this country, in arranging a spread of the holding of shares among members of the family, among boards of directors of the companies.  By so doing they are going to reduce terrifically any question of liability where wealth tax is concerned.</P>
      <P>We are talking about taxation matters and the legitimate thing people will do under existing legislation to escape the net.  This is the point we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I have stated on such holdings where estate duty was concerned.  We are talking about substantial undertakings, that is grants, capital investments and complete relief from taxation on export sales for 15 to 20 years and the reducing levels of relief, and all these have been adhered to by the Government.</P>
      <P>Indeed, the Minister for Industry and Commerce was on record at the time of the mining speeches as stating that it was not the Government's intention to cut back on these major incentives.  Again, if we are talking about foreign companies and their investment possibilities around the world, reference was made to comments made by one or two people in the United States.  We should put into perspective the fact that this country in terms of incentives offered has been offering the greatest range of incentives in the developed world.  We are prepared to pay the price for such investment because we are a relatively underdeveloped country.  We need employment and foreign capital.  Let us not get away from the fact that the price we are paying is enormous.</P>
      <P>Recently in one or two debates on capital taxation it was pointed out that the tax base in this country is weak because in a normal developed country there is an immense tax base for manufactured industry which does not exist in this country to a fraction of the same extent because of these concessions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.  Contrast this vast range of incentives which exist in this country in the form of capital grants&mdash;export total tax relief on sales, CTT assistance, IIRS assistance and the whole range down to the point of baling out through Fóir Teoranta if there are critical problems, not to mention the Industrial Credit Corporation and long-term loans which are practically automatic if one gets through the IDA&mdash;with an American company in Japan, for example.  Japan, in <Col N="802" /> taking investment from other countries for manufacturing industry, will not allow majority participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Japan is trying to discourage it, we are trying to encourage it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that countries abroad who are talking about investment possibilities, are looking at a number of countries.  For example in Japan there must be a majority shareholding by Japanese interests, there must be a majority on the board of directors and in many cases there must be Japanese management.  There are a great many restrictions.  If Americans look at western Europe they will see that there is no comparison between the opportunities for investment in EEC countries and this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have retained this range of incentives to which I have referred, and have turned around and introduced a wealth tax which, to a degree, is a replacement for a penal situation which had existed in the State due to taxation. We have not got the statistics, but we know the proportion of foreign investment in manufacturing industry in this country in private hands is infinitesimal and it is Cinderella-stuff to attempt to tell us that this section is going to undermine confidence in Ireland.  It is a lot of nonsense in my view and it is exaggerating it out of proportion.</P>
      <P>If, as we debate this wealth tax section by section, we give some sections a significance it does not merit, we will have a less desirable debate because obviously we will spend more time than we should on relatively unimportant matters.  In doing this we will create the type of environment that might possibly scare off people rather than the sections of the Bill.  There is a great deal of publicity at the present time about this wealth tax because it is absorbing so much time in the House and the types of speeches being made lead to banner headlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Obviously when we pass the point of debating this issue in the House and it is on the statute books, we will get back to a saner position when everything will be in prospective.  There is no question, and it is unfair of the Opposition to suggest, that we are reneging on commitments made, for the various reasons I have given.  There is not much more that I want to say. I merely wanted to address those few remarks on this section dealing with foreign investment.  I would like to come back to my original remarks.  Of course, we can have reservations.  We may be disturbed about the possibility of this tax being a precedent and the thresholds being reduced.  These are all very valid points, but criticisms of a more sweeping nature in specific sections without relating them to reality are not very helpful.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley speaking some time ago suggested that there were certain options open to the Minister for Finance in relation to shares held by non-residents here, by people who are not domiciled or ordinarily resident here.  I would like to put on record that under the policy pursued by the Opposition, it was not necessary for them to opt at all.  Their policy in regard to taxation in general was to let an out-dated system of taxation jog merrily along.  It is true that that sort of policy did not call for any opting or thinking.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no danger that this Government will do anything to discourage foreign investments from coming here. Indeed, it was an inter-Party Government which established this system of attraction under the Export Tax Relief Act, 1956.  It was a Coalition Government which established the IDA.  It is very good to hear the Opposition <Col N="804" /> thinking so highly of the Industrial Development Authority and of the tax reliefs provided by the inter-Party Government in 1956, because their policy, at that time, was to oppose it and in Government they said they would not work it.</P>

This section deals with individuals and subsection (2) of this section provides that only the wealth of a non-national which is in this country shall be taxed.  It deals specifically with individuals.  Deputy Colley's amendment proposes to exclude the shares in grant-aided companies up to 5th April last possessed by people who are not domiciled and ordinarily resident here.  Deputy Colley concedes that if that were to be an ongoing operation, if that were to continue <i>ad infinitum</i> in regard to those shares, that it would be an absurdity.

I think Deputy Colley concedes that to continue the relief he seeks in respect of these shares, no matter who holds them, would not be warranted and would be unreal.  That is the position.  That would be the position under the amendment.  I can tell the Deputy that his amendment will not relieve anybody.  Its value is insignificant. Any such amendment, no matter <Col N="805" /> how it is couched, under this section will not attain what he seeks to attain. I am informed that the shares held by foreign individuals are absolutely insignificant.  This might have some relevance for debate only under section 6 of this Bill but it is not relevant here.  I believe that Deputy Colley realises that it is not important or helpful here.</P>
      <P>The allegation that we are going back on undertakings given or on representations made is simply not true.  No undertaking was ever given in regard to capital taxation. Foreigners who were interested in investing money here were aware that there was capital taxation here.  They knew that our system of taxation provided for a rather severe system of capital taxation in the form of death duties.  They were not under any misapprehension about it.  The only assurances they received was that income from exports would be exempt from tax and that continues to be the way.</P>

Foreign investors coming here will find out the facts and do their sums and if they do their sums in regard to this matter they will find they are better off under the proposals which we have introduced than they were under Deputy Colley's arrangement, the arrangement that existed when we came into office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid we must be at cross purposes here.  The fact is that this amendment relates to shares in a company which has received a new industry grant from the IDA prior to 5th April of this year.  Any one of the taxable persons envisaged under this Bill could be in possession of those shares.  It could be an individual, it could be a private non-trading company, or it could be a discretionary trust.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am making.  This amendment deals only <Col N="809" /> with the individual.  What I am saying is that of course there could be the other kinds of persons involved in this, but I do not propose to put down an amendment to each one of these in order to bring this out.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that, if the Minister accepted the purpose of the amendment, I would expect him then to get the parliamentary draftsman to produce a suitable amendment covering all of the possible persons, in the legal sense, who could be involved in this.  The real thing is that the Minister does not accept the purpose of the amendment.  We can obscure this issue very easily by going around in circles.  The real issue is that the Minister does not accept that we should not apply wealth tax to shares in companies which got new industry grants from the IDA prior to 5th April, 1975.  The Minister does not accept that proposition, and that really is what the debate boils down to.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister is wrong in refusing that.  He says the number of individuals involved is infinitesimal.  I have tried to point out that if he accepted the principle, I would expect that he would apply it all round.</P>
      <P>Let us take the individuals.  If there was only one individual involved, and of course there are more, the question is: is this good or bad that it should be done?  Will it help our industrial development if we apply wealth tax to an individual who has invested here on the basis of certain arrangements and understandings with the IDA?  In this amendment I am not trying in any way to tie the hands of the Government in regard to the future.  I am simply trying to ensure that it will be clearly demonstrable that anybody engaged in negotiations with the IDA resulting in a new industry grant prior to the 5th April of this year, will be in a position where it will be seen that we in this House took precautions to ensure that nobody could say there was any going back on any arrangements or deals made.  That is the purpose of this amendment, and I do not care if it is reworded, if it is applied on a broader basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with that.  What <Col N="810" /> I am concerned with is establishing in this House that we demonstrate that we are conscious of arrangements made by the IDA and that we are conscious of the dangers of even appearing to breach those arrangements. I have made it as clear as I can what the dangers are of not making that clear.  Those dangers bear no relation to the amount of tax, or anything else that is involved here, but relate to the future development of this country.  In my view it is not good enough for the Minister to say or, indeed, for one of the Deputies in his party to say, that speeches of this kind are dangerous and may induce people not to invest here.  In my view this legislation and, indeed, the legislation going with it should on its face have made it absolutely clear that there was no question of going back on arrangements.</P>
    <P>I do not want to broaden the scope of this discussion, but the necessity for this legislation to make it clear that there was no going back on arrangements was highlighted by the fact that the Government did go back on arrangements in regard to mining.</P>

      <P>I am totally against it.

To go back on that was the most damaging thing we could have done. There was practically nothing involved with the Exchequer.  I am glad the Minister said what he did because clearly he has not got the point of what this amendment is about.  That is what it is about&mdash;not going back <Col N="811" /> on agreements made and demonstrating that we are not going back.  That is what it is about.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know no such thing. If one applies it as one must do, and if the Minister is talking about death duties not being abolished, and if they are not going to be levied he must admit that the very least he has got to do is to look at what is substituted for them.  It is not just wealth tax.  It is inheritance tax, gift tax and capital gains tax plus wealth tax.  He knows that.  If you apply that test you will find perhaps quite a different situation when you are talking about the levels of investment in industry that were involved here.  Again, I do not want to depart from what we are discussing here.  It makes it all the more important in relation to this amendment that in the capital gains tax there is a very clear breach of the undertaking given that proceeds of investments&mdash;profits and so on&mdash;could be taken away freely and without inhibition.  However, we discussed that before and I am not going to pursue it.  What I am saying is that the whole package introduced by the Government has to be looked at.  I believe that it is going to operate in breach of agreements already made. It is only those cases I am concerned with where agreements have already been made.  If I am wrong in that, and if it is not in breach of it it is not important whether I am right or wrong or whether the Minister is right or wrong.  What is important in the national implications is what is believed by the investors, actual and potential.  That is the kernel of this whole thing.  If the Minister feels that such people are not going to suffer in any way, let us assume he is right. Is there any objection to making it quite clear in the Bill by spelling it out and doubly underlining it that such people are not going to lose?  There is nothing to be lost to the Exchequer if the Minister is right by saying such <Col N="812" /> people are not going to lose, but there is a great deal to be gained in the development of this country and the provision of jobs for our people in making it clear beyond any shadow of doubt that we do not intend in this House on either side in any way to breach the undertakings given.</P>
      <P>I have tried to demonstrate the need for this clear underlining.  If the Minister does not accept it there is nothing I can do about it.  We have done our best to demonstrate it.  I rather get the impression that Ministers and some Deputies on the other side of the House have not yet grasped the vital importance of confidence when you are dealing particularly with foreign investors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that as far as I am personally concerned I have been very heavily engaged in this capital taxation legislation. The way the business has been ordered by the Government is such that there are long hours, very long sittings, and the capital gains tax legislation was followed on the same day by wealth tax.  Therefore, my opportunity of drafting amendments has been extremely limited.  What I have tried to do simply is as far as possible to get across the idea in the amendment of what I am trying to achieve but leaving it on the basis that if it is acceptable the Minister will have it drafted by the parliamentary draftsman.  That is the basic approach I have had.  The omission of debentures <Col N="813" /> is of no significance.  I just did not even think of debentures.  I wanted to get across the idea in the drafting of this.  I said shares or stocks.  There may have been a reference to that in some other section or something like that.  But there is no significance in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I wondered.  Your amendment was originally timeless. Now you see the point that there could be a time element in this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There could.  I would be prepared to pay that price one hundred times over rather than damage the reputation of this country in the field of industrial development and the attraction of industry from abroad. Maybe I have an obsession with this. I was Minister for Industry and Commerce for a number of years.  I really put my heart into this business.  I was successful, though I say it myself, in what I did and in what the IDA did at that time.  I am very conscious of what was done at that time and what has been done since and what can be done in the future.</P>
      <P>It is tragic for this country if preoccupation with tiny little things like whether there is going to be a certain amount of wealth tax payable by an individual who has shares here in the kind of company we are talking about here is going to damage our whole campaign for attracting industry.  The object of this exercise is to try to ensure that we do not do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I want to say a few brief words on this.  What tempted me at all to say a few words was the remark of Deputy Staunton that Opposition members were making speeches which may be damaging to future investors. We are only reflecting the views of the public.  Before this debate started and since this White Paper was first published in February, 1974, views have been expressed by business concerns throughout this country.  The views of the FUE are well-known.  They have no political leanings.  They may have political leanings privately but as a body I would not say they have. They have expressed views and great concern about the whole capital taxation <Col N="814" /> package.  Every one of them who has protested over the past two years has singled out the wealth tax as the tax that would be detrimental to the economic expansion of our country.</P>
      <P>We must next take the views of the NFA.  They have expressed the same view.  The Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association have expressed their views.  Let us take the view of many of our leading economists.  Take the views of the Chambers of Commerce throughout the country which have held their annual general meetings. Before this Bill was debated in this House these people and these organisations which are concerned with the economic expansion of the country but not with scoring political points have expressed their views in no uncertain fashion indicating that the wealth tax would be detrimental to the economic expansion of the country.  We must get that perfectly clear.  It is the duty of the Opposition, in my opinion, to reflect the views of these people.  The Government have failed to heed the warnings of these responsible members of the community.  They are not just single politicians like the people in this House but are combined organisations representing a huge volume of investment in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the members of the FUE.  See the number of employees they represent. It is they who have been expressing doubt and dissatisfaction up to this very day.  They have never let up on this Bill.  They have said quite explicitly that this would be damaging for foreign investors.  They have specifically mentioned that in an effort to get investment into this country. That is why we are here opposing this Bill, not to protect the wealth of the individual.  These organisations have expressed the view that it would be damaging to the employment content of individual firms.  I do not believe the amount of money we will get will be very substantial&mdash;£3 or £4 million. It is of no significance.  It could be given to one factory as a grant to get it started&mdash;and far more.  We are talking of small figures, but we could be doing something very damaging and that is undermining confidence. <Col N="815" /> For the amount of money concerned in this Wealth Tax Bill, it is a waste of time in my opinion where industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>But it has a psychological affect and that is what we must think about. Deputy Colley's amendment is a minor amendment but the thinking behind it is to ensure that contracts made before April, 1975, would be all right.  Deputy Colley has pointed out that the amounts of money involved if this particular amendment was conceded would be inconsiderable but the Government would be showing that they are honouring commitments and contracts made.  That is the most important thing about it.</P>
    <P>I am not going into the legal and technical aspects&mdash;these are for legal men&mdash;but I can see from a business point of view that if you dishonour a contract it is very hard to build up confidence afterwards.  If the various responsible bodies in this country on whom we are depending to expand our industries are concerned we must take heed of their warnings.  They do not say this for nothing.  Various types of taxation have gone through the House: they have to determine something for a short term.  We will see the Budget if it comes out: it will be criticised by various organisations. But the responsible bodies of this country that I have already mentioned, FUE and the farmers' organisations, the chambers of commerce and various other people who are concerned about economic expansion, are concerned and, if they are concerned, I believe we should be concerned in this House regarding this matter.  Contracts which were made before 1975 with foreign investors gave tax-free exports, and capital grants as regards construction and they knew exactly where they stood.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has already said that if you study the capital gains tax, to a certain extent we probably have breached our contract too.  These things can have a fundamental and psychological affect where foreign investors are concerned and we must ensure that this country retains the <Col N="816" /> attractions which it has over European countries.  The volume of activity, naturally and the volume of population are within the European countries, like Germany, France and countries such as this.</P>
    <P>It is very effective for a manufacturer to go into the centre of activities where transportation costs are much lower than to come to a country here on the western shores of Europe where transportation costs of raw material coming in and the finished goods going out are high.  We must give some attraction to cover these costings.  If not he would be very inclined to move his investment to Central or Western Europe where he would not be subject to the cost of transportation as regards raw material and finished goods.</P>
    <P>Any attraction which we give here &mdash;and they are given by the IDA&mdash;is of vital importance but otherwise in my opinion industrialists would not come.  We had the attraction in the past of our lower manufacturing unit cost.  That has been completely eroded over the past two or three years by inflation.  The unit cost of today is on a par with that of any Western European country.  That is the position we shall find ourselves in when foreign investors are researching the potentials of this country as regards labour costs, financial arrangements and transportation costs.  On these they will decide whether to site their factories in this country.  We may not have the attraction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> These are all factors that we have to take into consideration and we must give these advantages to industrialists if they are to come.  In his amendment Deputy Colley is not very demanding.  In effect, what it is <Col N="817" /> saying is, if you make a contract, honour it.  If a country makes a contract with a foreign investor coming into this country, then this should be honoured.  That is what Deputy Colley is looking for in this amendment.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure that no foreigner will come to this country and say: &ldquo;We know what your conditions are now, A, B, and D.  We know these exist but what guarantee will we have that they are not changed?&rdquo;  The Government will say: &ldquo;We do not do a thing like that; once we sign a contract or an undertaking you have our solemn word it will not be changed.&rdquo;  Then they will say: &ldquo;What about your mining?  What about your wealth tax? Have you not a breach of contract there?&rdquo;  How does one get over that? That is the question that will be asked by people who know the score.  When they invest in this country, it is not for today or tomorrow, it is a long-term investment.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider seriously Deputy Colley's amendment. It will not involve much money and I believe, in the long run it will restore confidence, which is badly needed in this country at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to misinterpret you.  When people come to this country to start a business they enquire through their banks, possibly, in the first instance, what the general financial structure is in the State.  They go to the IDA, the ICC and other State organisations and bodies in the private sector to be advised.  We would do the same if we were going abroad to invest. We would go to a bank, with probably a letter of introduction from our own banker and we would start there&mdash;possibly some other commercial contact that we would know in this country that exists in the foreign country.</P>
      <P>What would a foreign investor have found when he comes to this country? He would have found the export relief, the grants, the availability of sites, the general goodwill on the part of planning authorities to help him if at all possible, generally, a feeling of goodwill by Irish nationals where they are setting up an industrial project. We all have the view, we all have expressed, publicly and privately, that those people coming in here as Deputy Colley said, take out the pen, take a sheet of paper and you work out the pounds, shillings, and pence, the pluses, the minuses and when you have made a plus, what is the tax situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one thing that we could not put in a brochure in this country to any foreigner was our high and penal rate of death duties.  That had to be kept out of our brochures, it was too dangerous, too damaging.  Now we are talking about the individuals who go to make up an investment project, and the individuals that we are dealing with under this Bill.  It is the individuals who pay estate duty at a heavy rate, at an early stage.  Let us be fair. The average person who came into this country to invest in an industrial project would have been a person approximately over the age of 40 or 50 years, because they had acquired capital.  They are of the age-group <Col N="819" /> that had the money.  After making money in their own country, they enlarged and came to Ireland.  The very group that were faced with penal death duties on their property within this State&mdash;and this is the important fact to remember&mdash;now get the benefit of the threshold.  Long before that was reached they were paying and could have paid death duties at over 40 per cent.  This is a very serious aspect, and it would have been a tax on capital.</P>
    <P>All Deputies in this House who have taken the trouble of examining specific cases, rather than the run of the norm, in our constituencies, have seen businesses closed because of death duties.  I know in my own constituency the damage this has done.  I have to say the pleas over the years by people did fall on deaf ears.  I am not accusing Deputy Fitzpatrick of having a deaf ear, because he probably had no say in it, but others did and did not realise the damage it was doing to the structure of Irish business.  It was getting to the stage that where a man went to a bank or a finance house to borrow money for business and put up assets, the real concern of the lending body was to find out what was the state of health of the man who was borrowing because there was a swinging possibility and probability of heavy taxation from death duties.</P>
    <P>How could a person investing in this State, in Irish property as an individual be complacent about that position? God calls us; we do not know when we are going to go, and that was the situation so far as death duty legislation was concerned.  There was no guarantee that the axe might not fall the day after the factory opened. The major shareholder died and it went in paying duties.  Remember this, that charge for death duties was not up in the clouds, it was a specific charge on the assets, and it was a charge that it would take something like 50 years to equal under the present wealth tax proposals.  But that charge could have been cleared&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Quite outside anything dreamt of in estate duty or death duty legislation.  It bears no comparison. For the foreigner coming into this country to invest now as compared with a year ago, this is a far better country to come to taxationwise, both in regard to income tax and allowances given in respect of capital investment which are far better than anything that was there years ago.  But the main thing is that the axe of death duties is not coming in to wreck businesses.  Deputy Fitzpatrick knows the number of Irish businesses around the city of Dublin that have ceased to exist because of death duties.</P>

There was a thing that many people do not realise, and it is this, that people were so terrified about death duties that they did not even bother going to their solicitor to probate the will or to administer the estate.  They were too terrified to face up to the load that was facing them.  There were a lot of false situations existing because of that in Irish business and on the agricultural scene.  I do not hear anybody saying &ldquo;Thank God for the abolition of death duties&rdquo; from the other side of the House but I gave a commitment at the last general election, as did my fellow Deputies, in respect of death duties.  We followed that.  We stand over it.</P>

I am very much shocked at the ignorance of some of these bodies.  I do not know <Col N="822" /> whether this has been deliberate on the part of certain advisers.  I am almost driven to that point of view at the moment.  I have been more than surprised at some of the letters that have been written to me about various aspects of wealth tax and I would imagine the writers would have an adviser.  Statements have been made in this House by Deputies who have been supplied with the Minister's amendments to the Bill, who are not aware of the amendments and have made speeches as if the amendments did not exist and have made speeches here in this House without realising what is in the Bill.

      <P>Yes, and Deputy Colley is aware of my views on that. I will deal with section 14 when we come to do it because there is a lot to be said on that section.  There was a matter mentioned and I hope I am not taking it out of context.  I referred to it and I said that I had said &ldquo;anon&rdquo; in relation to the question of the farmer being the shareholder. There is a very grave danger here of a nominee shareholder being in the company.  I can see Deputy Colley's <Col N="824" /> imaginative mind ticking over when I refer to that little aspect and it could be open to terrible abuse&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, Deputy. The Deputy was here in the nice secluded confines of this House and I was outside the House, and as a practicising lawyer I know what was done with nominees and front men to avoid certain of the tax measures that were already contained in Finance Acts. This is a very serious objection to the amendment of the section as proposed by Deputy Colley.  I think it is just the opening of the floodgates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I know but it is the share that you are following, that is the difficulty.  I do not think Deputy Colley will suggest that the IDA were doing nothing prior to 5th April of this year.  There are a tremendous number of companies which have been aided by the IDA.  The IDA have done sterling work.  I suppose their hand is on practically every manufacturing industry, in one way or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>That is foreign to this country?  I class them all as Irish industries.  If we are going to get into distinctions like the fact that they are foreign owned it will take a long time to sort it out.  We would regard a great number of our industries as Irish industries even though there is quite a bit of foreign interest somewhere along the line.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties.  It might be found that a foreigner who had an interest in the ground on which a factory is built might get away with Deputy Colley's suggestion.  I feel this is another danger.  I understand what Deputy Colley is trying to achieve but I think it is a very dangerous line to take, as far as Irish industry is concerned. It would be open to so much abuse and I do not see how you could delimit it.  As he said if it is on a pure foreigners basis, there are very few and I do not think there would not be any injustice created by having them within the confines of the Bill as they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I do not want to go into this at any length.  The net position for the foreign investor has improved, as Deputy Esmonde has said.  The abolition of estate duties has been a major attraction. I shall deal with that point very briefly before I conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure if Deputy Colley gives some considerable thought to his amendment he will see it simply will not work, even in regard to the individuals because if the foreign individual keeps the shares in his own name he will be taxed on the income in his own country, in Germany, Holland or wherever he is.  In that way he will lose the export relief and will be gaining nothing.  Therefore, as Deputy Colley knows, these shares are rarely kept in the hands of individual foreigners.  They are either taken by foreign trading companies in the first instance or, in a rare case, where they are taken by individuals, they are put into holding companies so that they will get tax reliefs from their own countries.  If they were to be subject to tax on income in their own countries and gained relief from wealth tax here they would be no better <Col N="826" /> off.  In fact, they would probably be much worse off.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the IDA and the fact that the Government's proposals would hinder the IDA in their activities to attract foreign investment. The Government's proposals would not have this effect.  The Government's proposals will help the IDA to get on with their business.  I believe the IDA always appreciated that death duties were a hindrance to them in attracting foreign investment here.</P>
    <P>I have before me the industrial incentives compiled by the IDA dated November, 1974.  This was a publication that was sent abroad in order to let people who were going to invest here see what the taxation position here is and, having dealt with reliefs from income taxation, it goes on to deal with taxes based on capital.  It states in paragraph 11:</P>
    <P>Estate duty: This is a tax on property which is paid on the owner's death and is levied on the following scale: up to £10,000 free; between £10,000 and £11,000 4 per cent; up to £12,500 6 per cent; £15,000 8 per cent; £17,000 10 per cent; £20,000 12 per cent; £25,000 14 per cent; £30,000 16 per cent; £35,000 18 per cent; £40,000 21 per cent; £45,000 24 per cent; £50,000 27 per cent; £55,000 30 per cent; £60,000 33 per cent; £75,000 37 per cent; £100,000 41 per cent; £150,000 45 per cent; £200,000 50 per cent; over £200,000 55 per cent.</P>
    <P>The note says:</P>
    <P>In the case of estates not exceeding £100,000 net value there is an abatement of estate duty payable on the benefits taken by the widow or dependant children of the deceased.  The abatement is limited to £4,000 as respects benefits taken by the widow and £2,000 as respects benefits taken by each dependant child.</P>
    <P>And again there is a note which says:</P>
    <P>Proposals for a new scheme of capital taxation: the Government is considering a new scheme of capital taxation which could replace estate duty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> That was circulated throughout the world as an attraction and an incentive to foreign investors.  The IDA, in pointing out the position in regard to estate duty and pointing out that it would be abolished, thought that would be an attraction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is purely factual. The IDA is right to give the factual position&mdash;in other words to give notice of the fact that the situation may change.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am saying that what it means is that, hopefully, we will get rid of the above system of taxation and introduce another.  That is what we are doing.  The net result is that the position has improved.  Nobody ever promised to any potential foreign investor that we will abolish death duties and put nothing in its place.  That undertaking was never given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> They came here in the knowledge that death duties were a form of capital taxation in operation and no undertaking, or promise, or assurance, or hope was ever given that these would be abolished.  Therefore it is perfectly rational to abolish this harsh, unjust, unbearable in some respects, form of taxation both for resident nationals and for foreigners and to replace it by a reasonable system of taxation. That is what we are doing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the opposition to this Bill is much ado about nothing.  The White Paper was introduced first followed by the Bill.  There were consultations right across the board with all sections of the community interested. We had discussions with the IFA. <Col N="828" /> Perhaps I went too far last week in saying they had no objection to it. I followed Deputy Flor Crowley and perhaps he was not a good precedent to follow; he seemed to be attacking the IFA for not protesting.  The fact is we had broad discussions with the IFA and, while anybody would prefer there would be no taxation at all&mdash; that would be an ideal situation&mdash;the White Paper was altered substantially to meet the representations made by the IFA.  As I pointed out yesterday, there are no fears in this Bill for the farming community.  We also met industry and, by and large, all reasonable representations have been met.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's amendment would not achieve what he seeks to do.  The position in regard to capital taxation where foreign investors are concerned is improved by this Bill.  If Deputy Colley and Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick were here as practical people, men of common sense, men with a knowledge of industry rather than as politicians, they would be shouting: &ldquo;Hurrah, death duties are gone.  The capital taxation position has improved.&rdquo; That is the message they would be getting across instead of the message of doom and disaster that they are preaching here.

      <P>The very interesting point is that, as the Minister is well aware, four days before the last election the leader of his party, the present Taoiseach, wrote a letter in which he said that there would not be a wealth tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to pursue that matter.  I want to place on record that the leader of his party was saying the direct opposite at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the bulk of what the Minister has been saying now, and what Deputy Esmonde was saying before him, was dealing with death duties and their alleged iniquity and so on.  I explained to the Minister at some length before that when I put in this amendment I was not tied <Col N="830" /> firstly to its exact wording and, secondly, that I intended by this to indicate a certain line of approach, and, if the Minister accepted that line of approach, I would expect him to ensure that amendments would be produced by the parliamentary draftsman in line with what he would have accepted, which would, of course, apply to more than individuals, to investment companies and so on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, I think correctly, that in the great bulk of cases shares of companies assisted by the IDA, by new industry grants, are held by their other trading companies or investment companies.  Of course, if the Minister wants to follow up the death duty situation through that chain he will find that death duties were not a reality in the situation he has been describing, which is the bulk of the cases of these investments.</P>
    <P>However, I would suggest that this is really irrelevant.  What is relevant is that we in this House should underline, and doubly underline if we can, that there is no intention of departing in any way from agreements made or undertakings given with or by the Industrial Development Authority. That is what this is all about.  The Minister seems to be saying &ldquo;there is not a breach of any undertaking given, but if there is the people are better off than they were under the previous position&rdquo;.  He seems to be ignoring the major point I was putting forward which was that whether there is a breach or not, if there is any widespread belief that there is such, then we ought to counteract it in this Bill.  I believe that point is vitally important from the point of view of future development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick has very lucidly put forward aspects of this that arise, but it does not seem to make any difference.  The Minister either does not believe us or he believes us but is not prepared to do anything about it.  That being so I do not think we can put the matter any further.</P>

    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2 d:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, subsection (3), lines 32 to 36 inclusive, to delete &ldquo;the whole or the appropriate part of the property in which the limited interest subsists or on which it is charged or secured or on which the individual is entitled to have it so charged or secured shall be property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the taxable wealth <Col N="833" /> of the individual in relation to such property shall be such sum as that limited interest would fetch if sold on the open market on the valuation date, having due regard to the age and state of health of the individual&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section provides that where a person is entitled to the possession of a limited interest which interest is charged on profits, then the person entited to the limited interest is deemed to be entitled in possesion and the limited interest is valued on the basis of the value of the property on which the limited interest is charged.  This can produce not only a number of anomalies but plain injustices. The amendment is designed to provide that in such a case the limited interest is to be valued on the basis of its open market value having regard to the age and state of health of the individual.  The age is particularly important.  The state of health may present some further difficulties but the age is important.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of one kind of case that can operate under the section as it is drafted if this amendment is not accepted.  If we take an individual who is 80 years of age with a life expectancy of, say, five years, who has a life annuity of £500 charged on a fund valued at £10,000 at the valuation date and which is yielding say, £1,000, per annum.  In that case the limited interest of that annuitant would be valued at £500 over £1,000 multiplied by £10,000 which works out at £5,000, while the real value on an actuarial basis is £2,500.  So in that case the consequence of the section as drafted is that the person who has a life annuity of £500 is assessed on the basis of taxable wealth of £5,000 while the real value on an actuarial basis is £2,500.  In other words, the valuation under this section is double what it is on an actuarial basis.</P>
    <P>There are cases where an annuity or other limited interest is secured by what is valuable property yielding little or no income.  The owner of the limited interest has, of course, no power of disposal over this property <Col N="834" /> for his own benefit.  The property might be a residence and pleasure grounds yielding little or no income, but the person who has the annuity charged on it is treated as if his taxable wealth included the capital value of that residence and pleasure garden. It would seem, under these provisions that, say, a retired employee on a large estate who has been given an annuity of, say, £250 per year under the will of the former owner charged on the estate, may be assessable to wealth tax on the basis of the value of the estate.  I am sure this is not what was intended but it seems to be what the provisions in the section bring about.  That is why I propose this amendment designed, in such cases, to value the limited interest at its market value and not at the actuarial value of the whole property on which the interest is charged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Under section 3 (3) as drafted, a person who has a limited interest in property is treated as being entitled to the underlying property in which the limited interest subsists or on which it is charged or secured.  I regret to say that I cannot accept the proposed amendment because it seeks to substitute for underlying property the market value of the limited interest itself, in effect, the actuarial value of the interest, based on a life tenant's age and the state of his health.  I cannot accept the amendment for the following reasons: wealth tax is a tax on capital and it must, therefore, be charged on capital.  Capital should, as far as possible, be taxed on the same basis whether it is held absolutely or in trust.</P>
      <P>I should say at this stage that this section only decides what property shall be charged.  Who pays the tax is another day's work which will be dealt with in another section later on, section 14.  If that were not done, property held in strict settlement would have an advantage over property held absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum total of the separate interest, present and future, would not add up to the value of the property in trust.  Even if it did, taxing all interest <Col N="835" /> is not possible in the context of the scheme of the Bill which taxes only interest in possession.  If the amendment were accepted, it would be necessary to recast the Bill and to tax future interests such as reversionary interests.  Otherwise there would be avoidance of tax.  Deputy Colley's example of the old lady of 80 years really highlights how tax avoidance could be brought about by creating a life interest and settling property.</P>
    <P>For example, a person with assets of £150,000 would settle that property on himself for life, the remainder to his wife for life, and the remainder to his children.  If, during the life of the husband, and on his death during the life of the wife, the actuarial value alone was liable, neither the husband nor the wife would be liable to wealth tax, although the family are clearly as well off as if they were absolutely entitled.  In such circumstances, the Bill would have to be amended to make liable during the husband's lifetime the wife's contingent life interest, the children's remainder interest and the later during the wife's lifetime. Apart from the enormous administrative and valuation problems this would give rise to even in such a simple trust as the foregoing, it would open the way for tax avoidance on a substantial scale.  This approach would encourage settlement.  It is doubtful whether it is in the overall interest of the country as a whole that encouragement should be given to tying up property indefinitely, thus inhibiting its full development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley and I would probably agree with the proposition that it is a bad thing to tie up property from father to son and grandchildren, with nobody having a real interest in making it work.  We heard a lot of talk during this debate on working capital.  I must say, before I ever became interested in politics, I had that view of efforts by fathers to tie up property indefinitely.  I do not think it was good for the property and it eventually ended up in a run-down business or a run-down farm.  This section is concerned, as I have said, with what is liable to tax.  The question <Col N="836" /> as to who should ultimately pay the tax comes later.  Section 14 is not germane to the debate on this section.</P>
    <P>It may be relevant to take a brief look at the position on the Continent and in Great Britain.  On the Continent, the power to tie up property is severely curtailed, with the result that trusts are uncommon and where they occur they are relatively straightforward. Nevertheless, in the case of a person who has what might be considered here as a limited interest, the underlying property is made liable to wealth tax in Norway, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands.  In Germany, where the actuarial value is used, the balance of the capital after deducting the value is also liable.  In the United Kingdom, where the problems arising from trusts and settlements are similar to ours, it is proposed to tax the capital of the trust fund at the highest rate of the wealth tax, the rates being progressive, and allowing certain deductions on the basis of the rates applicable to the relevant life tenant.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that all other countries about which we have information tax the capital of the trust funds or, in the case of the United Kingdom, propose to do so. In no case is the acturial value alone used as the basis for valuation.  I should like to point out that decision of the Government to tax strict settlements in this manner and to tax the underlying assets, was made independently of the position in European countries and, indeed, before we knew exactly what the position there was. The philosophy of the tax led inevitably to this conclusion and, although the fact is that on the Continent these settlements are restricted in scope and play a very minor role, it is a source of satisfaction to find unanimous support for that decision in that everywhere the underlying property is liable.  I think that we fully realise here that this section is not concerned with payment of tax but is concerned with what is to be taxed, and that we bear in mind that this is first a tax on capital.</P>
    <P>Provisions are being made whereby the tenant for life can raise the <Col N="837" /> money for payment of the tax from the capital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If one approached it on that basis it seems to me to be producing, as I said earlier, very grave anomalies if not injustices.  One cannot quite&mdash;although I know it is under another section&mdash;ignore totally the question of who pays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that what is coming to light here is something that was referred to in an earlier discussion on an amendment on section 1.  It emerged that in some circumstances two people can be liable, each liable for the tax on a particular property, and the Revenue Commissioners can opt as to which one they go for.  Presumably this is what the Minister has in mind and he would say in the kind of case I mentioned where a retired employee is left a small annuity charged on a large estate, whereas under the section he is liable for wealth tax on the value of the estate, the Minister would say: &ldquo;Well, the Revenue Commissioners would not go for him&rdquo;.  But that is not a very satisfactory position if, in fact, he is legally liable.  I wonder if the problem is not arising because of the basis of the charge here.  The Minister said the charge is on capital but I wondered earlier when I was studying the Bill&mdash;and what the Minister has said has made me wonder even more&mdash;why is it that it is proposed to charge tax on property in possession.  If a future interest has any cash value why should not tax be charged on that?  In other words why should not everybody be assessed on the market value of what he is entitled to of his assets?  If there is a life tenant or someone in receipt of an annuity charged on property he clearly is not entitled to the property on which the annuity is charged.  He is deemed under this Bill to be entitled to it, and is deemed to be entitled <Col N="838" /> to be in possession and is therefore liable for wealth tax assessed on the value of the property over which he has no control whatever or no right of disposal.  All he has is that his annuity, or his life interest or whatever it is, is charged on this property.  That is all he has.</P>
    <P>I must say I find it difficult to understand why exactly one should not take each individual and take the market value, as near as one can get to it, of his assets whatever they may be, even if they are a contingent interest, and assess him on that.  That seems to me to be fair.  I do not think it is good enough if the reason for not doing this is administrative difficulty. I do not think administrative difficulty can justify producing the kind of situation in which as I have indicated, the woman of 80 years with an annuity of £500 charged on a farm valued at £10,000 is assessed at double the value of that for the purposes of wealth tax or where, as I said, a retired employee with a small annuity is, in fact, assessed on the value of the whole estate on which the annuity is charged.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be carrying much too far artificial concepts of people being deemed entitled to be in possession of property over which they have no control at all.  I would like to know what is the basic reason why each individual should not be treated on the basis of what is the market value of the property to which he is entitled, and assess the wealth tax on that.  If that could be done we would automatically get rid of the kind of anomalies and injustices to which I have been referring.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree with Deputy Colley when he says that we should not necessarily follow what has been done in other countries.  That should not be our guideline.  I agree entirely with him. We did not do that in this case.  I am assured that before the Government decided to adopt this matter we did not know exactly what was done in other countries.  I think Deputy Colley will agree with me that when we adopted the system we did adopt and when we find that other countries that have been operating wealth tax for years and years have been using the same method of taxation, it reinforces us in our belief that what we have done was the right thing and that it was the necessary thing to do.</P>

The point is that if the system suggested by Deputy Colley were adopted it would tend to make the section unworkable; it would leave the tax unworkable and furthermore, instead of one valuation, there would have to be several valuations in respect of the same property of the same time, and that is not desirable, surely.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The value is such value as the annuity bears to the total increase.  The value of the slice of the property for the purposes of this case is such value as bears the same proportion as the annuity bears to the entire income.  You get the entire income of the property and you get the income of the annuity then for the purposes of tax the value is such as bears the same proportion to the entire value of the property as the annuity bears to entire income of the estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But I was pointing out earlier that there are a number of properties, perhaps highly valued, from the property point of view, which yield little or no income, and in that case you can have a life tenant or anybody with a limited interest and when you start applying this apportionment that the Minister is talking about, the income from the whole property is little or nothing and you can get a totally artificial value placed on the limited interest. As a result, this person who clearly is not intended to be liable for wealth tax becomes liable, has to pay, and the fact that this can happen is clearly envisaged in the amendment referred to by Deputy Esmonde and the Minister because provision is made in the amendment to enable such a person to raise the money they have to pay for the wealth tax by charging it on the property but, as both the Minister <Col N="843" /> and Deputy Esmonde are well aware, charging it on the property does not mean you have actually got the money.  You have to pay the Revenue Commissioners.  But you could be a long time trying to recover the money, actually recovering the money and getting it into your pocket and reimbursing yourself.  Now I can see that there are reasons why this totally artificial situation should exist but I am still not satisfied that it is justifiable to create this artificial situation instead of simply approaching the matter on the basis that it would appear to be approached in Germany, from what the Minister said, what seems to me to be the very logical basis of seeing the value of what each person has and assessing him on that. If, in a case like this, you value the annuity, you take the capital value of that from the capital value of the whole estate and you deal with each party accordingly.</P>
      <P>Now that seems to me to be the straightforward and logical way to do it.  I am not so sure that this is as open to abuse as the Minister suggested it might be.  Provided you are actually valuing all the interests that are involved and charging people accordingly, I think you should be able to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a short Bill which arises directly from membership of the European Communities.  Section 1 makes it an offence under our law for a person before the European Court to swear anything which he knows to be false or does not believe to be true.  Section 2 is a technical jurisdictional provision.</P>
      <P>Under the Treaties a member State is obliged to treat any false testimony given on oath before the Court of Justice of the Communities as if it were an offence committed in proceedings before one of its own courts. In effect, what the Bill proposes to do is to take extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of false testimony before the court, which sits in Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>It might be asked why legislation is required at all since the Treaties are now part of our law.  First, it is necessary to have a technical provision, as in section 2, in relation to the venue for prosecution.  This is always done where extra-territorial jurisdiction is being taken.  Secondly, I am advised that there is some doubt as to whether or not we could rely solely on the Treaties to support a prosecution here for the common law offence of perjury in a case of false testimony before the European Court. Finally, this matter could not be dealt with by regulations under the European Communities Acts, 1972 and 1973, because perjury is an indictable offence and the 1972 Act specifically prohibits the creation of indictable offences by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="846" /> There are, of course, differences between the procedure before the European Court and the procedure to which we are accustomed.  The procedure before the court is mainly a written one and it is more the exception than the rule for witnesses or experts to be heard.  Furthermore, when they are heard, they take the oath after they have presented their evidence.  The court has power to exempt a witness or expert from taking the oath.</P>
    <P>Where perjury appears to have been committed before the court, the initiative in reporting the matter to the competent authority of the member State concerned would be taken by the court itself.  The competent authority here would be the Director of Public Prosecutions.  So far the court has never reported a case of perjury to a member State.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I was under the impression that if a citizen of the Republic of Ireland went before the European Court and committed perjury he could be prosecuted in this country even if this Bill were never introduced.  I was wrong about this.  I thought the situation came about by virtue of our accession to the Treaty and by virtue of European Community sanction.  I was just wondering if I was correct in that assumption and as to the reason for bringing in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Perjury is a very uncommon offence in Ireland.  I have never come across a case of perjury.  I do know that many people, every day, stand up in court and give testimony which could be described as inaccurate.  They are trying to recall, especially in running down cases, an accident which happened a couple of years ago.  I regard this Bill as a simple measure to harmonise the legal system <i>vis-à-vis</i> Europe.  I hope the Act will not have to be resorted to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to reply to the point made by Deputy Toal, at first sight it would appear that it might not be necessary to enable offences of perjury committed in Luxembourg to be tried here but there is some doubt about that and it is to remove the doubt that this Bill has been introduced. There is also the technical reason which is dealt with in section 2, namely, that a venue has to be specifically provided for this purpose. Again, the matter cannot be dealt with by making a regulation under the European Communities Act because perjury is an indictable offence and the 1972 European Communities Act specifically prohibits the creation of an indictable offence by regulation and if it is going to be made an offence it will have to be made by regulation under that Act.  So there is some doubt as to whether the Acts apply automatically and create the offence here.  Further doubt is created by the fact that the offence in our law is still a common law offence. We have never made it a statutory offence.  We rely on the common law to deal with the offence.  This raised the question to whether our accession to the Treaties would automatically make a common law offence an offence under the Treaties.  These are all areas of doubt, possibly not serious, but certainly of sufficient number and weight to justify simple legislation like this to remove that doubt.  In the unlikely event of an offence being committed and in the absence of legislation like this this sort of thing could end up in a legal battle.  The simplest way out was to introduce this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said nearly <Col N="848" /> all I intend to say about this Bill. Personally I am suspicious of a Bill and of any Minister who gets the sort of authority contained in section 3 of this Bill.  I believe that he can give any authority he likes to traffic wardens.  The powers in section 3 are too wide.  My second objection is in regard to the training these wardens will get.  The Garda get training on how to enforce the law and how to use discretion and discretion is necessary. If these people were appointed by local authorities they might be inclined to think that they had to justify their existence.  Everyone knows how the unfortunate motorist is penalised in every way at present. I shiver to think that this would be another way of collecting revenue for local authorities.  If it does not collect revenue it puts an extra burden on the authority if they have to pay for them, so quite naturally they will have to justify their existence.  There is also the easy fine to get.  Some poor unfortunate may pull up for a moment and if he is approached by a garda he would probably get the benefit of the first offenders' Act but if a man wants to justify his existence he may issue a summons.</P>
      <P>People might say I was biassed because I have been in court so often for minor offences but I am not.  I have great respect for traffic wardens. They have a job to do and are doing it.</P>
      <P>This is a very dangerous Bill from the point of view that it will be local people who will be appointed to the position of traffic wardens.  There is the danger of the human nature element entering into it that they may know some people including local representatives, people who employ them.  Very rarely is a guard stationed in his own county and therefore there is no danger of any favouritism being shown.</P>

      <P>Well, he would not be one of them.  His family would not be there.  He is paid by the State, not by the local authority.  If a county councillor pulls up at a prohibited area for a few seconds the warden may say: &ldquo;That fellow is paying me. I am collecting the revenue for him.&rdquo; But if another unfortunate man who is not a public representative pulls up in the same spot he may be inclined to summon him.  I agree that the man who is 20 years in the one place is pretty well known.  But he has no family connections whatsoever in that locality, whereas a traffic warden would.</P>
      <P>An on-the-spot parking fine means that you pay the £2 and that is the end of the matter but if you are caught with a tax disc not displayed you have to be summoned.  Is it the traffic warden who will issue the summons, take you to court and give evidence against you, or will it be passed on to the Garda and will they then issue the summons?  What qualifications will these wardens have and what will their pay be?  I shiver to think that we were trying to get a cheap police force by transferring gradually over to these a lot of the authority the Garda now have.</P>
      <P>I am worried about the effect this Bill will have on our tourists.  These wardens will be after them for minor offences.  I was caught a few times for minor offences, not having my door locked, not having the hand-brake on, not having a white light. On the occasion when I was pulled a fellow went through a town at about 70 miles an hour but it was too hard to catch him, it was easier to get me. I am worried that the easy summonses will be increased to justify the existence of these wardens.  There are too many watching the unfortunate motorists at present.  I fully agree that the reckless motorist, and the man who takes up space unnecessarily and remains there need to be summoned. But the motorist who parks for a few seconds in an unauthorised spot and is spotted by a guard nine times out of ten he will be given the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be worried about having too <Col N="850" /> many wardens, especially in my own city of Galway where I transact a lot of business, watching every move I make.  As I said before they may be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the person they know.  That is something I hate.  I would rather be summoned.  I never got that kind of preferential treatment or looked for it because it is a scandal that it could happen.  Just because one is a public representative or a TD one should not get preferential treatment. Thank God the guards do not do that. I do not believe that traffic wardens would do it either but at the same time the temptation is there.  The danger is that they will not have the required training and that some of the duties of the guards will be transferred to them.  There is also the danger that they would become tax collectors for the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am not completely opposed to the Bill because some of these are needed. The Minister mentioned that Galway Corporation are looking for wardens. That is correct.  I often wonder if this is not another way of collecting taxes. Ninety per cent of motorists do not want to break the law but they may have to park, for business reasons, in a prohibited place.  Then they will be fined without any consideration.  This is the sort of result I fear if the country is swarming with wardens watching motorists.  I would ask the Minister to state very definitely who will issue the summons in the case of a person not having his tax disc displayed. Is there a danger that the Garda will leave the task of watching for car tax to the wardens?  A man with an untaxed car could leave it at home during the day and take it out at night when the wardens would be off duty.  This is something which worries me.  I do not like the idea of having so many people watching the unfortunate person who rarely offends against the traffic Acts while, at the same time, somebody who commits a major crime is allowed to escape.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words.  I would advise the Minister to cut the red tape and hand over as much power and authority as possible to the local councils.  Traffic <Col N="851" /> wardens play a necessary part as a result of the large increase in the number of vehicles.  Listening to Radio Éireann one would think that traffic jams were confined to Dublin and Cork.  Even in my own town there is a build-up of traffic in the morning and evening.  This is a constant menace to the business life of the town because people cannot park their cars in the centre of the town.  Those who work in offices, shops and banks drive their cars into the town in the morning and park in the one place all day.  As a result would-be shoppers are prevented from securing a parking place and in this way a great deal of business is lost.  This measure will give to local authorities the power to regulate and control the movement of traffic in provincial towns.</P>
      <P>The Opposition have reacted in an alarmist manner to this measure.  They have talked about an auxiliary police force.  Some Opposition Deputies went so far as to call it repressive legislation. I have no fear that the powers of the Garda Síochána will be whittled away one iota by the introduction of this Bill.  Traffic wardens will complement the Garda Síochána.  They will help them in their work and free them to attend to those duties for which they were primarily trained, namely, the detection and prevention of crime. Young gardaí coming out of Temple-more, after a very good training, spending portion of the day watching parked cars and enforcing traffic regulations is a waste of manpower; not only that but it is an expense which we cannot afford.  The approach of the Opposition to this measure is quite unrealistic if they see it as diminishing the powers of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill.  It will bring some control into the movement of traffic in the provincial towns and I would like to see the Minister tackling straightaway the question of getting the various councils to appoint traffic wardens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Callanan, I have nothing against traffic wardens and I am sure the Government and Opposition would welcome any <Col N="852" /> measures which would help the free flow of traffic.  We, in particular, would welcome any measure which would prevent people obstructing traffic wardens in the carrying out of their duties and prevent people removing notices from cars.</P>
      <P>We are concerned at the transfer of powers to traffic wardens.  Under this Bill traffic wardens will impose fines for the non-display of tax discs.  Is the Minister giving already overworked traffic wardens an extra burden?  Will traffic wardens be asked later on to deal with such offences as dangerous driving or checking for false identity?</P>
      <P>Another important matter is the consultation which took place with the Garda Síochána.  As Deputy Callanan pointed out, the gardaí are given special training before they take up their duties and the question of discretion is also involved.  Traffic wardens receive only three or four days' instruction from a Garda sergeant on traffic control.  I suggest traffic wardens need a considerable amount of training, particularly if they are given extra duties.</P>
      <P>There is also the danger that traffic wardens might have to justify their existence, that they might have to pay their way, or become tax collectors for their local authorities.  If they had to justify their existence a situation could arise where there would be severe pressure on traffic wardens to issue tickets.  For example, during a holiday weekend in Salthill, it could happen that holidaymakers would be discriminated against and, while the return to the local authority might be considerable, those holidaymakers would be very slow to holiday in Galway again.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister say on a recent radio programme that he hoped people badly in need of employment would become traffic wardens.  This is important in view of the large number of unemployed.  I am thinking in particular of the 52,000 school leavers this year.  If young people are to be employed they must be trained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traffic wardens must use tact&mdash; something they will gain from experience. If young people are to be employed, they would need a considerable <Col N="853" /> amount of training.  I would ask the Minister to comment on this and I would remind him that the Bill could become dangerous if its power is expanded.  The Minister might never have to toe the double yellow line himself but he might have to toe the line some day if he is not careful with the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill. It is a great idea.  Traffic wardens are badly needed all over the country particularly in provincial and fair sized towns.  I cannot see what the Opposition are worried about when one remembers that they first appointed traffic wardens in Dublin city.  I agree with Deputy Callanan that some of these people are not very courteous to the public.  Everybody knows it is not hard to be courteous to the public. I fully agree with that.  One may have some slight fear of it, but I am sure the machinery that will be set up by the local authority for their appointment will make sure of that.</P>
      <P>We all know of the number of accidents on the roads these days.  We in this House are obliged to try to prevent that.  Traffic wardens should have power in every connection with a car. They could recommend to the gardaí that the drivers should be summoned or prosecuted.  I do not care how it is done but it should be done some way. They could examine lights, tyres, the breaking system and make sure the car is locked.  Every day we hear about cars being stolen and the public themselves are very often to blame.  I think this Bill should go that far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair to a garda who has done a course and should be dealing with crime detection and so on to have to <Col N="854" /> go around looking for bald tyres and wait half-an-hour for the owner of a car to come along.  If the garda is stationed in a particular town and he issues a summons to a local man, naturally the local man is sore.  This might be dangerous if the garda was looking for information with regard to the detection of crime.  The Bill is a great idea and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>It would be only right for me to say that as far as the gardaí are concerned, I have always found them courteous.  They may hold you up to see if your car is taxed and insured but in my experience they have been very courteous to the public.  For that reason I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words on the Bill.  I have heard the points advanced by most speakers on this side of the House and view&mdash; with a certain amount of apprehension&mdash;the Minister's proposal to give traffic wardens extended powers. Dublin City, as the Minister said, has 40 traffic wardens and they operate on a 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. or a 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. basis.  I often see them at 4.30 p.m. going to their depots to hand in their returns.  I should like to know if the Minister proposes to give traffic wardens these additional powers in relation to tax discs.  Does he propose that there should be a 14, 15 or 20 hours' service to the public?  I should also like to know if traffic wardens are to replace gardaí, and discharge the duties normally done by the Garda?  A garda has a defined status.  He is accepted into the force. He goes through a very rigorous training in all aspects of law and life generally.  He takes an oath to the State on his appointment.  He has, therefore, a certain clearly defined responsible status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A traffic warden, on the other hand, in my opinion has not got the same standards because of his training and his status in society.  It is going to be very hard, in my opinion, to transfer to these lay people the responsibility for offences under the Traffic Act. I am worried that they will not get the co-operation of the public as outlined by the Minister in his Bill.  On <Col N="855" /> the one hand the Minister said he is going to get the co-operation of the Garda to check tax evasion and, on the other, he is going to transfer these duties to traffic wardens.  I cannot reconcile his thinking on that matter. Has he had any conditions laid down by the Commissioner of the Garda as a result of this measure which has been brought in here at a time when other more serious matters should be discussed?  These are a few points I would ask the Minister to deal with.</P>
    <P>Also I believe that we as a country have failed to tackle the problem of providing car parks in our cities and towns.  We failed miserably in Dublin. Were it not for the interest of private organisations, there would be no proper car park facilities.  With the motor car becoming a way of life, we have failed to provide the parking facilities which the public need.  Instead, we have embarked on a programme of harassing the motorist. The time has come when we should rise to the occasion and ensure that proper car parking facilities are provided throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this unpretentious but useful Bill has been, to say the least of it, extraordinary. To hear the attacks by the Opposition on its terms and the spectres they have raised to what is involved makes one wonder, since it is practically the same Bill, word for word, the Fianna Fáil Government approved when in office.  It is hard, therefore, to take their criticisms seriously.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham referred yesterday to representations being made to me about this and suggested that he knew representations had been made to me.  No representations were made to me by any outside body.  However, after speaking to Deputy Cunningham I received a letter from the Representative Body of Inspectors, Station Sergeants and Sergeants dated 13th June, which only reached me yesterday afternoon, in which they asked for an urgent meeting with me regarding this Bill.  The final sentence in their letter stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> We would wish to discuss certain aspects of the Bill in so far as they relate to road traffic.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not relate to road traffic and, therefore, whoever told those gentlemen that it did and gave them that impression was sending them on a fool's errand.  I think it was rather foolish for Deputy Cunningham to suggest that I got a letter from somebody or had refused representations.  Most certainly I did not.</P>
    <P>To determine the functions of the wardens and the range of offences, it is better to look at sections 2 and 3 of the Bill together.  Together these are designed to ensure that they would cover parking offences and the offence of not displaying a tax disc and no more.  I was satisfied that this is what they do but, to show my goodwill and my desire that there should be no ambiguity in the Bill, I intended to have the text re-examined.  As a matter of fact, I had it re-examined and I am prepared to introduce an amendment so that everybody in the House will be satisfied.</P>
    <P>One of the things that seems to be forgotten is that over the years people got the impression that one side of the House should have all of the wisdom as regards legislation.  That is not so.  Again and again, on legislation of this kind I have invited the Opposition to give me the benefit of their views. A typical example is the Planning Bill which is before the House at present. I have accepted numerous amendments because I consider they would make the Bill a better one than it was. The same applies to the Road and Motorways Bill and so on.</P>
    <P>In this case I am interested to find that people could, in fact, interpret those two sections in the way in which I certainly could not interpret them.  I feel that legal men should not have done so but those who are not legally trained like myself may possibly find it difficult to understand the jargon.  I am prepared to change the section and to introduce an amendment which will ensure that both sections in question will relate solely to parking offences, apart from the offence of non-display of a current tax disc on a parked vehicle.  I hope <Col N="857" /> this ends any controversy about the functions and offences with which this Bill deals.</P>
    <P>Most of the speakers dealt with that section and most of the objections to the Bill dealt with it also.  Yesterday morning I attempted to give this explanation before the House started to debate this matter.  I did so because I was anxious to save the time of the House because, like everybody else, I was anxious to deal with it so that we could all take a break.  Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition objected to this being done and said that the debate would have to take its course. The result was that a lot of time was wasted by people who would have understood if it had been explained again.  Perhaps I should have done this at the start.  The Leader of the Opposition made the point that when I was introducing it on Second Reading I should have known that.  I could not and I still cannot understand how this ambiguity appears to be read into this particular section when it is not there.</P>
    <P>The training of wardens was mentioned by many Deputies.  Some of them apparently were under the impression that they would have to be specially trained because of the wide range of duties which they were getting. The duties will be limited as I have indicated.  Again, I have every confidence that the local authorities, in co-operation with the Garda, will develop adequate training arrangements, with initial and refresher courses.  They will be encouraged by me.  I am pleased to hear a number of Deputies praising the present wardens and I think this is a fair tribute to the existing training arrangements.  There is no reason why these should not be extended, if necessary and, of course, there is no need to make legislative provision for such a matter.</P>
    <P>It surprised me that some of the Dublin Deputies who are aware of the fact that there is a warden service in the city and that it has been operating in a certain way continued to make statements which showed that they knew nothing whatever about what is happening in this city. Maybe I misunderstood Deputy <Col N="858" /> Timmons but I think he said he saw the wardens proceeding back to the depot with their takings.  Did I assume from Deputy Timmons that he thought they had a lot of £2 rattling in their bags which they were bringing back and handing to somebody? If they had takings, what takings would they have?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I thought the Deputy said takings.  I have before me an advertisement for vacancies for traffic wardens in Dublin Corporation which was published on 8th February, 1973.  On the application it said that an official form would be needed, the age limit was not to be more than 35 years on 1st February, 1973, except for existing corporation employees who could be 40 years on the same date.  The candidate had to be in good health, physically fit, of good character and good appearance and he had to have a good standard of education to enable him to carry out his official duties.  Wardens would be required to work a 40-hour week within the period from 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. on week days.  They were obliged to attend an interview and undergo an educational test.  We hear people on the far side of the House talking as though the wardens were a crowd of ignorant bostoons who could not be trusted to talk to anybody.  I think it is a very poor reflection&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy did not but people spoke as if they would not trust them with anything except very minor duties.  They are decent people.  Deputy Timmons referred to the gardaí being of a different standard. These people are doing a good job and it is wrong that we should try to infer that they are inferior beings.  Deputy Callanan referred to the question of their being local and how they would deal with the local people.  I do not think he was being fair to himself because there are numerous employees of local authorities who are local, who are appointed to do a job, who could dispense favours but who do not dispense <Col N="859" /> favours even to the local county councillor. I have heard of one case where the local county manager fell under the wrath of one of these employees who was doing his job.  The question of discretion comes into this.  Of course, they have the same discretion as anybody else.  I would not like to see a situation arising where people would go around and insist on the letter of the law being observed every time.  Let us suppose that Deputy Callanan goes in for a paper to the local shop; he is in there for 30 seconds and then gets a ticket when he comes out.  That is not the object of the exercise and I think we have a far better chance of local people, who really know the local conditions, operating it properly.</P>
      <P>There are two very important things about this.  It is necessary to have the wardens appointed.  I travel around this country as most Deputies do and I see the towns of the country choked up.  People say they are choked up with traffic but in most cases that is not so.  They are choked up because some person puts his car or lorry in the wrong place and leaves it there.  Why should there not be legislation which will allow the local authority if they wish to appoint traffic wardens to do a job in conjunction with the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it provides a freer flow of traffic through the villages and towns is it not a very good idea?  I cannot follow the reasoning of the Deputy who feels that a traffic warden will be going around watching for the stranger to stick a ticket on his car and that he will get a clap on the back from the local county manager, or whoever is responsible when he goes in with the takings.  The position is that the traffic warden would not be going in with the takings.  He would simply be putting on a ticket.  If, in a tourist area, a traffic warden makes such a nuisance of himself that he chases away those who are not deliberately breaking the law, how long would be survive in his job?  There would be complaints about him and they would have to be dealt with.  If somebody gets a ticket for parking in a wrong place or for not displaying his tax <Col N="860" /> disc, he does not have to pay the fine. He can go to court.  He has that option.  That would soon settle the question of unfair activities of traffic wardens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is acting illegally. He has no business going to court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people have gone to court when they refused to pay their fines and they have succeeded. The Judiciary are not monsters either. There were occasions on which people got off because they were able to give a reasonable explanation.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the question of the appointment of wardens.  As regards the training of wardens, they get about a week's training and then they carry out their duties under surveillance to see if they can do the job properly.  They are taken back to do refresher courses from time to time. This will be continued under the new system.  It is a very good idea and there is no reason why training should not proceed along these lines.</P>
      <P>With regard to the financing of the scheme, the local authority have the option of adopting and continuing to operate it.  The scheme is primarily a local one and the decision to start or continue it must be taken locally.  At present, fines on the spot are payable by offenders at a Garda station and the money so collected accrues to the Road Fund.  The costs of the existing warden services are met from the Garda Vote, towards which the Road Fund is contributing about £1 million a year; it is £1 million this year anyway. The Department of Justice, in turn, pay the local authorities, who are at present administering the scheme in Dublin and Cork, the costs incurred by them.  This is an unnecessary and cumbersome system of administration. The previous Government agreed that in future when a warden service would be directly administered by the local authorities fines on the spot would be paid to the local authorities and retained by them. I fully agree with this principle and I have included it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A local authority who operates this service may have a surplus.  They will <Col N="861" /> be free to use such a surplus for road traffic purposes in accordance with regulations to be made by the Minister. This is an exact parallel with the system which applies at present to income derived from parking meters and disc parking as it operates in Cork.  No question of my paying a subsidy arises in such cases.  The decision to operate a warden service will rest with each local authority, after consultation with the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda authorities might decide for good reasons that a warden service was not necessary in a particular area.  They might be in a position to control parking arrangements without the necessity for wardens and it would be inappropriate that, in such circumstances, I should be statutorily obliged to pay the cost of an unnecessary service.  On the other hand, circumstances could arise where the Commissioner agreed with the proposals of the local authority to appoint wardens, the scheme was being operated in the interests of traffic, but causing a significant loss of money to the local authority.  It is possible that some contribution might be justified in that case towards the cost incurred by that authority.</P>
    <P>Again, I stress that the idea is to try to have a freer flow of traffic, a fairer way of parking and, particularly, to ensure that people who use motor vehicles on the roads tax those vehicles because, as is well known, for some years past, many people have not been taxing their motor vehicles. Apart entirely from anything else, this means a terrific loss of revenue.  I am amazed to hear people who should know better talking about harassing the motorist.  The only motorist who is harassed is the man or woman who breaks the law.</P>
    <P>There is no intention here to do anything to the person who pays his tax and displays his disc or to people who park in a normal way.  We all must agree that if we are law abiding we should ensure that other people are law abiding also.  It is in the common good that this should be done and I believe there will be a general welcome for this legislation.  The one thing which seems to annoy motorists <Col N="862" /> most is the fact that people can drive vehicles without paying taxation.  I met a very irate person recently who had to pay a parking fine of £2.  He did not complain about that, but what annoyed him was that parked beside his car was an untaxed car which, because a shilling had been put in the parking meter, was allowed to stay there without interference from the same traffic warden.  This is wrong and it should not be allowed to continue. That is why I propose to try to prevent it continuing.</P>
    <P>I must be flexible in regard to the question of the payment of a subsidy towards the running of the scheme. I propose to make the position clear to all local authorities when the Bill becomes law to assist them in their decision on whether or not to operate a warden service.  It is a matter for each local authority to decide.</P>
    <P>Another optional element of the scheme, as I said before, is that the person who gets a ticket need not pay but can instead decide to go to court. This is the answer to any suggestion of unfairness on the part of a warden. Again, I should like to refer to the complimentary remarks by Deputies about existing wardens.  Quite a number of Deputies paid tributes to them for the excellent way in which they are doing their job.</P>
    <P>Various points of detail were raised which would seem to be more appropriate to Committee Stage.  However, it may be helpful if I make a few comments on them at this stage. Deputy Faulkner hoped there would be a uniform code for fines on the spot and wondered whether the amounts should be prescribed in the Bill.  The amount of payments in respect of any particular parking offence will be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister under the Bill.  This is an exact parallel of the existing system by which the Minister prescribes the amounts for the purpose of notices or tickets issued in respect of offences under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  The reason why amounts were not prescribed in the Road Traffic Acts, and are not prescribed in this Bill, is that if they were so prescribed, they could not be changed without <Col N="863" /> amending legislation.  Changes can become necessary where the amount fixed for a particular offence is no longer seen to be an adequate deterrent.</P>
    <P>The payment for illegal parking was increased by my predecessor from £1 to £2.  This could not be done if it had been written into the Bill originally.  It may be desirable to raise the current payment for a clearway offence.  It is terrible that at present somebody can park a car on the clearway and leave it there.  If the fine matched the offence this sort of thing would stop.  Many of the traffic jams we have in this city are caused by people who park without thinking of anybody else but themselves.</P>
    <P>It might become desirable to have higher amounts laid down for special areas, say, for illegal parking in a central city area where the offence would have a greater effect on traffic flow generally than it would in areas of less dense traffic.  These are some of the reasons why I do not want to write into the Bill a figure which may have to be changed.  Sometimes when we look at old laws we see ridiculous fines for pretty serious offences.  They were big fines at the time but as the years go by they became smaller and smaller in relation to money value.  Regulations made by the Minister under this Bill must, of course, as in all such cases, be laid before the Oireachtas and the House is thus given the right to challenge them.</P>
    <P>The point was made by Deputy Hussey who questioned the giving of powers to town commissioners.  It is only right that they should be given these powers since they are concerned with the traffic situation in a town and already have some statutory traffic functions.  I do not suppose that they would operate the scheme normally but would get the county council to do it.  Would anyone suggest that the town commissioners of Mullingar should not have the right to appoint traffic wardens if they so desire?  I think that answers Deputy Hussey, but it was a good point.  It is pointed out that if after consulting the gardaí they decided to operate the scheme themselves they would receive the proceeds <Col N="864" /> of the payments but would have to dispose of them for the prescribed purposes such as road and traffic purposes. They could do this by arrangement with the county council.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to the accepted use of wardens' powers.  Some Deputies have got the picture of managers coercing wardens into being overzealous in their work in order to raise money.  I doubt if they were very serious about this.  Assuming that wardens exceeded themselves, the fact is that the person receiving the ticket can go to court.  This is the best corrective to excessive zeal.  If a warden went to court once and found that he was not being complimented too much he would not be inclined to go again.  In any case the elected member of the local authority can always take up a case of over-zealousness in any local service with the manager.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling went into detail on subsections (4) and (5) of section 3.  These are in the exact terms of the 1961 Act provision which to date has not raised any problem.  The Deputy was a little off-beam in this.  Perhaps he did not look at the section carefully enough.  Somebody remarked to me that some of the Deputies seemed to have read the leading article in <i>The Irish Press</i> last week rather than the Bill.  Apparently the person who wrote the leading article did not have the Bill either.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling also wanted to know what would happen a person served with a ticket for not displaying his tax disc and who had not, in fact, paid his tax.  There are two offences involved, one, not displaying the tax disc and the second, not paying his tax.  I would prefer to leave it to the good sense of the local authority and the Garda to work out the best arrangement of proceedings in such cases.  Such an arrangement could proceed as follows: a ticket would be served for non-display; the Garda would be advised and if they found that the tax had not been paid they would then take proceedings, bringing the warden as a witness.  I am sure Deputy Dowling does not underestimate the importancse to the general public of reducing evasion of <Col N="865" /> motor taxation both in fairness to those who pay and for the services for which the tax is used.  Every Deputy should be prepared to support this measure.  We have the situation throughout the country where, for one reason or another, people are not taxing their motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies asked if the Garda Representative Body and the existing traffic wardens were consulted before proceeding with the Bill. I could well ask the same question of Fianna Fáil in regard to their Bill. The answer in both cases is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. I can also assure the House that I have received no representations against the Bill.  Rather have I been pressed by local authorities to give them the power to engage wardens. Far from downgrading the gardaí the Bill removes from them much work. It enables them to be free for the work for which they were trained. The Conway Report, paragraph 11.86 says:</P>
    <P>The traffic wardens system should be divorced entirely from the Garda Síochána and should be the responsibility of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>This report was published in 1970.  I have not heard of anybody objecting to it yet.</P>
    <P>A few other small points arise.  I was asked by one Deputy if a warden will have power to stop a vehicle.  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I was asked why should a warden have powers to demand the name and address of an alleged offender as he has under section 4 of the Bill.  This is an essential feature of the system.  Existing traffic wardens have the same power under section 64 of the Road Traffic Act, 1968.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the question of training wardens and this question will be taken up with the local authorities specifically.  It will be their responsibility to ensure that the training is carried out with the co-operation of the gardaí.  At present Dublin Corporation operate a training system in conjunction with the gardaí, the purpose of which is to acquaint the recruits with the bye-laws, temporary <Col N="866" /> rules and regulations which they will enforce, the mechanics of notice issue and how to offer evidence in court.  The need for impartiality and courtesy is constantly stressed.  At the end of a week of preparation wardens are sent out on patrol, under supervision.  The notices of issue are subjected to scrutiny to ensure that the instructions given in lectures have been assimilated.  Refresher courses for wardens are also carried out by the corporation.  I have no hesitation in saying that the wardens will be adequately trained by local authorities before they take up duty.  Up to now, no complaints have been made to my Department against the warden system.</P>
    <P>The question was also raised as to whether wardens would be entitled to be members of a trade union.  Of course, they would.  The existing members of the warden service in Dublin and Cork are members of a trade union.  That answers the next question of whether they are adequately paid.</P>
    <P>I spoke strongly against some of the sections of the Bill which was introduced when the wardens system was being set up.  I spoke strongly against the idea that nobody except people who were prepared to work for a very low wage would be employed. The idea was that we could recruit from among ex-gardaí.  I believe they should get adequate pension when they finish their service and should not take up jobs which are needed by other people.  I am delighted with the arrangement here.</P>
    <P>I notice the age limit is 35.  I think that should be increased to 40 or 45. I do not believe that a person has finished his useful life when he reaches 35 years of age.  These people should be employed.  I am sure an excellent person would be employed even though he was older than the age specified by Dublin Corporation. There was no objection made by members of the corporation to the existing regulations and that is why they were left.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Faulkner got a copy of the proposed amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, if that satisfies the Deputy.  This is the Bill.  I have been asked &ldquo;why the rush?&rdquo; The rush is for two reasons.  First, we feel there is a growing demand for the appointment of wardens for local authorities all over the country and we felt the quicker it was done the better.  The second reason is that the sooner we can get some satisfactory way of dealing with people who do not tax their cars and do not display a tax disc, the better it will be for everybody concerned.  For that reason, I would ask now that the points raised by the Opposition have been adequately met, that we should pass the Bill as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points.  The debate, from this side of the House, hinged generally, as the Minister will accept, on the interpretation of subsection (1), section 3.  I was not satisfied that it was let go through in its present form.  I received legal advice not only from members within the House but also from outside. This legal advice supported my contention.  Not only that, but when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was speaking yesterday he did not disagree that my case was correct.  His main point was that he would not be adverse to the traffic wardens getting much wider powers. I was concerned to ensure that we would know exactly what powers were being given to the wardens.  This was not clear in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only pointing out that many of the points raised on this side of the House hinged on our interpretation of what was in that subsection.  When the Minister was replying on the question of educational standards, training and so on, that was raised on the basis that if the wardens were to get the powers which we anticipated could be given to them as the Bill stood we would have to reconsider that particular aspect of it.  The Minister stated that in the Explanatory Memorandum it was clearly pointed out what was in the Bill but the Minister will agree that the Explanatory Memorandum is not a legal document.  I would be quite willing to finish the Bill as quickly as possible if I am satisfied with the amendments the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirty-eight of the 52 recommendations made by the Commission on the Garda Síochána have been implemented in full&mdash;these include all the <Col N="871" /> key recommendations relating to pay, allowances, hours of work and compensation for overtime.  A further eight recommendations are in course of implementation.  In this connection, I regard the recent appointment of a firm of management consultants, with wide terms of reference and supported by the work of some other special committees, as meeting, to a substantial extent, recommendation No. 52 relating to an examination into the role, organisation and personnel policy of the force.</P>
      <P>Of the remaining six recommendations, four have been partly implemented and negotiations are still in progress in relation to one.</P>
      <P>With regard to that part of the question which seeks a comprehensive policy statement on this matter I think I need say only that the facts speak for themselves.  I am pleased that it has been possible to implement so fully the far-reaching improvements in the conditions of the force which were recommended in the commission's report.  I may add that further major improvements in these conditions, over and above those recommended by the commission, have taken place in recent years.</P>

If it should exist or if there should be any residue of that anxiety, I have no doubt that the survey by a firm of management consultants recently accepted by the Garda authorities&mdash;part of their brief, of course, will be to consider the entire structure of the force and their relationship with the Department&mdash; will isolate that anxiety and remove it if there be any need to remove it.</P>

      <P>The final report of the consultants is expected in about a year's time, the target time being July, 1976.  I do not think I can usefully make any statement at this stage other than to say that I am confident that this is a project which will be well worthwhile, all the more so since it appears to have been widely welcomed within the force.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to the contemplated structural changes within the Garda Síochána but in any event I can say that I would agree that no major organisational changes should be introduced while the survey is proceeding. Of course, this does not exclude the possibility of an interim report, if such appeared desirable, in relation to some particular aspect of the consultants' work which could be dealt with in advance of their general report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>Terms of Reference for Management Consultants carrying out a survey within The Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Management&mdash;1 (a) To examine the management structure of the Garda Síochána with particular reference to <Col N="876" /> the structure at superintendent and higher levels and to the organisation of Garda Headquarters and of Divisional and District Offices; and to recommend the organisational and staffing structures best suited to the efficient discharge of the duties and functions of the Force.</P>
    <P>(b)  To examine the organisation of planning in the force, including the role and staffing of the Garda Research and Planning Unit; and to recommend any changes considered necessary.</P>
    <P>(c) To examine the systems of review and control of Garda strength and to recommend any changes considered necessary to ensure the most efficient deployment of the available strength having regard to the duties of the Force, the needs of different areas and the necessity of keeping workloads within proper limits.</P>
    <P>Finance&mdash;2.  To examine the system of financial controls exercised in or in relation to the Garda Síochána and to recommend any changes considered necessary, bearing in mind the need to maintain accountability for the expenditure of public funds.</P>
    <P>Personnel Policies&mdash;3.  To examine the personnel policies of the Force with particular regard to training at different levels and to selection systems for promotion and promotion policies generally; and to recommend any changes considered necessary in the interests of the overall well-being and efficiency of the Force.</P>

      <P>As I am sure the Deputy is aware, in 1967 the Supreme Court decided that, having regard to certain provisions of the Constitution, bail may be refused only where the accused was likely to flee the jurisdiction or to interfere with prosecution witnesses and that it should not be refused merely because the accused would be likely to commit further offences while on bail.  In the light of this decision, it is extremely unlikely that legislation can be prepared which would obviate or substantially reduce the incidence of offences by persons on bail.</P>

Previously at the district court, is the Minister aware, the justice recommended a psychiatric examination of the prisoner and, by report, there was no such examination.  At the district court the prisoner stated he would do away with himself and there is no record of an examination before the prisoner left Limerick Prison and no record of an examination in Mountjoy Prison when he arrived there.  On 19th April he tore up his sheet and was placed in a padded cell and on the morning of 18th April his wife got a letter from the prison, which had been censored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am also aware that the other matters the Deputy has raised have already been raised and many of them were raised at the inquest.  The inquest was wide ranging and persons who were present there and about whose capacity and entitlement to be there there is some doubt were, nevertheless, permitted by the coroner in his discretion to intervene and asked many of the questions <Col N="883" /> the Deputy has now raised.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in the past year or so there has been an increase in annulments granted by the religious tribunals of the Roman Catholic Church.  Persons who obtain such annulments are not, of course, free to remarry unless they obtain an annulment in the civil courts.  The civil law relating to nullity is at present being examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if people get an annulment from the Church, then in the eyes of the Church they are no longer married; there never was a marriage.  What happens within the Church is a matter between the people concerned and the Church. <Col N="890" /> They are not free to marry again civilly, unless they obtain an annulment in the civil courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people understand that Church law is State law. Arising from that, if an annulment by the Church is allowed, they are then free to marry again and are married with the blessing of the Church. Complications can set in when a person dies who has had no children by the first marriage but had children by the second marriage because under the 1966 Succession Act his first wife, with whom he never lived, would be entitled to two-thirds of his estate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be very few people who would be so misled as to think that if they obtained a Church annulment they were free to marry again.  They would know the consequences of their actions.  It would be a bigamous marriage under the civil law if they were to marry again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the number of annulments is rising&mdash;I understand that there has been a drastic increase in annulments this year&mdash;does the Minister see any need to legislate in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister no doubt is aware that even with annulment by the Catholic Church if the people concerned marry again they are marrying bigamously in the eyes of the State.  I read some time ago that the Minister for Health said the Government intend to recognise annulment of marriage by the Catholic Church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government could not be put in the position of having to recognise annulment granted by a specific Church.  The Government is the Government for all the people, of all religions.  The question of annulment raises serious <Col N="891" /> matters of concern to a growing number of citizens, as Deputy Davern indicated.  Because of the growing size of the problem, it is being examined by the Government with a view to seeing if the plight of these people can be eased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Church marriage is regarded by the State as a contract of marriage, and in the light of an annulment of that contract by the Church authorities because the contract did not have the necessary ingredients to maintain it, will the Minister comment on the view that the contract is no longer even a civil contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The people adjudicating on that contract would be the Church authorities, not the State.  In the eyes of the Church authorities there never was a valid contract and to that extent, in the view of the Church an annulment is granted.  It does not necessarily follow that the State will take the same view, nor does it follow from what the Deputy says that because the Church is the registrar for the State in these cases, the State should apply Church law.</P>

Can the Minister indicate if this review body which is being set up will consider extending the grounds under which civil nullity can be granted, to have it coincide with the Canon Law grounds of nullity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the grounds of nullity under the civil law will have to be looked at.  A review without looking at those grounds and considering their aptness or otherwise, whether they should be narrowed or widened, would be pointless. The Deputy can take it that they will have to be looked at and examined.  I am not saying the examination will lead to the conclusion that they should be on all fours with the grounds as found by the Church, because we live in a pluralist society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reforms he has introduced since March, 1973, to speed the process in the Land Registry office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Many remedial measures, including the reorganisation of both the legal-clerical and the mapping structures, have been taken in recent years in order to provide a more efficient service in the Land Registry. These arose from the implementation of recommendations made by a study group which was set up in 1968 to review the organisation and procedures of the registry.</P>
      <P>Early in 1974 I reconstituted the study group to continue the work of examining the organisation and procedures of the Land Registry and to furnish recommendations as to changes that should be made so as to enable the registry to discharge their functions more efficiently.  I accept the group's recommendations to the effect that a new mapping system should be introduced and a special section in the Mapping Branch is now working on the implementation of the new system. One of the main advantages of the new system is that, when it is operative, a registered owner will be able to obtain a copy of a document, known as a filed plan, which will comprise both the folio and the map relating to his holding. Under the existing system, a major source of delay has been the need for copy maps to be drawn by hand, which is a time-consuming process. Under the new system delays in this area will be completely eliminated, as it will be possible to produce copies of the filed plans photographically.</P>
      <P>The amount of work involved in the introduction of the new system is considerable but I am hopeful that it can be completed in a reasonable period of time.  I expect the study group will let me have, in the very near future, detailed plans showing how the new system can be fully implemented within a reasonable time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study group are also examining other areas of difficulty in the Land <Col N="894" /> Registry, notably first registrations, storage of documents and the question of accommodation generally.  I expect that the group will furnish early reports on these matters.</P>
    <P>Apart from fundamental changes, a number of remedial measures have been taken from time to time in order to reduce delays in the registry.  As a result of these measures, which included the working of overtime and an increase of 15 per cent in staff numbers since the beginning of 1973, the arrears of dealings in registered land, which constitute the main bulk of the work of the registry, have been reduced by 27 per cent since the beginning of 1973, despite the fact that the intake of dealings increased by 35 per cent during the same period.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that the improvement in the arrears position will not only be maintained but greatly accelerated as a result particularly of the changes which are being introduced.  I am most anxious that the Land Registry should provide the most efficient service possible and I will continue to do whatever I can to achieve this end. In this context I might mention that in order to facilitate the public in the lodgment of applications, I made an order in November, 1974, providing that fees could be paid by cash, banker's draft, money order, postal order or cheque as well as by Land Registry stamps, which was previously the only method by which fees could be paid.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy probably knows from his experience in practice, the procedures in the Land Registry have speeded up considerably in the last couple of years.  In order to speed them up even more, the project is to tackle what is the main cause of delay, namely, in the mapping procedures.  A process of photo-copying will be used more widely.  In the future when a copy folio is bespoken a new instrument will be furnished in the reply, an instrument which will contain the present folio and the present map in the one document in a photo-copy form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is satisfied that a lease does not come into this I will not pursue that aspect of the matter but I will go back now to what I was saying earlier on the question of the situation where you have property which is high in capital value and low in income and in which as a result, a limited interest charged on all of that property results in a totally distorted valuation of the limited interest for the purpose of assessment of wealth tax.  This is independent of the amendment that the Minister had down later dealing with the question of raising money to pay it and so on.</P>
      <P>I think it is true to say that in such a case one is getting a totally distorted valuation of the limited interest and therefore the apportionment provision in the section still gives you a distorted result.  The justification for this that the Minister gave us as I recall it is that failure to treat it in this way would leave the matter open to evasion or avoidance and also it would involve a number of valuations on the same property.</P>
      <P>To take the second point first, it might involve a number of valuations of the same property but surely the valuations are of different interests and that is the reason that you would have to have separate valuations.  The valuations would not be the same figure.  There would be the valuation of the limited interest; the valuation of the reversionary interest and possibly the valuation of a contingent interest.  But you would, in fact, if you did this be assessing tax on the real market value of each person's interest, not on as you get here, a totally artificial value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of avoidance. I doubt if it is beyond the wit of the Revenue Commissioners to devise methods which would overcome the efforts at avoidance principally by using the basic tools that we were referred to earlier of looking through <Col N="922" /> the transaction and seeing who is effectively the owner and in control of the particular interest or asset.  Such an approach would, I suggest, make the whole concept of the application of this tax more logical and more understandable and would avoid the kinds of anomalies which I have referred to earlier and illustrated.  I wonder if the Minister is fully satisfied that such an approach is really not practical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Colley can rest assured that very serious consideration has been given to this matter and that my advisers are satisfied and I am satisfied that the only practical way of dealing with it is the way in which we propose to deal with it here.  As the Deputy knows, subsection (3) says:</P>
      <P>Where the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession includes an interest which is a limited interest, the whole or the appropriate part of the property in which the limited interest subsists or on which it is charged or secured or on which the individual is entitled to have it so charged or secured shall be property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession.</P>
      <P>Then, as the Deputy knows, we have the method of valuing today.  We have the definition of &ldquo;appropriate part&rdquo; in subsection (5) (c):</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the appropriate part&rdquo;, in relation to property tax referred to in subsection (3), means that part of the property which bears the same proportion to the entire property as the gross income of the limited interest firstly referred to in subsection (3) bears to the gross income of the entire property, and the property to which the individual is beneficially entitled in possession shall be deemed to include the appropriate part of each and every item of property comprised in the entire property.</P>

Supposing that a person is entitled to an annuity of £1,000 and that it is charged on a fund which produces £10,000, and is valued at £100,000.  The value of the appropriate part there is £10,000&mdash;one-tenth of £100,000.  Of course it is not liable.  It does not come within the charge to tax, that is unless the threshold for the individual is exceeded.  If the income was £10,000 the value of the appropriate part would be £5,000.</P>

The exemptions and reliefs could not be applied if he were treated as having a mere chose-in-action or a right against the property.  Neither could these exemptions or reliefs be applied to remainder interest or a revisionary interest whether vested or contingent.  Deeming a life tenant to be entitled to the property gets over all arguments regarding the proper law of the settlement, the charity, <i>et cetera.</i> The Deputy may take it, as I say, that this has been gone into very carefully &mdash;I am slow to use the words &ldquo;in ignorance&rdquo;&mdash;but without being aware of what the position in other countries was and we find that the other countries had adopted this approach which we had arrived at independently. It is a satisfaction that there is this practically universal justification for our approach.  The exception is West Germany where they have another system where they tax the life-interest and the remainder interest.  Once the method of getting after the underlying property the &ldquo;appropriate part&rdquo; is understood there is no problem, there is no hardship and what we are doing is necessary in order to make the system workable.</P>

For a given time the limited interest will be ignored and you will go to the underlying value of the property to assess what the property is worth.  I can see why Deputy Colley is concerned about this point.  The underlying value could be valued at a much higher level than would be appropriate to a limited interest.  We want to ensure that this limited interest is not overvalued. That is the purpose of what Deputy Colley is trying to do here, to ensure that persons having a limited interest are not victimised.  I thought we could approach this on the same basis as Deputy Colley has mentioned, the value plus the limited interest.  I can see the Minister's point of view.  It would certainly create complications as regards value for two or three different factories within the property. This would probably create a problem and add another complication for the Revenue Commissioners.  What we are concerned about is to protect the person with the limited value.</P>
      <P>Take the case of property on the perimeter of Dublin that might be subject to development in the near future.  Here is a property the underlying value of which would be valued at a very high level.  But if there is a limited interest in the case of a family, a mother or nephew, as the case may be, will the apportionment in a case like that be accurate?</P>

It was done in good faith at that time.  Is there a danger <Col N="926" /> then that with the movement of the city out and property getting a much higher value that they could be penalised by virtue of the fact that the underlying value had appreciated by 500 or 600 per cent?  Could that type of situation not arise where this limited value has been created over the past 20 years long before what we are talking about?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I understand that on the Second Reading debate Deputy Colley said that he had no objection to the limited interest that we are dealing with now provided that the corpus of the fund was made liable for the tax. We have introduced an amendment to meet that point.  That is the purpose of the amendment I am making.  I am advised, and I accept, that if the limited interest is not made liable in the manner we are dealing with it then by means of settlements very valuable property can be settled in such a way that it would escape fictitiously all liability to tax.  This is a tax on capital as has been said.  That is the reason it must be done this way.  Otherwise it simply will not work.

      <P>Could I ask the Minister if the amendment to which he is referring will ensure that in all circumstances the estate will pay?  In other words, where there is a distorted value put on the limited interest and where the owner of the limited interest is, because of other property, liable to wealth tax the effect of the distorted value will not affect his liability for wealth tax but only the estate where it will not be distorted.  Does the Minister follow the point I am making?  Let me put it this way: A is the owner of a limited interest and the effect of applying this subsection is to value his limited interest, we will say at £50,000, when its market value might be only £10,000.  This is conceivable. If the effect of the Minister's amendment which is coming later is that no matter what A's liability for wealth <Col N="927" /> tax is other than in respect of the limited interest&mdash;suppose he is liable for wealth tax apart from the limited interest and then this £50,000 is added on for the purpose of assessing him for wealth tax can he, no matter what his liability under other heads, recover the wealth tax on the £50,000 on the estate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (5) (a), lines 9 to 14, to delete subparagraph (i) and to substitute the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  an individual who is not domiciled in the State on a valuation date and who has resided in the State for not less than&mdash;</P>
      <P>(I)  183 days in the year ending on that date, and</P>
      <P>(II)  183 days in each of six or more of the nine years immediately prior to that year,</P>
      <P>shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original subparagraph is being deleted and a new subparagraph is being substituted.  The effect is that liability in respect of global wealth will not arise in the case of an individual who is not domiciled in the State on the valuation date unless two conditions are fulfilled, that he has resided in the State for 183 days in the year ending on the valuation date and he has resided in the State for 183 days in each of the six or more of the nine years prior to that.  For the purposes of wealth tax the position of a foreigner will now be as follows.  He will always be liable for the tax on property situate in the State.  If he <Col N="928" /> comes here and does not acquire an Irish domicile his foreign property will not be liable for the seven years of his stay here.  After the seven-year period liability to tax on foreign property will arise only if conditions at (I) and (II) of the new subparagraph are fulfilled: that he has been there for 183 days in the year ending on the valuation date and that he has been there for 183 days in six or more of the nine preceding years.</P>
    <P>In view of the two tests it is possible that the liability to tax on the foreign property will be intermittent: liability may arise in the eighth year not in the ninth year, again in the tenth year depending on the movements of the individual.  If an individual does not reside for 183 days in the year prior to the valuation date his previous history is irrelevant.  That is, unless he is 183 days in the State on the relevant 5th April it does not matter what he was doing in the previous year.  Liability arises under the amended subsection where the individual has resided in the State for six months in the year.  This test is not the equivalent of &ldquo;resident&rdquo; as used in the income tax code.</P>
    <P>A person is resident for income purposes if he maintains a place of abode in the State and stays any time, however short, in the State during the year.  If he has not such a place of abode he must spend more than six months in the year to be regarded as resident.  For wealth tax purposes he must stay six months, whether or not he has a place of abode in the State, before liability can arise.  This approach has the special advantage that it simplifies the problem for both the public and the Revenue.  Whether or not a person has resided in the State for six months is a question of fact and readily ascertainable.  It removes all doubts on the issue.</P>
    <P>This amendment has the effect of removing from liability to the tax in respect of their global property the vast majority of persons who are not domiciled here but who, for business or social reasons, spend a couple of months each year in the State and who, for this purpose, maintain a residence here.  Under the Bill, as drafted, these people felt they were being caught unfairly with the result <Col N="929" /> that many representations were received in the matter.  The amendment should have the desired effect and should put the matter beyond doubt.  Residence alone seems to be the criterion for liability to wealth tax in most countries. That is certainly the case with European countries&mdash;Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.  The concept of domicile is a feature of common law countries and is unknown in these European countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the Minister that the definite specification brings an element of certainty that is desirable from the point of view of the administration of the Act and also from the point of view of the person charged.

      <P>Yes, but where he has property outside the State he does not incur any liability until he has fulfilled the two conditions in this section.  As the Minister has pointed out, there is one condition with regard to the year immediately preceding the valuation date; he must have been there for just over the six months and, if he fulfils that condition, then you have to look back and see if he fulfils the further condition.  If the answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the first, then the question does not arise.  So far so good.  The Minister has referred to the type of country that can be involved. We would be particularly concerned with certain countries and the question naturally arises as to how this ties in with the similar provisions of these countries.  For instance, a question of double taxation might arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but this <Col N="930" /> brings in a problem.  We are in the Common Market and there will be growing economic inter-relationships involving the owning of property outside the State.  Take a specific example: supposing an ordinary citizen&mdash;I do not want to use any of the technical words here&mdash;of some continental state within the Common Market has property here; if he fulfils this condition this property, say in France, is captured for the purpose of wealth tax here.  That involves double liability on his part, namely, making the appropriate return here and then paying the tax on the assessment.  Am I right in that?  He makes the appropriate return here after the assessment. It could be that he is, at the same time, capitally taxable in his own country for precisely the same property.  If there is a double taxation agreement the matter can be resolved. I presume taxation of this sort, as the income tax code did, will stimulate double taxation agreements.  Assume for the moment that there is not a double taxation agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Assume there is a corresponding tax, and assume the property is taxable in the same sense in both countries, the question I am asking is are the terms of these provisions as near as possible on all-fours?  In other words, can we get an automatic element into it?  If in the country in Europe where he is a citizen and where his principal place of residence would be, and he spends six months of the year here and six months of the year there, he qualifies under this&mdash;if you had precisely the same provision in both countries the whole thing would work automatically because he would be automatically excluded in the one by that one day. It is six months and one day; the 183 days boils down to six months and one day.  If he is six months and one day here he cannot be six months and one day in the other; he is six months less one day in the other country.  If the tax is comparable, it is simply a question of where does he pay and at what rate.  I would like to know if that <Col N="931" /> aspect has been considered and if the Minister has any information on that point.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley brings up another issue when he points out that France has no wealth tax.  You may be dealing with countries that have not got this type of taxation and we are not, in this section, confined to the Common Market.  Even if all the Common Market countries were involved you would still have other countries where this did not apply.  In that case, the problem is resolved for the gentleman by his keeping a diary; he makes sure he has an efficient secretary who tots up how many days he spends in each country and, when he reaches the 180th day, he gets out.  The more knowledgeable people may say: &ldquo;There is something more to this than you see&rdquo; and I would like to see what the little something more is, if there is something more to it.  I am thinking of the exercise in practice.  That is the big objection to the Minister's amendment, as I see it.  I see all the points in its favour.  I go all the way with the Minister in this but it seems as if we are trying to have it both ways&mdash;to criticise some of the amendment stimulated by comment and an attempt to meet the comments of Deputy Colley in this.  I do not want to put it in that way, but one of the difficulties about a specific definition like this is that anti-avoidance in the most virtuous sense is so facilitated. We are talking in Committee and it is as well to see&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but it is the capturing of the foreign property for the purposes of here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am taking the case where that foreign property is capitally taxable here, if it is captured within this section, but which is not capitally taxable in the country where the person concerned is ordinarily resident.  In that case, as I say, the simple solution is to keep a diary and he avoids capital taxation altogether.  Where there is equality of code, there is no problem. I do not wish to hold up the House <Col N="932" /> and if I am, so to speak, barking up the wrong tree, I would like to be stopped.  I am referring here to an old point.  On the one hand one wants to control the powers given to any State agency to keep control in this House and we had to argue that very strongly on the last Schedule of the last Bill. On the other hand I am equally strongly in favour of delegating the proper discretions.  Once you give fairly definite guidelines to the Revenue Commissioners, I have confidence that they would say: &ldquo;Do not confine discretion too narrowly in the mathematical sense.  Because it may work injustice.  We have plenty of experience of our own agency to know that discretion will always be applied in reason&rdquo;. Perhaps I had better leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The next point I am raising is: what will happen to double taxation? Will double taxation agreements cover it?  What is the position <i>vis-á-vis</i> ingrafting and the fixing of six months plus a day?  What is the position in relation to, say, the countries we are most likely to be dealing with?  And lastly, where the property in a country is not capitally taxable a person can evade taxation by the simple device of carefully keeping his diary.  Is there a disadvantage in this section as against the original drafting?  I think that is a simple question.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> In regard to countries that have no wealth tax, the question of double taxation will not arise, but it will be in the interest of the person who has property here to establish that he is not domiciled and ordinarily resident here within the amendment as I am asking the House to accept.  I understand that this is a problem the Revenue Commissioners have been dealing with for years.  They have been dealing with it in regard to income tax and they are aware of the type of people likely to be involved in this tax.  In income tax they would be asked to produce evidence to the Revenue Commissioners in the form of&mdash;it may sound odd to us&mdash;travel tickets, hotel vouchers or something of that nature.  It is a matter of considerable importance to these taxpayers, and, therefore, they keep much more accurate diaries than some of us would.  They have evidence to back up the diaries.  I am told that this is the way this works.</P>
      <P>The whole section, as originally drafted, was intended to deal with foreigners but some, as I said in introducing the amendment, felt that they would be caught as being domiciled or resident within the section if they were only here for a couple of weeks and had a residence here.  We wanted to put the position beyond doubt.  That is the purpose of this amendment, which spells out very clearly that the person must be here 183 days in the year ending on the relevant date and must be here 183 days in each of six of the previous nine years.  I think that answers the point raised by Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde said earlier in regard to this amendment that it was a relieving amendment. <Col N="934" /> The Minister said it was introduced because of the various representations received by people who felt they were going to be caught and should not be. It occurred to me that there might be another reason for this amendment. When I look at it I find that it very neatly introduces the concept of residing in the State and then goes on at the end to deem to be domiciled and ordinarily resident.  The Minister will recall my difficulty in regard to the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  I raised this quite a long time ago with the Minister for Finance and as a result &mdash;I am not going to go into all the details of what transpired across the floor in the House&mdash;the Minister for Finance undertook to let me have details of the basis and the cases on which he claimed that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; was clearly defined, despite the information that had been given to me by various well qualified sources that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not defined anywhere with any degree of precision.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I reminded the Minister for Finance that he had undertaken to give me this information and that I had not got it.  Last week I reminded the Minister for Lands, sitting in for the Minister for Finance, that this was the position and I still did not have it. As of this minute I have not got it.  I believe there is considerable difficulty arising as a consequence of the non-statutory definition of the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy de Valera is saying is quite true.  In effect, this amendment is providing, at least in this class of <Col N="935" /> case, a definition of what is &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  In the course of doing so it uses the word &ldquo;resided&rdquo; in the State.  When the Minister was talking about the amendment, he clearly believed, and gave us to believe, that that means actual, physical presence in the State.  The Minister is presumably aware of the fact that under other codes, income tax in particular, one could be deemed to be certainly ordinarily resident&mdash;I do not know if one could be deemed to be residing in the State&mdash;for a year, without actually physically being in the State for a year. I would like to know the basis on which the Minister says that the term &ldquo;resided here&rdquo; means that you must be actually present for the 183 days in the State, because on the definitions that are available, and the interpretations of these terms in the past, it would seem that it was not necessary to be physically present in the State. I think the Minister would agree that it is of considerable importance that we know precisely what is being provided here in regard to persons of the type covered in this part of the section.</P>

      <P>I would like to add one further point to Deputy Colley's argument here, merely to reinforce it.  The Minister will remember that on section 1 I raised the whole question of <i>in pari materia</i>.  Now if these Acts were to be so, if the point of view that I have taken were to be held to have any substance, notwithstanding my learned friends' contrary opinion, we are introducing a definition into the code that might have unforeseen effects.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> You would not go back to that sort of slavery again.  To get on to Deputy Colley's argument, we have two types of person here.  We have the person who is domiciled and ordinarily resident <Col N="936" /> here.  He is a person who is domiciled according to the well-known criterion of domicile which has been used here for estate duty purposes since estate duty was introduced.  Now you have that person who is domiciled and ordinarily resident here, and for the purposes of that individual, &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; has the meaning ascribed to it by the income tax code over the years and operated by the Revenue Commissioners in regard to income tax.</P>

That is domiciled, and ordinary resident for a person who is domiciled. We have here in this amendment the man who is not domiciled, in other words, he has not the intention of living here permanently.  He is not domiciled but he seemed to be domiciled, if he has resided here for the required period, that is 183 days in the year ending on the valuation date and in six of the nine years before that.  We do not have to define every blessed word we use&mdash;&ldquo;has resided in the State&rdquo; means that he has slept in the State, or tried to sleep for 183 nights, and I think that Deputy Colley is really going too far.  I know that it is the business of the Opposition to raise obstacles and they are certainly discharging that obligation very well&mdash; going too far to question the wording.</P>

      <P>We will try not to do that.  The Minister has given satisfactory answers to me, but Deputy Colley raises a point that I think we should not pass, even though the answer in the end may be the same as in the other cases, and I would like to recap in this form.  This definition introduces what is, in effect, a definition of &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on that valuation date&rdquo;.  It is a definition of these terms, primarily for this Bill.  I think everyone will agree that, being a taxation measure, it will be strictly construed so far as the taxpayer is concerned in the first instance.  If it is being construed <Col N="939" /> in the interest of the taxpayer one should confine one's self to that definition alone and not go beyond it. That is an end to the matter.  But if the circumstances should be different &mdash;I am not going to expand the argument; I merely wish to mention it&mdash; the point, <i>in pari materia</i> with the other three measures and even the income tax code, could conceivably arise. Deputy Esmonde will see that I am trying to be accurate and not provocative. I admit that the matter is completely arguable and perhaps the balance of the better opinion would lie with the Minister although, as I said, I think that in certain cases, I would be prepared to argue it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it states, &ldquo;for the purpose of this Act&rdquo; but I am getting into the old <i>pari materia</i> argument again and I do not wish to do that.  The balance of the better opinion may very well lie with the Minister, so I would not refuse the challenge if it were to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that case, it is only if the construction were favourable to the taxpayer that it could arise.  In my submission, it could arise against the Revenue Commissioners.  It is the protection of the Revenue Commissioners we are talking about on this point, not the taxpayer.  As Deputy Esmonde pointed out very early in the debate on section 1, the taxpayer will be protected by the principle of the most strict and the most appropriate construction in his favour.  I think I am right in that.  But <i>per contra</i> the Revenue Commissioners may be at the opposite end of the stick and I am raising the point in that sense.  There is no need to expand on it because the practicality of it is this: the Revenue Commissioners, in the colloquial phrase, did not come up yesterday; they have a lot of experience and no doubt know what they <Col N="940" /> are doing.  I am perfectly happy that having once raised this point on section 1 they are alert to it.  If there is any trap in it they will look after their own interests, and I am quite prepared to leave it at that.</P>

I see no problem in the future in so far as the returns will have to be made annually and after six years there will be no difficulty because the Revenue Commissioners' records will be there.  But Deputy Fitzpatrick has a point in raising the question of the previous six years.  Income tax and capital property are not quite the same thing. The evidence may or may not be there for six years behind us.  I give two general answers to that: first, the Revenue Commissioners know what they are doing and they are the only people who can advise the House, through the Minister, whether there is any problem there; secondly, we are not so vindictive as to be worried about missing out a little retrospectively. It would not be of great financial concern to the State to lose out retrospectively on this so it does not arise as a practical problem.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick had a point to raise there and I should like the Minister to confirm or otherwise that the attempted answers I have given there are the correct ones.  I seem to be giving the Minister's answers now.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Deputy is worried about how the Revenue Commissioners are going to decide whether a person has been here for 183 days in six out of the nine years that have gone past.  The answer <Col N="941" /> is that unless he is or has been here or hereabouts for seven years the matter will not arise because he will not be alive.  If he has been here, the probability is that he has been dealing with the Revenue Commissioners in regard to income tax and they will have a lot of information about him. The movements of people in this category are pretty well known.  I suppose if a man had a residence here and the Revenue Commissioners thought he had been living here for the past seven years, they would put an assessment on him under the income tax code.  His advisers would come in and talk it over.  There has to be a common-sense approach to all these sorts of things and this is just one of the teething problems.  There are teething problems in any innovation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not think it will work out as simply as that because it is quite obvious that representations have been made to the Minister in regard to this section and this is why we have this amendment here.  Of course it serves a fundamental purpose which we will pursue on another section of the <Col N="942" /> Bill.  As Deputy Colley has already mentioned, the 183 days have not been established in any of the income tax laws where they tried to establish domicile and especially ordinary residence. Unless that number of days is established, it will be important to the Revenue Commissioners to say : &ldquo;You have been here for 183 days in the past seven years&rdquo;.  The section will be of vital importance to people who have property abroad.  They will be rearranging their affairs from now on. Whether the Revenue Commissioners will be capable of establishing the fact that they have resided here over the past six years will be a major problem for the Revenue Commissioners, where this particular type of person is concerned. He will undoubtedly now be looking at his whole financial arrangements and from now on he will consult the calendar with regard to the number of days he will reside in this country.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with people who could have substantial wealth abroad. These people are well advised by their accountants as to the exact number of days they will spend in every country, especially in Ireland.  The Minister has stated that the same regulation exists in the other European countries where there is a wealth tax, but I am convinced that it will be very difficult to ascertain that information. The Revenue Commissioners say: &ldquo;We can use another guideline.  We have some other means of doing this.&rdquo; This Bill provides for 183 days over the previous nine years and, irrespective of whether the Revenue Commissioners would like to decide on any other issue or not, I do not think they would be entitled to do so.  All this person has to say is: &ldquo;I did not spend 183 days over the previous nine years in this State.&rdquo;  This will be very difficult to prove.  I doubt very much that the Revenue Commissioners will be able to prove it.  I am looking at the section in the Bill to see how it will operate.  There is no good in having a section in the Bill if we think it cannot operate to the benefit of the entire Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we read the Bill now it is quite obvious that people will be taking a <Col N="943" /> different view of their whole financial structures and their place of residence in any particular country.  I am raising this problem because I can see it arising immediately this Bill goes through the House.</P>

I would be accused of driving those people out of the country.  It would be said I was making it impossible for them to know where they stood in regard to this tax.  All sorts of accusations would be levelled against me, acting for the Minister for Finance.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Revenue Commissioners are the people who will have to operate these sections.  The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that this subsection is workable, as drafted, and after all they are the people who will be responsible for operating it.  We should <Col N="944" /> take their advice, which is based on experience over many years in dealing with people who have been liable over the years, for income tax here under these circumstances. I am told the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the type of person they will be interested in in this regard will be able to establish whether or not he comes within this.  Indeed, as of now, he would most probably have been dealt with during the past seven years.</P>
      <P>If they have not been dealing with them over the past seven years because they were not here, then there is no problem because they will not be liable to this tax.  I would suggest to Deputy Fitzpatrick that he should leave this with the Revenue Commissioners for the time being and if they find that they have not got the tools to do the job, he may be certain that they will be back here asking for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that is the real significance of the point Deputy Fitzpatrick is making.  As I understand it the Minister is saying that in most of these cases in fact the Revenue Commissioners were dealing with such people in respect of income tax and the evidence will be available.  That may be so.  but presumably there must be a number of them who were not dealing with the Revenue Commissioners. However, I am not pursuing that matter very much further, though I think that Deputy Fitzpatrick has a very strong point when he says it might turn out to be unworkable in so far as some people are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to return to the point that I raised earlier which the Minister may think is a small point, but I want to <Col N="945" /> assure him it is a vital point and will be for very many people, to get this absolutely right.  The Minister described the meaning of domiciled as defined over the years.  I agree with him 100 per cent in what he says.  He went on and seemed to imply that the same thing was true in regard to the definition of &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, but it is not.  That is what the real trouble is.  I do not want to go on repeating myself but there is some significance in the fact that when I raised this point on the capital gains tax, the Minister for Finance was unable to point out what was the basis for the statement that this was clearly defined over the years.  When pressed, he stated that it would be aiding people unnecessarily if he gave it to the House and he would give it to me privately.  He did not and I reminded him afterwards and I did not get it, I reminded the Minister for Lands last week and I still have not got it.  There is some significance in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I hope the Deputy will accept that I am not deliberately withholding it.  I never thought of it since it was mentioned here before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, though the Minister will appreciate&mdash;I know from my experience as a Minister&mdash; that when a thing like this happens in the House the normal thing is that the official concerned makes sure that it is done.  I accept the fact that because it has not been done there is a difficulty. I shall not pursue that any further.  All I am saying is that it is of some significance in the light of this amendment and its wording.  I must get this as clear as I can; so far I do not understand it although the Minister may believe that he has explained it very clearly.  The point is that since the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not clearly defined under &ldquo;case law&rdquo; and it is not defined at all in the statutes, we find that in the amendment the Minister is defining here something that will be deemed to mean &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; in a particular class of cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is all right but we are entitled <Col N="946" /> in those circumstances to try to find out what precisely is the meaning of the definition.  In so far as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has been defined at all, one thing that can be said with certainty about this term, which is being imported into this at the bottom of the amendment, is that it can cover a situation in which the individual concerned was not physically present in the country at all for years. &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo;, I take it, can cover that.  The Minister said that by using the word &ldquo;resided&rdquo; in this and then defining that later on as, in the circumstances, meaning &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;, &ldquo;residing&rdquo;, means physical presence in the State. I should like to ask him on what basis does he say that having regard to the fact that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; does not mean that?  I am not saying he is wrong.  I just want to know why or on what authority he is saying that &ldquo;resided&rdquo; means physically present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Words in a section or in an Act which are not given any special meaning and which are not specially defined, are given an ordinary, everyday meaning of The ordinary, everyday meaning of the word &ldquo;reside&rdquo; is to be physically in a place at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a flaw in that argument, because the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is not defined in any Statute.  Therefore, on the basis of what the Minister is saying, it should have been interpreted in its ordinary meaning.  I think the Minister will agree that no ordinary meaning of the term &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; would envisage not being present in the State for a year and still being deemed to be ordinarily resident for a year. Therefore if we let this phrase go as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; went in the past, we can end up with an artificial definition of &ldquo;reside&rdquo;.  This is why I am paying such attention to this particular phrase.  As I already said, I am reasonably convinced that there was a motive in the introduction of this amendment in addition to the motive mentioned by the Minister as being in response to representations and in ease of the people.  I do not deny that <Col N="947" /> it may be in ease, but I think it is doing more than that.  The key to what it is doing lies in the word &ldquo;resided&rdquo; and in the manner in which a definition is being spelled out in the phrase &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;. It is a matter of considerable importance which we are entitled and indeed obliged to pursue as far as we can to get the exact consequence of what is in this amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I just want to say again that the Deputy is introducing the terms &ldquo;resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; have acquired a special meaning within the income tax code. Section 3 (1) says: &ldquo;a person who is domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; that is the man who is domiciled in the State, and we know what the meaning of that is.  Then &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; comes within the meaning of the income tax code.  When we come to this amendment we are dealing with another type of individual, with &ldquo;an individual who is not domiciled in the State.  That is important.&rdquo; An individual who is not domiciled in the State on a valuation date and who has resided&mdash;&ldquo;resided&rdquo; there is the simple word &ldquo;resided&rdquo;, it is in no way connected with &ldquo;ordinarily resident.&rdquo; It goes on to say he is not domiciled but he has resided for the period specified in (I) and (II) and he then &ldquo;shall be deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;, which is a different thing.  He is deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident if he has in fact done what was mentioned earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That, I think, would meet it because, if I may put the argument in reverse we could get into a legal circle here&mdash;I understand that the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has been judicially interpreted in such a way that the consequences, pointed out by Deputy Colley, follow.  It seems surprising to the lay man at first glance that &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; can cover a man who has not actually physically resided at a particular place for a year, but lawyers can well contemplate cases where the contrary interpretation would be valid.</P>
      <P>The danger that I see is that the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, having been subjected to such judicial interpretation and the consequences which Deputy Colley has pointed out, having been accepted, may be taken to define what is meant technically by the phase &ldquo;who has resided&rdquo;.  I am talking in legal terms now.  The danger is that on a question of interpretation the court would invert its approach and say &ldquo;we do know what ordinarily resident means&rdquo;.  This is a very convenient yardstick for deciding what &ldquo;who has resided&rdquo; means, notwithstanding that the Minister is very clear in his own mind as to what he intends.</P>
      <P>Whether, therefore, the Minister adopts the suggestion which we have made that the word &ldquo;physically&rdquo; be used to qualify the words or finds some other suitable form to express his intention, the matter is worthy of detailed and careful consideration, particularly from the Revenue point of view.  We are glad that the Minister will look into it.  We will be very interested to know what the result of the research on that point will be.</P>

      <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, the taxable wealth of an individual other than an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State on the valuation date shall comprise only the property situate in the State to which he is beneficially entitled in possession on that date.</P>
      <P>The Minister has referred to this subsection and has said that the meaning of &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo; is such that it does not include the ownership of shares in a foreign company which effectively controls and owns property situate in the State.  I do not know whether the Minister would agree with my version of what he said, but I give the specific example he referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one assumes that, say, an American citizen and resident of the United States sets up here a factory with substantial investment and assistance from the IDA the normal pattern is that an Irish company is formed and therefore the ownership of the property here is vested in that Irish company but the shares in the Irish company are owned by an American company, a trading company in each case.  There are cases we know of where this is the set-up and where the shares in the American company are owned virtually 100 per cent by an individual, perhaps one or two by relatives, but substantially by one individual. The practice of the Revenue Commissioners under the death duty code has been and will be under the Capital Gains Tax Bill, in such circumstances, to look through the transaction and to determine who effectively owns and controls that property which is represented by the shares in the American company.  If they find that the effective ownership <Col N="952" /> and control of the property in the State is in the hands of X, then X is liable to them for whatever tax arises on the property.</P>
    <P>That has been the general approach of the Revenue Commissioners.  In the Capital Gains Tax Bill there are some detailed rules set out for determining whether property is situate in the State or whether it is not.  But in this Bill there are no such rules.  It simply states &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo;.  If one followed the normal approach adopted by the Revenue Commissioners one would conclude that in the kind of situation I have described that American citizen would be deemed to be the owner of property situate in the State. but the Minister has told us that that is not so, that in fact in such circumstances the American is deemed to be the owner of the shares in the American company and is not situate in the State and therefore does not come under this subsection.  That is what the Minister has told us.</P>
    <P>If one follows the line that has been followed heretofore one does not reach the conclusion the Minister reached.  If we assume that the conclusion the Minister reached is the correct one then what do we find?  We find that in the case I have described that American individual shareholder is not liable for wealth tax and of course neither the Irish nor the American trading companies are liable for wealth tax.  So effectively that operation&mdash;we will assume for the moment that it is a manufacturing factory&mdash;is not liable for or affected by wealth tax.  There may well be within half a mile of that factory another factory engaged in the same business and competing.  It is owned by an Irish trading company the shares in which are owned by Irish residents and Irish citizens and in that case the wealth tax is applied to the Irish shareholders with the consequent effect on the company that that extra amount of money, plus the income tax on it as I explained earlier, has to be paid out.  So there is extra overhead added to the operation of that factory because it is owned and controlled by Irish residents and Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>You could take a situation in which exactly the same thing happened but <Col N="953" /> with hotels close to each other and competing in the same resort, in the same area.  If the Minister's interpretation is correct what I have described is the position and therefore this section proposes deliberately to discriminate against Irish shareholders in companies of that kind.  This is what I was referring to this morning, where the Minister finds himself in the position that either he has to discriminate against Irish people in favour of foreign investors or, alternatively, he has to impose the tax on foreign investors and thereby risk inhibiting encouragement of investment from abroad.</P>
    <P>When I said this morning that we, in protesting in this matter, were not being inconsistent and that both propositions were valid, that is the proposition that there should not be discrimination against Irish people on the one hand and on the other hand the proposition that we should not inhibit investment from abroad, I was saying that those two propositions are valid and it is not contradictory on our part to put them forward.  The contradiction lies with the Minister and with the attitude that is taken up in this Bill because the Minister finds himself, under this section, obliged to come down on one side or the other and the side on which he has come down is to discriminate against Irish people.  If he took the other side we would still attack him and we would not be inconsistent because the two propositions we are putting forward are correct, I believe.  I do not think the Minister would dispute either of them but he finds himself in the position that he has to make a choice between two propositions, each of which is valid and he has to choose one and reject the other.</P>
    <P>The reason that this is happening is that the basic concept of this Bill is wrong.  That concept is that you should apply a wealth tax to productive assets in an economy like ours which needs to attract investment from abroad as well as encouraging Irish people to invest in productive assets.  These are the two requirements which I think everybody accepts that we need in this country.</P>
    <P>This Bill, because of its basic concept <Col N="954" /> being wrong, its basic concept of applying a wealth tax to productive assets, produces this result that we either discriminate against Irish people who invest or we inhibit investment from abroad.  I think that the Minister has in his interpretation of subsection (2) opted to discriminate against Irish people presumably so as not to inhibit investment from abroad. We should not be in the position of having to opt between these two.  The reason that we are in it, and I repeat, is that the basic concept of the wealth tax in our circumstances applying to productive assets is wrong and it is producing this ridiculous situation which I do not think we should be put in and I do not think the Minister should be put in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I stand over the attitude I have taken at the commencement of this Committee Stage debate.  Take the example given by Deputy Colley.  There is an Irish trading company established here, presumably, and owned by an American trading company, the shares of the American trading company being owned by American citizens resident in America.  I repeat that those shares are not liable to wealth tax because they are shares in an American company held by American citizens.  It is true that some of the profits, some of the wealth, owned by that American company comes from its operations here which are giving employment and adding to the economy.  That is the position and I stand over it.  The very same position exists at the present time in regard to death duties.  There has never been any complaint about it or never any suggestion that it should be otherwise.  In that very same situation, the Irish trading company owned by the American trading company, whose shares are owned by American citizens, or people resident in America, those shares on the death of the owner are not affected by death duties at all. Neither do the shares attract wealth tax.  I see nothing inconsistent in that, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley had an amendment down this morning which we discussed for a long time, the object of which was obviously to confer a benefit on <Col N="955" /> foreigners who own shares in Irish trading companies.  He argued it very forcefully.  I argued that it was not necessary, that it did not affect many people but, if it did affect people, Deputy Colley was quite prepared to confer on those foreigners a benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister has referred in the past to amendments coming up he might refer to the fact that I have an amendment coming up to abolish wealth tax on all productive investment.  Would the Minister deal with that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am dealing with that point.  There is nothing new about this.  That is the position as it operated in regard to death duties over the years.  That is the position as it will operate in regard to wealth tax.</P>
      <P>I can see that shares in Irish trading companies, in the hands of people who are deemed to be domiciled and resident here, are subject to the tax.  I can see that, but there are generous thresholds as I have stated, up to £100,000 which can be scattered around and I do not think it is likely to inflict any hardship.  Even under the income tax code there has been a recognition over the years that foreigners can have substantial deposits in Irish banks and I think&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;may buy Irish Government securities and national loans and the income will be disregarded for income tax.  In regard to the ordinary Irishman, the banks are obliged, under legislation enacted by the previous Government, to make a return to the Revenue Commissioners, giving particulars of any deposits held so that tax can be levied but they are not required to do that in regard to foreigners.  Again, this is a storm in a teacup.  There is no precedent being established; there is no innovation.  We are following, by and large, the practice carried out in the past.  The underlying principle in all this is that a trading company as I have said <i>ad nauseam,</i> is not subject to wealth tax.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> As Deputy Belton has reminded me, the American is subject to whatever forms of tax exist there.  I know that is no concern of ours.  On the other hand, if an Irishman owned shares in an American company, he would pay the tax here and the death duties. There is nothing inconsistent about this if you do not look under the surface to try to find something inconsistent.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's answer and, in the sense in which he uses those words, I do not controvert him, but there is a difficulty, if not an inconsistency, that goes to the root of the matter.  In effect, putting it in its simplest terms, the capital of the Irish company will be taxed in one case and will not be taxed in the other.  Let us get these fundamental points clear.  The Minister has made a good case and has pointed out the consistency with the Revenue Commissioners.  This is fine as far as it goes.  I do not want to say that I agree with the Minister as far as he has gone.  Will the Minister <Col N="957" /> please accept that I am taking his arguments in the most sympathetic spirit?  there is a basic fact that, whereas looking at it from the point of view of this code, it would be difficut to answer some of the Minister's points, there is still a basic difficulty; in one case there is a capital tax attaching to one company and there is none in the other.  That is the basic principle.  That creates a certain difficulty.</P>

      <P>I may do it later, but I do not have time now to spell out the whole point of the case. Accepting that the Minister does not accept my premise, will he allow me to make my argument on that basis in order to save time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this is so, does it not really get down to a fundamental matter of principle which has been summarised by Deputy Colley?  Could we not, in this taxation code, differentiate in some way between productive asset and non-productive asset?  Obviously, from the point of view of the economy, take a trading company or, more pertinently, a manufacturing company, a company that employs a number of people and is manufacturing a product, from a social point of view, bringing in factors which will stimulate the growth and activities of this company is desirable.  If the wealth of that company is taxed, even when it is in the hands of the individual shareholders, a liability is still put on the company and it inhibits the reinvestment of profits in that company.  This is the point I should like to develop: it is essentially a matter of how far wealth can be used <Col N="958" /> for productive purposes.  The wealth which is being syphoned off merely to pay the housekeeping expenses of the State, to support the superstructure, is wealth for productive and reproductive purposes taken out of the economy.  We are at the basic point of the argument here.  I have sympathy with the Minister if he feels: &ldquo;Oh, not again,&rdquo; when this point comes up.  We cannot but come back to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had virtually finished yesterday evening.  I was summing up by saying that there is very little evidence, in this Dublin-orientated Government, of any concern for the people in the West.  In particular, the Minister for Finance has proved that he has little knowledge of the situation and has no desire, apparently, to help.  I appreciate that he has serious problems on his own doorstep. This evening's paper once again gives banner headlines about the steadily deteriorating job situation in Dublin City.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last week similar headlines dealt with the very bleak prospects for the younger people who will emerge from school this year.  I can <Col N="959" /> understand why he has problems other than regional problems.  Obviously he must be concerned with what is now, to him, the greatest single difficulty of all, that is, a disastrously deteriorating situation where unemployment is concerned, in Dublin. All these facts re-emphasise the necessity for preserving for us on the west coast whatever funds are now available, or may be available in the future, to provide for our existing people there and also for the younger people who are, this year and in the future, to come on the labour market.</P>
    <P>As I said yesterday evening, this Minister in particular has not shown any appreciation, or evidence that he appreciates, the situation of the people of the West.  It seems obvious that he is concerned with providing them with sops, with substitutes for work. In other words, as far as he is concerned, he is happy enough, and that would appear to be Government philosophy as well that these people, rather than being provided with work, be provided with a place in a dole queue as a substitute.</P>
    <P>If this is the situation for older people, what will be the prospects for the younger people, for they appear to be nil?  Therefore, it is essential that as a result of this debate, we in this House and the people we represent in the country areas, should extract a firm undertaking from the Government that whatever funds percolate into our economy, intended for the benefit of the western areas and the more depressed parts of the country generally, will be used for the purposes for which they are intended and in pursuance of the Directives of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Kelly as Parliamentary Secretary, with his own personal knowledge of the situation in the West, shares my desires that this development should take place in the future.  I know also that he shares with all of us in the West the determination that we, as public representatives, will do everything in our power to redeem the promises we made when asking the people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum.  As I said last night, <Col N="960" /> I am sure the people understand why some of the delay took place.  What they would not understand, and would never forgive, is the diversion of any funds intended to be used for regional purposes into the general Exchequer. I look forward to the undertaking asked for by Deputy Colley and sincerely hope that it will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is concerned with Regulation 724-75 of the Council of Europe, 18th March, 1975, which establishes the European Regional Development Fund.  The suggestion put forward by the Opposition is that the money being made available will be used by the Government for past expenditure. This is patently not so.  The Opposition may feel that way, and they may be making a case.  But there are certain in-built safeguards in this regulation. What I would like to remind the House of is that this is just not a direction but a regulation, which means it has the force of law in this country, just as we pass any statute or Act in this House.</P>
      <P>We have done a lot of work in this sphere of the EEC's activity in the Joint Committee of both Houses which deals with secondary legislation and the implications and effects of European legislation in our laws.  As I understand the position, this regulation comes under Article 235 of the Treaty of Rome.  In other words, it is a programme which is not provided for in so many words in the Treaty of Rome as it stands.  It has to be imported to and added under Article 235.</P>
      <P>That has now been effected after considerable difficulties, delays and virtual disappointments of the hopes of people in this country in that the amount of the fund has been so small and so short of our expectations, so short of our actual necessities, and the fund as provided at the moment is virtually a part fund, a trial period fund for three years.  It is very important that we administer that fund in the best way possible to leave the door open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain statements have been made <Col N="961" /> in relation to this regional fund which caused me some concern.  The reason is that one must bear in mind that so far as the application of the regional fund in this country is concerned, the region involved is the whole of the State.  We must look on it as a fund that can be applied anywhere in the State because that is a designated area for the purposes of this fund in its application to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be irreverent. This fund is for the purposes of implementing the key article in the Treaty, which is Article 2.  The task is to promote the harmonious development of economic activities.  We are all aware in this House that we have an under-developed country.  We have a difference in our country in relation to the other countries, because as I understand it, the fund cannot be applied in other countries for the whole of the national territory.  We are the only one that has our whole national territory under the auspices of this fund.  There is good reason for that because a country also badly in need of it is a certain area of Italy. Italy has a very strong industrial element, part of it, and that industrial sector can provide finance for the poorer areas.  In other words, Italy has something that she can fall back on. We are not in that position.  We are poor right across the board in terms of European wealth and European development. That is why it is important to bear in mind that whereas one's first inclination would be to pour all this money into the west of Ireland and into the north-western areas and exclude the others, if we do that in the next three years during this trial period, we will be making a case for the exclusion of other areas in this country.  I will come to that shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the purpose of this fund <Col N="962" /> is to correct regional imbalances&mdash; and it gives the criterion&mdash;resulting from a preponderance of agriculture, industrial change and structural under-employment.  It is also important to bear in mind when looking at this regulation that one should not confuse the situation that exists under the directive dealing with disadvantaged areas.  Some of us in this House have discussed this with various officials who are aware of the ongoing situation in relation to the disadvantaged areas and also in relation to the regional fund.  The criteria are somewhat different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read the motion, I understand the Deputies across the House are looking back into the past and making the case that all this money is being spent on some past situation.  This regulation can only be utilised and availed of in relation to projects since 1st January.  That is written into the regulation and it must be on the basis of proposals put up and accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For fear that some people will say that I am talking nonsense or off the top of my head&mdash;it will probably be said anyway&mdash;I would refer Deputies also to Article 8 of the regulation in which there is a very strict policing of this fund so far as this or any other country is concerned.  I do not know whether Deputies realise it but the Government here has to provide a quarterly statement to justify the continuation of payments from this fund for any particular project.  There are other very detailed criteria that arise under Article 4, which is the main article that sets out what it can be used for.  I understand that there has been quite a bit of correspondence in the public press as a result of articles written and there has been correspondence from the Minister for Finance in the matter, but what I would like to direct everybody who has been involved in this dispute or misunderstanding of the problem that arises under this regulation to is the last paragraph of Article 4 (2) (a) of the <Col N="963" /> regulation.  For fear that Deputies opposite may not have this Article, I quote:</P>
    <P>The contribution from the fund thus defined made pursuant to a prior decision of the member State concerned communicated at the same time as the request for this contribution either supplements aid granted to the relevant investment by public authorities or remains credited to those authorities and considered as a partial repayment of such aid.</P>
    <P>The regulation came in on 1st January, so we are speaking as from that date.  I think there must be agreement in this House by anybody who has any legal experience of reading these documents that you are tied down to that and you are tied down to the wording of this clause.  This is in large measure where the confusion has arisen.</P>

      <P>This is a very tender spot so far as I am concerned as a representative from Wexford.  There is a large area in my constituency known as the Macamores.  The Macamores at the moment apparently do not qualify for the disadvantaged area scheme, though it is a disadvantaged area.  It does not qualify under the criteria because the criteria are different under the disadvantaged areas scheme from those under the regional fund regulation.  You have to show a drop in population, the land and soil in difficulties and that the income is below the national average.  We are hard-working people in Wexford.  That is why we generate an income.  But we make the best of what we have.</P>

      <P>I am only talking about my own people and how we suffer under the disadvantaged area scheme.  Being in that position, I am naturally very interested in the application of the regional fund.  I feel that that fund does give us some hope in my country.</P>
      <P>There have been a lot of criticisms of what the Government have negotiated in relation to this fund.  I think our position under this fund is unique of all the nations involved.  We have held our own on the original proposals. We have in addition to getting 6 per cent of the fund a further six million units of account which brings us up to 6.5 per cent.  We are the only country that is treated in that way under this directive; there is a specific mention made of Ireland under this directive.</P>

      <P>We differ from every country that is involved in the regional fund but it just shows that our negotiators looked after our interests so far as they were permitted to do so within the limits of the fund made available.  It is commonplace to both sides of the House that the allocation of the fund is utterly inadequate for our purposes.  We must do the best we can.  Fighting among ourselves, by making false criticisms or saying that the Minister for Finance is going to take the money and shove it into the Exchequer and get lost there, is just so much nonsense.  He cannot do it under the regulations, he cannot even get the money unless he carries out a certain procedure.  He has to do it in the way that is laid down.  This regulation is part of the law of the <Col N="965" /> land and the Minister made that perfectly clear both in this House and outside it.  As far as I know from some notes that appeared in the national press, the Commission are satisfied that the Minister is doing the right thing and is, to put it bluntly, behaving himself within the terms of the regulations.</P>

      <P>I understand it came also from the Commission. However, the Parliamentary Secretary may know more about that.  We cannot limit this to any particular area of the country because if we do we damage ourselves.  In my constituency those who could benefit from the regional fund and who come within it are, first of all, Bord Iascaigh Mhara with the mussel industry which requires assistance.  The other matter is coast erosion which, obviously, is getting way beyond the capacity of any organisation in this country to deal with on its own.  We have a particular situation in Wexford.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>As this debate has developed it is becoming clear that two separate issues are arising. The approach of the Government side now to the second of these two issues, namely, that the fund be used to finance a special regional development programme in less developed parts of the country, is becoming quite interesting.</P>
      <P>First of all, we had Deputy Desmond yesterday and now Deputy Esmonde implying that because the whole of Ireland has been accepted as an area capable of designation and one which qualifies for assistance from the regional fund, that means that our hands are, for some reason or another, tied and that we have to allocate the moneys from that fund throughout the whole of Ireland. Deputy Desmond made the amazing discovery here yesterday that all parties are now agreed on this fact&mdash; that the whole of Ireland qualifies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the historical fact on the record, let me tell Deputy Desmond that, whether or not all parties were <Col N="966" /> agreed at the appropriate time, the Fianna Fáil Minister for Foreign Affairs, now Commissioner, Dr. Hillery, succeeded in negotiating on this issue.  He negotiated on the premise which was finally accepted, that all of Ireland qualified for assistance from this fund.  This was the basis of our negotiations at all times.  The basis of his case then, which was subsequently accepted, was not at any stage to exclude special provision within our own jurisdiction for specially designated areas but, in having this accepted, to prove our right to a greater share from the fund than the other countries.  This was the basis of the presentation of the case for all of Ireland, but that did not exonerate our Government when the fund was made available to us.  That did not exonerate us from applying within our own jurisdiction special regional programmes or a special regional policy which would be supplemented or assisted by these funds from the European Community. Let me make that point very clear in the first instance.  Any suggestion or attempt to imply that we are now almost bound to spread these moneys throughout the whole of Ireland is flying in the face of reality because we are not so bound.  The fact that all of Ireland has been accepted as qualifying under the regional fund simply accepts the reality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that even parts of Ireland in our jurisdiction which are comparatively much better off than other parts, here on the east coast, such as Deputy Esmonde's Macamores in Wexford, by the general standards of the Community qualify for assistance from the regional fund.  Of course, that does not exonerate our Government from having within our country a regional programme, and that is the point we make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the fund in its totality&mdash;and this is my second point&mdash;had met the expectations that were established in the first instance at the Paris Summit of 1972, the expectations that were raised to a very considerable extent <Col N="967" /> by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs, the statements which he made as to what would or would not be acceptable, then we might have contemplated including areas such as the Macamores or otherwise.  I say &ldquo;might&rdquo;.  Of course, the fund did not meet such expectations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which it does not qualify is that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his advisers cannot see that it fulfils the criteria.  On the basis that such areas do not fulfil the criteria, Deputy Esmonde seems to think that this is an argument then for putting them in under some other fund which, in fact, was not contemplated by the Fianna Fáil Party when we approached this regional fund and <Col N="968" /> was not the kind of argument that we, or his party, made when we asked our people to vote for membership of the Community and when we made reference to the regional fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right, and give it to the Macamores or Tipperary for that matter, and that is my constituency.  One of the realities is that the people here thought that the regional fund would be available throughout the whole country, through the Government, to correct imbalances in our community.  That is how we presented it then.  I do not recall anyone saying that when the regional funds were made available, they would be applied only in Wexford, Tipperary, Kildare, or elsewhere. We expected them to be made available for the whole country.  This fact cannot now be overlooked.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it is the exclusive candidate.  There may be some other limited pockets, and they may be of concern to some Deputies in the House.  Despite the progress reports we get from time to time from the Minister for Foreign Affairs on his achievements, this fund is not anything like adequate.  He is not to be faulted for that exclusively. The achievements have not measured up in any way to the promise of those heady days in 1973.  The reality is that the amount available this year is £4 million.  This is the sum that will be actually applied.  The Government then say: &ldquo;We are not that badly off.&rdquo;  We know they are badly off and <Col N="969" /> that is why we are looking for the assurance that that paltry sum&mdash;or £8 million as it will be in a full year &mdash;will not be taken into the maw of the Minister for Finance, who has stirred up all this confusion.</P>
      <P>We would all be happy if the Parliamentary Secretary could clear up this whole mess now, and also assure us that the money will be applied to our less-developed regions in a special fund, as Deputy Colley has very properly asked for.  If there is confusion it is the fault of the Minister.  Let me quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of 7th June, 1975, as per Deputy Charles McDonald.  We are told that the Minister reversed his foreign policy. We got this interesting comment and it is a quotation from the Commissioners in Brussels.  It does not indicate who the spokesman was, but it says:</P>
      <P>We were misreported when it was published that we had accepted Mr. Ryan's original proposal to use the regional fund moneys to reimburse part of the Irish Government's spending on regional development.</P>
      <P>Either the Minister made a proposal or he did not.  We did not dream that up on this side of the House.  Deputy Esmonde is at pains to reassure us that, because an application has to be submitted this year, that in itself is a guarantee that the money cannot be swallowed up by the Exchequer. That is not the case at all.  It could, in fact, be said: &ldquo;This is evidence of what we are doing with the regional fund.&rdquo;  It would not prevent the Government from putting money which they had originally allocated through their own regional policy into some other source and using the £4 million from the Community and saying: &ldquo;There is the clear evidence.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde has made some play with the fact that Article 4 of this Regulation provides an inbuilt guarantee and therefore there is no need for concern.  Let me point out some of the other provisions of Article 4, and in particular paragraph 2 (a) of Article 4 which says that in the case of infrastructural projects the Government are to take all necessary steps to ensure that assistance from the fund is given suitable publicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This, of course, means, and understandably so, that there will be clearly designated projects in a clearly designated fund and this can be ascertained as being evidence of the presence of the regional fund in Ireland, and evidence also of the presence of the European Community in Ireland, the presence which all of us promoted as <Col N="971" /> being of major consequence and major benefit to this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to be assured, in the proposals the Government are going to present, that we will have this guarantee, that assistance from the fund will be given the necessary publicity. The only way that can be done is by doing what Deputy Colley has suggested, that is, to set up a separate fund for the undeveloped regions. To do this there must be a policy for the undeveloped regions.  Until such time as we see clearly what that policy is, it will be difficult to have a fund.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, speaking of other areas said: &ldquo;It is not a good time for planning.&rdquo;  It is not an appropriate time apparently for planning in the context of our overall economy. If it is not an appropriate time for planning on the level of the general economy, it is hardly an appropriate time for planning for the undeveloped regions.  Perhaps this, again, is why the Minister is keeping all his options open and is apparently contemplating the possibility of applying this fund elsewhere than in the needy regions.</P>
    <P>It must be recalled that one of the principles behind the establishment of this fund was a movement towards economic and monetary union and thereby towards European union.  To do this, regional imbalances must be corrected.  There may be regional imbalances between Ireland and Germany, or between Ireland and France, but if that is so, surely there are very real regional imbalances between the west of Ireland, in particular, and any part of Germany.  How can any talks of economic and monetary union or real union in Europe be meaningful unless we really concentrate the meagre amount we have on the most needy areas here?</P>
    <P>I was amused at Deputy Desmond apparently saying that it was a matter that could be applied and that we could rely on the Government anywhere throughout Ireland.  His group within the European Parliament have said that what distinguishes them from the other groups is that they are committed as socialists and they certainly <Col N="972" /> always parade themselves on high as being very committed people when they use the term &ldquo;socialist&rdquo;.  But they are committed as socialists to correct these regional imbalances. They say that is the difference between themselves and others.  I heard this said on radio a few nights ago by the Secretary General, Manfred Michelle of this group.  What is the difference between them, for instance, and the CD group in Parliament&mdash;that they are committed of their very nature to correcting the regional imbalances.  If that is the way the Government see it here, if we allow regional imbalances within our own country, how can we possibly correct regional imbalances within the Community at large?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never argued that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to see&mdash; and our party at successive Ard Fheiseanna have, in fact, endorsed this unanimously&mdash;that this fund is almost exclusively intended now for the undeveloped regions of the country, for good social reasons, good economic reasons and possibly for good European reasons.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, as Deputy Colley has so rightly argued, made certain commitments and the people understood us to mean what we said, that this fund would be applied to develop the undeveloped parts of the country.  I do not mind if the Fine Gael party renege on their own commitments but they have no right to renege on our commitment.  If this fund, which is so small in the first instance, is to be applied, as we fear it will, this Dublin-based Government, as Deputy S. Flanagan said, should know that they are entitled, if they wish, to renege on their commitments but not entitled to renege on ours.  We will have to tell the people that their expectations have not been realised: we will have to be honest enough to admit that the fund is not being applied as we thought it should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission have always said that the fund should be applied so as <Col N="973" /> to create maximum impact on public opinion.  We know that the way to create maximum impact on public opinion is to apply it through a specific fund for specifically-designated projects here.  Otherwise it does not create maximum impact on public opinion especially when the amount available here, over the trial period of three years, is £35 million, far, far less than we required, and the amount actually available for spending in this year will be £4 million, of the £8 million which will be available in the full year.  Obviously, to spread that kind of money around would have very little impact on public opinion.</P>
    <P>The signs are that even now the Government who have had notice of this for so long do not seem to have selected a project that will benefit from this fund.  We have no evidence that they have: perhaps they have. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have gone over my time.  We will give him time to get in.  The Government have had ample opportunity&mdash;we have asked them often enough&mdash;to have these projects selected by now.  Why have they not been selected?  Why have they not been designated?  There is a real danger that if they are not designated quickly, that even if we fall short, we could even lose the right to our allocation this year.  It could be postponed but that will hardly make for a sense of urgency from this country.  I assume that I am wrong, but I am making the assumption more in hope than in confidence, because we are long enough talking about this fund: we have had adequate notice about it and the only thing that was to be determined was the amount of the fund.  The fact that it fell far short of our expectations does not in any way justify the inactivity of the Government in determining what projects would qualify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount of the fund would not even build 14 miles of roadway in the west of Ireland.  It would only point <Col N="974" /> the way to the west rather than reach the west.  At least, let us give evidence of a commitment.  We have blamed Europe enough, particularly on the Government benches.  In the final analysis, the Taoiseach and others had to recognise that rising prices and inflation were not the fault of Europe, but of our own maladministration here.  We have blamed them enough. But let us not blame them for something for which they are entitled to some little credit, namely, the existence of a regional fund.  Let us not blame them for the fact that we do not have a regional policy.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will pressurise the Government to have a regional policy with a specific regional fund through which the resources available from the European Community Regional Fund can be applied to give maximum impact on public opinion, and, in the words of the Regulation that the Government &ldquo;will take all necessary steps to ensure that assistance from the fund be given suitable publicity&rdquo; and will finally ensure that the commitment that we gave will be honoured.  It will mean that we can come back after the trial period as I am sure we will and say: &ldquo;That is how we applied our moneys in those needy areas.  There is the consequence of our application of moneys.&rdquo;  That is the strength of our case for our renewed application in three years' time.  If the Government adopt that attitude even at this late stage there is some hope that we will have a stronger case next time around.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary can reassure us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I read the motion proposed by Deputy Colley.  In it he says that it is the Government's expressed intention to recoup past expenditure.  I do not think that the Government ever expressed such an intention.  This image of the Government's intention is due to misinterpretations of the regulations of the EEC.  It is also due to reports attributing to the Government an intention to misuse EEC funds which they never had.  The <Col N="975" /> operative word is &ldquo;misuse&rdquo;, and it has appeared on very many newspapers all over the country; it is a word that should never have been used in any newspaper.  If the Government misuse the EEC regional fund they thereby contravene the regulations of the EEC and they will not, therefore, get any aid from the EEC.</P>
      <P>If this Government do not strictly adhere to the conditions and regulations laid down by the EEC they will forfeit any further aid from the fund.  This was the anxiety of the mover of this motion, Deputy Colley, that we are in danger of losing this if we do not adhere strictly to the conditions and the regulations of the EEC.  I want to make it quite clear from the outset that it is never, and has never been, the intention of the Government to use Regional Fund assistance for the purpose of recouping past expenditure to the Exchequer.  Only time will tell whether the Deputy who moved this motion is right, or whether I am right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy that the Minister is right, and what I am saying is right.  The misinterpretation by various Deputies and various people all over the country will not make the truth untrue.  Any suggestion to the contrary is simply not true.  I can only conclude that such a suggestion is based on an error in interpreting the EEC regulations governing the operation of this fund. What is the correct position?  In accepting the fund regulation the Government agreed to observe the principle stated therein that the fund assistance should and I quote:</P>
      <P>not lead member States to reduce their own regional development efforts but should complement these efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, the Government undertook that Ireland's receipts from the fund would result in an increase in assistance to regional development. They will add to their own regional <Col N="976" /> expenditure to fund's assistance.  The regulation leaves it to each member State to decide whether this increase should occur on a global basis.  In other words, whether it should take the form of an increase in the total of assistance to regional development or, in the case of industrial handicraft and service activities it should be used to increase the level of aid to individual projects.</P>
    <P>There are very good reasons why it would not be appropriate for us to raise the level of aid to individual projects. If we were to do so we would not be getting full value from the Fund so far as our own development needs are concerned.  Assuming, for example, that the IDA succeeded in attracting a project to a particular location with a grant offer of, les us say, £500,000, would it make sound economic sense to use regional fund assistance to increase aid to that project to £750,000, by adding £250,000? Would it not be far more logical and far more intelligent to use that extra quarter of a million pounds to set up a new industry somewhere or to set up some infrastructural project?</P>

      <P>People find out, the ordinary rural people as against Dublin people, whether your word is your bond or not.  You may appear here once, but after that&mdash;oblivion.  I want to tell Deputies that both inside and outside this House the Minister for Finance has time and time again asserted that this sum will not be misused. I want to quote a few extracts. There is the Minister for Finance's letter of 14th April, 1975, to <i>The Irish Independent and Cork Examiner:</i></P>
      <P>It would make little sense simply to add regional fund moneys to this level of assistance (to individual projects); far better to use these resources to ensure additional industrial development.  Under the repayment system, the partial refund of State aids in respect of investments submitted for fund assistance augments the pool of scarce capital resources available to finance future development.</P>
      <P>Again on the Adjournment Debate on 23rd April, 1975, he said:</P>
      <P>There will be no reduction in the development aid, in the regional development of this country. Rather will we increase the aid given by the Government.  We are glad to have it complemented by the regional fund, small and all as this is.  The receipt of moneys from the fund will help to increase the overall volume of projects so that Ireland will be able to promote more projects with the fund than we could have done if it were not received.</P>
      <P>This is his reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 6th May, 1975:</P>
      <P>I wish to make it quite clear that the selection of a particular project for assistance will not increase the level of that aid already being paid to that project.  It will simply be the means of obtaining assistance from the fund to increase our total industrial and infra-structural investment efforts, particularly in less developed areas.</P>
      <P>In another reply to a Parliamentary Question on 28th May, 1975, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should again like to stress that the selection of a particular project for assistance will not increase the <Col N="978" /> level of aid already being paid to that project.  Rather will it be the means of obtaining assistance from the fund to increase our total industrial and infrastructural investment efforts, particularly in the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating and disappointing and galling that this tissue of fabrications as to the Government's alleged misuse of the regional fund has been built around selectively quoted extracts from letters which issued from the Department of Finance explaining how the repayment system operated in the case of individual projects.  As I have said already, under this system, aid received from the regional fund will not benefit the individual investment but will be recycled by the Government to increase total industrial and infra-structural investment.  Far from the regional fund being used to recoup past Exchequer expenditure, I should like to remind the House that we must first spend money on a project ourselves before looking for payment of the fund assistance.  In order to get £1 of Community assistance we must spend at least £1 ourselves in the case of industrial projects and at least £2.33p in the case of infrastructural investment.</P>
    <P>In the newspapers many conflicting reports emanated from the various reporters in Brussels from their various newspapers.  I would like to clear up any lingering doubt as to the attitude of the Council of Ministers and the Commission to the Government's proposal. Newspaper headings, such as &ldquo;Our misuse of fund dismays Commissioners&rdquo;, <i>The Irish Independent</i> of 14th April, 1975, and &ldquo;Ryan starts EEC row on Regional Aid&rdquo;, <i>The Irish Press</i> of 2nd May, 1975, are wide of the mark and have no foundation whatsoever.  That can be absolutely proved.  These imputations of alleged Commission dissatisfaction have been made without any indication as to the status of persons making them and are completely without foundation.  I had to interrupt Deputy O'Kennedy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the true version that was sent from Brussels. I know that for a fact and I can prove it.  The Commission has been very forthcoming in its statements.  The following is the text of a statement issued by the spokesman of the Commission on 30th May, 1975:</P>
      <P>Reports in certain Irish newspapers today regarding a meeting between representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commerce, Ireland, and officials of the Commission may give the erroneous impression that the Commission is not satisfied with the system which the Irish Government proposes to adopt in applying assistance from the regional fund.  The Commission has been informed of the intention of the Irish Government to use fund aid to increase the total level of regional development investment in Ireland.  The Commission notes that this intention is in conformity with the principal purposes of the regional fund which is to increase the volume of public expenditure in the regions by the amount represented by the fund.</P>
      <P>Nobody can deny that.  These are the proofs both from the Minister himself, from the Commission and from Mr. Thomson, but I want to go further.  On the 23rd of April, 1975, in the Adjournment Debate on the EEC Regional Fund, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The counties which will mainly benefit from the regional fund are counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry, parts of Limerick and parts of Cork.  There are a number of <Col N="980" /> misconceptions circulating as to the nature and scope of the regional fund.  They would be laughable if they were not so misleading.  While certainly some of them arose originally through a misunderstanding we cannot now ignore the damage that is mischievously spread for base, partisan motives at home, and also done with the malicious intent of doing harm to Ireland's position in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I have no idea of what harm may be done in Brussels but I know all over the country, when they see statements like &ldquo;West wants full value from the EEC Fund&rdquo;, they think they will not get anything.  This emanates from these rumours in various newspapers that have no foundation whatsoever.  The Government do not intend to misuse the funds.  They cannot do that.  Neither do they intend to reimburse the Exchequer for past expenditure paid from this fund. We are all disappointed at the dilatory methods by which this fund is administered.  It only started in September, 1974.  It is going ahead now and our applications will be sent in by July, 1975.  There are certain projects being thought about, which will be selected and sent in time. I do not know the details because I am not a member of the Cabinet and I do not know if the Cabinet have finalised their selection yet.  They will be sent on in time and I trust, like all rural Deputies, that the majority of them will embrace, for the most part, those areas that have been mentioned by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance is aware of the importance that the receipts from the regional fund should be seen to increase the total resources allocated to industrial and infrastructural investment. In discussions recently with the Commission's director general of regional policy officials of the Department of Finance let it be known that it was intended to show on the resources side of the annual capital budget the total payments expected to be received from the fund during the year.  With that there will be then known how these funds will be expended.  Deputy Colley asked me for a statement as to the type of project which qualifies for fund assistance. The factual position is as follows: Under Article 4 of the fund regulation assistance may be given for investments which exceed £20,833 and which are of the following types:</P>
      <P> (a)  industrial, handicraft or service activities which either create ten new jobs at least or maintain existing employment;</P>
      <P>(b)  investment in infrastructure directly linked with those activities or which is an essential pre-condition of such activity; and</P>
      <P>(c)  investment in infrastructure covered by the Council directive on mountain and hill farming and farming in less-favoured regions, for example, access roads to farms, electricity and drinking water and, in tourist areas, disposal of sewage.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley asked that.  Suitable projects which meet these criteria have been identified and a final selection will be made shortly by the Government.  As I have already said, Commissioner Thomson has indicated that he hopes to receive the first applications from member States by mid-July.</P>
      <P>Our applications will be easily in by that date; the Government's application will be there by then.  Deputies will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to anticipate a final Government decision on the pattern of our applications by giving any indication of the type of project being put forward or of the geographic spread involved.  Nor, indeed, as Deputies remarked last night, would it be proper to disclose details of individual applications.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind the House that individual projects submitted for regional fund assistance will not, if approved by the Commission, receive fund aid in addition to the amount of State assistance already being paid to them.  These projects will, rather be the means of obtaining assistance from the fund to increase our total industrial and infrastructural investment effort particularly in less-developed areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> We are emphasising, less-developed areas.  The Minister has given his word on paper that these areas will, to the greatest extent, benefit.  Deputy Colley stated last night that this Government have no regional policy whatever. Deputy Seán Flanagan alleged that the Government were not providing work for the people of the West and denied that there had been any strides made in regional development since the Government took office.  There is no difficulty in refuting both these statements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Seán Flanagan spoke about County Mayo last night.  I know County Mayo as well as Deputy Seán Flanagan although he is in the House longer than I.  Since the mid-1930s dole has been paid to the people of Mayo to give them in some places a very bare existence.  This has been a consistent and persistent cancer in the lives of the people.  That cancer did not start two years ago but from 1973 the people got enough money in dole to give them a fair existence until such time as they are employed.  It is not a matter of pride to talk about dole, but dole since the start 40 years ago has shattered the moral fibre of the people who receive it.  As quickly as we can give people work instead of dole, work must be provided.  Until such time as they get work they must get some assistance.  No one knows better than I or Deputy Seán Flanagan of how people live in the barren, remote and secluded areas of County Mayo.</P>
    <P>It is true that this Government have not repeated the performance of the previous Government.  The previous Government indulged in producing so many programmes and voluminous papers pertaining to employment. Every year or every five years a plan was presented.  Once or twice the plan succeeded but then they faded out.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley mentioned Buchanan last night.  I was <Col N="984" /> against Buchanan myself but this Government preferred to act.  In the last two years all of the major IDA projects have been allocated to the designated areas.  In the final two years of Fianna Fáil's term of office, IDA grant approvals for projects in the Donegal, north-west, west, midwest and south-west regions amounted to £24.7 million.  That was for two years.  During the 21 months from March, 1973, when this Government took office to December, 1974, grant approvals for these areas amounted to £82.9 million.</P>

There is a full stop in farm grants because of the fact that the percentage are not qualifying.  There is lack of industrial progress; there is lack of tourist progress because grants are not being given.  There is no provision for the fuel industry in the west of Ireland by either the Minister for Local Government, by the Department of Lands or by the Parliamentary Secretary who is in charge of the Office of Public Works.  We want an assurance from the Minister for Finance that these projects, which are desirable and which are more necessary in the west of Ireland than anywhere else and which are doubly necessary in the context of EEC grant already mitigating against schemes.  In other words, the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme has done away with all the farm aids to small farmers in Gaeltacht areas.

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary spent a great deal of the time available to him trying to refute a case which we did not make.  There has apparently developed a row between the Minister for Finance and some newspapers on this matter and the Parliamentary Secretary devoted a great deal of his time trying to refute the case made by those newspapers against the Minister.  But that is not the case that we made in this House.  This motion, first of all, deplores the Government's expressed <Col N="988" /> intention of using the EEC Regional Fund to recoup past expenditure to the Exchequer.  Secondly, it demands that the fund be used to finance a special regional development programme for the less-developed parts of the country.  We got nothing from the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to the first part beyond the quotation of what the Minister has said in the past.  In regard to the second part we got nothing at all.</P>

      <P>The Government got the chance to indicate what they intended to do and they did not do it. It is also of some significance that the two Deputies from the other side of the House who spoke, apart from the Parliamentary Secretary, went to considerable trouble to try to suggest that we should, and indeed have an obligation to, use the EEC Regional Fund in all parts of the country.  That will be noted with considerable interest not only in the less-developed parts of the country but in the other parts of the country where people <Col N="989" /> listened to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael speakers during the EEC referendum, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, spelling this out very clearly that it was the intention to use this fund for the less-developed parts of the country.  Now we find that is being switched too.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary seemed to suggest that all of this originated in some peculiar way with newspapers or rumours or something like that but the fact is that it originated in a letter written by or on behalf of the Minister for Finance to a local authority.  I quoted it yesterday and gave the source, so I will not waste time on that.  The actual wording again is:</P>
      <P>Actual payments from the Fund in respect of approved projects will be on the basis of part recoupment on the scale of expenditure already undertaken by the member State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is a bit complex but nevertheless if it is looked at and analysed all it can be taken to mean is that money received from the fund in respect of expenditure already incurred will be taken by the State into its coffers and not put to the particular project.  Let me explain, because I think if I give an example it will be clear precisely what we are afraid of. The Minister, as quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary, did say, when pressed, that it was intended to increase the amount of aid given for regional policy by using the fund.  Of course, he is obliged to do that under the fund regulations.  But, if we take it that there is, say, an infrastructural project costing £1½ million and <Col N="990" /> the Government say, &ldquo;We are getting £½ million of this from the regional fund in Brussels and we are putting in £1 million ourselves and if we did not have the regional fund we would only be spending £1 million on it,&rdquo; that is presumably what is envisaged. How are the Irish people going to know, how are Brussels going to know, whether that is true or not?  How can anybody know what would have been the level of expenditure unless you treat the fund separately and clearly?</P>
    <P>Our obligations under the fund in regard to what Deputy O'Kennedy quoted included giving maximum publicity apart from the requirements of a clear-cut demonstration to the people of what is coming and what is being used from the regional fund of the EEC and the setting up of the kind of the special regional development programme we have called for in this resolution and which we have got no indication is going to be produced by the Government.  Despite the fact that the Government have notice, and that this motion was being discussed, we got no indication of it, and we can, therefore, only assume that the Government do not intend either to set up such a special fund or, indeed, that they are capable of snaffling the money and putting it into their general coffers because they are not taking the precautions to ensure that that is seen not to be done.  That being so, I can only say, as far as we are concerned, it is not what we promised the people in the EEC referendum; it is not what Fine Gael promised them and it is, in my view, a deception and a fraud of the people who voted in the EEC referendum.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned I was about to make a general point.  I had said, without wishing to be over-committed, that I understood the force of the Minister's argument. I nearly went so far as to say that I was with him, as far as he went. We had arrived at what I can see to be the fundamental difficulty in this Bill.  The fact that it has recurred on other sections does not enable me to avoid raising it on this section.  I will try to deal with it as briefly as I can, and within the context of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nevertheless, I must make a background statement.  It stems from what Deputy Colley said.  In essence, his argument was this: in the facts as outlined, there is a basic unfairness to Irish citizens where, say, a manufacturing or productive company is <Col N="993" /> concerned, as against a company which is the property of an external interest which is not captured by subsection (5).  In making that argument he took the case of an Irish company whose shareholders would have to pay wealth tax on the shares they held. In that case all the shareholders were Irish.  He considered the particular case of one shareholder who was, in effect, the biggest or the most important shareholder of the private company. If an American company were to set up an Irish company, the capital would not be taxable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that that was unfair.  He also said that it was not in accordance with the principle the Revenue Commissioners had been operating of looking through to the origin.  In reply the Minister made an effective reply, as far as it went.  I do not need to repeat my own attitude to the Minister's reply but I want him to accept our <i>bona fides</i> and particularly I want him to accept that I am not brushing that cogent reply aside.  But I do say that Deputy Colley's point, if it was inconsistent about looking through, may not have been specifically answered, and it still does not get over the fundamental difficulties that arise in such a case. It is to that that I was addressing myself when the debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary for me to make a few general statements here, conscious of the fact that it is only too easy to digress too far on a section on fundamentals that are more appropriately dealt with in any detail or at any length on Committee Stage, and I do not want to be guilty of breach of the rules of the House in spirit any more than in letter.  If the Minister will bear with me, I will try to make the background point as shortly and cogently as I can.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we are up against in this section&mdash;and I will illustrate with reference to the illustration Deputy Colley made when I made my grounding point&mdash;is this.  This Bill as a whole is misconceived in its failure to distinguish sufficiently between productive wealth and non-productive wealth. There is in the Bill, further on, some <Col N="994" /> effort to recognise this point.  Let me be objective, but basically there is a confusion of thinking behind the Bill that is reflecting itself in this section as in others.  Productive wealth, that is, the wealth that is generated during commerce or economic activity generally, is a different thing from wealth represented by large possessions which are held for self-enjoyment and are luxuriously enjoyed and accumulated as a form of extravagance.  This is a basic difference the latter type of wealth does not possess.</P>
    <P>If I acquire a very large landed estate, and have it there for my pleasure, even though it may give a certain amount of employment, and this is the old argument about the big estates, it is still not particularly productive for the community and gives me standards that are out of line with the rest of the community, and it is only equitable that an adjustment should be made in a case like that.</P>
    <P>It is thinking of that kind of case, backed up by the illusion that there is a lot of that type of wealth there and, somebody has said, the philosophy of envy, that has inspired much of the approach&mdash;the political approach&mdash;to this Bill.  That kind of wealth nowadays is of minimal importance, certainly of practical importance, to the Revenue because over the past 150 years, fiscal processes and everything else have tended to capture a large part of that for the community as a whole and tended to dissipate it to prevent its accumulation.</P>
    <P>It is a totally different thing when you have productive wealth.  We hear a lot in these times of economic depression about &ldquo;working capital&rdquo;, &ldquo;liquidity&rdquo;, and &ldquo;cash flow&rdquo;.  These are all related to the generation of wealth by commercial process.  They are less inflationary where the wealth that is produced is real.  What is really of importance is that the State does not inhibit wealth of productive industries, that is, manufacturing industries and industries of that nature, in contradistinction to mere financial trading, but even there, in the financial system which is so necessary, the <Col N="995" /> flow of wealth and the growth of wealth in, so to speak, the transit lines is of economic importance.</P>
    <P>If a factory makes some commodity and it prospers and makes money, that money is a measure of the wealth it has produced.  If that money goes back into it, it produces more money and wealth is generated.  That is an economic activity that is of benefit to the community and it seems to be a false economy, to say the least, and in fact, seems totally contradictory to seek to tax that.  Capital generates capital and the community benefits.</P>
    <P>There is the background against which I want to set the example that Deputy Colley gave us.  Here is the difficulty the Minister has and I appreciate it, and recognise the argument. The difficulty stems from the fact that this Bill not only taxes unproductive wealth but, as the Minister said, its underlying social policy is to prevent the accumulation of wealth in particular hands and to ensure the more even distribution of wealth over the community.  It is all very fine and quite right when it comes to personal possessions and the possession of wealth in that sense enjoyed by the individual.  Here we are dealing with wealth in a different sense and for that reason I want to approach Deputy Colley's example in another way.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the House for allowing me to digress to this extent and I appreciate that the Minister did not interrupt me or seek to stop me going on, but it is sometimes hard to drive home your point unless you put in the background.  Let us take the two cases.  Here, as Deputy Colley postulates, you have an American company with American shareholders. I use the word &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; because it is not American anyway&mdash;you have a foreign company with foreign shareholders who are not captured by subsection (5) who have invested and built an industry here where the industry and the physical assets are in this country.  That is one set up.  The shares in this Irish company are owned as capital by the American company which is not taxable and the <Col N="996" /> shareholders of the American company, the ultimate beneficiaries, are not taxable.  That is on this side.</P>
    <P>On the other side, you have a completely Irish company where the shareholders are Irish and where the company is completely contained within the State.  Look at the difference in what happens from a social point of view, from an industrial point of view, particularly important, in a time when you want to stimulate economic activity, and that makes me say in passing that the point has been emphasised by the Opposition throughout the discussion on this Bill: it is not the right time to put through such legislation. Whatever merits it would have in a time of boom, it certainly does not have any now in a time of depression.  It must be looked at in this way.</P>
    <P>In either case, capital generates capital.  Assuming that both these companies are trading prosperously and paying dividends, let us see what the consequences will be on both sides.  We must take into account that in the generation of capital, because of the existence of income tax and taxes attaching to corporations specifically such as corporations tax, in the flow to make new capital, there is already a skimming off of some of the profits.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of these two companies and trace what happens in each case with the profit. Then we can ask ourselves what is the result.  I shall take the Irish company first.  In the case of the Irish company, profits will be made.  When profits are made two things happen; some profits are ploughed back to develop the industry, and a proportion are paid back in dividends to the shareholders.  What is made in any case is taxed; what is ploughed back is taxed in the company's hands, one way or another&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>One way or another. I am not saying capitally taxed. What is paid back to the shareholder <Col N="997" /> is already taxed as income tax&mdash;I am simplifying my argument by not considering reliefs and such details.  In the case of the Irish shareholder if money is ploughed back directly by not paying dividends there will be an accumulation of capital.  As the company prospers, shareholders' funds will, therefore, increase, the capital of the company will increase, the capital liability of the shareholders will increase, the capital tax paid will increase. This must be a big disincentive to ploughing money back into the company.  It would be better to distribute the money in dividends because it will come off as tax anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it comes off now, a tax is not being accumulated to be added to the other tax.  The more that is ploughed back the better&mdash;ploughing back is desirable. I do not want to give the impression that dividends are not economically useful.  They are indeed. I am not to be taken as going along with the argument that dividends should not be paid.  They are a factor contributing to the circulation of money and are useful stimulants to the investment in industry.  The point I am making is that because the logical result of the ploughing back of profits into a company is to increase the shareholders' funds that will ultimately mean an increase in the shareholders' capital.  That will ultimately bring about an increase in capital taxation. If there is capital taxation, the fact that it exists is a disincentive to investment in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am gratified that the Minister finds something to argue with me.  I know that these arguments are not simple and that we could be here the whole night arguing on detail.  Will the Minister please accept that I understand the detailed qualifications?  It would be another matter if we discussed this matter point by point.  Will he please take the generality of the argument I am making which is netted down to this point; that in the case of the Irish company which Deputy Colley spoke about, any capital taxation provision <Col N="998" /> will result in a disincentive to investment of that sort&mdash;for the reasons that have been given on section 2&mdash;I do not want to expand the debate or repeat the reason.</P>
    <P>Let me now take the case of the foreign company.  That disincentive does not exist there.  In this case there is a positive incentive to invest.  The Minister may very quickly take up that ball and throw it back at me and say: &ldquo;That is a very good thing.&rdquo;  I will say: &ldquo;The Minister is quite right, it is a good thing.&rdquo;  But would it not be a better thing if the Irish company would do the same?  This is my argument.  I am trying to show that there is another view of Deputy Colley's point.</P>
    <P>In the case of the American company, the very existence of income tax and the other taxes, particularly income tax on distribution, is a direct incentive to invest for the non-capitally taxable.  In the case of the foreign company its capital is not taxable; in the Irish company its capital is taxable.  please do not say to me that it is not the company but the shareholders which are taxable.  I know that.  It is capital in the hands of its shareholders.  It is taxable in one case, not taxable in the other.</P>
    <P>These are the difficulties which I find in this section as it stands.  I also realise that in some of the arguments, particularly the one I have made about incentive, the Minister can say: &ldquo;Look, I have given some very good reasons already why we should take this attitude to the foreign company and now the Deputy has given me one other one, namely, that there is a positive incentive to attract foreign investment here.&rdquo;  I go all that way with the Minister.  When it comes to deciding on this Bill, while not committing my colleagues and stating the position in which I find myself at the moment, if there is a dilemma which cannot be solved otherwise, I am not sure that there is not a point on which the Minister will vanquish me.</P>
    <P>We have highlighted the fundamental difficulty in this whole code of capital taxation.  What do we do about it?  I am afraid I have talked a little bit at length.  I am grateful to the Minister for listening to me. <Col N="999" /> Perhaps at this stage the Minister might like to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I hope we are not embarking on another marathon.  I have been criticised on two counts in respect of this provision in the Bill.  First of all, it has been alleged against me that I am discouraging foreign investment here or, alternatively, that I am discriminating in favour of a foreign company as against an Irish company.  I propose to deal briefly with those two charges.  I think I have convinced the House, and Deputies opposite, that there is nothing in the Bill which acts as a disincentive or a discouragement to foreign investment here.  If we have got that far, then we have gone a fair distance.</P>
      <P>I still argue that foreign trading corporations are free to establish subsidiaries here and have the dividends from those companies paid to the parent company and that, in turn, the dividends of the parent company will be paid to the shareholders free of tax as far as this country is concerned. I want to emphasise that. Let us not forget that the dividends in question are subject to foreign income tax, that the dividends in question are subject to foreign capital taxation.  For example, in the United States, there are death duties.  There is Federal death duty and there is State death duty.</P>
      <P>We have got off on the wrong foot here by seeming to assume that once the dividends from an Irish trading company are paid into the foreign trading company, tax is at an end as far as those dividends are concerned, and the shareholders of the parent company can have a gay time, free of any tax, and to that extent they are in a privileged position as compared with the Irish shareholders.  That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> They are in a privileged position as regards competing.  The Minister cannot get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is not so, because they would <Col N="1000" /> only be in a privileged position if their dividends were subject to less taxation than the Irish shareholders. It is true they are not subject to Irish taxation, but it does not matter very much to the shareholder to whom he pays his tax as long as it is collected from him.  If the tax is collected from him it cuts him down to size&mdash;as long as it goes to some State and as long as it is not left with him.  That is the position.  About that there is no doubt.</P>
      <P>The next thing that is charged against me is that in some way or other I am discriminating against an Irish company.  I say I am breaking no new ground at all.  At the moment, the dividends of the foreign trading company, about which I have been talking, are exempt from Irish death duties.  Now death duties are gone and they will be exempt from Irish wealth tax.  Did it occur to Deputies opposite that at the moment there is discrimination within the country as between one company and another?  You have company A engaged in the business of exporting practically all its manufactured goods.  It is exempt completely from corporation profits tax at 50 per cent.  You have company B down the road, with the same amount of capital involved, the same number of employees, engaged in a business which does not export, and it pays corporation profits tax at 50 per cent.  There you have two similar companies.  One is taxed by the Irish Government and the other is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already pointed out that we have a provision under which bank deposits of foreigners are not subject to Irish income tax&mdash;they are ignored; a blind eye is turned on them&mdash;whereas the deposit of the Irish depositor is not. We have given, over the years, substantial grants to foreigners to come in here with expertise to establish industries. Most of those grants were availed of by foreign companies because they had the expertise.  They had the know-how.  That was a good thing.  I concede that the shares of the Irish shareholder are taxed but only as shares.  I cannot see how that in any way acts as a discouragement. Whatever else that person puts his wealth in, will be also taxed. <Col N="1001" /> If he puts it in land, it will be taxed. If he puts it in investments of one sort or another, it will be taxed.  It is not as if the dividends of trading companies were going to be taxed and another form of wealth was not going to be taxed.  That is not the position at all.  They are all going to be taxed.</P>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera has rightly conceded, the dividends enjoy preferential treatment.  They enjoy 20 per cent discount.  This is a good Opposition point.  It is a point I would expect the Opposition to make forcibly. They have done that.  At the end of all this talk, what is involved?  What is the amount of capital taxation that is going to be involved?  If any individual shareholder owns shares in an Irish company worth £2 million, then he is asked to pay £19,000 tax per year.  A tax of £19,000 on £2 million is considerably less than 1 per cent. That is all that is involved here.</P>
    <P>I think I have for the purposes of this section, established beyond yea or nay that there is no disincentive to the foreigner to come here and establish industries and provide jobs. There is no discouragement.  What I am being criticised about now is that I am in some way not giving the same encouragement to the Irish investor. But when all this legislation is teased out and when all the pros and cons are gone into, in the end result the Irish investor will be every bit as well off as the foreign investor.  You only get discrimination and a difference, if you assume&mdash;something you are not entitled to assume&mdash;that the foreign investor is getting off scot-free in his own country.  That is not so.  Nobody will argue that.  Therefore, the incentive is just the same for the foreign investor as for the Irish investor.  This argument which was properly begun has been fully answered and it would not be reasonable to carry it on too long.  The facts are that there is no innovation; we are not breaking new ground; we are not creating precedents. Foreigners may appear to be getting preferential treatment here.  I do not want to be going back to it but that was the basic attack on this Bill from the beginning.  That was the onslaught on the provisions of this <Col N="1002" /> Bill; that it was going to prevent foreigners coming here with their money and their expertise in search of labour.  That is not so.  I repeat that there is no discrimination.</P>
    <P>There appears to be discrimination, if you disregard the foreign taxation in the country of domicile.  Take the two Irish companies I mentioned; one pays 50 per cent tax on the spot, the other pays nothing.  The foreigner has money in the bank; he pays no income tax but the native pays income tax.  Deputies might consider the whole matter in the light of what I have said and accept the logic of my argument that there is no discouragement and no discrimination.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I can fully understand the Minister's explanation of this section but I do not see the logic in it.  It becomes more obvious the longer this Bill is debated that this country was never suitable for a wealth tax.  We see the provisions and the amendments which had to be brought in to ensure an inflow of capital.  We see the amendments which the Minister brought in as regards foreign residents and the provision in this section to exempt foreign shareholders.  I have come to the conclusion that there is only one type of country which should have a wealth tax, and that is where the wealth of the country is owned by the people in the country.  A wealth tax would be suitable for such a country, but for a country such as ours which requires a big inflow of capital and where a big proportion of the wealth is foreign-owned and has to be exempt, I doubt very much the wisdom of a wealth tax here at all.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say we are not discriminating against Irish people as regards taxation but it would be very difficult to explain this to holders of property in this country, owners of Irish hotels and company hotels which are foreign-owned.  One need only go to St. Stephen's Green for such a hotel and if one continues for another five minutes and arrives at Ballsbridge, the distinction can then be seen.</P>

I am talking about two companies, one an Irish company and the other an English company operating the same type of business.  Deputy de Valera has given an excellent example already as regards the position of these two companies.  I am talking of companies that will be competing with each other here for business.  They will have to be competitive in prices. The foreign-owned company will now be exempt from wealth tax.  Take the Irish-owned company which built up a business by endeavour and hard work and expanded that business.  The Minister has given us a figure of £2 million. If a company own five or six hotels throughout the country giving substantial employment, it can very easily earn a sum of £2 million.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It does.  Deputy de Valera mentioned this a few minutes ago. Assuming that dividends are not paid, this is what will happen.  I could go on all night quoting instances of what will happen and how property here will tend to fall into the hands of foreign businessmen.  I do not blame people if this happens.  The £19,000 which the Minister mentioned as an example is quite a substantial amount of money for any company to be able to plough back into the business.  It certainly puts a company in that category at an advantage over their competitors. That is wrong.  The whole principle of the Bill is wrong.</P>
      <P>I fully agree with sections of the Bill which will encourage the flow of capital into this country, we are very sceptical about that in this section. I am delighted there are exemptions because we need that inflow of capital but I believe the Bill as it stands is now discriminating, whether we like it or not, against an Irish business man.  I object to the idea of one man having a property equal to mine and he is exempt because he is living in America or England and I am not.</P>
      <P>An Irishman who has built up a property here, let it be in any industry or any business, will now find himself in the situation, whether he likes it or not, that the foreign competitor down the road is getting preferential treatment.  The Minister will say, &ldquo;Of course this will be taken off him in the country he is residing in&rdquo;.  I do not think that will wash very well with the average Irish citizen, no matter how you explain it to him.  I doubt very much if it will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy de Valera has indicated, <Col N="1005" /> productive assets should be exempt from wealth tax.  I can see now the position, especially in regard to the type of business I mentioned, the hotel industry and places like big supermarkets.  I have never held that we needed foreign capital for supermarkets here.  We have enough expertise ourselves to run the retail end of business.  I always said that maybe we needed extra expertise at the productive end of our economy, the manufacturing and the technological end of it.  That is the type of activity in which I would welcome capital.</P>
    <P>But now we find ourselves in the position where one of the leading supermarkets in this town has already put it on record that supermarkets here are operating on a gross margin of roughly 4 or 5 per cent.  The Minister a few minutes ago said that on a £2 million package £19,000 would be equivalent to 1 per cent.</P>

The wealth tax on that figure will be 1 per cent.  That means a substantial amount where you are operating on a small gross profit.  That is just one example.

He is already in a competitive position over the Irish owned supermarket&mdash;he is in a 1 per cent better position in the selling market under the provisions of this Bill.

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> One of the leading Irish owned supermarket owners in this town has already stated that by virtue of the very tight margins they are working in, if the English company has advantage over him it will gradually pass into the hands of an English shareholding company.  That is going to happen whether Deputy Esmonde or the Minister likes it or not.  This will be the fact of financial life.  A 1 per cent saving is quite substantial in a type of business where you find it very difficult because of a low profit margin to operate in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> This can happen throughout Dublin. I could take a chain of pubs in the region of O'Connell Street which can be acquired very easily in the morning by an English company.  We all know that.  I am not going to mention names because it is not the right thing to do in this House, but you do not have to stretch your imagination to identify this group of centre city pubs I am talking about.  The very same situation can happen to any Irishmen who would have built up the same number of houses through hard work down through the years.</P>
    <P>This particular Irish company started at a very small level and gradually expanded and is giving good employment, the same type of employment as another company which is owned by Irish-English shareholders. The Irish owned company will find themselves in the very same position. A central city company can very easily be taken over by English shareholders who will be exempt from wealth tax.  The other man, who has the same number of public houses, because he has built up his business through initiative and enterprise will find himself at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> his English owned rival.  Nobody will convince me that is right.</P>
    <P>This is not the type of example we will hear about when this Bill goes through the House.  There are many business people in this city who will be informed that their only misfortune is that they were born in Ireland, that their colleagues down the road are not paying wealth tax. I do not believe the Irish people will take that too kindly.  I do not care what the people outside think.  I know that I have no choice.  I will have to accept it but I do not like it.  I do not like the whole philosophy of it.</P>
    <P>There are certain countries which this Bill would suit, where the wealth of the country is held by the people of the country.  It would be much easier to operate it in them.  For the past 30 years, through the IDA, we have been encouraging British, American, Japanese or any country in the world to bring money into this country and start factories and every <Col N="1009" /> type of business, creating wealth within the country.  Then we must go to the extent in this Bill to exempt them to ensure that the inflow of capital will not be impeded in any way.  We had two amendments here already.  One defines ordinarily resident and the other exempts foreign shareholders from paying wealth tax in this country.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that the Minister is a reasonable man and he must know perfectly well that this anomaly exists, that we must go out of our way in this Bill to ensure continuity of capital in this country for the creation of jobs.  That is the whole thinking behind it.  Jobs are what we are all talking about.  This is what this Bill is about.  That is the whole reason for this section.</P>
    <P>At the same time there are also Irish people in this country who are quite capable of creating jobs, extending their present financial holdings and generating more wealth within the economy.  Whatever type of Bill we bring into this House we must keep an even balance between the two types of people we are talking about.  We have native Irishmen who down through the years, through hard work and endeavour, have expanded their business and were never concerned about a 40 hour week or watching the clock at 5 o'clock in the evening.  Many of them worked in many cases up to 10 o'clock at night. We should not discriminate against such people.  That is why the whole philosophy behind this Bill is wrong.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, we will have chains of hotels in the country, some Irish owned and some foreign owned.  Nobody can tell me that the foreign owned company, from a competitive point of view, has not an advantage over the Irish owned company. I have already stated that supermarkets on a very tight margin will be encouraged now to slip into English hands.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that we always had this policy in this country as regards death duties but when he was talking about death duties this morning he pointed out how the IDA had circulated in one of their reports that <Col N="1010" /> death duties would be abolished.  Some time ago he mentioned that we always had this relief as regards foreign owned companies in relation to death duties. I do not think he can use the argument this morning that it was a disincentive as regards companies coming into this country.  A few minutes ago he said that we always exempted them.</P>

One certainly would never think, listening to Deputy Fitzpatrick now, that he had supported this morning Deputy Colley's amendment No. 2 (c) which sought to exempt shares in the hands of foreign shareholders from wealth tax while at the same time taxing shares in the hands of Irish shareholders. That was the effect of Deputy Colley's amendment.  That was the amendment that Deputy Fitzpatrick supported.  I am glad we have got to the stage where I think it is accepted now that there is no disincentive in so far as foreign capital or foreign industrialists are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick went on for the last 20 minutes or so building his case on the fact that the Irish shareholder would be in a worse position than the foreign shareholder and that the Irish concern would, therefore, be less competitive. Even to make that argument <Col N="1011" /> he had to completely shut his mind to the fact that foreign companies are taxed, that the ultimate dividends in the hands of foreign shareholders are subject to the wealth tax of the country in which they are situated.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Irish shareholders in these companies. Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested that hotels would fall into the hands of foreigners and they would get preferential treatment.  Irish shareholders have a discount of 20 to 30 per cent.  If they are foreign owned, even by individuals, they do not get the 20 or 30 per cent reduction on their shares because that does not extend to foreigners.  If these people are resident outside the country they will have to pay the capital tax in their own countries as is appropriate. There is, therefore, no area of discrimination. I pointed out previously that there are no innovations here.  For years back we have been encouraging foreign investment here by giving preferential treatment in the form of grants and in the form of tax exemption. I also pointed out that at the <Col N="1012" /> present time, according to our tax laws, one company is exempt from corporation profits tax while the same tax is levied on another company at the rate of 50 per cent.  There is no substance at all in the arguments put forward by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Tax is not levied on companies as such, it is only levied on the value of shares and dividends on the value of shares in a company. The value of those shares is taken into account after deducting such taxes, outgoings and overheads as are properly chargeable.</P>

      <P>I can sympathise with the Minister feeling that he has to make the same point over and over again.  I do not want him to repeat and I shall try not to repeat.  I must comment on some things he said. The point about foreign companies being taxed abroad is a general consideration and it is not <i>ad rem</i> in this debate.  There is no wealth tax in at least two countries that could be involved&mdash;the United States of America and France.  It is a red herring to refer to taxation outside the country because it is not the same type of tax.</P>
      <P>The Minister insists that he is breaking no new ground and in the sense in which he means it I accept that.  Nevertheless, he is breaking new ground.  He is breaking no new ground when he says that: &ldquo;We are applying the same kind of principles as we have applied with income tax and previous taxation&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>And other taxes. I accept that from the Minister; he is right, but he is breaking new ground when he introduces a wealth tax at all.  We are dealing with something new.  It does not necessarily follow that everything that was done in regard to these other taxes must necessarily be done in regard to this new tax.  This is new tax.  At an earlier stage when I sought to make parallels between the income tax code and this code on section 1 I was quickly brought to heel.  That is the type of tidy administrative thinking <Col N="1013" /> that is valid enough&mdash;I do not say it is not a worthy approach&mdash;but there is another approach.</P>
      <P>We are living in a world of practicality. We do not all live by tidy administrative files or accounting.  One of the things that is fundamentally wrong with our western economy is that it is becoming&mdash;and the computer is making it more so&mdash;an accounting-file-economy in which we are all being dominated by the file, the record and the accounting machine.  That is a complete digression but I make it to show that I am not making any indictment of the administration which is coping with reality in another way.  I ask that the possibility of another point of view be recognised.  Perhaps there is force of argument in the other point of view.  The taxation the other shareholder has to pay is not <i>ad rem;</i> it is not in our scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not; it is their taxation.  It is not <i>ad rem,</i> it is the rake off they are getting from here that matters.  We are not concerned with what they do after that at home with it.  We are concerned with our own economy.  What they do with what they get out of it is their business and not ours.  I am grateful to the Minister for his reasoned attitude. I am aware that a Minister has a difficult time on Committee Stage if the Opposition is trying to do its job properly.  It is a very wearying job, I do not wish to make it more wearying and I hope the Minister will take my remarks in that spirit.</P>
      <P>Everything in life is not governed by the administrative approach.  There is another point of view.  In practice it is a combination of all these points of view.  One of the frictional and viscous forces in our economic flow is precisely the preponderance of that element in economic activity.  Any of us who have experience of productive industry, and the repercussions, will find that.  I am not referring to revenue gathering; I am referring to the overall financial structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The third point is that that very <Col N="1014" /> same type of thinking is very prone to make a nice tidy distinction between the company and its shareholders when it suits, and in this case it does suit.  But remember the company is the shareholders and the shareholders are the company and in the case of a private company the shareholders are so much the company and the company so much the shareholders that it may be an informal distinction, a nice legal distinction between the legal person, on the one hand, and the group of legal persons, on the other.  In practice it is a distinction without a difference, and to attempt to force that distinction brings about consequences that are absurd.  Even in the case of a big public company with many shareholders, that distinction is not altogether clear-cut as regards the repercussions of one on the other.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would like to try and clarify our approaches.  I want to make one comment on what the Minister said about discouraging foreign investors.  As far as the point we are discussing in this section is concerned, not only did I concede but I pointed out in advance that, looking at the particular case that Deputy Colley produced here, analysing it with specific reference to this section, there certainly is an incentive under this section, but I do not think that I can quite go the whole way with the Minister when he takes up the point of view that the Opposition have now admitted that there is nothing in this Bill that is a disincentive to foreign investment, that, in fact, it is an incentive.  I think I have to deal with that point.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best way of characterising the Bill as a whole in that regard is this.  Parts of the Bill are good. There are benefits in the Bill as well as disadvantages.  There are as in all Bills provisions in this Bill for which we laud the Minister and there are provisions for which we criticise him. That does not get us away from the fact that, as far as we can see, the Bill as a whole is bad.  I am reminded of the curate's egg.  Parts of it were excellent, but it must not be forgotten <Col N="1015" /> that at the end the curate's egg was rotten.  Our trouble is that basically we have in this Bill a misconception. I was nearly going to call it an abortion. Parts of it may be perfect, and this is our difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into a supermarket, either for eggs or herrings, red or otherwise.  Coming back after that bit of levity which perhaps lightens the discussion, I do not expect my extravagant words to be taken literally.  The Bill is undesirable.  The whole idea behind it is inapplicable in our economy and unfortunate at the present time.  That would be my sober judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us follow up the Minister's point: there is no disincentive to foreign investment.  The Minister is quite right, on the example I gave there is a positive incentive.  However, there is another type of disincentive.  The disincentive is here&mdash;and it may not be desirable socially&mdash;to a foreign person with capital coming to reside in Ireland.  I do not know if it will be of great importance in the future, but it is something that, at one stage, we would have looked for, namely an Irishman who had made good abroad &mdash;if he can be classified as foreign capital&mdash;who would come back to Ireland, have an interest in his own country and use the resources that he has at his command for the benefit of the country.  Maybe he has the patriotic desire to do this&mdash;we are always a little niggardly in acknowledging or giving credit for&mdash;for the country of his origin.  We are always inclined to put it down to selfish motives, but even if it is a selfish motives, there is certainly a distincentive for him.  There was a disincentive for the foreigner who came in after the war and brought in money and perhaps knowhow.  I have a factory in mind that played a vital part at a very important time in stimulating activity in a certain town in this country.  Whether this would be important at the moment I leave an open question.  This group of foreigners <Col N="1016" /> came to live here; they brought their money and their know-how and the town in question got a flourishing industry.  This section is definitely a disincentive to that.  Let the Minister not claim that because the example which we were discussing specifically under this section did work out as an incentive by comparison with the Irish company where there was a positive disincentive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the only incentive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I was prepared to go even further than Deputy Colley was there.  But even granting as far as I went, there are still disincentives here, so that I do not think the Minister is justified in generalising to the extent that he did in this. That is my answer to him.</P>
      <P>We were dealing with productive wealth in this section.  The very same situation can work in reverse where unproductive wealth is concerned.  It might be a very undesirable thing socially and fiscally.  I ask the question: supposing we had the foreign company that we were talking about; they can acquire capital here and in order to act, so to speak, as an umbrella&mdash;this foreign company is carrying on a productive industry here and therefore in the position of the company I originally mentioned but proceeds to acquire, say, a large estate. Again, do not complicate things by telling me that the local authority can look after that or that we can pass a Bill to cure it.  We could, but if we have to get after that kind of complication it only proves what kind of a cure this Bill is.  Again, keeping to simplicity and not complicating it with extraneous details, though they may be valid if they are pushed home but I have made my answer in advance to that&mdash;he accumulates non-productive wealth.  As far as I can see there is no wealth tax on that.  That is socially undesirable.  It is defeating the social purpose of the Bill.  Let me go a little further in that example.</P>

I hope my job is also, when I feel the Minister has given a satisfactory answer, to acquiesce in common sense and reason and not to push it too far.  I hope the Minister will take it that that is my attitude.  I am not infallible but it is better that I should say it.  Supposing you have a foreign industrialist in a country where there is no wealth tax.  It does not matter what other taxes there are.  It is conceivable that he could be in a country where the taxes are minimum but there is no wealth tax.  An industrialist in that company sets up what would be, in effect, as far as we are concerned, a private company, but it is still a fully-fledged company; it can be camouflaged in his own country.  He sets up here a productive industry or maybe a number of them.  If there is an answer to this I would be very glad to get it but this is the type of question we should have the answer to.  He comes over here and sets up a number of productive industries but in the process he acquires a large landed estate.</P>

      <P>If it goes too far, I grant you.  I do not want to mention names even in the past that are dead and gone but it has been known for people to come and take a fairly nice estate&mdash;I do not mean thousands of acres, but a nice, big, comfortable mansion.  This is acquired.  The point for my argument is that unproductive wealth is acquired, the very type of wealth that the Minister for Finance pointed out in his opening speeches on bringing in the legislation as a whole, was his object to prevent accumulation of.  This will go completely capitally tax free.  If I am right in that approach, we have the anomalous position that we may be stimulating investment by the foreigner, but we are doing it to the extent where we will stimulate the acquisition of Irish assets by a foreigner, perhaps unduly. I know it is very difficult and I sympathise when the Minister says &ldquo;It is very easy to think up the problems that are there&rdquo;.  Where I found the excellent spot in the curate's egg, I am now beginning to find one of the black ones.</P>
      <P>In this section we are running into this difficulty.  I suppose I am delaying the House if I labour the matter any further.  I shall mention briefly the points I want to make to the Minister. The first point is that taxation outside the bounds of that is <i>non ad rem</i>.  There could be places where it is beneficial and there could be places where it is not.  We should leave it out of this argument.  We are breaking new ground with the Bill and I do not accept that if we did it under income tax or anything else, we automatically do it here.  That does not mean, however, that I do not accept the approach that it is a reasonable thing to try to get uniformity.  It is a valid approach and one that can be justified.  I see the force of the Minister's argument here. All I am saying is that it is not a completely overriding argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that in regard to foreign investment the stimulation may not be <Col N="1019" /> uniform and there are cases either of the returned Irishman or somebody with Irish connections or the foreigner where there is a very definite disincentive to anyone who can be captured by subsection (5).  On the other hand, there can be the undesirable acquisition of unproductive wealth that can escape capital taxation and also would be contrary to the social intention expressed by the Minister for Finance earlier.  That can happen under the Bill.  That is undesirable.  The particular person concerned can even come over and enjoy it.  I gave the example of a single person who had this company or maybe a number of companies here, who can come here and actually enjoy this unproductive wealth <i>ad lib</i> provided he keeps a close eye on the 183 days.  A gentleman of that nature will find it very difficult to stay in any one place for a total of 183 days.  I know it does not all have to be in one run.  These busy people of the nature involved in this will probably not be 183 days in any one place by the time their activities are finished. Taking all that into account, there is a great deal to be looked at in this section.  I am making these points now as qualifications to some of the observations the Minister made on what I said already.  I accept what the Minister has placed on the record as the argument.</P>

Are we agreed that in the case I have been describing, of an Irish factory in which there is an Irish company owning it, and as I said all the shares owned by an American company, that in relation to the Irish company and the shares in it, they, standing on their own, would come within the definition of property situate in the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we agreed that that is on its own property situate in the State, the shares in the Irish company, if they were standing on their own and not owned by an American company? Right.  Let us assume that those shares are owned by a private non-trading company in the United States, which is a very possible set up for one of these factories, in other words, a type of private investment holding company, <Col N="1025" /> holding all the shares in the Irish company, it seems that they are liable to wealth tax with no threshold.  If the Minister will look at the provisions relating to private non-trading companies, he will find that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, but the Minister is telling us that wealth tax cannot apply in the case of American individuals who invested in the kind of way we have described.  He is now saying, in the case I have described, &ldquo;that is not an individual, this investment company&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We have not come to non-trading companies at all.  We are dealing all the time with trading companies.  That was the essence of the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister was suggesting that because the shares in the Irish company were owned by an American company, wealth tax could not arise.  If he did not say that, he certainly suggested that the only case in which wealth tax could arise was where there was an individual holding those shares, and that would be very unusual.  I am suggesting, indeed, I suggested it earlier on, and Deputy Esmonde may remember that I referred to the fact that the Minister in replying to the point, omitted to refer to either discretionary trusts or private non-trading companies.  Deputy Esmonde seemed to think that I was talking about some set-up for the purpose of evading death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now demonstrating that there are such set-ups in relation to American investments here.  I am suggesting that in those cases there is a liability <Col N="1026" /> for wealth tax with no threshold, in other words, on the first £1.  I do not think that we can just skip over it.  If the Minister wishes to stick precisely to it, he is entitled to do so.  He can say: &ldquo;this only deals with individuals and we can deal with it on the other section&rdquo;. I do not want him to bear in mind what I have said, in all that he has been saying about non-liability abroad, of investment abroad for wealth tax, because I propose to demonstrate to him that that statement is not correct.  He may recall that he said a few times that he thought that we have accepted that this was correct and I indicated that I demurred at this.  I have given an indication of one of the reasons why, but if we are to confine ourselves to the discussion on the individual, I would like to ask the Minister also&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is very hard to discuss an argument on this section with Deputy Colley apparently arguing that these foreign companies are subject to wealth tax and to Deputy T. Fitzpatrick <i>(Dublin Central)</i> conducting an equally forceful argument on the basis that they are not and it is a disgrace.  It is very hard to carry on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This illustrates precisely the difficulty I spoke of earlier. The Minister said dogmatically, and Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick accepted it, that no liability for wealth tax arose in these cases.  I indicated that I had reservations about this, but, assuming that the Minister was right I went on to deal with the situation then arising as Deputy Fitzpatrick did.  I also made it perfectly clear today that there is no inconsistency whatever on our part if we urge (a) that there should be no discrimination against Irish people and (b) that there should be no inhibition on foreign investment in industry here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think, that there is no discouragement to foreign capital on the basis that these shares in Irish trading companies, in the hands of foreign trading companies, are not liable, and have argued that there is no discrimination because the individual shareholders in the foreign companies are liable to whatever tax is payable in that country, and that sometimes is heavy enough.  I have also argued in your absence that even within this country you have the case where company A pays corporation profits tax at 50 per cent, and company B, which is similar in all respects apart from the fact that it exports, pays none.</P>
      <P>I have also drawn attention to the death duty situation.  I pointed out that there has been discrimination here in the past, if discrimination it is, in so far as deposits in Irish banks in the names of foreign people are not taken into account for income tax while deposits in the names of Irish people are.  I have stated that we are breaking no new ground.  I have answered that several times and I think it is unreasonable to expect me to keep on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for summarising his arguments again, but, of course, I heard them before and they are not an answer to what I am saying.  The Minister was trying to suggest that Deputy Fitzpatrick was arguing one thing and I was arguing the other.  The fact is that we are both arguing the same thing.  We are against discrimination against Irish people under this wealth tax, we are against inhibiting investment from abroad.  The difficulty is that the Minister finds himself in this position.  I have indicated one way in which there is an inhibition being imposed here on investment from abroad.  I am not going to pursue it until we get to the section, but I am simply responding to what the Minister said just now that Deputy Fitzpatrick and I were arguing in opposite directions and leaving him in an impossible position.</P>

So that we know something of what is involved in this does the phrase &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo; include simple contract debts where the debtor resides here?  It does under the death duty code so, therefore, I presume it does under this.</P>

Having regard to that definition and the fact that the kind of things I have been mentioning, and there are others I have not mentioned, are, in fact, included in the phrase &ldquo;property situate in the State&rdquo;, I do not think the Minister should be too surprised at the fact that people took it that investment from abroad of the kind we have been describing would, in fact, be caught <Col N="1029" /> by this, as, indeed, I believe it is in certain circumstances and propose to show later.</P>

Property situate in the State is either real estate or shares, anything coming under the heading of value in money that an individual or a company may hold.  If an American citizen is prevailed upon to invest a substantial amount of money in an Irish company, say, in the region of £1 million to start an industry here, under subsection (2), is it not correct that he would be assessable above the threshold under this Bill?</P>

      <P>Earlier on the Minister's amendment in a certain limited category of persons we disposed of the position about &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. The Minister amended subsection (5).  In subsections (1) and (2) we have this phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;. Admittedly &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; is the phrase used in both.  The effect of the amendment to subsection (5) is that if people come within the conditions laid down in it they are deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident in the country. As I understand it that is one particular category of person but it does not mean that those who do not come within that are not domiciled and ordinarily resident.  In other words, persons other than those coming within that category may be domiciled and ordinarily resident within the meaning of subsection (1).</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They must be domiciled and we all <Col N="1032" /> know what that means.  That is a well accepted legal concept.  Section 3 (1) captures all the global property of people who are domiciled and ordinarily resident.  Subsection (2) captures only the wealth situated here of people other than those who are domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State.  In those two subsections we are dealing with people who are domiciled and ordinarily resident.  Subsection (5) deals with people who continue to live here for more than six months in a number of years.  They are deemed to be domiciled and ordinarily resident here.  That is the position.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that.  If we exclude persons who are caught by subsection (5) as amended, with regard to other persons it is necessary to decide whether or not they are domiciled and ordinarily resident.  In deciding that it is necessary to consider &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  I am sorry to have to come back to this but I am in trouble about it because I have not got from the Minister for Finance what he promised to give me.  It leaves me in the position that for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), in deciding whether a person is domiciled and ordinarily resident one has to take account of the fact that that phrase can include a person as being domiciled and ordinarily resident in the State although he was not physically in the State one day in the year.  Is that the intention?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> No. &ldquo;Ordinarily resident&rdquo; is defined in section 1 generally as having the same meaning as in income tax.  The term is not defined in income tax but, as in the case of domicile, guidance as to the meaning has been given by decisions in the courts.  The expression &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; is used in its everyday sense and has no special or technical meaning.  It is broadly equivalent to &ldquo;habitually resident&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid this is where I got into difficulties with the Minister for Finance.  He also read a note to that effect with which he was supplied.  I pointed out to him that <Col N="1033" /> people who were far better qualified in this area than I have claimed consistently that the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; has not been defined under the various decisions and so on with any degree of precision in the same way that, say, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; has been defined or other phrases of that kind.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and myself pursued this matter and I asked him if he was maintaining that that was the position, and that if it had been clearly decided could he give me an indication of some of the cases on which this claim was based.  The Minister felt he could not do so because he said that this might be assisting people who wanted to engage in evasion.  He said he would give it to me privately.  That was many months ago.  I have mentioned it here on a number of occasions and I still have not got it.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands has just said that it has been used here in the ordinary sense of the words meaning &ldquo;habitually resident&rdquo;.  That may be what the Minister intends but that is not what can be achieved having regard to the fact that while it has not been precisely defined there are certain definitions in existence and one of them includes what I have just described.  No physical presence in the State for a year could still be &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  If that is so, I think the Minister will agree that that is not the plain, common or garden sense of the phrase &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>

I do not want Deputy Colley to misunderstand me, nor do I want to imply anything by innuendo, but I wish to make it clear that income tax experts who presumably will also be the experts dealing with wealth tax and the consultants of the bigger practices are well aware of what is involved here because they are dealing with it every year.</P>

The Minister has put it on the record that the decision will be made for income tax purposes and whatever decision is made on that will be followed for wealth tax.</P>
      <P>The next point I want to refer the Minister to is in relation to subsection (3).  It is really just a drafting point.  I am referring now to the beginning of line 35 on page 4: &ldquo;...shall be property...&rdquo; The sense of it is that where the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession includes an interest which is a limited interest such property shall be property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession.  It is just a drafting point and I am wondering if that should not be &ldquo;shall be deemed to be&rdquo;.  Just to try and get the construction of it, I was going back to the beginning of subsection (3).</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The proviso deals with purchase annuities and applies where an individual purchases an annuity for himself or for a third party.  In such cases the annuity is, for income tax purposes, treated as being composed of two elements, part an annuity proper which, as such, is liable to income tax and the remaining part being a capital.  The main income tax provisions are sections 239 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, and the Income Tax Purchase Life Annuities Regulations, 1959, S.I. No. 152 of 1959.  For example, a person aged 61 purchases an annuity of £325 for £2,000.  His life expectancy is 16 years approximately.  The capital element of annuity is £2,000 over £1,620.  The income element is the balance of £205. Where an annuity is for a term of years certain, the calculations are slightly different and the capital and income elements of the annuity vary from year to year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proviso offers the annuitant the choice of valuing the annuity mentioned above of £325 per annum for wealth purposes: to have it valued as an unsecured annuity on the basis of a national sum required to produce £325 per annum if invested at the current yield of the most recently issued Government security, or to have the income element thereof for income tax purposes £205 so valued and in addition thereto the proportion of the purchase price of £2,000 referable to the capital element of £120, that is, £120 over £325 multiplied by £2,000. The annuitant has the option of adopting which of the two alternatives suits him.  Which will give him the lower value will depend on many factors: the type of annuity, the rates of interest prevailing at the time of purchase, the interest on the Government stock and its current yield, the age of the annuitant and all other personal elements relevant to insurance policies generally.  So many factors enter into <Col N="1036" /> the terms of insurance policies, including the fact that they are geared to individual needs, that it would be extremely difficult to devise a system of valuation which would provide uniformity of liability to tax in all cases. The fact that a choice of valuation is available ensures that purchased annuities are not at a disadvantage as compared with unsecured annuities. Finally, it might be said that in the context of the threshold for the individual many cases will arise where purchased annuities will come within the tax net.</P>

This provision is designed to forestall fictious claims of change of domicile.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Paragraph (b) of this subsection defines an interest which is a limited interest where a person is not absolutely entitled to property and part of the income must be applied for his benefit. He is deemed to be entitled to a limited interest under the provisions of subsection (3).  The capital in which the limited interest subsists is liable to tax. In order to be a limited interest the income must be applied for his benefit. If there is no discretion to apply or not to apply this income, the liability of the trust fund will arise under section 5, as the trust will be a discretionary trust.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Paragraph (c) defines the appropriate part of property under subsection (3). Where an annuity is payable the taxable wealth of the annuitant is the appropriate part of the property out of which the annuity is payable. Under this definition the appropriate part is the slice of the property required to pay the annuity.  The fraction of the property is the proportion that the gross amount of the annuity bears to the gross income of the property.  For example, if an annuity of £100 per annum is payable out of a fund of £20,000 which yields an income of £1,600 per annum then the taxable wealth is one-sixteenth share of the £20,000 which is £1,250.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for that.  Could I ask him why this section does not contain rules for determining, to some extent at any <Col N="1046" /> rate, what is and what is not property situate in the State?  I ask him that for this reason.  If he would refer to the Capital Gains Tax Bill he would see that there&mdash;I am speaking from recollection, but I think it is in section 4&mdash;are rules specifically laid down determining, for the purpose of capital gains tax, what is property situate in the State and what is not.  We have had quite a discussion earlier on the effects of whether property is situate in the State or whether it is not.  It is quite clear from the discussion that we shall be pursuing that question on another section.  If there were such rules, would it not be at least a clearer situation, leading to less confusion than has arisen even on the discussion of this Bill, if the kind of rules in the Capital Gains Tax Bill were laid down here for determining what is in or what is out of the definition of property situate in the State?</P>

      <P>My reason for raising this matter on the adjournment is to try to ascertain the facts regarding the sad death of this man, a father of seven young children, with another baby expected in the near future.  I want to raise a few points which I hope will prevent a recurrance of a similar death in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to my question today asking the Minister for Justice if he has called for an inquiry into the death of the prisoner in Mountjoy Prison and if not he will do so, he stated that on 16th May last an inquest, which is a public sworn inquiry, was held on the death of the prisoner.  In addition, full departmental inquiries were made into the circumstances of the death as is normal in such cases.  The Minister knows as I do that an inquest is not an inquiry into all aspects.  An inquest is an inquiry to ascertain the cause of death and that only.  I have not seen the findings of the departmental <Col N="1048" /> inquiry, nor has that man's poor wife.  I have a letter of 14 pages, which I do not propose to read.  It is a sad letter from the widow in County Clare, a young woman who knew that her husband was ill from the evidence presented later, that he was not of very sound mind.  She never complained that he ever did any harm to her and she never thought of having him examined with a view to have mental treatment for him.  The Minister referred to that today when he said that he did not have treatment outside of prison.</P>
    <P>The Minister also knows the regulations about having mental treatment under the Mental Acts.  There are two main methods, one is voluntary, where a person thinks he needs treatment or his immediate friends will ask him to have treatment and he voluntarily signs a form to have treatment.  The other procedure is where the person is certified where a relative complains about the peculiar behaviour of the person.  That relative goes to the doctor and signs what is known as the pink form where that person is certified.  A person may be certified by a member of the Garda Síochána who will go to the doctor.  In cases of reports from people, except the person has done something to interfere with a person the Garda are not entitled to sign the document, nor is the doctor entitled to sign it.</P>
    <P>That is the sad situation which exists in the country, where almost similar sad cases to this one of Donlon from County Clare occur, where people have to wait until damage is done.  They are not brought to the mental hospital but to the District Court.  That is what happened in this particular case.  He was brought to the District Court the first time and on being sentenced to prison the district justice recommended psychiatric treatment for him.  He was admitted to prison and, from the information I have ascertained, he was not examined by a psychiatrist.  On 22nd March his sentence ceased in Limerick and on leaving that prison he was arrested, brought to Ennistymon Garda <Col N="1049" /> station and returned to Limerick Prison again.  Subsequently, he was brought to Kilkee Court and then to the Circuit Court at Ennis where he was referred to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin.  Bail of £4,000 was fixed.  The bail was not forthcoming and he was remanded to Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>Prior to this, at Ennistymon court when he was charged he made a prophetic statement which was recorded by his friends.  He said:</P>
    <P>Remember when the court comes on ye will have no Seán Donlon to deal with, only his dead body.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that that man had a disturbed mind.  His wife got a letter from him from prison stating that he wished her, when he died, to take down his dead body and bury him in the family grave at Killeany.  There were some strokes on the letter.  According to that man's widow the letter was censored in Mountjoy.  It should have been obvious to the authorities that that man had a disturbed mind.</P>
    <P>When he left Limerick Prison he was not examined medically and when he arrived in Mountjoy Prison he was not examined, even though the prison regulations state&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but the information I have is that even at the inquest there was no record of his having been examined in Limerick prior to his discharge and no record in Mountjoy Prison of examination on arrival. On arrival in Mountjoy Prison he was admitted to the infirmary.  Normally, prisoners are not admitted to the infirmary except for some medical reason and there was no other reason except for his prior history.  He had not been in Mountjoy Prison before.  Was it that he was considered a violent man <Col N="1050" /> and was admitted to the infirmary for that reason?</P>
      <P>For nine days prior to his death, it was admitted at the inquest, he was not examined or seen by a medical officer in Mountjoy Prison.  Some few days before his death&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The source of information is his widow.  If the Minister refers to the inquest he will see that the doctor from Mountjoy Prison admitted he had not seen the man for nine days prior to his death.  I am not blaming the doctor in Mountjoy Prison, he is a busy man who is on temporary work there.  He is a busy man outside and is only allowed a certain time to do all the work he is supposed to do.  The work has increased in prisons.  I am not blaming anybody, but there was general negligence by the State and by the prison authorities.  It needs a reshuffle and re-examination, particularly when inside one month two other prisoners committed suicide in two other prisons. I am not familiar with the circumstances of those two men; I am only familiar with the circumstances regarding my neighbour.  My evidence may be wrong but the Minister can refer to the findings at the inquest.</P>
      <P>If the statements I got are true it is obvious the man needed examination and treatment.  If he had got this examination and treatment there is no reason to believe that that man would not be alive today.  The onus of responsibility is on the prison authorities, and, in my opinion, on the State.  That woman and her family are entitled to compensation, just as much as any widow with children whose husband is knocked down by a drunken driver who is covered by insurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with Deputy Dr. Loughnane's emotional involvement in this sad case.  The deceased was a constituent of his and, as he says, a neighbour.  Indeed, at one time in the course of his imprisonment Deputy Dr. Loughnane was interested in early release for him.  I regret this man's death and everybody connected with the prison services deeply regrets it.  I share the feeling of sadness that it should have occurred or that any tragic death should occur.  The issue here is a clear and serious charge by a Deputy of this House against the prison service. The charge is that the prison services are so construed and so negligently run that they caused this man's death.  That is a charge I reject completely and entirely, and I regret that I have to say that as put tonight it is a reckless charge, put in good faith but that does not save it from being a reckless charge.</P>
      <P>I asked Deputy Dr. Loughnane the basis for his information.  He indicated that it was the unfortunate widow of the deceased.  He purported then to tell us what took place at the inquest, and what took place on the prisoner's admission to hospital, none of which was correct.  When this man was before the District Court in Clare the district justice suggested that he should be referred for psychiatric examination when he was lodged in Limerick prison.  He was seen on the date of his lodgement in Limerick prison, 15th January, 1975, by the medical officer of that prison who referred him, in accordance with the district justice's view&mdash;a layman's view I hasten to add&mdash;to the consultant psychiatrist to the prison.  He was seen by the consultant psychiatrist to Limerick Prison, a man I am sure well known to Deputy Dr. Loughnane and a man highly regarded in his particular speciality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if it is fair to name those men here but I will give the names to Deputy Dr. Loughnane.  Dr. Cagney is the prison medical officer and Dr. Fennelly was the psychiatrist who saw the deceased.  That is the first and serious mis-statement of fact <Col N="1052" /> by Dr. Loughnane, that that man when admitted to Limerick prison, was not seen by a doctor and did not receive the psychiatric attention recommended by the district justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that he was not seen by a doctor in Limerick on the day of his discharge, before he went to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that also.  Dr. Loughnane can accept from me that he was seen by a psychiatrist.  That psychiatrist, in the course of his report &mdash;and I think it is proper to say this in fairness to the medical personnel attached to our jails, and in regard to the attack to which they have been subjected, an attack by third-party hearsay that the assessment by that highly thought of psychiatrist was that &ldquo;this man does not appear psychotic&rdquo;. He was subsequently transferred from Limerick Prison on 10th April, 1975.  On the day he left Limerick Prison he was seen again by the prison medical officer.  That is the second incorrect fact put forward by Dr. Loughnane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>That fact was not recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I do not know the source of Dr. Loughnane's misinformation, but there are people interested in this case&mdash;I am not saying that Dr. Loughnane is one of them but he may be duped by them&mdash;&mdash; whose <i>bona fides</i> towards our prison and our prison system must be seriously in doubt.  If they have been the source of information to the unfortunate person who gave Dr. Loughnane the information, then I am not surprised that the information is inaccurate and slanderous of the medical authorities in our prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On arrival in Mountjoy on 10th April, 1975, he was seen by the prison medical officer, and again it is incorrect to say that the prison medical officer is unable to carry out his duties.  It is a serious reflection by one professional colleague on another to suggest that this man would continue <Col N="1053" /> to occupy a position that he was not able to discharge efficiently, to the best of his professional ability and in accordance with the dictates of his profession.  That is wrong and I must reject it on behalf of the devoted medical officer in Mountjoy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>How is it that the assistant chief officer in both prisons have made no records of the medical examination prior to leaving Limerick&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect. There are records.  Where else did I get my information except from the records?</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Loughnane made a further serious mis-statement when he said that ten days prior to this man's death he was not seen by the medical officer in Mountjoy.  He was seen by him on 21st April and he was seen again by him on 24th April.  The unfortunate death took place on 28th April.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the record be put straight as regards what happened.  Dr. Loughnane has been seriously misled and probably a lot of other people have been seriously misled as to the true and tragic facts of this case.  As to whether a person is seen by a psychiatrist is decided in the first instance on the assessment of such consultation by the medical officer of the prison or by the general practitioner outside the prison.  In this case the medical officer in Limerick called in a consultant psychiatrist whose examination did not reveal psychosis.  The medical officer in Mountjoy, an experienced and dedicated medical officer, did not call in <Col N="1054" /> a psychiatrist when the prisoner was in Mountjoy.  I have to accept, and I am sure that Dr. Loughnane, as a member of the medical profession, will accept that I and any other layman and any other doctor who knows nothing about the case and whose only information about the case is biased third-hand hearsay, would not dare criticise the professional decision of a medical officer in Mountjoy as to how he conducts his professional affairs.  That is what is at issue here, and that is what I deprecate.</P>
      <P>There was a tragic event and unfortunately the tragedy has been compounded by the raking over of events by people whose <i>bona fides,</i> as I said earlier, must be at least suspect. I want to put the record straight as regards the misstatement of facts alleged here by Deputy Dr. Loughnane.  The prisoner was seen medically and psychiatrically in Limerick.  He was seen on his arrival in Mountjoy, and he was seen at least three times during the 18 days he was in Mountjoy.  We have to depend on the professional expertise of the medical officers attached to our prisons as to whether any particular prisoner is assessed or referred for psychiatric examination.  Psychiatric facilities are available in our prisons to the degree they are required and at the level they are required.  They are provided by the health boards independent of the prison service altogether.  To suggest that through some fault of the psychiatric service attached to our prisons this man took his life is misleading and erroneous and from the mouths of some people &mdash;and I exclude Deputy Dr. Loughnane from this&mdash;it is malicious.  But I would include Deputy Dr. Loughnane in a charge of being reckless, because he has come in here with evidence that was hearsay and inaccurate and has made charges which reflect unfavourably on professional colleagues. I am glad to have the opportunity to reject them and show them as completely untrue.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was not paid unemployment benefit on his claim made on 26th May, 1975 as he did not satisfy the contribution condition which requires that not less than 26 employment contributions have <Col N="907" /> been paid or credited in respect of him in the 1973 insurance year.  As his contribution record in the 1974 insurance year was also deficient he does not qualify for benefit in the current benefit year which commenced on 2nd June, 1975.  However, the question as to whether other employment contributions are payable in respect of the years 1973 to 1975 is at present being investigated. An application for a qualification certificate under the Unemployment Assistance Acts, which is a necessary requirement for the receipt of unemployment assistance, is also under investigation.

      <P>The person concerned applied for a qualification certificate, which is a necessary requirement for the receipt of unemployment assistance, on 29th January, 1975.  On the same date a provisional application for unemployment assistance was made by him.  Following investigation, a deciding officer assessed the applicant's means at £8 a week and this assessment was upheld by an appeals officer.  As this rate exceeds the maximum rate of assistance which could be paid in his case, the person concerned is not entitled to unemployment assistance.  In the absence of new facts or fresh evidence the appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive.</P>
