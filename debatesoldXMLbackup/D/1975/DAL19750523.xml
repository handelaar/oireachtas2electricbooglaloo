      <P>It is proposed to take No. 10, Vote 49 (resumed).  The Dáil will sit next week as follows: Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m.; Friday from 10.30 a.m. to 5.00 p.m.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, in view of those three 12 hour days, I, as Whip on the Opposition side, am conscious of the fact that there is pressure on the staff within the House in relation to the continuous 12 hour days; I am looking for some type of a mid-day break from their point of view.  Would the Taoiseach look into that particular aspect? I think it is a bit thick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look into it.  Of course, the Deputy will appreciate that the break defeats, to some extent, the objective of the long hours, but we shall look into it between now and next week and see if it is possible to make a suitable arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We will take it, on the Opposition side, reluctantly.  Of course, I do not accept that it defeats the purpose of the long hours, when we are sitting about 30 hours a week longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection we might consider the suggestion made last week that we sit earlier and rise somewhat earlier.  They would be more civilised hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach was thinking of sitting much earlier than <Col N="650" /> 10.30 a.m.  I would be interested to know what hour he has in mind.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £177,022,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1975, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig na Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain services administered by that Office, including grants to Health Boards, miscellaneous grants, and certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanToal" hpid="Mr. Toal Mr. Toal">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Toal</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Health on the very comprehensive statement he made in the House on the activities of his Department.  This is one of the most important Ministries and the decisions the Minister will take in the months and years ahead will have a far reaching effect on all our lives.  I should consider my time well spent here this morning if I could urge the Minister to do something more for mentally handicapped people.  This is an area which has been long neglected by the Government.  Were it not for the dedication of the religious and the charity of the general public, very little at all would be done for them. There should be special centres provided for the mentally handicapped in our community.  These unfortunate people are afflicted from childhood; they will be with us all their lives; they need special care and supervision from people qualified so to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For six long months recently I tried every avenue open to me to have a <Col N="651" /> child admitted to a special hospital for the mentally handicapped.  One has no idea of the hardship that child's family endured during those six long months.  In the end I succeeded but, during that time, the parents of that child, the brothers and sisters, suffered untold hardship.  They had to board up the windows in the house and sit up all night with that unfortunate child.  More facilities must be provided for such people.  The reason for the delay in that particular case was that there was a huge waiting list for the hospital concerned.  They had no money to provide more facilities or to train extra staff.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to mentally handicapped children is bad but that pertaining to mentally handicapped adults is even worse; there are no proper facilities in this country for mentally handicapped adults.  I visited St. Felim's Hospital for old people in Cavan recently and spent three hours there.  The conditions of the building were bad, the overcrowding there was bad.  But worst of all, however, was the sight of mentally handicapped men and women in their 20's and 30's placed alongside elderly patients in that hospital.  How on earth could any of us recommend that an old person unable to look after himself should go into a home for old people when he or she might be placed beside a mentally handicapped adult?  Something will have to be done in this area, and done quickly.  We can have fine thoughts and sentiments about the mentally handicapped; we can subscribe to charitable organisations, flag days and so on but I should like the Government to treat this area in the health field as a special one because those people are the worst cases of all and are worthy of the maximum of attention.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also the new concept of community care.  This seems to be an &ldquo;in&rdquo; phrase these days when speaking about health.  The strongest answer to community care is the family doctor.  In my constituency there are vast areas where there is a crying need for general practitioners&mdash;in Clones, Kingscourt, Shercock <Col N="652" /> and other areas&mdash;and I have no doubt this prevails throughout the rest of the country.  If a family doctor is available and is not overburdened with work he can keep potential hospital patients happy and comfortable in their homes.  I would ask the Minister to give the doctors enough incentive to live and practice in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The £60 PLV ceiling for farmers for eligibility to health services should be scrapped because it perpetuates many injustices.  The worst injustice of all is to shut them away from the health services because of the national value of land.  If the Minister cannot abolish the ceiling figure completely, at the very least he should increase it to £100.</P>
    <P>There is a gap in the health services in so far as secondary school children are concerned.  Pupils are covered until they leave primary school but after that they are not covered for such services until they reach 16 years when they may qualify for a medical card.  This throws a heavy burden on many families and I would ask the Minister to rectify the situation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the bureaucracy of the health boards.  I dislike bureaucracy and anything that can be done to reduce it would have my support.  However, it would cost more than the country could afford to dismantle the health boards.  They are long enough in operation to have made their mark and to have given evidence of what they have done. There have been marked advances in the area of health&mdash;more has been done in the past five years than in the previous 15 years&mdash;but health boards and the Department should never forget the role of the religious orders in the health services.  These dedicated people have worked 24 hours a day for seven days a week in hospitals and institutions and perhaps we have tended to forget what they have done.  The health services could not function without them and we will always be in their debt.</P>
    <P>With regard to the siting of the general hospital in the North Eastern Health Board area, because of the proximity of the psychiatric hospital, <Col N="653" /> the general hospital should be located in Monaghan.  I have made this view clear to the Minister for Health and I hope he will keep it in mind.  I look forward to a favourable result when he makes his decision in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the many details supplied in this Estimate which will permit us to examine the entire health services, to consider what is being done and what should be done.  It may sound impressive that we are spending £208 million on our health services until we realise an equal amount is spent on drink every year.  We must also consider the amount of money spent on the treatment of people who are unfortunate enough to suffer from alcoholism.  We do not begrudge that money because we accept that the alcoholic is suffering from a disease just as much as a person with an organic complaint.  However, the fact that so much is spent on drink and on the treatment of alcoholism should ensure that we do not get complacent about the money we spend on our health services.  We cannot pride ourselves on our care of the ill when, in a cavalier way, we spend so much on satisfying the drink appetite and even allowing for inflation I am sure that sum will increase each year.  We cannot compliment ourselves until we satisfy the needs in the health services and until we correct the lack of full coverage in the health services.</P>
      <P>More than ever before the prison service is under scrutiny and criticism. Deputy Haughey devoted a considerable part of his speech to this matter. Most people consider there is something wrong with the prison service in view of recent happenings.  I have no intention of joining a bandwagon that seeks unjustly to criticise the prison service and I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the men and women in the service who play such an important part in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this morning's papers Mr. Bill Keaty, President of the Prison Officers' Association spoke about the need for a psychiatric service and this was supported by Dr. Fennelly, Chief Psychiatrist <Col N="654" /> of the Mid-Western Health Board. I realise there are people in this city and elsewhere who will use any occurrence in a prison as a means of bringing the service into disrepute.  The Government have a grave and urgent duty to examine the health services in the prisons and ensure that the very best treatment that can be afforded is available.  They must ensure that every prisoner in need of treatment, mental or physical, will get it.  The home backgrounds of some of these prisoners is a cause for concern; I believe it is the reason why people get off to a bad start in life and turn into habitual criminals.  I do not suggest prisoners should be pampered but, even if a man offends against society, he still has certain basic rights.  Medical attention for prisoners, be it mental or physical treatment, should be a high priority on the Minister's list when improving the health services.</P>
    <P>There is now a longer expectation of life and the need for homes for old people, the senior citizens, is becoming more and more urgent.  While good progress has been made we are still far short of having sufficient services. Putting old people into homes should not be our final commitment in the care of the aged.  Old people like to remain in the area in which they were born and reared and removing them from that area is part of the tragedy of old age.  There should be more district homes where the old could be visited by relatives and friends.  There are people who would willingly play a part in running such homes, who would visit the old people in them and make them feel they were still a part of the local community.  That would be much better than sending them away to large institutions in unfamiliar surroundings. The ideal would, of course, be to keep the aged in their own homes.  The next best thing is a small home in a familiar locality.  The Eastern Health Board are doing this in the case of psychiatric patients.  These are now living more or less as part of the community and that is a very good thing.  The same pattern should be followed in the case of the aged.  Voluntary organisations are to be commended for the work they are doing in the care of the aged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> The Minister does not accept the Fitzgerald Report as the be-all and end-all where hospitals are concerned. I do not think the Minister mentioned the federated Dublin hospitals.  What will be the evolution?  What voluntary hospitals will close?  Reorganisation is, I suppose, necessary but I am thinking of Sir Patrick Dun's hospital; it is practically sited in the dockland area.  It is a very old hospital and a very good hospital with an excellent medical school.  This is one hospital earmarked for federation with Baggot Street and some other hospitals.  We do not know when federation will take place and I am not urging that the date should be brought forward.  We should, first of all, take another look at the whole position.  These hospitals earmarked for federation could be retained as health centres.  Candidly, I do not want to see Sir Patrick Dun's disappear from the scene.  It has been in existence for over 200 years.  Would the Minister give us some information about federation when he comes to reply?  Does he think it will make for improvement?</P>
    <P>One hospital I mention every year is the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear hospital.  There is still a long waiting period for people needing surgery. Sight is probably the most important faculty of all.  People tell me they have to wait three months, and sometimes longer, for a cataract operation. The mental stress caused during waiting must be tremendous.  I do not know if waiting causes further organic deterioration, but I would urge the Minister to do all he can to increase the number of beds so that more prompt attention can be given to those who need it.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker stressed the care of the handicapped.  Tremendous progress has been made but a great deal still remains to be done.  Voluntary organisations are doing a tremendous job and the State recognises the work they are doing.  The handicapped should be trained so that they can realise their full potential in society.  It is important to provide a family <Col N="656" /> atmosphere for these people.  It is a great worry to the parents of these children not knowing what will happen to the children when the parents die.  It is good to know that the Friends of St. Michael are creating this unit, where the children will be placed in houses with a home mother or father.  As long as those children live they will be trained and looked after and as much family atmosphere as possible will be given to them.  I do not believe anybody will deny any moneys which are thought necessary to help those handicapped people, young and old.  The State should become more involved in this type of remedial treatment where preventive treatment is not possible.</P>
    <P>It may well be possible to train those handicapped children from very soon after they are born so that they can take their place in our society.  I would like to record the appreciation of many people in regard to the settlement which has been given to the thalidomide children.  I know you cannot ever really compensate those children for their disability but it is good to know that this country has taken note of them and have given them a generous settlement.  There is a great onus on the manufacturers of this drug to ensure that every child who is affected for the rest of his or her life is given some of their profits to enable them to have as good a life as possible from a financial point of view and that their parents are not penalised through something which was not their fault.</P>
    <P>Although it may not be really relevant to this Estimate I should like to refer to absenteeism from industry and commerce generally.  Somebody recently called it industrial morbidity. That sounds better than absenteeism. A great deal of absenteeism is caused by alcoholism.  Many people I have spoken to have stated that drinking is one of the main causes of absenteeism. I am sure the council dealing with this problem are aware of this but I do not think we can stress too much, apart from the damage the unfortunate person who drinks causes to himself and his family, the amount of <Col N="657" /> time lost to industry generally by absenteeism caused by alcoholism. People who are addicted to drink, perhaps through no fault of their own, lose a lot.  I hope the Minister, in the coming year, will do something concrete to show that we are able to check the terrible toll on industry because of too much drinking.</P>
    <P>I do not know if a decision has been taken yet about when drink advertising will be phased out of the television service.  We should emphasise to young people especially that the glamorous advertisements we see about drinking are not made in their interests.  They are in the interests of profit making by the people who are manufacturing drink.  It is deplorable to see when any social occasion is on television, even if it is a football match we always find it ends with a scene of a person drinking alcohol.  I believe we are reaching a point when some very definite action will have to be taken in order to arrest the drift towards further alcoholism.</P>
    <P>No Estimate for the Department of Health would be complete without an examination of the medical card system. Perhaps the Minister would let us know, when replying, if it is much harder to get a medical card in Dublin than in the rest of the country?  This is an accusation made to Deputies of all parties in the Dublin area.  I feel, like Deputy Haughey, that we should see an extension of the medical card system.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned people who are on the border line in relation to medical cards.  Some years ago, before the medical cards came in, I knew of a man who died because he could not afford to leave his work to have proper treatment.  I was convinced at the time, and I am still convinced, that if he had been able to have proper treatment he would have lived for many years longer.  He had a young family but his commitments were so heavy that he felt he could not afford to leave off work.  That could not happen to the same extent today.  A father or a mother may often feel he or she cannot spend too much money on medical care.  The fact such people <Col N="658" /> have not got a medical card means they will put off a visit to a doctor because they will have to pay for that. Those people get worse and eventually have to go into hospital for some very expensive treatment.</P>
    <P>There should be an extension of medical cards to families, where there are young children, at least up to the time those children have grown up. When a mother and father are rearing their children we should try to remove the worry of medical bills off their shoulders so that they will not have to stint on themselves in relation to medical care.  This involves much greater cost to themselves in the end.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his brief mentioned the cost of hospitalisation several times.  Costs are rocketing so much, despite State subvention, that in a few years' time it will be too dear to go into hospital.  I work on a hospital board and I know we cannot stop inflation by wishing it to stop. It is becoming so very expensive to keep people in hospital that unless the State increases tremendously its contribution to the health services, the money provided will cater for fewer and fewer people and we may reach the stage where people cannot be sent to hospital because the cost is so high.</P>
    <P>I want to put forward a plea which I make every year.  I believe we should have more local clinics from which would operate teams of doctors and nurses who would even carry out minor operations in people's homes. I am told by doctors that this would be possible.  We should try to keep as many people as possible at home rather than in hospital.  Most people want to stay at home anyway and with present housing standards so much higher than they were, with hot and cold water in most houses, it should be possible for people to be treated at home.  The maternity hospitals have been doing this for years.  I would also like to see a greater emphasis on preventive medicine.  The local health centre should become the hub of the medical service and we should educate people to avail of services which will obviate the necessity to go to hospital. If we do not develop along those lines <Col N="659" /> we may reach the stage where people will have to be refused treatment because the costs are so high.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have the highest ratio of hospital beds to sick persons in Europe.  This is something to be thankful for but it is still not all that easy to get an old person into hospital.  We are making progress along this line but we must press forward with the provision of more hospitals. According to a recent report the medical schools are cutting back on the intake of students.  It is suggested that we have too many doctors. I do not think we have.  I think we could do with many more doctors. The difficulty here may be the cost. Is it that we have too many doctors or too little money to employ them?</P>
    <P>A recent happening in my area is relevant to this Estimate.  A number of young boys somehow got fire extinguishers off buses.  They sniffed them for kicks.  One boy died and the others, according to the inquest, may have suffered brain damage.  I do not know how the boys got those things. I am not suggesting that the concern involved were neglectful in looking after them.  In my young days we never thought a fire extinguisher was anything but a fire extinguisher to be used when a fire took place.  Something like 400 extinguishers were taken.  The Department should insist that lethal objects such as those are kept away from young people and young people will have to be warned of the dire consequences if they persist in sniffing those things for kicks.</P>
    <P>One reads many reports of health depots being broken into and drugs taken or cars containing dangerous tablets being stolen.  We must examine the whole question of how drugs which are held by doctors or at health centres are being safeguarded.  I read again today or yesterday of another boy being found dead near drugs.  We cannot expect that such happenings will just cease.  We must make it much more difficult for people to acquire drugs.  We must also educate them and convince them that, apart from the moral aspect, drugs will do them no <Col N="660" /> good even from the point of view of self-preservation.  There are people who make money from pushing drugs. They are the real enemies of society and should be dealt with accordingly. Alcohol is our greatest problem at present.  The Minister should use every possible means of educating young people on the danger involved for them in the trendy advertisements which encourage drinking and excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the coming year the Minister will be able to make more progress in combating the menace of alcoholism and in dealing with the problem of the rising costs of hospitalisation. Neither of these problems is easy of solution.  The development of preventive measures would reduce the necessity for hospitalisation.  There could be, as I have already suggested, local depots from which teams of nurses and doctors could move out to housing estates and central city areas in order to treat people in their homes so that only the very acute cases would have to go into hospital.</P>
    <P>I do hope that the Minister will consider the suggestions I have made to him.  I look forward to his reply, in which I hope he will deal specifically with the problems I have referred to, namely, alcoholism and the cost of hospitalisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with my colleagues, I must compliment the Minister on the Estimate that he has introduced for £200 million for the health services.  As the Minister pointed out, at a time when money is scarce, we are still forging ahead with the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with the previous speaker in regard to the increasing cost of in-patient hospital treatment.  I do not know what the answer is.  The position should be monitored very carefully to see what could be done to keep the cost of hospitalisation within the bounds of reason.  I agree that the position might be reached where hospitalisation would be impossible for a great number of people. Consideration must be given also to that sector of the community that is not covered by free hospitalisation and <Col N="661" /> who rely on the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme, the cost of which for a large family may be prohibitive and which is only partial coverage.  In some cases it can become very expensive.</P>
    <P>The area to be looked at is the whole area of community care.  I am glad that the Minister devoted a good part of his very well prepared Estimate speech to community care and the necessity to do something at local level to look after people in their homes.  In this respect we are losing ground by not having enough personnel to carry out the work.  We should have been devoting more attention to the matter of training nurses. Every year thousands of eager young ladies who are anxious to train as nurses in this country have to go elsewhere. We can take on only about 1 per cent of the applicants.  The remainder leave on the emigrant ship and they do not return.  Every applicant should get an opportunity to train as a nurse here at home.  There will be plenty of work for them to do when they are trained.  This matter must be attended to if we are to provide for the health of our people in a manner that we can afford.  Nurses can do fantastic work if there are enough of them available.  I hope something will be done about this matter.  I mentioned it before in the House.  Parliamentarians are asked if they can get young ladies placed in hospitals for training but there is nothing we can do.  The places are not available for them.  This is a tragedy. I do hope that notice will be taken of this matter and that educational and training facilities will be provided.</P>
    <P>In regard to preventive medicine, we can do a great deal by education. I agree with the previous speaker as to the dangers that beset people.  We must teach young people about these dangers.  It is not possible to put young persons in a glass case in order to protect them.  There are dangers inherent in electrical installations about which persons must be warned.  People must be educated to live with these dangers.  It is not possible to eliminate all the dangers.  There is the danger that weed killers present.  There is <Col N="662" /> the danger involved in tablets.  There is the danger to which the previous speaker referred of fire extinguishers. This is an educational function.  In association with health boards, this should be part of the training of youth.  There is no way in which you can protect a child against all these menaces other than to put him in a glass case.  The problem will not be solved by abolishing fire extinguishers or other potentially dangerous objects.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in what the Minister had to say about the care of the elderly and the whole field of geriatrics.  I should like to compliment the Minister on his statement. More attention should be paid to the voluntary hospitals that are left.  These hospitals should get better treatment than they are getting.  They do fantastic work.  Some of them do not come under the health boards and are operating on a shoe string.  They probably depend on what the old people get by way of pension.  I see no reason why these hospitals should be differentiated against.  They should be encouraged and the type of service they give should be encouraged and more facilities should be provided for them.</P>
    <P>I am referring now to one or two hospitals being run by religious orders. I should like to compliment the religious orders concerned on their fantastic work.  They dedicate their lives to this service.  Their hospitals are highly regarded.</P>
    <P>The care of the elderly is a matter of education.  There was a great tradition in this country of looking after our old people at home.  The latter day trend of moving old people into hospitals is not a good thing.  It is unChristian. We will all be old one day. I, for one, should like to end my days at home and not in the ward of an old people's home.  Young people should remember that one day they too will be old.  We should do unto others as we would wish others to do unto us.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned that more financial assistance should be given to young couples who are looking after their parents or who are looking <Col N="663" /> after any old person.  That person would cost 100 times as much if he had to be hospitalised.  We are not giving due recognition to that fact.  I would go so far as to say that all old people should have free television, free electricity and other perks like that. They could then claim that they were helping in some small way to keep the house going.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for helping me with regard to a school for mildly handicapped children. He showed his deep concern for this sector of the community who cannot speak for themselves.  The parents of these children are deeply grateful for his interest.  I am sure he will be glad to know that these children now have a school convenient to their homes.  I will not elaborate on that.</P>
    <P>I should like to encourage the Minister to do all he can for handicapped people.  This is a necessary and Christian work.  Indeed, it is very rewarding work.  I have been involved with these people and it is amazing what can be done for them.  They can be fitted into employment.  The resources of AnCO are available to them and I am sure this will be a great success.  Many handicapped people are really slow learners.  Even the severely handicapped can develop little skills and live a very useful and profitable life.  They need the encouragement and help of the State.  I am glad the Minister has decided to take action in this field and to spend considerable sums of money.</P>
    <P>We should all like to see more people brought into the net of the medical cards.  Perhaps that is not possible with the available resources.  In the present system there is a grey area in that it is the responsibility of the local administrative officer to decide whether a person is entitled to a medical card. I do not think that decision should be left to any one individual.  I should like to see the Minister roping in the services of members of the local pensions board who very often would give a fairer assessment of the situation.  This would be much more satisfactory than the present system.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the Minister has devoted some time to the more <Col N="664" /> positive side of health.  He makes the very valid point that we can do something about most modern killers such as alcoholism, cancer and heart disease. Previous speakers referred to alcoholism. We are looking for trouble when we allow these advertisements on television and in the newspapers.  Every function, whether it is a day's fishing or a day at the seaside, must end up in a bar.  That is wrong.  We should do everything to keep young people out of those places until they are competent to control their drinking.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of advertising is to sell and to make a profit.  People who advertise drink are very successful salesmen.  They are doing a great job when it comes to selling.  If you go into any rural bar at the week-end you find that it is packed to the doors with teenagers.  They seem to have plenty of money to spend and they are spending it very unwisely in my opinion.  This is one area in which we can safeguard our youth by forbidding the advertising of drink on our television screens.  The programme, <i>The Riordans,</i> should portray rural life at its best, but the bulk of that television effort takes place in a bar.  We are gearing our youth towards being a community of alcoholics.  I hope something will be done quickly by the Government about this.</P>
    <P>The same thing would apply to a lesser extent to cigarette smoking.  At the moment there is a genuine scare about lung cancer.  The warning is on the packet and if people are foolish enough to smoke after that they know the risk they are taking.</P>
    <P>The late President Kennedy once asked for a keep fit year.  This would be of benefit to the whole community and it would probably keep down the cost of the health services if everybody tried to eat the right food in the right quantities and took exercise.  In summer when those of us who like to think we are fit take the first plunge into the sea, we swim a few strokes and we suddenly realise that we are out of breath.  This is the acid test of fitness.  It is hard to see how anybody in that shape could do a good day's work and be of optimum service to the community.  On the manual side <Col N="665" /> of employment you have to be fit, but people in offices should get out and take a bit of exercise, and even get involved in keep fit clinics.  This could save a lot of money for the Minister for Health.  It is an area in which instead of devoting television time to ads for drink it should be devoted to ads about keeping fit.  I think we would be doing a great service to the nation.</P>
    <P>I have referred very briefly to the matter of handicap but there is one point I forgot to mention.  There are people who are haemophiliacs and I was involved lately with some young people who have this bleeding problem. They were very interested in getting employment in Dublin where treatment can be provided for them and I would like to see a special effort being made by the Department to encourage industrialists and people giving employment generally, such as solicitors and others, to employ these people in Dublin where possible.  We had the greatest difficulty in getting employment for a few of them in the not too distant past and I think the point should be made by the Department with a view to giving employment in Dublin to people who need treatment.  It is a small point but an important point for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Coming back to parochial matters, we are still awaiting a decision on Mallow hospital and I hope the Minister will bear the various representations in mind when he comes to make his decision on the matter.  I suppose that in view of the financial problems facing the Minister, it would be a good idea to look again at the Mallow situation and to note the fine structures that are there to see what could be done with them.  The people there have a very legitimate case for a good hospital service, especially in view of the fact that the hospital services a section of the country further north than Mallow, right up to the Limerick border, and caters for people living a long way from Cork.  That hospital has, down the years, provided a very good service and with a relatively small financial investment, would provide for the needs of the community in that area.  Now that a <Col N="666" /> start has been made with a break-through in relation to mildly handicapped children in the new school there, the Minister should follow it up by doing something with regard to hospitalisation in the Mallow area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the training of youth, it came to my notice recently that while we talk a lot about the negative side of health, there is a more positive side, the sound mind in the sound body.  The provision of recreational facilities is not strictly within the realm of the Minister but some note should be taken by the Government in relation to the provision of some subsidisation for young people in the matter of swimming pools.  Due to the exorbitant cost of oil at the moment, the cost of the use of swimming pools by children has gone out of bounds in the charging of sums as high as 25p for the use of pools.  This is a matter that should be looked at by the Minister and the Government because it is one area in which kids can grow up healthy and fit, be kept out of mischief and become good healthy citizens.  Again this is only a small matter but I hope he will do something about it.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this matter of giving the facilities of free television, ESB current and what have you to old people, whether or not they are living in with their families.  Give the facility to all, because the cost of administering the service at the moment is such that it would probably work out cheaper anyway in not having to find out who is or is not qualified.  It would give these people a certain status in their homes and help the family budget and in the end would save the State quite a lot of money, because something that horrifies me at the moment is to see the number of these people being put away in homes when there is no need for this at all.  Most of them should be living in their own homes with their own people.  It may well be a function of education or it may be a trend of the times, but it is a bad trend, and we have a responsibility as a Government to change it and to put people thinking in terms of looking after their own old folks in their own <Col N="667" /> homes.  There are cases of course which need daily medical attention but I am talking about the ordinary old people.  They should be at home and not in flats or anywhere else.  We really cannot dictate to sons and daughters what to do but we can encourage them by giving them financial help to keep them at home.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to congratulate the Minister on his performance in a difficult situation in finding £200 million for health services.  I can appreciate these difficulties but I would like to see a swing away from in-patient and general hospital services towards community care.  It is going to be a long, tedious path but he is certainly going along the right lines in thinking in terms of general community care and more geriatric care in the homes.</P>
    <P>Let me appeal again to him to provide full and adequate facilities for the training of nurses.  These are the people who will help to get his health bills in order in future, if we have an adequate supply of local nurses trained and working in the community.  At the moment I think that only 1 per cent of these people are trained at home; the rest go abroad and are lost to us for all time.  These are some of the things we have to look at and some of the things we can do.  There are some things we cannot do, due to financial limitations, but there is no reason why we should not train five or six times more nurses than we are training.  These people work hard enough during their time of training anyway and they are dedicated enough and selfless enough to go ahead and take up this very arduous way of life because it is a most difficult way of life and a tough way of life for a girl and it is a great credit to their dedication that they work so hard.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have spent a short time in hospital know of the dedication and hard work of nurses.  They work under difficult circumstances and for long hours and I should like to avail of this opportunity of complimenting them.  I appeal to the Minister to make available proper facilities for the training here of young applicants <Col N="668" /> for the nursing profession so that we will not be handing them over to Britain and elsewhere.  Because of a lack of these facilities we have lost some of our best nurses.</P>

      <P>The setting up of the regional health boards was a major milestone in the development of the health services.  These boards provide a unified management structure. It was not possible to have such a structure before because of the numerous boards and councils operating the various health schemes.  The structure of these boards is as near perfect as is possible.  There is a built-in safeguard as far as local interests are concerned in that local committees of the boards have been set up. These committees can easily bring to light the major defects which are inevitable within any organisation operating a major scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on the statistical information he supplied to Deputies when introducing his Estimate.  It must have taken much time and effort to compile this very useful information.  A striking feature in that information is that 31.3 per cent of our population are under 14 years of age, the largest percentage population of any age group in Western European countries. This is of great significance and should be borne in mind when a programme of health education is being prepared.  Health education should be included in the curriculum for primary schools.  This percentage will be increasing annually particularly when one has regard to the fact that during 1974, 68,000 births were registered. I urge the Minister to use his influence within the Government to have health education included in the curriculum for primary schools.  Such a policy would compliment and improve other preventive measures being taken at school level in regard to smoking, alcoholism and drug addiction.  Even if the complaints I have mentioned are hereditary, education would be of tremendous help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general medical services, the basic principle should be to ensure that no person is denied medical care <Col N="669" /> if they have need of it because of their inability to pay for that care out of their own resources.  The medical card system is not working towards this.  It is all right to say that 35 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards but the guidelines established by the CEOs, and agreed by the health boards, are interpreted in a wrong manner.  Because of the strict code adopted, it is almost impossible to obtain medical cards on hardship grounds.  The general excuse made by health boards is that persons can avail of the scheme under which they can recoup the major portion of the cost of drugs and medicines.  These guidelines should be changed periodically and applicants refused under earlier guidelines should be notified when they qualify for medical cards. CEOs should be notified that they can use more discretion in the granting of medical cards in hardship cases. It is not right that a person who is in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, social welfare disability benefit and redundancy payment does not qualify for health cards. I know of a family, the breadwinner of which is collecting unemployment benefit, who cannot get a medical card.  I know of many cases of persons, in receipt of social welfare disability benefit, who do not qualify for medical cards.  The health board insisted on using the guidelines when considering their applications and ascertaining their income during the previous 12 months, not at the time of application. The health boards should be advised to take the duration of an applicant's illness into consideration.  Certainly, if a medical adviser recommends a medical card for an applicant cognisance should be taken of that fact because, generally, it is a fair indication that the person may be out of work for some time.  The CEOs and the health board adhere too rigidly to those guidelines.  I believe many people were better off prior to the 1953 Health Act when they received free medical attention and drugs.  At that time applications were considered and approved by the local home assistance officers who knew whether a person was entitled to such services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> I believe also that some health boards are treating applications from small farmers for medical cards in a rather flippant fashion.  We are all aware that the rate of unemployment assistance being paid to those small farmers is taken into account but there seems to be no clear system of calculation of a farmer's income as far as the health boards are concerned.  I know of numerous smallholders who submitted their creamery milk return receipted accounts from creameries and their suppliers of manures and fertilisers so that such expenses might be offset against incomes.  But such bills were only partially taken into account by the health boards, which is most unfair to applicants.  Some unified system of calculating the income of a small holder must be devised. Sometimes it happens that the bills are offset against income but in the majority of cases I have good reason to believe that a percentage only of those outgoings are allowed.  I believe what I say is correct and has been proved to be correct from the statistical information made available by the Minister. For example, small farmers in the Southern Health Board area are among the lowest category of persons in receipt of medical cards.  We must bear in mind also that the percentage of population covered in the Southern Health Board area is less than the national average.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment briefly on the general hospital programme and on hospital services in general.  We know that 55 per cent of the total current expenditure on health services and 66 per cent of the total capital expenditure on health services go into their improvement.  I realise fully that hospitalisation and the operation of the hospitals system in this country becomes more expensive not merely monthly but daily.  This is due to the fact that hospitals have a high labour content but is due primarily to the rapidly rising prices of food, drugs and medicines, resultant on inflation.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, in his opening speech, mentioned briefly the county hospital in Tralee among a list of proposals for new hospitals in the country but I still cannot figure out <Col N="671" /> what exactly is the position in regard to that hospital.  The Minister stated that officials of his Department and the health board are currently devising a detailed plan for the implementation of this project.  That is a rather vague statement and, perhaps, the Minister would clarify what he means by a detailed plan for implementation of the project.  It is vital to the interests of the public and of those persons entitled to avail of the services to which they are entitled under the Health Acts that information centres be set up in each town throughout the country with a population of 1,500 or more.  It would not take much to man such centres.  I advocated also in the field of local government that such information centres be set up.  Perhaps they could be operated on a joint basis by the county councils, county borough corporations and the health boards which would considerably reduce the costs.  For example, I know there are many people who do not know how to apply for or where to get application forms in order to make application for the payment of health contributions.  These are people who do not qualify for medical cards, who can pay contributions and qualify for free hospital services.  It is amazing the number of people who do not know where to apply for such application forms.  I know of many people who sent postal orders to cover the cost to health boards, merely to have them returned.  I know of people also who sent postal orders to the Revenue Commissioners, again merely to have them returned saying they could not be accepted until there was first received an application form, duly completed, when their applications would be considered.</P>
    <P>In addition, very little publicity is given to the advantages of being a member of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board scheme.  Such advantages might be publicised also in these information centres.  Application forms and general information regarding entitlement to services should be made available also at these centres.  I know the Minister and his Department are considering setting <Col N="672" /> up certain centres in the major towns throughout the country.  I am speaking of a different structure where there would be an information centre in each small town.  They could be run jointly with the county councils and could provide information for the general public.  Such centres would pay their way because more money would be obtained by way of health contributions and more people would be encouraged to join the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme.  All the services provided should be readily available for the people for whom they are intended.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister said that the mentally ill and mentally handicapped were neglected in the past but I do not agree with that. Continuous progress was made by the previous administrations in these areas and there was considerable improvement. There was a marked swing away from the policy of hospitalisation towards community care and out-patient services.  This was clearly evident in the psychiatric sector.</P>
    <P>With regard to the handicapped, the Government should insist on a certain number of positions being made available in the public service and in the semi-State bodies for people who are physically handicapped but are qualified from the point of view of education.  An arrangement should be made with the Civil Service Commission to enable such persons to get posts.  A ratio should be struck between the physically handicapped and those who are fortunate not to have a physical disability.</P>
    <P>The Government should avoid any arbitrary division between mental and physical illness.  Out-patient and special psychiatric care should be provided as part of the community care programme; where in-patient treatment is required the aim should be to have psychiatric units attached to general and district hospitals.  If we are to move away from hospitalisation to out-patient service and community care it is of vital importance that personnel be trained.  There will be a need for more nurses, social workers and public health nurses, and more <Col N="673" /> training facilities should be provided urgently to enable an increasing number to become qualified.  At the moment it is difficult for girls to train as nurses here.  I realise a new training school was opened recently at the James Connolly Memorial Hospital in Blanchardstown but it will have little impact on the problem.  There were more than 1,000 applicants last year for 70 vacancies for trainee nurses in the South Health Board area.  This is an indication of the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a major defect in the psychiatric service, namely, where retarded children who are in homes for mentally handicapped children are found for psychiatric reasons to be not suitable for the homes and are then transferred to psychiatric hospitals. In these hospitals more than 99 per cent of the patients are adults.  I have known of cases of children in the nine- to 11-age group who were admitted to psychiatric hospitals and those children have the strength of children of five or six years.  There should be one special institution in the country to treat these unfortunate cases.</P>
    <P>At one time there were strong views held by many people that extra accommodation for geriatrics should be provided in each district hospital, but personally I disagree with this view.  There are strong pressures from communities adjacent to district hospitals for such extensions but, with an expansion of the community care scheme and with the involvement of more people in the scheme, encouragement should be given to keep geriatrics and elderly patients in their own homes where this is possible, unless on medical grounds it is really necessary to have them hospitalised. The reasons are obvious.  Closer co-operation should be encouraged between statutory bodies and voluntary agencies in the field of community welfare and care services.  The statutory bodies should not try to give the impression that they are the leading lights in this field.  They should work in close co-operation with the voluntary agencies.</P>
    <P>There is room for substantial improvement in ophthalmic services.  Improvement <Col N="674" /> will certainly cost money. The Minister should have a look again at the proposal that those requiring ophthalmic treatment or needing spectacles could on a prescription from their doctors go to the optician of their choice for whatever was necessary. I see no reason why such a scheme could not be implemented. The opticians are there.  The scheme could be operated in the same way as is the choice of doctor scheme where the patient can go to the chemist of his or her choice for drugs and medicines. Persons requiring ophthalmic services should be able to go to the opticians of their choice.  This would improve the service without very much additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Government's policy of providing hospital care for the entire population irrespective of income.  At the moment about 90 per cent of the population are eligible for free specialist care either in hospitals or in out-patient departments. The remaining 10 per cent represents a relatively more privileged section, and an extension of eligibility to this section should not be considered until the much larger section of the community has been brought into the general medical services. Some of those at present excluded from consultant hospital services suffer financial hardship in providing such services for themselves.  I suggest they be given an adequate tax-free allowance for voluntary health insurance contributions both for in-patient and out-patient cover and in respect of other financial outlays as well.  The numbers affected would be small and the cost to the Exchequer would not be very great.  The loss in revenue would also be small.</P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the view that it is vitally necessary to examine the trends of expenditure here and in other countries because experience points to the conclusion that the present approach is a little bit misguided. The best service cannot be provided along the lines followed at the moment.  A radical change of emphasis is called for and a re-allocation of financial resources.  Services must be brought out into the community <Col N="675" /> and an increased proportion of the moneys available must be devoted to community services and preventive treatment with a corresponding reduction in hospital admissions and institutional care.  I am convinced this shift of emphasis is absolutely essential on humanitarian and social grounds.  It also makes economic sense.</P>
    <P>The family doctor is the cornerstone of any community medical programme. His services must be available free through the general medical service to as wide a section of the community as possible.  This section should be enlarged.  As I say, the family doctor is the cornerstone of the service provided he is not given more work than he can handle.  That would be disastrous.  There should be no problem in attracting more doctors into the service.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to repeat a special request I made at the outset.  The Minister should urge the Government to include health education in the primary school curriculum for children from ten years of age upwards, particularly now when over 31 per cent of the population is under 14 years of age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his brief.  A sum of £177 million is provided for health.  That is a vast sum of money.  I do not quibble with the amount but I would like to know that we are getting the best value for the money.  I know discussions are going on at the moment about hospital development and reorganisation. It is more or less agreed now that we shall have a hospital in Blanchardstown, Newlands Cross, Beaumont and an extension to St. James's and the Mater.  I am wondering are these vast hospitals the solution to the problem.  I am not an expert but I am a bit anti having everything on a vast scale.  I was in favour of community schools at the beginning but I am not quite so much enamoured of the idea now.  In vast buildings personality tends to become lost.  That is happening in our hospitals. <Col N="676" /> While saving money possibly by having bigger hospitals will we get better services in those hospitals?  I am not wholly satisfied that we will get a better type of service.  If the patient benefited and if it benefited the Exchequer, by reducing costs, we should go ahead with it.  I am not in favour of these vast institutions for the sake of having big buildings and somebody saying that we could get better treatment in them.  I do not believe we would.</P>
      <P>We are moving in the area of psychiatric services.  We are pulling down the walls of these institutions. We are recognising there is a problem. It is important not to hide this problem.  There are probably people in these institutions who should not be there at all and every effort should be made to ensure that a comprehensive rehabilitation scheme is introduced. I know rehabilitation services are in operation in some areas but it is important that we have them all over the country.</P>
      <P>As chairman of the housing committee of Dublin Corporation I met a delegation from the Eastern Health Board last week.  They were looking for some local authority houses.  I agree with their scheme but I believe it would be better if they provided their own houses.  They informed us they had no money.  Money should be provided for such a service.  We have a vast housing problem in Dublin.  Some of the people who come to me are on the verge of needing psychiatric treatment because of the bad housing conditions they live in.  I would be very slow in handing over houses to the Eastern Health Board when they should be able to provide their own.</P>
      <P>We have a very high bed rate in psychiatric hospitals in comparison with other countries.  Is this because people could be signed into such hospitals and left there without anything being done for them?  Now, with the new programme, possibly our bed rate in such hospitals will fall.  It is necessary to rehabilitate such people as quickly as possible.  We hope the days of putting such people inside high walls are gone for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> We have neglected the training and employment of handicapped people. We seem to ignore people once they are handicapped.  AnCO should be asked to train them.  If necessary, incentives should be given to employers to provide jobs for them.  Do Government Departments employ handicapped people?  I believe there are many jobs which such people could do very well.  A certain number of jobs in State Departments should be allocated to the handicapped.</P>
    <P>There is a move in the right direction in relation to community health and welfare services.  Our whole attitude towards health should be that of preventive medicine.  We all know the old saying that prevention is better than cure and we should always have that before our minds.  Doctors very often write prescriptions aimlessly and dole out drugs without considering their effect on the particular patients.  We have all heard recently about the tranquilliser drugs that are literally being shovelled out.  It seems to be the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to take Roches 5, Roches 10, or whatever number it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good question.  I came across a girl of nine years who has been on this drug since she was six years old.  A doctor who prescribes such a drug to a child of that age should be medically examined. It is a handy way out.  We should be able to look at a patient and say that it is not drugs which are required, that such a person has a particular problem and we will do our best to sort it out.  The liberal prescribing of such drugs adds considerably to our drug bill.  A lot of the drugs, for which the Minister has to foot the bill, are not really necessary, but it is handy for a doctor to write a prescription and that is the end of his problem. Doctors have a great responsibility in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the home help service was introduced in 1972 quite a number of <Col N="678" /> people have been able to keep out of geriatric hospitals.  The cost of hospitalising elderly people is very high in comparison with providing home help.  A home help should be made available to a widower who has a large family.  Such a man should be able to apply for home help to look after his children when he is at work.</P>
    <P>The meals on wheels service does very good work and more money should be provided for it.  One could regard it as preventive medicine because elderly people get one good protein meal a day.  If they had not this they would only have a pot of tea, bread and possibly margarine. This undermines their health considerably. When they get a hot meal at midday it adds years to their lives. This cuts down on medical expenses. It is an admirable service and long may it continue.  The necessary funds should be made available for this service.</P>
    <P>The work of voluntary bodies is tremendous.  The religious bodies particularly give a first-class, unselfish service to the community.  If they withdraw their services the cost of replacing them would add millions to the bill.  Voluntary agencies should be helped financially and in every other way.  They provide community services. I know the Eastern Health Board pays half the cost of staffing community services but I wonder if it would not be better to pay the full cost.  There are areas in which the system could be operated if it were not for the fact that the money is not available.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the allowance of £25 per month to a handicapped child was an excellent break-through, because there was a great strain, financial and otherwise, on people with handicapped children.  This allowance will help people to keep such children at home where they can get the very personal attention they need.  That allowance should be reviewed at every budget with a view to increasing it where possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned information centres.  There is much to be said for that idea.  Many people are not aware of their entitlements.  Such <Col N="679" /> centres would become community advice centres.  I do not believe that such a centre should be merely the instrument of a health board but that the community should be very much involved in it and the health board should only help to pay for the staff. In that way it would give a better service.</P>
    <P>The whole area of dental health is very much neglected.  In fact, it is completely ignored.  We put fluoride in the water and then washed our hands of it.  We have not yet tackled the problem.  There is no real training programme.  There is nothing done in the schools in regard to educating people in dental care.  I have had occasion to look at the dental hospital several times.  It is archaic and a disgrace. The out-patient facilities are very bad and people have to wait in draughty corridors.  The equipment is outdated.  In a training hospital the very best equipment should be provided. Bad equipment will reflect on the dentists turned out.  The whole field of dental health should be looked at.  Many people neglect their teeth because to go to a dentist privately is too expensive.  If one has gum disease, bad teeth or other mouth problems it can undermine one's health and one can then become a hospital case.</P>
    <P>Health boards have become vast bureaucratic institutions and one wonders who has any control over them.  The idea at the beginning looked good, but the health boards are mushrooming into monsters.  The elected representatives have a smaller and smaller role to play within the boards.  They are generally organised and operated by the medical profession. The members of the medical profession are not accountable to anybody for their actions.  The elected representatives are.  The health boards have become too big, bureaucratic and answerable to nobody, as far as I can see.  While there are a number of elected representatives on them they have a very small say.  The whole question of health boards should now be looked at again because it is a Parkinson's law situation.  They are developing job after job and creating <Col N="680" /> this vast empire for themselves.  I do not think we are getting value for the money we are spending on the health boards.  I would ask the Minister to examine the whole workings of them and to ensure that they will operate well and efficiently.  I doubt if they could be dismantled at this stage and revert back to the local authorities again, but that is what I would like to see happening.  I suppose they have got too big for that.  It looks now as if it was a mistake to create them.</P>
    <P>I do not think the medical card system is a very fair one.  There are guidelines laid down but a person with a prolonged illness or an illness which will last for the rest of his life, because he is a couple of pounds over the guideline, is refused a medical card. This is wrong.  People with terminal illnesses have been refused medical cards.  That is wrong.  In such cases the medical card should be issued immediately.  There should be greater flexibility about issuing medical cards. The scheme to assist people with regard to the cost of drugs is a very good scheme and I agreed with it when it was introduced but it is being used too widely without reference to the cost of the doctors' fees.  A medical card entitled the holder to a choice of doctor.  Doctors' fees have increased considerably and people who need to make frequent visits to the doctor because of chronic illness find that the cost of the drugs is only one aspect, that the doctors' fees are very high. In the case of prolonged or chronic illness the guidelines should be revised in respect of the issue of medical cards.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis must be placed on health education.  I do not think there is any plan or programme of health education.  There are television shots about not smoking or drinking but it is a negative type of programme. There must be a positive programme of health education.  For instance, there could be physical education programmes.  Young people should be encouraged to participate in sport.  Sport should be encouraged. Other European countries do it.  We do not or it is done haphazardly.  We were talking earlier about preventive <Col N="681" /> medicine.  Education on health would prevent illness.</P>
    <P>Misuse of drugs is a big problem and one that is not easily solved.  The incidence is worldwide.  I am glad that the Minister has a Bill before the House that will help.  I am against penalising people who take drugs.  It is a negative reaction to put persons who take drugs into jail.  Certainly the people who sell these drugs, the peddlers, should be locked up unceremoniously for a long period of time.  They are the people responsible for the misuse of drugs, the people who exploit the weak for their own monetary gain.</P>
    <P>We should consider a programme of preventive medicine.  I realise that the Minister is anxious to expand the health services where possible but there is a limit to what can be done because of the tremendous cost involved. There should be greater emphasis on voluntary health insurance. People should be encouraged to help themselves rather than ask what the Government will do about this or about that.  This can be done by community development and health education.  The lead should come from the Government.  The aim should be to establish a good voluntary health scheme that would be augmented by grants from the central fund.  The voluntary health insurance scheme that is now in operation is first-class and works well but it could be expanded with a view to reducing the cost of the health services.  The cost this year is the vast sum of £177 million.  That must be viewed in the context of the requirements for education, housing, social welfare and all the other departments.  It is absolutely essential that any money expended should be spent wisely.  The people should be encouraged to take out voluntary health insurance.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on his speech.  I know that he is anxious to do a great deal more but there are financial constraints.  He should examine the possibility of involving voluntary bodies in the implementation of programmes.  He should ask himself, do we have to spend vast sums on huge hospitals?  Is that a <Col N="682" /> way of doing it?  I do not think so. The hospital services are reasonably good; further help must be given them, but should we take over these vast hospitals where patients become numbers and the medical staffs are part of a factory situation?  We are spending money in this area of health which might be spent otherwise more wisely.</P>

      <P>The proposal that the spokesman on health for the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Haughey, made in relation to the general health services is one that must command the attention of those who are interested in improving the health services.  The emphasis that Deputy Haughey laid on the provision of medicine in the local community in conjunction with social welfare schemes allied to community care and away from institutions must be the emphasis of the future.  We have seen over the last few years how, despite a temporary set-back, the tuberculosis hospital became obselete in many cases when the disease was brought under control.  As community development continues, as the provisions of medical services within the community context develops, then, if we concentrate too much on institutional care and the provision of institutions, we may find that we have white elephants on our hands.  This is not to say that there are not institutions in each region which are absolutely essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concentration on developing the general health service by the provision of medical cards for more people is important.  Public representatives who keep in close touch with their constituents&mdash;and those who do not do not at their peril&mdash;will find that, in most of the health problems encountered, what people are most interested in is the provision of medical cards for a greater number of people in the community. Hardly any meeting with constituents in any town goes by without some person coming in with a tale of woe about being unable to pay for medical services.  It is difficult in most cases not to concede that a very strong case exists.  We could ask the Minister <Col N="683" /> for Health to concentrate on these needs.  This has been done already.  I simply reiterate it.  He should concentrate on these needs and demands and ignore the theorists who want to start at the other end of the scale to try and keep in touch with some theory which may be fashionable but which is not really related at the moment to the needs of the community.</P>
    <P>I referred to the importance of the link between the medical services and the social welfare services.  I agree that these two portfolios being carried by the same Minister are too onerous. This point has been made already. There is a close relationship, of course, between the services provided, but they are so important that it is rightly contended that two different Ministers should carry the portfolios.  Perhaps next after the demand for medical cards, public representatives come up against the problem of the old.  They tell us&mdash;though one gets cynical as one grows older&mdash;that it is a celtic thing but there is a traditional respect for the granny and the granddad or, as we pronounce it Spanish-wise in Cavan, the granda in Irish society.  In fact the Dublin granny is the kind of goddess of the household.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And a formidable granny she was.  In the country there has also been a traditional respect for the grandparents.  In fact there are two stages when the grandparents are very useful: in the urban context for baby-sitting, in the rural context for doing quite hard work&mdash;the granny in the house and the granda around the garden and the farmhouse and so on if it is in a purely rural context. That stage passes.  The grandparents become more feeble and become a greater burden particularly on the housewife.  It is this area which needs attention both from the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time last year I put down a question to the Minister for Health about the availability of specialists in geriatrics and I was shocked by the <Col N="684" /> very few people who are employed by the health boards, and I think those qualified specifically in geriatrics generally in the country are comparatively very few.  As I say, when this second stage in the life of grandparents is reached they become more feeble and less useful.  I am not saying they are judged by their usefulness. I am saying the problem begins when they grow more feeble.  They also become more testy, more demanding, more selfish if you like&mdash; this is a natural thing.  Then the burden on the housewife, the bean a' tighe, becomes very heavy indeed.  I am not talking theoretically.  I am talking from practical experience of this practically every week in my constituency work.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects to this problem.  The idea of the prescribed relative allowance which relates to social welfare was a good one.  I contend that it is much too restrictive. Purely from the health point of view, which is what we are dealing with at the moment, it would be important to extend the provisions of the prescribed relative allowance to cover the work of a housewife, even though she is supported by her husband.  Most of the applications are turned down because the prescribed relative is supported and has not got to rely on the allowance purely from the old age pensioner plus the prescribed relative allowance.  Wearing his other hat the Minister for Health is the Minister for Social Welfare and I would think that this is an area that could do with a little attention.  That is the purely economic side of it.</P>
    <P>I think also that a campaign to educate the people who have to deal with the problem is important.  I am talking about this in the context of saving institutionalisation, saving people from having to go to the institution which, in human terms, can be wrong and, in purely economic terms, is much more expensive than if they are being dealt with in the home.  I am saying that there is an educational problem because young people have no particular competence. They know the parents or parents-in-law as the case might be quite well. <Col N="685" /> They are inclined to think that the testiness and their being over-demanding and getting more selfish as they grow more feeble is a particular problem in that particular household, that it is not generalised.  If, for example, they got lectures pointing out to them that they can expect this kind of problem and this kind of approach, they would be in a better position to cope with the problem in the home as it arose.</P>
    <P>I know from personal experience a bean a' tighe who had to deal with an old person who was very difficult. She had nine children and lived in a farmhouse.  The facilities were not too bad; they were not ideal.  The woman was under great stress and there was grave danger of her own health deteriorating, of her collapsing under the strain.  This is not an example thought up.  Other families who may not be quite that large are dealing with this problem.  When the housewife has neither aid from social welfare nor training nor education to cope with the problem, it makes it very difficult indeed.  I would suggest that the Department of Health could look at the educational end of the problem and, perhaps, set up a series of lectures&mdash;after all we are producing too many doctors they tell us today&mdash;under the auspices of the county medical officer of health, which could be given to existing organisations.  I am talking mainly of rural Ireland in this context of my own constituency but this could also be done, and more easily, in urban Ireland as well.  Lectures on the problems of handling old people could be given through clubs such as the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Macra na Feirme.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the burden should be laid solely on the woman in the household.  The man, who may be the son of the old people concerned, should also know how he can help, should be enlightened as to the universality of the problem, should be enabled to, if I may say so, stand back from it and see it less subjectively than he is bound to do when he is living with the problem and dealing with his own kith and kin.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="686" /> An idea has come from France of permanent education in three phases: the formal educational process that we know of in the early part of a person's life, the middle period, which would be retraining and in-service courses, and a third period to deal with the retirement of people and the problems of retirement, and so on.  We should have the objective that health educational programmes be organised by the county medical officers of health in the various counties under the auspices of the health boards to help people to deal with this problem in the home.  It is in keeping with the ideas that have come from this side of the House on the development of our health services. Respect for the aged at the moment is being cashed in on by our community, if you like.  The health authorities take it for granted that families will do&mdash; and it is only right that they should dedicate themselves to their aged&mdash;all that is necessary at a minimum cost to the health services to keep people fed and clothed and reasonably happy in their old age.  It is not right that the community should rest on another person's wound, the wound in many cases being that of the woman who is raising a young family and who has enough to cope with.  It is not right that the community should be complacent about that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he has spent&mdash;he probably knows what I am going to talk about now&mdash;18 months studying the problem of the regional hospital system and said that in a short time he would be making announcements.  I know criticism is often levelled&mdash;sometimes by professionals, dentists, doctors and so on &mdash;at Members of this House for being too parish pump in their approach to health problems and other problems as well.  I am not entirely inclined to agree that the parish pump is not important. On this question of the regional hospital, one is really talking in a national context because where one is set up will provide arguments for where another should be set up. When one talks of one hospital, one is then talking of all.</P>
    <P>I want to point out again to the Minister, lest he has not heard it sufficiently <Col N="687" /> often before, that Cavan town has a very strong case for a regional hospital.  He has heard the arguments before.  The Fitzgerald Report, which has taken at least one wallop from the Minister in his Estimate speech&mdash;a mild wallop I should say, and I am sure the conclusions of the Fitzgerald Report are not totally invalidated by that wallop&mdash;recommended Cavan town for a regional hospital, as the Minister knows.  This proposal was debated by the North-Eastern Health Board and the board's decision was that Cavan was the suitable place for the regional hospital in that area. Comhairle na nOspidéal also favoured this location and the people of the whole area&mdash;and I am not excluding places like Leitrim which would be catered for from the term &ldquo;area&rdquo;&mdash; are anxious that a decision should be announced.</P>
    <P>I know the decision has been made to build a regional hospital in Cavan but the decision should be announced in the very near future.  When the Minister says &ldquo;a short time&rdquo;, I hope it means not more than a month.  A site is available in the town.  It is one of the most beautiful sites in Ireland for a hospital.  There are beautifully kept grounds&mdash;we have a tradition in that; we have won the Tidy Towns competition with monotonous regularity and I am sure Deputy Haughey will be going to see this beautiful site shortly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A Shangri La.  The shrubbery, the flowers and so on around the existing Lisdarn hospital are really worth seeing.  They are as beautiful as the Botanic Gardens and we are awaiting the start of the regional hospital.  What we are looking for at the moment is a surgical unit of 100 beds.  We are not going to break the bank, or going to be greedy; we are not going to stick our hand in the sweet jar and not be able to pull it out.  We are simply looking for a 100-bed surgical unit at present. If the Minister makes the decision while the shrubs and flowers are in <Col N="688" /> bloom, he will be able to lay the cornerstone this summer and we promise him a good day and all the blessings of the area.</P>
      <P>He knows, for example, that the chamber of commerce&mdash;and this was no ersatz or rent-a-crowd move on their part&mdash;have conducted campaigns to try to get an announcement of the Minister's decision to start the regional hospital in Cavan in the very near future.  Throughout the county, all the rural organisations&mdash;sporting and social, the Countrywomen's Association, both the Macras, the Gaelic Athletic Association, the chambers of commerce, Muintir na Tíre, co-operative societies&mdash;have been writing to the Minister making this case.  It is a very strong case.</P>
      <P>The surgical hospital which we have is in the centre of the town and was condemned as a building a long time ago.  It is quite dangerous in many ways.  I made the point last year, and I hope I will not have to make it next year, that the high quality of service provided for the people of the area in that building is the biggest tribute one could pay to highly-skilled surgeons who worked without complaining&mdash;perhaps they did not complain hard enough or often enough or wield their scalpels in the right direction&mdash;over the years.</P>
      <P>I will not dwell any longer on this. My reason for bringing the matter up is that it is not purely a local issue, it is one related to the provision of all regional hospitals.  These institutions, with their ancilliary services&mdash;they are very bad in Cavan&mdash;technological and scientific will be necessary no matter what way the health services develop.</P>
      <P>With regard to dentistry, I am glad to see the Minister is 100 per cent on Fianna Fáil policy in relation to the Cork Dental Hospital.  I had occasion to visit the Dublin Dental Hospital over the last two years and I appeal to the Minister, no matter where he gets the money, whether he begs or borrows it, to provide adequate accommodation for the Dublin Dental Hospital as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be convinced of that remark by the Parliamentary Secretary as soon as the Dental Hospital at Wilton is roof high, and I presume that will be in the near future.</P>
      <P>The staff in the dental hospital in Dublin are highly qualified and have something more than the purely technical qualification, the scientific qualification, they have a sense of mission.  Many of them to whom I spoke felt constrained and defeated to a certain extent.  This is a pity because many of them are young and have high qualifications acquired here and abroad.  There is a danger&mdash;we are all affected by cynicism as we grow older&mdash;of cynicism setting in too soon.  If this happens it will be a great loss to dental education.</P>
      <P>They complain also that they fall somewhere between the health and education stools.  Perhaps there is a case for a health/education joint committee because the Departments of Health and Education will be responsible for developments in the dental hospital.  One thing is true, they feel they are being made the poor relations of the health service.  Neither the public, the Members of this House, or the Departments of Health and Education regard dental education, and the dental services, with the seriousness they should.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to what everybody is calling for, the health education programmes, an education programme in the dental field is necessary and an easy one to mark.  Deputy O'Brien referred to the lack of education in this field.  I cannot see why our television programmes&mdash;the ears can be assaulted by various commercials but I would expect more finesse from a Government Department&mdash;could not be utilised to put on a series of programmes for <Col N="690" /> children on the care of their teeth.  I know there have been spasmodic ones but I mean a concentrated course at a fixed time with a quiz programme built into it to try to arouse interest and impart knowledge about care of teeth to children.</P>
    <P>I remember going to the dental hospital and getting instructions about teeth brushing from a highly qualified peridontologist there.  When I went back he gave me 10 per cent out of 100 per cent on performance.  I thought I took particular care in the meantime. I said to him: &ldquo;unfortunately having been involved in the education business, I am suspicious that you are putting that mark very low for propaganda reasons and that I really performed better than 10 per cent but you just want to shock me into upping my standards and so on&rdquo;.  He admitted that was partly true but he said I was not doing the job properly.  I improved gradually&mdash;mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sé.  As I improved in his rating I got happier and happier.  I should have been older, tougher, more cynical and less amenable to adulation but I have to confess I was delighted I was improving so well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Bhí mise ag iarraidh foghlaim.  I should like to mention an important health activity in Dublin city, the kidney screening programme which is mainly centred on the children's hospital in Crumlin.  This is a very thorough and exact activity and, apparently, the discoveries made by people conducting this kidney screening operation on children have been quite revealing and very important with regard to the health of the people of this city.  There was rumour that there was a danger of its being under-financed or of finance being withdrawn from it.  I cannot pin this down.  There was a fear at one time that it might have to be discontinued because of lack of adequate finance.  I appeal to the Minister that if there is ever any danger of this kidney screening programme being under-financed to intervene and see that it is adequately financed until the disease that is being <Col N="691" /> discovered has been wiped out.  I understand that, whereas the infection that is being discovered is not serious at the school and child age, it can be very serious, particularly in the case of girls, in later life.</P>
      <P>On the education aspects of the health programme, excessive drinking by young people is on the increase. The Minister and his predecessor, the late Mr. Childers, were concerned about alcoholism.  I am talking in the field of excessive drinking as much as alcoholism.  Frankly, from my personal observation which is, of course, necessarily limited but stretches over much of the country, there is an increasing tendency to drink in excess among young people.</P>
      <P>The churches did&mdash;if I may use a vulgarism&mdash;cop themselves on that the kind of religion of &ldquo;nos&rdquo;&mdash;thou shalt not do this and thou shalt not do that&mdash;was counter-productive, was not positive enough and did not appeal to young people and this has inhibited them in some ways from starting a campaign with regard to the increased drinking by teenagers.  For the health of the country, in general, we should be very careful about this because it will affect the moral fibre of the nation.  That sounds like a cliché, but if it is a cliché it is the nearest I can get in words to express what I am thinking about.  The &ldquo;do not&rdquo; element which was a feature of church teaching and reflected the attitude of elderly people to younger people has had a bad effect.  It has a bad effect in that where there are legitimate grounds for conducting this kind of campaign people have now become psychologically inhibited and do not want to conduct such a campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fulminations against drink, the fire and brimstone type of campaign, is counter-productive; it is no longer on.  The facilities are available to the Department of Health of using the television and radio to conduct a campaign, not in the old temperance style but to encourage moderate drinking or at least discouraging immoderate drinking.  I deliberately <Col N="692" /> used the first, being the positive and the more teachable nowadays.</P>
    <P>With regard to smoking, I worked in London for a while and in the school in which I worked there were all teenagers, practically none of whom smoked.  This was due, as much as anything else, to the very high cost of cigarettes at that time in Britain&mdash; at least relative to this country.  It seems to me that in this country a higher percentage of young people are smoking now than were, say, ten years ago.  There was a decrease in cigarette smoking but now people seem to have come back to smoking again.  As a former slave to cigarettes myself I have no kind of advice to offer.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health should concentrate on pointing out the health hazards.  Indeed the statistics which we have here regarding deaths from cancer&mdash;it does not distinguish lung cancer from other forms of cancer&mdash; show that there has been an increase. I do not know if all the talk and statistics is very impressive to smokers. I saw films on television with horrible pictures of cancered lungs and I was subjected to all kinds of personal propaganda and so on.  I do not know what is the psychology of giving up smoking.  Those things did not impress me at all.  The badgering of a former fellow-student of mine, who now holds a chair of medicine in one of our university colleges, did not have the slightest effect either.  I listened to him, I was convinced, but I did not give them up at that time.  I may thank Dr. Mulcahy for giving them up&mdash;although I never met the man&mdash; because he sent around a little card one time to people who were being X-rayed asking them how many cigarettes per day they smoked.</P>

I did not wish to end up as a statistic in relation to the survey and that, plus the grace of God, enabled me to give up smoking.  Nobody has the secret.  Deputy Haughey probably has a will of steel&mdash;he decided to give them up and that was that.</P>

      <P>I am not competent to talk about drugs or how to deal with the problem. I was shocked to see in the area of Dublin which I know best that two young people died as a result of drug-taking within the last couple of weeks. One chap died from drinking cider and taking barbiturates and another person was found dead at a doctor's surgery door.  It was a great tragedy. I have no particular competence to discuss it but as a person who knows, likes and works with young people it saddens me to think of a person of 18 or 19 years dying in this way.  Society owes them a duty in every way&mdash; educational, corrective and so on&mdash; and should ensure the provision of skilled social workers to try to obviate this kind of happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The social workers in the central city area were doing very good work in this regard.  I do not wish to be partisan about this but there seemed to be a degree of discouragement of them.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education mentioned recently that the social workers who were employed are now being set up with proper career structures and salaries.  I asked him if any of them would be allotted to a kind of &ldquo;rambler&rdquo; role in the centre city area and he told me that it would possibly happen.  I should like it to happen because the people who are working in that field were extremely good.  They were making contact, <Col N="694" /> were spending some part of each day with people who had these problems and they had some successes.  When measured against the salary of a social worker for a year, even one life saved in my scale of values, is a success.</P>
    <P>With regard to the schools service, there is a great deal lacking in the post primary.  In fact, the service should be gradually extended into the post-primary schools.  We are all very obtuse with people whom we see all the time.  Eyes and ears particularly can deceive us.  Young people may be caught in the net of the medical service in the primary school or they may not.  There can be ear and eye defects which parents even do not notice for a long time, let alone teachers, and there should be some way of getting at this problem.</P>
    <P>Diabetes is another disease which can exist for a long time in young people without diagnosis.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should like to refer to the injuries that athletes and foot-ballers, particularly in the context of schooling and later on, suffer.  A booklet could be produced by the Department of Health to help people to understand the type of injury they may suffer when playing games.  I know that the Minister for Health played for the YB's in his time and I think the Parliamentary Secretary played football in my county at one time.</P>

However, a small booklet could be issued dealing with the normal injuries, such as pulled muscles or ligaments or Achilles heel. Sometimes they diagnose incorrectly their own ailments and a booklet would be helpful.  It could be distributed through the schools, particularly in post-primary schools where games are played, and where most of these injuries start.  Information does not necessarily cure, but it may prevent. Very few people have even enough basic knowledge to know that, for example, a warming up period in cold weather, and so on, is very important <Col N="695" /> so that muscles will not be pulled. That kind of information in a small and inexpensive booklet would be invaluable. It could be contained in a chapter in a larger booklet.</P>
      <P>With regard to maternity medical services, an effort is being made to provide adequate services for those who hold medical cards.  Those who are very well off will see to it that, as far as their cheque books will guarantee, they will get services. Then there are the in-betweens. There is an educational job to be done and services must be improved.</P>
      <P>With regard to nurses, Deputy O'Leary referred to the difficulty about training.  He covered the point more than adequately.  We all get at least ten letters a week from girls who want to do nursing seeking places in training schools.  The answer is nearly always that it is very difficult.  There are not sufficient training schools for those who want to dedicate themselves to this very arduous profession.  It is one in which both women and men excel.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one point dealing with the system that obtained before the marriage ban on nurses was lifted.  A number of nurses were being employed on a temporary basis.  Some of them have recently received cavalier treatment from the health boards.  I am appealing to the Minister to examine this matter and to see to it that people who have given long service on a temporary basis&mdash;it sounds paradoxical, but that is what was happening&mdash;should not now be summarily dismissed, or asked on a week's notice, as happened in a case brought to my attention, to leave their positions as these were being advertised.  This is not good enough in the case of people who have given any kind of service to the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to ask the Minister to request the officials of his Department to examine the position of some towns which, under the old regime, had doctors.  There is a pleasant little town on the Longford-Leitrim-Cavan border where the <Col N="696" /> three counties meet.  There was a Senator who used to claim he was a native of those three counties.</P>

A little bit of co-operation is needed between the North-Eastern Health Board, the North-Western Health Board and the Midland Health Board.

In fact, I wrote to him about it.  There is a problem.  The doctor who is covering it&mdash;he is a very good doctor and gives a very good service&mdash;has too many on his books.  Possibly another doctor will be allotted to the area at some stage. The community were thinking of building at their own expense a house specially for a doctor.  It is a progressive little town.</P>

      <P>Not necessarily, although I think they are the only ones that are held in my area.  Food <Col N="697" /> now is very often taken from the deep freeze.  The Department of Health function here to instruct people.  Commercial companies do it to a point, telling people who use deep freezers how exactly they should use them, how long the food should be removed before cooking, and so on.  This is not confined to my own area.  I have known of it happening in many areas, even in the deep south.  There is a change in eating habits and in storage methods.  The Department of Health should interest themselves in this field. It is part of the concern of public health.  Indeed, I should like somebody to explain to me why the radiators&mdash;I am thinking now of my own health&mdash;in the reception room at the main entrance cannot be turned down: they are unbearably hot on this beautiful day.  I am sure that some Deputies will get pneumonia from this yet.

I am talking about what looks to me&mdash;again I am only a layman in this regard&mdash;a case for payment of this £25 which was refused whereas in a case that looks physically or mentally better in another area the money is being paid. I am not saying that there is any form of dishonesty in this but this is the situation as I find it.  I suggest that a more liberal interpretation of retardation, the kind of retardation that attracts this money, should be aimed at.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="698" /> I would like to see the numbers which I gave in the statistics for the whole country broken down for health areas and even counties.  In some cases perhaps an appeal board of some kind at national level might be the right approach.  In some cases where the money should have been paid, it has not been paid.  As I said in my initial remarks on this matter, I think that the idea was a marvellous one.  We should push ahead for the provision of places, particularly in day centres, for the mentally retarded.  I can claim, without being chauvinistic, that Fianna Fáil made great progress.  I know the figures given are 64 and 74. Consequently I cannot make my point from the particular set of statistics in front of me but the Fianna Fáil administration made great progress with regard to mentally handicapped. I can, in justice, say that.</P>

      <P>I think they are very good.  The only point I was going to make was that a health board area is rather large and maybe the county health committees might be able to <Col N="699" /> compile their own statistics from the general statistics and this would be a great help to anybody talking about a constituency.  This is not purely parish pump although, as I said before, that it is an honoured institution&mdash;the parish does a good service and I would not denigrate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  In the North Eastern Health Board area we have Cavan, Monaghan Louth and Meath. Cavan and Monaghan are homogeneous to a degree and, of course, very friendly to an extreme degree, but Louth and Meath are somewhat different. Louth, for example, have more than the national average employed in industry whereas Cavan have 51 per cent underemployed in many instances in agriculture.  The statistics given in a lump for the North Eastern Health Board are not a great deal of help to me in assessing my own constituency. I am sure Deputy Leonard would also say that with regard to Monaghan.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to see that the population, despite what somebody else said in the debate, is a younger population and there is an increase in marriages. I know this is due to an improving economic climate.  I am a little worried now because the increase in marriages nowadays in the particular kind of situation we have depends on the availability of mortgages and so on for building houses.  I hope that this trend of an increase in population, in marriages and so on continues.  It is the duty of the Government to see that the economic climate is kept healthy so that this can happen.  There is an increase in the number of people to the square mile.  It is very important where the square mile is and what the square mile is where this increase of people takes place.  All the time the statistics show that the east is at an advantage. Here positive policies can be implemented by a Government to correct any over trends in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant statistics also are that Ireland has the highest number of people in the nought to 14 age group <Col N="700" /> of ten countries and the lowest percentage of 15 to 64, which is the group that is working and which produces the wealth to be distributed in social welfare.  Therefore it is very important for anybody responsible for the economy to see to it that work is available so that health services, social welfare services and so on can be paid for from the fruit of their labour.  I am glad to see also, despite all the cries about women in Ireland and their disadvantaged position, that the female life expectancy in all the age groupings is higher than that of the male.  This, I suppose is as it should be.  I am glad also to see that there is an increase in the birth rate, although the statistics show that two-and-a-half times more illegitimate children were born in this period than there were in the previous period.</P>

      <P>Admittedly this Estimate comes within six months of the previous one and perhaps nothing new has emanated from it, but it is the third interim report on progress within the Department.  I think the Estimate debate offers Deputies the opportunity to voice grievances, to put forward proposals, recommendations and suggestions as to what should and should not take place in the whole wide field of health.  This morning I heard some very constructive suggestions and recommendations indicating to me that there is a tremendous interest among Deputies in the whole field of health and they are fully alive to what is happening and should be done.  I hope the Minister will pay particular attention to what is said, assess the opinions of the Deputies here and see to it that they are given particular consideration within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> I say this because I feel moved to speak, first, about the Waterford seminar, which I think was a laudable idea.  It was a wonderful innovation aimed at bringing together people with a vital interest in the health service. However, health is not a matter which should be a political issue.  Many people have a lot to contribute to the field of health.  I say now, against my own Minister, that he should have invited the Opposition spokesman on Health to the seminar.  He should have asked Members of this House, who vote the money for the health services, who are directly responsible for whatever happens in the field of health.  Many legislators here, from what I have heard, had a vital place at this seminar. They should have been present at it to contribute a lot to it.  The seminar lost as a consequence of their not being there.  Those who vote the money&mdash; this £179 million&mdash;should have been present.  It should not have been just the people who work in the health services.  The public who contribute money to the health services in the final analysis, the people who benefit from the services, the people who avail of the services, the consumers, should have been present at this seminar and they should have been asked for their views as to how this money should be spent.  This was a big mistake and I would be hyprocritical if I did not express my views very bluntly on this matter.</P>
    <P>We have come a long way in our health services since the old poor law and dispensary system.  We have made good progress down the years, admittedly. But looking over the whole spectrum of health in general one wonders if, we have succeeded in improving the health services to such a degree that we do not have to spend such money in eliminating all the illnesses that confront us.  The figure is £179 million.  That is £59 per person, man, woman and child, per year&mdash;or, taking a working population of one million, it is £118 a year.  That is a lot of money for health services.  I thing much of this money is being squandered.  We are not spending this £179 million in the correct way.  We are not putting the money to the proper <Col N="702" /> use in the interests of our people.  We must take a long, hard look at the whole area of health to see what we can do to reduce considerably the vast sums being spent and, at the same time, provide a proper health service for our people.  We have been tinkering with the system and the Department is an ultra-conservative one which never comes forward with any initiatives.  In my experience of them, they have resisted any change all along the years and any suggestions that have come for a change in the services have been opposed.  It would take a Minister of vision, imagination and courage to change this very conservative Department. We will have to have a complete review of the health services to see how we can redeploy health personnel to the best advantage of our people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that the emphasis must be on preventive medicine and that the growing cost of hospitalisation is such that, if it continues, we cannot afford it.  I agree completely with the Minister on this because I have been preaching this for years.  But the paradoxical part of the Minister's speech is that he wants to encourage free hospitalisation and thereby encourage more and more people to avail of hospitalisation rather than preventive medicine.  If they are to get hospitalisation free and if they are to have to pay for the family doctor service, naturally they will opt for free hospitalisation.  The whole thing is paradoxical.  It is completely wrong. It costs over £120 a week for a bed in a hospital in Dublin.  It seems to me ridiculous.  If a doctor tells a patient that he may have to see him five or six times at £2 a time or so the patient will naturally opt for hospitalisation which will cost the State £120 a week.  This is ludicrous and it is burdening all the people.</P>
    <P>We have got our priorities wrong. We are looking at the issue through dark glasses.  We are not examining it properly and we are out of focus completely on the question of what preventive medicine is.  If we are going to talk about preventive medicine, if we are going to talk about primary medical care, we must <Col N="703" /> put the money into primary medical care.  We must make this a better service and thereby reduce enormously the cost of the health services in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be coming forward with a plan of action that would expand considerably community health centres.  I envisage health centres which will have consultants or specialists seeing the patients.  The health centres are placed right in the centre of the community and they should have proper diagnostic services, X-ray facilities, facilities for blood testing and so on. The consultants should come to the people rather than having the people trekking into the hospitals.  We will have to talk to our consultants about taking patients in for check-ups. Many of these check-ups are unnecessary. They could be done on an out-patient basis if the services were available.  But the services are not available and we should be ploughing money into the provision of these out-patient services so that the patients can have their check-ups done in out-patient departments. There are long waiting lists and long delays.  One can wait months for an appointment at the present time.  The whole thing is collapsing.  I am constantly badgered with requests to see if I can bring forward dates of appointments for diagnostic services. There is a delay of up to six months for an eye examination.  This is wrong.  When people have the opportunity, they will go into hospital to have the whole test done.  It is almost quicker to get a bed than to get an appointment.</P>
    <P>This is where we are using our money wrongly.  It is very badly organised.  There is no imagination or initiative coming from the Department of Health to see how we could improve this situation.  I have been harping on this for so long and saying this so often that I get tired and frustrated when I see that nothing is being done about it.  It is four years since I tackled it on a vast scale to try to force the Department to look carefully at it.  Long before I was <Col N="704" /> associated with politics I remember writing to Mr. MacEntee, who was Minister for Health at the time, suggesting that he should ask the medical profession and the hospitals to reduce the number of days a patient had to spend in hospital because I felt this was holding up beds and was costing the State money.  The patients were there when they need not be there and the patients were anxious to get home.  He said he had no function in the matter.  I knew nothing about politics.  That was a letter from the Minister for Health saying that he had no function in the matter.  It was a terrible indictment of him and his Department.  That was in 1963 and the State was contributing considerably to the cost of the hospital services.</P>
    <P>It is typical of the whole attitude in the Department that they have not looked beyond the immediate pressing problems to see how a health service was evolving or what they could do to improve it.</P>
    <P>The health centre should be the focal point within the community of the whole service.  It should provide this full sophisticated diagnostic service. It should contain within it the consultants who might come out and see the people there, and thereby reduce considerably costs.  It should have all these extra facilities there for dealing with them.  It should have all sorts of out-patient facilities at the centre as well as the social welfare services, all combined in one place.  I would recommend that all doctors be encouraged to work in the health centres and be given the facilities to work in the health centres.  Where they see private patients they should be charged a certain percentage by the Department of Health for providing this service for them.</P>
    <P>This is the way you will get a proper co-ordinated health service within the community.  This is the only way to get it working.  If you try any other way, you are going the wrong way about it and incurring endless and unnecessary costs.  It is part of the Labour Party policy.  I supported it in 1968 and the whole thing has been left in abeyance <Col N="705" /> and nothing has been done about it. It is the only answer to our problem. Might I suggest to the Minister that he could consider sending some of his men to Russia where they have the best health service in the world, operated properly in the interest of the patients?  It is a magnificent example of a health service operating to the benefit of the patient and helping him orientate towards a healthy life, not a sick life as we are operating here at the moment.</P>
    <P>On the question of social workers who are working with doctors, I do not think it is sufficient that when a girl gets a diploma she is a fully qualified person.  When you are working in the field of health, it is a highly confidential aspect of life.  It needs more than a diploma for a person to tackle some of these pressing, acute and very private matters that affect a whole family.  We would need to see that there is more supervision and more training.  It is not good enough.  I have seen some examples that leave me in awe at the whole thing and wonder at their real relevance or should they have a little further training and experience before they are thrown out onto the complex problem of health care.  I would ask the Minister to look into this very large field to see what can be done to ensure that the patient is the important person and his privacy is important.  We must respect that above all.</P>
    <P>While on this, in this highly technological age when we are talking about having information on everything, it is not good enough to have the patient's chart being available to non-medical people.  This to me is damnable.  A patient's illness is the patient's own concern.</P>
    <P>In the interest of computerisation and all the other statistical analyses, I do not think it is good enough that we should expose patients' records, patients' history, patients' private medical concerns to the full glare of statisticians.  I would want to ensure that the full doctor/patient confidentiality is maintained and ensured and that information like this would not be exposed to other people.  A <Col N="706" /> patient's illness is his own private concern.  The patient gives the information to his doctor on the understanding that no one else will get it.  I can say definitely that this is not the case.  Information in respect of patients can be available to non-medical personnel.  This is very dangerous. I said it before and it was ignored but I will say it again and again until we are sure that in this so-called computerisation, this so-called advanced statistical analysis, the patient does not suffer in the process. This is important and I am obliged to say it again.</P>
    <P>I should like to talk about the question of health education again.  If we are talking about change in the whole health system, if we are talking about orientating people towards health instead of illness, we have to think in terms of telling them about their health.  The ignorance of people about their health is appalling.  They do not know anything about anatomy or physiology.  They know nothing about the workings of the body.  They go to doctors in absolute ignorance. Many visits to doctors would be unnecessary if patients knew exactly the whole basis of working of their systems.  It should not be beyond the ability of the Department of Health in consultation with the Department of Education to introduce in the curriculum a health education course &mdash;basic anatomy and physiology and also information about the dangers of drugs, the normal drugs, aspirin and all the other drugs.  They should have a proper knowledge of them.</P>
    <P>Many people think there is a pill for every ill.  There is not and all these drugs have their own bad effects. When a doctor is making up his mind about a drug he has to weigh up the condition of the patient, weigh up the danger of the drug and see which is more important.  Patients often think they must have tablets and that tablets are the answer to everything. They are not.  There are many more people ill as a result of tablets than there were before them.  This should be borne in mind by people.  This will only come with proper health education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> Therefore we are back to where we started.  Let it be tackled along the right lines.  Get these courses going. It should not be beyond the ability of the Department to introduce this. One hour a week in the course of the last two school years would suffice. Why can this not be done?  We have to get to the young people, when we talk in terms of changing the whole approach to health.  Unless we start there we will have this over and over again.  The cost of the health services will escalate, more and more people will be going to doctors, more and more people will be living on drugs, more and more people ill.  We have got to stop this.  We must start in the right place.  We have got to educate people about their systems and let them think in terms of health instead of illness.  If we do this we can reduce considerably the cost of drugs, the cost of health services and the whole cost of this operation.</P>
    <P>We talked about improving psychiatric services and I am for it. We might have need to talk in terms of redeploying our medical personnel here, without casting reflection on them.  I visited one psychiatric centre and I saw a consultant psychiatrist playing basket-ball with a patient.  I am all for that but I do not think a consultant should do it.  It is too costly.  We could have volunteers from the community coming in to help them and we should have consultants doing proper jobs.  This is wrong.  There must be an enormous waste in the health services if this kind of thing prevails&mdash;a consultant playing ball with a patient, costing the State a fantastic amount of money.  We should try to change our concepts again and perhaps encourage school-leavers to come in after school, the last year at school, and work in the hospitals.  They should see what is happening in hospital.  Many school girls would like to go in and help with the meals in the hospitals. It would give them a better outlook on life, seeing what it is like.  It would improve them tremendously. That would encourage them to be more responsible citizens and we <Col N="708" /> would have less of the vandalism in our society.</P>
    <P>We should bring young people from the schools into hospitals.  The Department of Health should take an interest in this and write to the schools suggesting various hospitals where they could do this work.  There are people in the community who need this direction and leadership. Lots of women, widows and people with nothing to do would like to go in and help patients in hospitals.  If we could mobilise this massive force and get them into a hospital, we would get a better understanding of what happens in hospital and where there are defects in a hospital the public would be prepared to help to remove them and to pay the necessary finance.  It would change the whole approach to the health services if this were done.  Some of our mental hospitals need looking at by the public. It is not good that they should be so remote from the people.  If people in the community could help out, they would not be infringing on trade unions or anything like this.  They would be helping people in hospital, helping with bandages, rolling bandages, writing letters for people.  We should mobilise this force.  In the schools we should be encouraging the young people to go in and help with meals and so on.  This would reduce enormously the costs in hospitals.  I would like the Department to think along these lines even if they do not do anything about them.</P>
    <P>If the hospital plan is not implemented soon it will be outdated.  It will become so obsolete that we will have to start all over again.  In May, 1974, the announcement was imminent. Then, for political expediency, it was put on the long finger, and then we had a sub-committee. Now the decision has been made. Why can we not have it announced because the uncertainty is creating problems?  There is nothing worse than uncertainty.  The Minister should say: &ldquo;Look, this is our plan.&rdquo;  It will not appeal to everyone.  Naturally some people will be upset.  But a decision must be made some time.  It may be unpopular, but a good Minister <Col N="709" /> can be unpopular.  One cannot be popular all the time.  As public representatives we must know this.  It takes courage to stand up and say: &ldquo;This is it.  Let us see what we can do about implementing it.&rdquo;  Let it be announced and then see what happens.  There is discontent.  There have been meetings, marches and rallies because of this.  It is causing a lot of concern.  We should announce a firm decision and let people know what the situation is.</P>
    <P>With regard to Dublin, I have memories of its being announced in October or November, 1973, and announced three more times, but it has yet to be put in motion.  There is no objection to the plan but the whole thing is left in abeyance.  I should like the Minister to tell us what is happening about the Beaumont site.  Has written agreement been reached?  Has a committee been set up to start off the whole building?  We must take decisions about it.  We must have a progress report on it as we will vote the moneys for it.  It is not good enough to say: &ldquo;That is it&rdquo;, and leave it at that.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the St. James's Hospital site.  We must have a firm decision.  Indeed, St. Laurence's Hospital, I would say, is bulging so much that they will lose interest.  There will then be a brain drain.  Doctors will not work under the conditions prevailing in that hospital.  The same applies to Jervis Street.  Meanwhile, there are piecemeal extensions and renovations which are costing a fortune. As I have said already, if we extend the out-patient department or some other department in Jervis Street Hospital when we know the place is going to close down, when we know we are going to Beaumount, that is a wrongful use of money.  It is a misuse of money and this in an indictment of a Department who would allow this to happen.  We must know it is going ahead, and we must know what the deadline is.</P>
    <P>This fact must be borne in mind when considering extensions, renovations or any additions to hospitals like Jervis Street or St. Laurence's where <Col N="710" /> the future is unknown.  Naturally they will clamour for extensions to deal with their problems.  If they knew that in five years' time a major hospital would be built the authorities could then see there was no purpose in making application for extensions and renovations, and so on.  The fact that they do not know this is the cause of their present problem.  I am speaking about extensions to existing hospitals. If the Minister's plan for the Beaumont site is to take effect or be implemented on a realistic basis it is ludicrous that we do not know.  This is the problem. This is why the Minister should be forceful in his decisions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said&mdash;and I am delighted he said it&mdash;that there is no cutback in the health services, that there is actually real growth of 1½ per cent.  I wish he would convey this message to the CEOs of the health boards because the CEOs of the health boards have told us that there are cutbacks and that we cannot have this or that because there are cut-backs and that we cannot have this or that because there are cutbacks in the health services.  A directive should go out immediately to the health board CEOs telling them that there are no cutbacks.  At a health board meeting, when we came across a reference to dangerous fire hazards in institutions run by the health boards and called for the immediate provision of fire escapes, the CEOs said there was a cutback and we could not have them.</P>

      <P>The CEOs are under a different impression and we should tell them.  We cannot have two voices.  The Minister is the boss. The Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo; and these CEOs must be told that, and the sooner the better.  While on this question of fire hazards, a hospital would be a very dangerous place if there was a fire because so many people are immobile.  We could have a dreadful national tragedy in a hospital.  Many hospitals are real fire hazards and I say that without being too alarmist about it.  The Minister might get his <Col N="711" /> Department to compile a list of what hospitals are fire risks and find out what can be done to eliminate the risks.  If a tragedy occurred it would be too late to talk.  We must talk now. There are fire risks, serious fire risks, in many hospitals.  We must get a report and see what can be done about it.  Let the Minister say: &ldquo;We will provide the money for those hospitals. We will try to eliminate fire hazards.&rdquo;  This would be done overnight after a fire.  That is the tragedy of it.</P>

      <P>The Department could be usefully employed in looking into this problem.  Some hospitals have not got a sufficient number of nurses on duty at night.  I am not having a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at the Minister.  It is a matter of lives being at stake.  This is serious. The Minister would have to take the rap if anything went wrong.  He might not know about it because the Department might not have told him about it. So the Minister must not take the rap. Let them get the information and see what can be done.  The Minister should tell them to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of nurses' training was mentioned by rural Deputies.  Listening to them makes me realise that what I suggested to the Minister two years ago should be brought into effect.  Many girls in the country want to take up nursing as a career.  They write to almost every hospital.  They are called for interview.  They might go to one hospital in Dublin on Thursday and come back the following Monday to another hospital.  I suggested that a simple way out of this was for An Bord Altranais to set up an interview board comprised of the matrons of different hospitals and that a questionnaire be sent to the applicants.  The applicants <Col N="712" /> could state in order of their choice, the particular hospitals that they wanted to join.  Having regard to their eligibility and suitability for the profession, An Bord Altranais could then recommend them to a hospital, or assign them to a hospital.  It is very simple to centralise this whole question of allocating or assigning nurses to different hospitals.  It should not be difficult.</P>
    <P>If An Bord Altranais tell the Minister it is difficult he is worse to take that from them.  It is a simple thing. It would simplify life for these girls who are frustrated at having to try so many different hospitals and having to write to each one individually.  It is so stupid when we could centralise it at the drop of a hat.  This could be the national interview board for all hospitals run by Bord Altranais.  Rural Deputies ask me if I can do anything about Dublin hospitals.  This is not fair to the girls.  We should all press to have this done.  Two years ago I asked for it and it has not been done yet.  It should be done.  I hope that by this summer we will hear that it has been implemented.  The Minister should not take that sort of nonsense from An Bord Altranais if they try to put obstacles in his way.</P>
    <P>No matter what Minister is in office my approach is the same.  I must confess that I made life impossible for the late Mr. Childers but it is the only way to get something done.  My abrasive approach may not be the most acceptable but at least it gets across what I have in mind.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about the question of medical cards.  We succeeded in getting the previous Minister to establish a national system of guidelines of eligibility.  I cannot for the life of me see why the Department cannot issue a directive to health boards to make a list of these guidelines available to the public.  It would save a lot of money, because people who could look at this, who know their income, know they are outside the limit, would not apply.  Each application must cost a bit of money, because officials must assess it.  In the Eastern Health Board alone, the officials are not able to cope.  People are told that they did not make application and many <Col N="713" /> applications are being mislaid.  These guidelines should be made available to the public, through information centres, public libraries and so on, and every application should be acknowledged with a copy of a guideline.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to me during the Estimate debate in November last was that the public representatives know.  That is a very poor answer.  The public should know&mdash;not the public representatives. Why can we not?  I have a motion down for next week's meeting of our health board to ask that these be made available to the public.  I do not think it is good enough for one health board.  I would hope to get support for it and I would like to see a directive from the Department of Health, again as the body responsible for the health services, to all the health boards to make these available, because they are uniform now.  We should not be trying to hide the fact that certain people might be entitled to the health services, might be entitled to the medical cards, we should make them available.  It would serve a great purpose and would save a lot of money for health boards.</P>
    <P>The other big problem with the Department is the over-visiting of patients by doctors under the medical card scheme.  This is a problem that needs looking at.  Patients do not know the system; they do not know how it operates or that the doctor gets paid each time or that they can only have a certain number of visits in a year on average.  There is therefore a situation where the public are not informed. If they have a medical card, they feel entitled to visit the doctors they like and they will do so.  It is not pure &ldquo;cussedness&rdquo; on their part that they want to do it.  They feel that it is a service and they should avail of it.  If the doctor says to a patient: &ldquo;Sorry, you cannot visit me&mdash;you had better change your doctor&rdquo;, he goes to another doctor and the whole thing becomes a vicious circle.</P>
    <P>Would it not seem again that the Department of Health should take the initiative?  The word &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; is not very popular in the Department, but would they not take the initiative <Col N="714" /> and start a type of an education process by way of ordinary discussion programmes on television and radio, telling them what the cost of this service is, how patients need not go to a doctor so many times, how they are better off not going to a doctor in many cases, and to leave the place there for those who must go to a doctor.  This would be a good idea and would seem a logical approach to it.  The doctors would not become involved in having to tell the patients they cannot visit them.  There is concern about many dedicated doctors who feel, that for social reasons they should visit the old patients on their lists because these patients wish to be reassured.  That is a costly business. again for the State.  We must consider other ways to stop it.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we should start an education programme telling the people about the cost of this service.  It is costing every working person in the State £180 a year for the health service: that is something that is not known.  That is a lot of money and that has never been spelled out.  We must therefore talk to the people about it, about the utilisation of this service.  If we do so, we will reduce enormously the cost of this service.  We should tackle it and get moving on it quickly</P>
    <P>The question of drugs arises and again we should start the education process.  Why not start with women's clubs throughout the country?  The Department's inspectors could visit them to give general talks on drugs and their adverse effects and that they need not be used.  This should be part of an ongoing programme of the Department to change the whole picture about health.</P>
    <P>With regard to eligibility for medical cards, it is not good enough that it should be left to a junior official to make a decision as to whether or not a person is eligible.  It is a dangerous thing.  The Minister constantly says in replies in the House that the CEO has power in special hardship cases.  I know that that power is not being exercised in the Eastern Health Board area.  It is a cut and dried issue.  There is no grey area: it is a black and white <Col N="715" /> issue&mdash;one is either eligible or not. There are many grey areas, where people have unnecessary expenses. These are not spelled out enough on these application forms, and a junior official makes a decision.  I say &ldquo;junior&rdquo; knowing that a CEO with a committee should make the decision. There should be a committee set up in the health board to consider that.  It should include a doctor working in the board, or an independent doctor who would examine these borderline cases and make decisions.  This is the way it should operate&mdash;a committee should do it, not an individual.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Department of Health examining these suggestions for reform and innovation and doing something about them.</P>
    <P>I know that the Fianna Fáil Party are committed to the concept of regionalisation of the health service with the health boards.  When the Minister came into office and found this a <i>fait accompli</i>, he said &ldquo;How does one unscramble the scrambled egg?&rdquo; He was right, but I say: &ldquo;Discard it, and put another egg on the pan&rdquo;. They are not operating properly. There are numerous complaints and criticisms by people who are involved in the operation of health services and by public representatives, who find them ponderous bodies with unnecessary duplication of services.  They have become very much removed from the public and the old system of the local health authorities was much more efficient. All that these big ponderous health boards are doing is providing extra jobs for certain people, but certainly not streamlining the service.</P>
    <P>If the Minister doubts what I am saying, let him have a study into the cost benefit analysis of the health boards <i>vis-à-vis</i> the health authorities. If he does that, I shall be convinced. It is the only way.  The present way is operating with public representatives having little or no say on them.  Policy is not determined by the public representatives. If anyone examines the present representation on these boards, it will be seen that it is not quite what it should be, and is in fact far from it. <Col N="716" /> I have asked&mdash;and I think it is necessary, though I believe the Southern Health Board have such a situation&mdash; that the health board splits up into functioning committees.  We, in the corporation split into committees and have this power and are able to get changes and to get policy implemented. On the health boards, one cannot.  It does not operate properly and as a public representative one is a mere rubber stamp.  Bureaucracy organises, manages and dictates the policy of these boards.  I will not tolerate it: I will not accept it and I shall constantly campaign against it until we get a proper structure.  They do need to be restructured and the sooner the better in the interests of the health services. The concept might have been good but the operation is not.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a recommendation came from the seminar in Waterford that the hospital boards be abolished, because they were serving no purpose. The Minister should look carefully at the powers being conferred on Comhairle na nOspidéal because it has unlimited powers, dictatorial powers and powers greater than those of the Minister.  That might be all right but if there is a board to decide for the country; having it too Dublin-orientated is dangerous.  It is not good.  The Fitzgerald report was prepared by a group of people who were Dublin-oriented and did not understand the problems of rural areas.</P>
    <P>Decisions may be made in Dublin which are at variance with feelings, views and problems in rural areas. The Minister must set up an appeals body against decisions of Comhairle na nOspidéal.  This is the only way he can get it working so that people will have some confidence in this body. They have too much power and no body like this should have powers greater than those of the Minister. The Minister would be well advised to look at this.</P>
    <P>Dental services is an area I know the Minister feels strongly about but he feels almost impotent to deal with the problem.  In 1969 a report was prepared by Professor Kaim-Caudle on dental services in Ireland and if ever there was an indictment of a <Col N="717" /> service it was contained in that report. I should like to read some passages from it:</P>
    <P>All children attending national schools are entitled to free dental services.  These are provided mainly by public dental officers and are of a fairly rudimentary nature.  Fillings of deciduous teeth are rare, one filling per 10 extractions.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is appalling, it is disgraceful. In the case of adults, those who are eligible in the social welfare benefit class, he says that these are of a most rudimentary kind.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Even for expectant and nursing mothers in this group the service was minimal.</P>
    <P>That is a terrible indictment.  Six years ago that was published and the service has not improved since.  In fact, having regard to the expenditure in other areas this has deteriorated.  We have got to look earnestly at this and see what we can do about it.  I suggest to the Minister that he look into the costing of a proper service.  The public would not be adverse to paying for a proper service.  We have got to look at this in conjunction with the health services.  We should cost a proper national health service, talk about it and have discussions with the public. The public would be prepared to pay if we had a proper service introduced.</P>
    <P>We have got to talk about this urgently.  We cannot forget about it, hide our heads in the sand and say, it is there and we are doing the best we can.  That is not good enough in this age.  We have got to talk to the Irish Dental Association and say to them: &ldquo;We are going to change it whether you like it or not because we have to account to the public, not vested interests in any particular area; the public are suffering.&rdquo;  We have got to provide the best service we can.  The dental association have to be prepared to permit the training, recruitment and employment of dental therapists, those who would deal with fillings and periodontal disease&mdash;problems of that kind.  We have got to get these.  It is a costly service, but it need not be that costly.  We can produce a first-class <Col N="718" /> service with these dental auxiliaries and dental therapists as is happening in New Zealand and as has been recommended by the World Health Organisation and the International Dental Association.  Those two powerful bodies are in favour of this.</P>
    <P>The Irish Dental Association would not be averse once they are assured that their status would not be endangered and they would be more than happy.  These talks should be initiated as soon as possible to see what we can do and to introduce a training programme for these dental therapists who could be brought into the service quickly and improve it.  The present services are appalling and we should not be allowed leave them as they are. The Minister must have the power to make regulations regarding the qualifications of these people and no one else.  The Minister must exercise this power.</P>
    <P>Similar problems would arise in the psychiatric service.  The top personnel in the psychiatric nursing service must not be employed in doing work not befitting them and this is the way we should be talking about it.  In an age when we were not so enlightened we had so many people committed to our mental hospitals but that is all over now.  We now see the error of our ways but we have inherited a problem and that is as a result of the institutionalisation which occurred of our mental patients.  We, the doctors, are to blame; we are the culprits; we have institutionalised these people in our ignorance.  We have these people institutionalised and we cannot close down these places and throw these people on the scrap heap because we have this revolving door syndrome; they go back in again or end up in prison.</P>
    <P>It is important to discuss this.  Three suicides occurred among people who were psychiatrically deranged and found themselves in prison, people who may have come out of institutions who should not have.  The Minister for Health is responsible for ensuring that these people&mdash;a report has been produced that up to one-third of the people admitted to prisons are psychiatrically abnormal&mdash;get psychiatric help and we should be aiming to <Col N="719" /> give it to them.  These deaths might not have happened if we had a proper psychiatric service in our prisons.  We should be aiming to do this.  A psychiatric service is needed.  It should have been provided but it is not being provided and I do not care if the Minister for Justice says it is tomorrow.  I will say he is wrong; it is not being provided. If we get such a high proportion of our prisoners who are psychiatrically abnormal, deranged, or with psychiatric disorder we must aim to help them.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough that we, as public representatives, are not allowed to visit our prisons to see what is happening.  We should be allowed. We vote the moneys for the prisons. There should be a parliamentary committee to visit the prisons regularly to see what is happening.  I should like the Minister for Health to see that it comes within the ambit of his responsibility.  These people in prison who need psychiatric treatment should have it.  It is not good enough to give this treatment to an occasional person.  We will have further suicides and this is what we should be aiming to prevent.</P>
    <P>On the question of mentally handicapped, I know great progress has been made and the Minister can say the situation was worse before he came into office.  It was worse but the situation is still far from satisfactory. As public representatives, we often meet people who have the burden of mentally handicapped children in need of hospitalisation and residential care.  The waiting list is long.  I had a letter from the Minister this morning with reference to a letter sent two years ago when I was promised that a patient would get a place soon.  Two years later we are still awaiting a place.  I know we cannot work miracles overnight but this is where we may be misusing funds, not channelling them into where they are badly needed.  This is what is wrong with our health services.  It might be said with justification that the pressure groups get things done in the health services, as they do in other areas.  As the Minister pointed <Col N="720" /> out, the people who are not vocal about their complaints are frequently neglected, and this applies particularly to the case of health.  We should divert funds so that people can get their rightful dues.</P>
    <P>The question of the cost of the health services arises.  There will be advanced technological and surgical techniques and we will find that people who have been bed-fast for long periods may be rendered ambulatory and mobile within a few days with sophisticated modern operations. The question arises: can we afford to provide these services?  I do not know how we are going to solve it.  We will have to work out whether we should spend £1,000 on a kidney machine at the expense of somebody who needs a very important hip operation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps ten people need a hip operation where one person requires a kidney machine but the kidney machine is doing a vital job.  The demand on the services will be so great we will have to know what we are going to do.  This is the big problem and we are going to have to sit down and study it.  We will all have to take responsibility, not just the Minister for Health.  The public also will have to look at it.</P>
    <P>Do we spend £2,000 on a machine? Will we have to take into account the benefit to the community of a person of 60 years as opposed to a person of 80 years?  We will have to face serious ethical problems unless we are prepared to provide unlimited finance for the health service.  An orthopaedic surgeon mentioned to me the number of people who are awaiting orthopaedic operations.  Many of them could be rendered mobile and wonderful jobs could be done on them.  Are we prepared to pay for this?</P>
    <P>Many of the problems that will arise will not be just political problems.  We will all have responsibility in deciding.  We will have to examine what the services are worth to a patient and to the community before we decide to give a person a kidney machine or whether to take a person into hospital and give him a new hip joint.  There <Col N="721" /> will be big problems.  Are the public prepared to finance all this because techniques are becoming more and more advanced in kidney and heart operations?  Are we prepared to spend £10,000 on a special pacemaker for a patient?  Who will decide?  Will it be the surgical or medical profession or a committee who will say what is best for that patient?  If you are putting a sophisticated instrument into a persons body, will it make him so much more mobile and active that the expenditure is worthwhile or should the money be spent on another patient?  We will have to have an ethical committee to study these problems and to assess the priorities.</P>
    <P>An 80-year old man was taken into hospital to have a hip replacement operation but the operation did not go quite right.  He spent seven months in hospital at £120 a week.  Was this hip operation justified as the man was 80 years of age?  Was he going to become mobile in which case the operation would have been worthwhile?  As it happens he is worse.  No one man should have to make these vital decisions. There are several important things to be examined in a matter like this.  Who picks up the chits for this £120 in a hospital?  That man would probably have been better off without such an operation.  He is not going to run the mile in four minutes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health will have to consider such matters seriously.  He will have to decide in conjunction with a team, who makes the vital decision and what factors are taken into consideration. It should not be left to the surgeon, the technician.  Many factors will have to be considered&mdash;the man's home, his background, his employment, and aftercare.  This is a problem that will have to be faced more and more often and we will have to make decisions.</P>
    <P>We had a Bill before the House&mdash;I have almost forgotten the name of it&mdash; the Misuse of Drugs Bill.  I reported progress on it some months ago and I will be expected to resume when it appears again on the Order Paper. Even though I have amendments down I have forgotten the provisions of the Bill and what I said on it.  I wonder if <Col N="722" /> it will appear again or has it been decided that there is no misuse of drugs, there is no problem, the whole thing was in vain and that it is wrong that it should ever have been brought in?  I know that the Bill was not taken during the week when I was absent from the Dáil but that was a long time ago.  If we are serious about tackling the drug problem, we should discuss the Bill and put it through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It is not good enough to say a Bill is before the House unless we do something about it.  I had hoped we could have the Committee Stage before the recess and I would ask the Minister to see if anything can be done about this.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies spoke about drugs, smoking, alcohol and advertising.  I have a few words to say on alcoholism. Rightly we look upon this as a disease but we cannot allow alcoholics to destroy and kill themselves. It is not enough to feel sorry for them.  They can be helped to pull themselves out of it; we cannot just let them kill themselves.  We may reach the stage where there will be compulsory detention in hospital and I think this is the way we will have to do it.  We will have to provide hospitalisation but if they refuse treatment there will have to be compulsory treatment.  I would be prepared to adopt a very rigid line on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of alcoholism.  Many people have the will-power to make their minds up about curing themselves. We should not adopt such a lenient attitude towards them that will make them helpless.  We should encourage them; we should exercise certain restraints and these restraints will have to be set out so that we can look at this problem seriously.  I think alcoholics are getting too much sympathy which convinces them they can never do anything for themselves. They feel there will always be someone to be sorry for them and that they cannot help themselves.  This does not assist them and restraints have to be imposed on them.  We could deprive them of certain benefits and certain rights if they are not prepared to conform.  This attitude is <Col N="723" /> at variance with the general attitude but it must be admitted that the general attitude has not exactly succeeded in overcoming the problem. We should be prepared to look for more positive methods of solving the problem.  It is easy for us to say: &ldquo;Take all the ads off television&rdquo; but, when it comes to paying the licence fee, we all throw up our hands in horror and say &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  I realise that the public, when they are screaming for the ads to be taken off, must be told what the cost to them will be.  If they are prepared to pay the ads can be taken off.  We should spell this out to them.</P>
    <P>My last point is in relation to the opthalmic services.  The Eye and Ear Hospital is not able to cope with the situation.  It is badly in need of extension.  It is not good enough that people should have to wait six months for an appointment.  People who are paying for an ophthalmic service in their social welfare benefits should get it.  The service has been ignored for too long.  We must take all the necessary steps to improve it.</P>
    <P>I hope the points raised, and there have been some very constructive points, will be examined, analysed and assessed by the Minister and that he will put his Department to work on how best the suggested improvements could be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said, and I quote:</P>
      <P>There will be no cut-backs, either in services or in expenditure in real terms in relation to last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister is sincere in that statement and he must either intend, later in the year, to ask for a substantial amount of money for works that are being turned down at present or he is unaware of what has been said by his officials because anyone in contact with health boards or health affairs can say that this statement is simply not true.  The plain fact is there is a massive cut-back, and there has been no serious attempt, even by officials, to disguise that fact.  There <Col N="724" /> are, of course, many ways of cutting back, and the Minister and his officials know, one way would be the failure to make appointments or the failure to approve appointments.  With large health boards that would be considerable cut-back.</P>
    <P>With so many old buildings, coupled with poor and inadequate services, a constant programme for up-grading institutions is essential.  It just cannot be said that normal maintenance will be done and they will hold their own. That is a false approach.  You either move forward or slide back.  I am not blaming the health boards; they are the victims of circumstance.  I noticed in statistical information supplied that one health board was docked by £2,500,000.  Recently the Minister advised the North Eastern Health Board that the welfare home schedule for Monaghan town cannot proceed. Does the Minister realise how desperately needed this home is?  I would like to hear him convince my constituents in Monaghan that this was not a cut-back. I was not at the meeting of the health advisory committee last week but I had a letter to the effect that the Department of Health have shelved plans for the welfare home in Monaghan town because of shortage of funds.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>The Committee have instructed me to write to you asking you to bring pressure to bear on the Minister to persuade him to make the funds available for this project.</P>
    <P>That will give an idea of the thinking of those people with regard to the shelving of plans for a welfare home. It was to be a 40-bed welfare home and it was expected it would be erected this year.  It is very badly needed.  I tabled a question recently asking the Minister when it was expected approval would be given to proceed with the welfare home in the Monaghan area.  He said:</P>
    <P>In common with that of the other Health Boards, the provision of funds in 1975 for capital projects for the North-Eastern Health Board was reviewed some time ago in the light of the overall capital allocation <Col N="725" /> for hospitals, the amount required to provide for existing inescapable commitments and other relevant factors.  As a result the Board was informed that it would not be possible to allocate funds for the commencement of the welfare home at Monaghan during the current year.  The matter is being kept under continuous review and when further funds become available the question of proceeding with a welfare home for the Monaghan area will be considered after consultation with the Health Board as to its priorities.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister this is a priority of the health board.</P>
    <P>Regarding medical cards, the Minister told me a week or so ago that he was critical of the Fianna Fáil Party motion suggesing that the percentage of the population covered by medical cards be increased from 35 per cent to 60 per cent.  I was amazed that the Minister chided Fianna Fáil on having the temerity to introduce a motion like that without taking account of present circumstances. The Fianna Fáil Party steadily over the years improved the services provided for the people by facing up to the facts.  Increasing the percentage covered by medical cards, while it might not be as spectacular as free hospitalisation, would certainly remove a heavy burden some people in ill-health or with ill-health in the family have to bear.  It would not put a burden on the hospitals in the area.  There would be need, of course, to amend the guidelines announced earlier in the year.  It would have been interesting to hear from the Minister the extra number who would qualify for medical cards. With every increase in wages, there is an increase in the eligibility limit in the guidelines for medical card applicants.  There is one yardstick that could be used.  I refer to the county council road worker.  He and his wife have always been just outside the eligiblity limit for a medical card. Following the last increase in eligiblity, the people who then got medical cards were farmers.  This has <Col N="726" /> been mentioned by a number of speakers.  The system of assessing a farmer's means seems unfair; assessing the means of a small farmer is a problem if the poor-law valuation is not used.</P>
    <P>The experience I have had since the change in guidelines on the last occasion is that health boards are reverting more to the means test system. An assistance officer calls to the farmer, assesses his means and sends in a report to the administrative officer in the local board area.  It would take a person with very high qualifications to assess a small farmer's means especially if the farmer is not keeping farm accounts. It is nearly impossible to arrive at a definite means unless the farmer has kept accounts.  I have heard of instances this year where the incomes of farmers who were keeping accounts had dropped considerably from those in other years.  All in all there is no visible increase in the number of people in receipt of medical cards as a result of the last increase in the guidelines for eligibility limit.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of self-employed people.  In that instance they have to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for cover under the Health Act.  It is a problem to those working in small business because they have to make proper returns.  In a number of instances I came across the problem of single persons who were above the eligibility limit in the medical card application.  Some of these people find themselves maintaining either their parents at home or perhaps a widowed mother with a small number of children.  There should be some allowance paid in cases such as this.  I heard of one instance recently where a young girl, above the eligibility limit and unable to obtain a medical card had to maintain the household.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on a subject, to which other Deputies have referred, the case of home help.  I know that there are difficulties and not so many people willing to undertake this type of work.  It would be a great help if more realistic payment could <Col N="727" /> be made for this work.  There should be some simple training course for those employed as home helps.  Many people do not understand what is required of them as a home help, especially at present when there are various pieces of equipment such as bed lifts and other handling equipment that aged and disabled people use.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if he would consider setting up a pilot training scheme for home helps geared to make the job lighter and more pleasant. This should be coupled with a more realistic adjustment for this work.  In a country like ours, known for providing so many recruits to the nursing profession in other lands, it is strange that we cannot channel some part of this female work to provide jobs as home help.  It is a great opportunity for the Minister to take a look at this home help and prescribed relative allowance situation.  It is one way by which a lot of people could be kept out of hospitals and other institutions.  There is not a proper system devised to have both the home help and the prescribed relative allowance taken together.  The case needs to be tackled.  If it could be operated in an efficient way there would be fewer people admitted to the geriatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to make which has been mentioned by at least two other Deputies from my health board area today and that is the general hospitals in the Monaghan-Cavan area.  We had a deputation last year to the Minister and we made a case to him as to why we felt that Monaghan was an ideal situation for a general hospital.  With the cost of building programmes the Minister should have a decision made very quickly to have Monaghan as a centre again.</P>
    <P>The hospital there is giving a very worthwhile service but it has been existing under the threat of downgrading for a considerable period. One wonders how the morale of the staff has remained so high with such a threat hanging over them.  It is essential that this matter be cleared up as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> We have a large psychiatric hospital and a county hospital in close proximity to each other in Monaghan. It seems to be the ideal setting for a complete hospital service.  If it were backed up by a good community service the people would certainly be well served.  If it were efficiently run &mdash;there is no reason why it should not be&mdash;it should not be under the threat of being run down.  Its bed complement is: medical 62, surgical 68, maternity 20 and children under 16 years, 24.  That is a total of 174 beds.</P>
    <P>We have a psychiatric hospital, St. Davnets, and the figures for it are very interesting.  The number of patients in that hospital on the 31st December, 1966, was 714.  The number of patients on 31st December, 1974, was 582.  The number of patients over that eight-year period dropped by 132 patients or 18.5 per cent.  Half of the patients in St. Davnet's hospital at present fit into the geriatric category.  This is from medical men we have on the advisory health services.  It is not a layman's assessment.  They maintain that half of the patients fit into that category.  They could be better housed in an old people's home or alternatively in a geriatric hospital. The accommodation in those two buildings would provide an ideal set up for a general hospital.  It is well to note that the buildings forming St. Davnets have undergone a thorough and extensive reconstruction.  It was commenced in the early fifties and continued on into the sixties.  They are in excellent condition.  They are laid out in spacious grounds.  Even without the transfer of geriatric patients there is definitely more space becoming available each year at St. Davnets due to the shorter average period of hospitalisation and to the greater number of people being treated in out-patient clinics.  In recent years, in St. Davnets, they have had a new general kitchen and a new boilerhouse installed so it is very well equipped for use as a general hospital.</P>
    <P>There would not appear to be any insurmountable problems in having <Col N="729" /> surgical patients sent to the county hospital, as at present, and medical patients located in accommodation provided at St. Davnets.  The distance between the two places is only about a half mile, no greater than the spread of one of the large Dublin hospitals.  I recently visited the James Connolly Memorial Hospital and the distance between St. Davnets and the county hospital in Monaghan would not be any greater than the distance between different parts of that hospital.</P>
    <P>If geriatric patients were transferred from St. Davents and the beds made available to the county hospital we would have 450-470 hospital beds.  A hospital with that accommodation would be adequate for the Cavan-Monaghan area.  This could be accomplished without the massive expense of building a new general hospital.</P>
    <P>There are other considerations as well.  St. Davnets is a training hospital for psychiatric nurses and the facilities could be extended to cover general training, which would provide a supply of nurses with the qualifications required for general hospital work.  If St. Davnets were used in this way it would simplify the problem.</P>
    <P>A case has been made, by eminent people in the Department of Health, that the psychiatric service should be integrated with the other health services particularly the health boards, as far as possible so as to remove the stigma. We have over 300 geriatric patients in the psychiatric hospital in Monaghan and, if it is possible, the Minister could consider placing them in suitable private homes.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister to reconsider the case of a general hospital for Monaghan in view of the fact that the number of beds is being reduced daily.</P>
    <P>I noticed that there is to be no cut-back in the provision for the mentally handicapped.  I hope additional revenue will be made available for the mentally handicapped.  In most countries there are organisations which are doing very commendable and worthy work. These people devote much of their time to making life easier for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of dental treatment.  Many secondary schoolchildren <Col N="730" /> are outside the scope of the dental scheme.  From the time they leave the national school until they come within the scope either of insurability or medical cards at 18 years of age they are not entitled to treatment. I have had a number of complaints from secondary schoolchildren on this subject.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of the question of alcohol and the problems it causes.  The Department of Health are to be commended for the allocation of funds for alcoholic clinics.  An alcoholic clinic has been provided in St. Davnets.  When we talk about alcoholic units we must also remember the glamorising of drink on television. On the one hand, money is provided to build units for people to overcome their drinking problems and, on the other, there is the glamorising of drink on television.  While the revenue received from television advertisements is needed to provide a television service we must try to balance that need with the harm caused by glamorising drink.  This approach to drinking is a most serious offence.</P>
    <P>It has been said that many people do not know their entitlements under the Health Act, although there are information booklets available.  The public should be made better informed through advertisements in local papers.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the delay in treating orthopaedic patients in hospitals.  This is a serious problem in the area of the health board of which I am a member.  From the time the orthopaedic patient is first examined by the surgeon to the time he is admitted to hospital his condition has often deteriorated very much.  I would ask the Minister to try to increase the number of orthopaedic surgeons.  I know of one case where a person had to wait longer than 12 months before being admitted to hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy accept from me that it is not a problem of beds but of people to deal with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  Even though their salaries and conditions <Col N="731" /> are favourable surgeons do not seem to be available.  There have been a number of complaints about the scarcity of doctors in our area.</P>
      <P>There is very little a Minister can do to channel doctors into a particular area where the facilities for leisure hours might not be as attractive as in cities or large areas of population.  In areas where doctors are not interested in a certain post there should be some additional incentive for them to ensure that all areas will have good coverage and sufficient doctors operating in them.  Those are the few points I should like to make.</P>
      <P>We are very concerned with the siting of the general hospitals and I think there is sufficient statistical evidence regarding beds and the operation of the two hospitals to make a strong case for the Minister to review the situation and we hope that he will place it in an area where we think there is evidence it is most suitable for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his opening statement introducing the Estimate and the activities of his Department.  He spelled out very clearly what had been done in recent times, what is being done at the moment and what his aspirations are for the future development of the health services.  He points out clearly what the difficulties to be encountered are and he has established priorities. This is an excellent statement and I compliment the Minister on it.  I heard once again from Deputy Leonard the question of a cut-back on health services. If he had read this statement clearly, he would see that there is no justification for any such thought of cut-backs.  The increase in the non-capital expenditure on our health services from £169 million to a figure approaching £200 million should silence those prophets of doom who are forecasting a cut-back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What about inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later on.  I heard statements by <Col N="732" /> Members of the Opposition on the North Western Health Board in an effort to get the people to panic.  It was said that there would be a severe cut-back, that there was a chance of the health service collapsing.  That was probably wishful thinking.  While other countries throughout Western Europe are endeavouring to maintain the same standard as 1974, this Estimate shows that not alone will we hold the 1974 standard but we are also providing for further development and improvements in 1975 in spite of inflation mentioned by Deputy Haughey.  The Minister and the Government have accomplished something that the Opposition thought was impossible.  That was an increase in services and expenditure in real terms for the current year in spite of inflation and our economic difficulties. The fact that the Exchequer is meeting 90 per cent of the total expenditure involved shows the faith that the Minister and Government have in the future of this country.</P>
      <P>There are points I should like to bring before the Minister.  The first is one that I have not heard at all from the Opposition.  I am very glad, indeed, to note that the Minister and the Government are continuing to fulfil the pre-election promise to phase out the health charges on rates. It appears from the statement that the sorely pressed ratepayers will have £9 million less to pay in 1975 than they did in 1974 due to the transfer of this amount from rates to the Exchequer.  We may have started the development of our health services a bit late in the day as the Minister said but a tremendous amount of work has been accomplished in the last two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to come to what appears to be the Minister's top priority&mdash;and I compliment him on it &mdash;that dealing with the less-favoured section of our community&mdash;a section that was almost forgotten and completely neglected in the past.  I refer to the mentally handicapped.  In the present Estimate we find an expenditure of £38 million on current account and £2.9 million on the capital account.  This shows the concern of the <Col N="733" /> Minister for those less-favoured members of our society.</P>
    <P>Up to recent times we know the difficulty we had in getting mentally handicapped children placed in any suitable school.  I think every Deputy also knows the trials and tribulations of distracted mothers who found a mentally handicapped child in her home.  She did not know how to handle it.  Not alone that: she was afraid of the influence that the child would have on younger members of the family.  I knew many cases such as this.</P>
    <P>I remember about four years ago going to our geriatric hospital in Sligo and visiting the wards.  I went into a large room where there were about 30 to 40 adult male mental patients and in the centre of the room I discovered a little boy of about eight or nine years sitting on a chair.  I chatted to him.  He had almost normal intelligence but he found himself in the position that his mother had died, his father had to emigrate, he was an only child and no suitable home could be found for him anywhere in the country. He was thrown on the scrap heap of society and put into a mental home.</P>
    <P>I remember another day leaving St. Columba's Mental Hospital in Sligo and I met a father and mother with a little girl of about seven or eight years of age.  The mother's face was streaming blood where it had been torn by the nails of the little girl.  They had tried everywhere to get her into a suitable home and failed.  Deputies from the opposite benches and myself got on the phone to homes in Donegal and in Sligo and to homes outside the west of Ireland.  Nobody had a place for her.  Eventually she found herself on the scrap heap of society in Sligo Mental Hospital.  That was the case up to recently.  Tremendous strides forward are being made now.  In my county, by the end of this year, I think we will have accommodation for all mentally handicapped children not alone in the county but in the surrounding counties.  With the extension of Cregg House last year and the taking over of Cloonamahon Passionist Monastery this year we hope to be able, at least, to fulfil a much <Col N="734" /> needed want and credit must go to the Minister for Health for providing money for this development.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see in the Minister's statement that there will be a followup service.  I am delighted to see that AnCO are now training instructors for handicapped children.  This is a major step forward.  Our object should be to train mentally handicapped children so that they will be able to live as normal a life as possible.  If we do not do this, we are failing in our duty as public representatives. We are failing in our duty if we do not show those unfortunate people that we are their brethren.  They cannot organise for themselves, they cannot speak for themselves, so we must speak for them and do everything in our power to raise the level of service being provided for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to medical cards.  In my area I have not got many complaints.  The norm used there is quite fair.  I did not agree with Deputy O'Connell when he talked about advertising the yardstick or the guideline by which people are assessed for medical cards.  The North-Western Health Board publish the guidelines in all the local papers so people there have no complaints. Every local authority member, every county councillor, every Deputy is issued with copies of them also.  It would cover Deputy O'Connell's point if they were published in the local papers.</P>
    <P>I notice that 1,092,000 people or 35.2 per cent of the population have medical cards.  Since the easement of the means test we in our health board area have not many cribs.  It works pretty satisfactorily.  In Donegal just over 60 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards; in Leitrim 52 per cent; and in Sligo 48 per cent.  That is well above the average for the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the case where some people may not meet the guidelines or criteria laid down in the means test.  Due to heavy medical expenses, they find themselves in great hardship. <Col N="735" /> In those cases, the guidelines should be improved in order to eliminate hardship.  I have many cases in mind.  I have in mind a mother who has two retarded children.  She has to take one of them to Dublin every month to a clinic. She has to stay over a night or two in Dublin and she has to take the child home again.  Very heavy expense is involved.  They are just over the limit of the guidelines laid down.  Those cases should be examined completely and dealt with on their merits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In existing legislation there is a hardship clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there is a hardship clause.  I am saying that each case should be dealt with on its own merits and that the guidelines should be flexible.  I have very few complaints. I have no complaints about our officials.  They are some of the finest officials in the country.  But they stick to the guidelines.  In this particular case they issued a medical card to the child only.  They thought that fulfilled their obligation.  I think it should have gone beyond that.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer briefly to the dental service.  Throughout the country we find great difficulty in getting dentists to join our scheme.  The terms are not attractive enough and they find they are better off in private practice.  We certainly have a very big backlog in dental treatment in my part of the country and we have to give priority to home assistance cases, expectant mothers and TB cases.  Others have to wait a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in orthodontic treatment we have a very long list.  We find it impossible to get an orthodontist and consequently we have to send the children to a clinic in Dublin.  It appears that there are not that many of them in Dublin either and they only take so many a month or every two months.  We got one to visit Sligo once every two or three months.  This is totally unsatisfactory from the point of view of the backlog.  I do not know if the Minister can do anything about <Col N="736" /> it but I should like to bring it to his notice.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the voluntary bodies.  There are many of them in Sligo.  The parents and friends of the handicapped are doing a tremendous amount of work in Sligo town.  We have people operating meals on wheels, and we have the ICA.  Many of those voluntary bodies are doing a tremendous amount of work.  I should like to compliment them.</P>
    <P>I have yet to be convinced that the health boards are more satisfactory than the old system under county managers, taking into account the tremendous amount of money that is available to them.  I was the first chairman of the North-Western Health Board and I saw it developing from a baby into a monster.  I am wondering if the health boards are not approaching a stage similar to that of the semi-State bodies where the monster may get out of control. In this I am not referring to the membership or to officials&mdash;as I said, we have some of the best in Ireland &mdash;but to the system.  We have nothing but new appointments every month and there appears to be more staff now than is required.  There appear to be a lot of chiefs around compared with the number of Indians, and the Minister should have a hard look at the constitution of health boards to see if they are over-staffed. I am not in any way suggesting that the staff should be reduced but we might overcome it by stopping recruitment for a time.  Too much money is being spent on the administration in relation to the amount spent on the doctors and the people who look after the patients.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to think about the case of a retarded adult. The health board failed to get a suitable place for her, and it was through her friends and relations that a place was obtained for her in Donnybrook. When the question of payment arose, we discovered that the health board could not pay because it was not an approved hospital.  This is one of the little flaws in our regulations.  The North-Western Health Board recognised <Col N="737" /> her as eligible, and did their best to get a suitable place in an approved hospital but they could not do so.  I should like the Minister to see if anything could be done about it.  They said they had no legal right to pay because it was not an approved hospital.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to compliment the Minister on the excellent work he is doing and I hope he will continue to keep it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going into the Estimate in any great detail, I should like to make a few general remarks in relation to this very important Ministry.  The Minister for Health at present has a tremendous responsibility.  When one looks at his Department and looks at society today and the field that has to be covered, one wonders if health is the actual title this Ministry should have.  It is true that the Department covers practically every aspect of life, from birth to the grave.  In those modern times and in the changed society, we have, in this Ministry, possibly one of the most important Departments of Government.  Possibly the Minister realises this in having taken over this Ministry but having the added responsibility of being Deputy Leader of the Government restricts the enthusiasm that a person in his position can put into this office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's standards of living are completely different from what they were years ago.  Rural and urban communities change from day to day.  I am old enough to remember things like the first radio coming into my village.  The people who were reared in my community at that time were industrious in every way; they were self-sufficient. The youth played games for hours on end and at this time of the year one would find them roaming the fields looking for birds' nests, or climbing mountains or going to the sea.  We had a healthy youth then, both physically and mentally.  Unfortunately, we find today that television, the little box in the corner, seems to govern the way of life for everybody.  On a Sunday afternoon, for instance, one finds the youth inclined to stay in and <Col N="738" /> watch television, irrespective of what type of programme is on.  They no longer take the same interest in athletics and so on.  One can honestly say that the scooter and the motor car and the lounge bar have taken over, even in rural communities.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to prevention of illness as one aspect of the health services which he intends to concentrate on.  In this field the Minister has collective responsibility with the Minister for Education and the Minister for Local Government to look at this aspect of life and to try to get our youth to make better use of their leisure time, and in this way build up a healthy society.  The new curriculum in national schools can be of great benefit in this respect, and the Minister for Education can do a great deal by having programmes on health education introduced in our schools.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this it is necessary for the Minister for Local Government to ensure that sufficient amenities are available so that the youth can engage in healthy outdoor exercises. In this respect there is a great deal to be done and the Minister for Health as deputy leader of the Government is in a strong position to ensure that something worthwhile and positive is done in this field.</P>
    <P>When mentioning education and the new curriculum we have a greater concentration on matters like art, painting, crafts and while the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may not agree that this is entirely relevant I believe that in the prevention of illness this plays a significant part.  It is something we must concentrate on.  The first step has to be taken here and the guidelines have to be set for the youth. If one takes athletics, for instance, we have very little coaching or training in athletics at any level of education. We have the traditional games of hurling and football which are very good and provide good exercise for our youth, but proper coaching in athletics should be undertaken.  We should also consider swimming.  These are all necessary and will have to be <Col N="739" /> concentrated on in order to have a good healthy society.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that we are constantly casting aside the things that are worthwhile in life.  We seem to be constantly aping sick societies.  We are satisfied with anything the Americans or the British give us.  It is terrible that we have to sicken our youth with the horrible, disgusting Hollywood films which we show constantly.  We cannot expect to have a healthy society physically or mentally when we have to put up with this. The Minister has a responsibility in this regard and he should use his influence to see that our youth as far as possible get nothing but the best. Pornography is taking over in a big way.  Drugs have also been mentioned.</P>
    <P>This is not confined entirely to the urban areas.  When one is talking about drugs and matters of that kind one is inclined to think of Dublin or the bigger built-up areas but the Minister would be surprised to discover that in remote rural areas one finds all kinds of influences working which are to the detriment of our youth and certainly to a healthy society.  The Minister cannot stand alone in this.  He has to have the co-operation of his colleagues in the Cabinet in order to ensure that there is a change in present attitudes in relation to many of these matters.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of the health services with which I am familiar is the school service.  We have seen very little improvement in the school services down through the years.  The facilities available to doctors and nurses from the public health authority visiting schools are very limited. They do not find it easy to carry out an effective job.  The calls from the county medical officer, and his staff, should be more regular.  In the case of young children they should come to the schools more often to carry out proper examinations.</P>
    <P>I had a case recently of a young boy who was thought to be a slow learner. He had reached the age of 10 before it was discovered that his hearing was defective.  His problem was that he was <Col N="740" /> not able to follow the teacher and, as a result, was falling behind and was not able to keep pace with his classmates. I am making that point to emphasise how important the school medical services can be for children. Many speakers have referred to dental services.  They are appalling.  Young children have to wait a long time to have dental services provided for them. It is possible that in remote areas it is not easy to get the services of dentists, but that is no excuse.  Some provision should be made for youngsters so that it would be possible for them to have treatment with, possibly, the family dentist.  The fees should be covered in some way by the health boards.</P>
    <P>There was a system at one time where dentists in private practice were empowered to give their service for a few hours occasionally to assist in matters of this kind.  The Minister should have a look at areas where these services are lacking to ensure that the children are not entirely neglected.</P>
    <P>The setting up of health centres in the more remote areas is necessary. To illustrate my point I will give an example.  A neighbour of mine got a serious heart attack.  The doctor sent for an ambulance but the man died about five or ten minutes before the ambulance arrived.  It was the opinion of the doctor that if he had oxygen the man's life could have been saved. In remote areas if a centre were provided where a dispensary doctor could be of help in matters of this kind many lives could be saved.</P>
    <P>I had a question down to the Minister in relation to the provision of an extra unit for a small hospital in Belmullet.  It may not be the practice of the Department of Health or the health boards to provide units of this type in small hospitals, but there is a lot of hardship imposed on people who have to travel long distances, say 40 miles to Ballina or 60 miles to Castlebar.  It would be much more satisfactory if this type of unit were provided in the hospital.  The usual practice for transporting patients to these hospitals is by minibus or van which starts at one point and may <Col N="741" /> travel a circuit of 100 miles before arriving at its destination.  The same procedure applies to the return journey.  This is hardly a suitable or a practical way of transporting people who want to avail of these services.</P>
    <P>The health boards would be well advised to consider the possibility of providing cottage hospitals in the more remote areas.  It might cost a good deal of money but one cannot always look at the provision of hospitals in terms of population.  We are too prone to having civil servants or planners deciding on the type of hospital to be erected in terms of population.  Physical features and so on should be taken into account.  In the long run little units of this kind would help tremendously in providing a great service for the community.</P>
    <P>The welfare homes are very welcome and very much appreciated.  In my county three of them are operating. The only objection I have to them is the use of the word &ldquo;home&rdquo;. In Castlebar we have a very fine hospital.  It was the old county home which was converted and it is now called the Sacred Heart Home.  I think there is a stigma attached to the word &ldquo;home&rdquo;.  An Irish name such as &ldquo;Lios&rdquo; and possibly a saint's name could be used with it, such as &ldquo;Lios Eanna&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lios Breandain&rdquo;, and this would get away from the stigma which is attached to the word &ldquo;home&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister and his officials would take a look at this.</P>
    <P>We are all very grateful for the tremendous advance which has taken place in the psychiatric services in the last five or six years.  We are very proud of the opening of a new admission unit at Castlebar.  The service being provided there for people in need of psychiatric treatment is first class and the doctors and staff and everybody connected with it deserve the highest praise.  We are moving away from the old asylum attitude&mdash;the stigma that was attached to the unfortunate people who suffered from mental illnesses.  The extension of the social work which is provided for people who have to spend a period in psychiatric hospitals also deserves to be commended.  These people are now <Col N="742" /> called on regularly by a social worker and it is marvellous to see the encouragement they get from a visit from a social worker.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of the health services which are highly commendable. Among them are the meals on wheels and the care of the mentally handicapped.  Very often we do not seem to appreciate the great work that these voluntary organisations do in helping the mentally handicapped and the retarded.  In Mayo we have been very lucky in having a number of dedicated people who have done tremendous work in fund raising and in trying to improve these services generally.</P>
    <P>The question of the regional boards was raised by Deputy Gilhawley.  I agree to a certain extent with his views.  I believe he always consulted his health committees set up under the county council; these were more personal.  I am not at all convinced that the health boards will do the job they were set up to do.  I hope I will be proved wrong in this.  There are many aspects of the regional boards which have still to be looked into, such as the provision of various essential services within each region, specialist services and so on.  When we have all these services working properly we may then be able to have a more balanced look at the health boards.  Like Deputy Gilhawley, I am not at all convinced that they are providing a better service or doing any better than the consultative health committees.</P>
    <P>While on the question of hospitals, I should like to ask the Minister to tell us what the plans are in relation to Castlebar hospital.  We have been waiting patiently for the last few years to have a declaration from the Minister and the Department of Health following the recommendations of the Fitzgerald Committee. We understand Castlebar was selected as a training hospital and we were to have 90 to 100 additional beds provided but, at the moment, this proposal seems to be very much in the air.  I would urge the Minister to give us a fairly quick decision.  We have been waiting for quite a long time. We think the accommodation is very <Col N="743" /> necessary in Mayo as we are finding it hard to get specialists for the clinics and so on.  If we had the type of hospital recommended, that would improve the services immensely.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of training nurses.  We have a great tradition in this respect.  Many girls take up nursing and it would be a great asset if they could do their training in their own local hospital.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a very serious problem which has now arisen for girls who are anxious to take up nursing as a career.  I get very many representations from young girls who go for interview for hospital training courses and who find it impossible subsequently to get places on these courses.  This situation has arisen mainly because married nurses are allowed to continue working.  While I am not against that decision&mdash;women should be allowed to continue in their careers as nurses if they wish to do so &mdash;the Minister will have to take a very serious look at this problem.  We will be adding to the emigration figures if our girls have to go to Britain for training.  Working outside their own country, they may find themselves expected to perform work that is against their religion and against their consciences, such as assisting doctors at abortions, and so on.  One solution would be to have an earlier retiring age for married nurses.  This might provide the avenues necessary for the girls anxious to train as nurses.  This is a very serious problem and one which will have to be looked at fairly soon.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the provision of services&mdash;orthopaedic services and so on&mdash;people have to wait a long time for appointments and for admission to hospital.  In the western region, particularly in Mayo, we always seem to have a long list of people waiting for surgical operations.  There was one well-known Deputy&mdash;he represented my constituency&mdash;who said that a patient received a call to hospital for an operation six months after he had died.  That is literally true.  A great deal of planning will be necessary to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="744" /> Home help is a good idea.  It is very necessary in a community such as ours because we have a high percentage of old people.  It also creates problems, of course, because people tend to think they are eligible for home help just because they reach a certain age, even though their families are caring for them.  As public representatives, we receive a great deal of correspondence on this matter.  While I am in full agreement with home help in cases where it is necessary, we should have clearer guidelines as to who is and who is not eligible.  Very often it is the district nurse who makes the assessment and the situation varies from one area to another depending on the particular nurse.  Sometimes one nurse may be inclined to be sympathetic while another may adopt a more rigid attitude.  This can create many problems for public representatives.  People say: &ldquo;So-and-so is getting help; why cannot So-an-so get it also?&rdquo;.  It is necessary to have firm guidelines and the Minister should let people know exactly who is and who is not entitled to home help.</P>
    <P>In relation to medical cards I think the limits are not at all adequate.  A single person earning over £14 is not eligible for a card.  That figure is not a realistic one in this day and age.  The people who find it hardest to meet their commitments are people who are on a fixed wage&mdash;young married people living in towns earning £32 or £33 a week as factory workers, who are trying to clear off a debt on a house or in some instances paying a high rent for a flat.  These people find themselves just that few pounds beyond the limit.  They are very worried.  It is very often a source of worry to young married mothers when they cannot get a medical card.  They are worried about going into hospitals and incurring bills which they have to pay to chemists, which can be quite substantial today. These people, who are on a limited income, should get every consideration when it comes to deciding who is and who is not eligible for a medical card.</P>
    <P>I have covered most of the points I wanted to make in relation to this Estimate.  I hope the Minister will be able to keep to his word in the coming <Col N="745" /> year and ensure that the health boards will get all the funds necessary for them in order to carry out the various services to the community.</P>
    <P>As was stated at the seminar, and mentioned by the Minister, I believe that money alone is not the answer to the problem.  We can, by going into the communities and trying to revive a great deal of the spirit of the past, get a greater awareness of what is necessary in life and what looking after our neighbour means and so on. In every way possible this line of thought and action should be encouraged. The health of the people is important.  We must have a healthy society.  As far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we will cooperate in every way with the Minister to ensure that the people get the best possible services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to preface my remarks by complimenting the Tánaiste and Minister for Health on his very fine brief.  I want to thank him especially for putting at our disposal such a wealth of statistical information, which he has also given with his brief.</P>
      <P>One cannot but notice, reading through his Estimate speech, his willingness to meet people who are directly involved with health.  The very fact that he attended the Waterford seminar, held last week-end ranging over three days, and the fact that he had various discussions with those directly involved in health is adequate proof of his determination to make a success of this very important portfolio. I am assured also from reading his Estimate speech that he will attempt to make sure that every single pound in the £208 million devoted to his Department will be spent most efficiently and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note, coming from a rural constituency, that he is continuing to transfer the health charges off the rates.  This year £9 million has been further removed from the local rates and given over to the central fund.  It is also assuring to note that, despite our temporary economic difficulties, there will be no cut-backs in <Col N="746" /> either services or expenditure in real terms.</P>
    <P>I want to be parochial for a few moments, before discussing the Estimate more generally.  I should like to remind the Minister that in Tipperary town we are still awaiting the building of the new maternity wing to St. Vincent's District Hospital. It was promised some time prior to the Minister taking over his portfolio but to date no progress has been reported in this regard.  I urge him to give it as much attention as he possibly can.  We have a site available and there will be no difficulty with planning permission.  The people are eagerly awaiting the building of this much needed amenity.  A welfare home has been designated for Tipperary town also.  The site is available and planning permission has been granted and everything is ready to roll, so I hope that the Minister's Department will set about building this facility in Tipperary town as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in Clonmel the welfare home has run into rather stormy weather.  To-night there is a meeting in Clonmel, to which I am invited together with the other Oireachtas Members, called by the Clonmel Corporation.  The express purpose of this meeting is to try to impress on the Minister for Health the need to alter his decision and to agree to site the Clonmel welfare home in Morton Street rather than the alternative site at Gallows Hill.  I know the Minister is in a dilemma on this point because early in 1974 the South Eastern Health Board made a proposal to his Department to build a welfare home at Morton Street. Subsequent to this another site was available at Gallows Hill.  This site was purchased by Clonmel Corporation and they indicated to his Department that they were prepared to grant him a site for the building of this welfare home.</P>
    <P>From then on the dispute arose locally as to which of the two sites was the better.  The Minister, advised by his medical, architectural and administrative officers, opted for <Col N="747" /> the Gallows Hill site, but the local people opted for the Morton Street site.  There the position lies at this moment.  The Minister would want the wisdom of Solomon to solve this dilemma.  I, as an independent interested spectator, urge that some agreement be reached, rather than delay much further the building of this very vital welfare home, taking into account rising costs.  I hope that an agreed site is decided on and that the welfare home is erected forthwith.</P>
    <P>In Cashel, too, we have our problems. Last Sunday in Cashel there was a public rally in support of Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.  Details of this were in the public press and on television. I am told that there are programmes to follow, outlining it on both radio and television during the coming week.  This latter issue arose over an article that appeared in the <i>Irish Medical Times.</i> In that article, ironically enough, neither Cashel nor Clonmel nor south Tipperary was mentioned.  The local hospital committee thinking that this article had more authority than it actually had immediately thought that Our Lady's Hospital was being by-passed.  They mustered all their forces and had this supporting rally in favour of Our Lady's Hospital held last Sunday.</P>
    <P>I, together with other Members of the Oireachtas, attended and I could not but be impressed by the huge turn-out of people together with clergy of all denominations and the nursing staff, both religious and lay, of this hospital.  I assured them, rightly or wrongly, that this Coalition Government had no intention of reducing the facilities at Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel and that rather than further reduce the hospital facilities in south Tipperary we were going to build another hospital there, the location of which, I think, lies between Cashel and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister, at his earliest possible opportunity, to make a definitive statement on this and so allay any doubts, suspicions or misunderstandings in the people's minds <Col N="748" /> about the future of Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel.</P>
    <P>Referring more generally to the Estimate, the Minister's free hospital care to all is highly commendable and desirable.  However, I think at this time it is slightly too ambitious. Rather than go for free hospital care for all, he should take it in steps.  This he could do by including people who are presently excluded from any eligibility and any free services under the health insurance.  I speak particularly about members of the farming community who are outside the Health Insurance (Contribution) Act having valuation of over £60 or those who are self-employed having an income over £1,600.  I would like if the people who are presently cut off from any eligibility could be introduced gradually into the scheme.</P>
    <P>At this point there is not a great demand by those people to get free hospital care.  I think they would be quite prepared to pay some contribution. Reading through the Estimates I noticed that £8.5 million was contributed in health contributions.  I have no doubt that a similar figure or perhaps even a greater figure would also be contributed by farmers and self-employed people who are at present excluded from any benefits.</P>
    <P>Quite a lot of discussion has taken place on medical cards so I will not detain the House too long on this.  At present the eligibility of an applicant is based on his gross income.  I would like it based on his net income because that is what materially affects a bread winner&mdash;the amount of money he actually gets in his weekly pay packet. The gross figure naturally excludes quite a lot of people because it does not take account of his income tax, social welfare, insurance stamps or donations.  I hope the Minister will in future assess an applicant's eligibility on his net income rather than his gross income.</P>
    <P>A little more flexibility could be allowed in the case of the middle income group.  I know, as well as every other Deputy knows, that there are anomalies and hard luck cases.  You have to have an upper limit and no <Col N="749" /> matter what limit you put there will always be an applicant marginally above that limit.  I know there is a hardship clause but in cases especially where there is continuous sickness irrespective of the income of the person a medical card should be granted to him.  We hear from doctors that they are being overworked.  If we visit any of their waiting rooms we cannot but be aware of that.  We should set about educating the public to avail of the free medical service rationally rather than run to a doctor with every little complaint.  In this way we would give the doctor more time to devote to those who are genuinely ill.  If we could achieve this by advertisements or in whatever way the Minister thinks fit we would save the doctor much valuable time in which he could give his badly needed attention to the more urgent and deserving cases.  This again could be counter-productive because the hardened medical card holder would not listen to such advice and the rather sensitive person might not attend the doctor when he genuinely should.  In this case, the second situation would be worse than the first.  Something should be done along this line.  We should learn from the mistakes of other countries particularly our neighbour across the water where this system was abused. By the mistakes made over there we should ensure that our doctors' time is not wasted by frivolous callers and frivolous users of the medical card.</P>
    <P>Many references have been made to our dental treatment.  On Monday before coming to Dáil Éireann I was approached by two parents in my home town whose children needed urgent dental specialist treatment. One parent's daughter had been on a waiting list since before Christmas. On contact with the county clinic I was informed that an orthodentist attends the clinic once a month.  There are 100 urgent applicants awaiting the service of this one specialist.  I think this is totally inadequate because, to my layman's knowledge, there are only a couple of years within which effective treatment can take place.  It would be a pity if any young boy or girl were denied dental treatment <Col N="750" /> through lack of qualified personnel.  I sincerely urge our Minister for Health to appoint more of these specialists or even to facilitate the transfer of a patient from one region to another where adequate facilities might be available.  Listening to the contributions made here by Deputies I think each area is as badly served in this regard as my own in Tipperary.  I think it is worthy of note.</P>
    <P>Note should also be taken of the situation regarding eye specialists and speech therapists.  I know of mothers in Tipperary who are very anxious about speech impediments in their children.  Again this specialist treatment is not available.  When it does become available it may be too late to effect the cure that we all hope for.</P>
    <P>Reading through the statistical information, I was rather surprised at page 47, table 6 to note in regard to the child health service that the number of children examined in 1973 was 4,000 less approximately than in 1969.  In 1973 131,655 children were examined at school.  In 1969 135,086 children were examined at school. This to me is a pity.  I would have thought that there would have been a vast increase because it is at this school age level we can give this urgent treatment to our children.  It has been referred to by many a speaker but, again, often in schools the facilities are not there.  Even the rooms are not available and from my own experience in the school I know that when the doctor and nurses came the whole workings of the school were disrupted because suitable acommodation was not available and they had to take over the classroom of the headmaster or the assistant.</P>
    <P>I should hope that, perhaps, next year when we discuss these figures again there will be a vast improvement. Here is the time and the place where the most effective treatment can be given whether it is dental treatment, eye treatment or speech treatment.  The few years a child can be treated most effectively are very limited.  It would be a pity that any child should go forward into life with some dental malformation or some eye complaint that <Col N="751" /> could and should have been treated but was not treated due to neglect by the Department of Health.  I would sincerely urge the Minister and his Department to have a fresh look at this and set about ensuring that every schoolgoing child should be thoroughly examined and any defect remedied.  It should be an ongoing thing not only at primary level but also at vocational, secondary and post-primary levels and, indeed, if needs be at the higher level.</P>
    <P>Looking again at the statistics I was appalled to note that in 1974 541 deaths occurred as a result of road accidents.  That, indeed, is a frightening figure and it includes, of course, all those who are permanently maimed and injured for life.  I think that both the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government should come together and try to do something to alert people to the dangers of the road.  The loss of 541 lives is a loss at national level.  People have to be cared for life maybe in institutions as a result of these car accidents.</P>
    <P>I would imagine that lectures on television and radio should constantly harp on the perils and dangers of the road to try to instil in our motorists, pedestrians and cyclists alike the need for care because every person who is injured, if he is permanently injured, is a liability not only to himself but to his family and to the nation who has to look after him for the rest of his life.  It would be money very well spent. Perhaps, it is an aspect of the matter that has not been given the attention it should have been.</P>
    <P>I remember reading an article once on the financial loss to a nation in deaths of that magnitude and it ran into millions of pounds, millions of pounds donated to the education of the individuals involved, medical expenses, housing and so on not to speak of the extra millions that would have to be paid for those people who are permanently injured.  I think it would be worth the Department's while to set about alerting the people to the dangers of the road.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that in the building of new housing schemes a <Col N="752" /> certain number of houses are allocated and are allotted for what we term our senior citizens but, again, a little more could be done by the Department of Health and the Department of Local Government.  I should hope that a communal room would be attached to some of these houses for senior citizens in which a fire be kept, television and newspapers provided and even a small kitchen made available.  I have no doubt that the many voluntary organisations would willingly send personnel to such a communal room nightly for to meet and have discussions with these senior citizens.  It is a point worth remembering in any future housing development.</P>
    <P>Again, many references were made to the nursing facilities.  I, in common with all Deputies, have been approached on numerous occasions by aspiring young nurses, girls who are well-qualified academically and otherwise to devote their lives to nursing in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the facilities are not there and one can feel rather depressed when one has to make them aware of the situation.  It is almost virtually impossible to gain admittance to our training hospitals.  I know one hospital had 30 vacancies and no fewer than 450 applied.  That to me is appalling.  I sympathise with the young girls.  They would love to give their lives in the service of their fellow human beings but they cannot and they will have to settle for something less inspiring in an office or some other soul-destroying position.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the remedy is. We should have more training schools for nurses.  If we are to develop the home care, community care and the welfare home system, I think we will need many more nurses.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter.  I note from his Estimate speech that a new training school for nurses has been opened at James Connolly Memorial Hospital. I should hope that there would be many of those to give our young girls an opportunity to be trained in the vocation they like best of all.</P>
    <P>I shall now turn to a rather depressing <Col N="753" /> subject, the subject of morgues attached to hospitals.  It has often been brought to my attention that the morgues attached to our hospitals are cold, bare and rather depressing.  This in no way reflects on the marvellous service given by the nurses, religious and otherwise who make the last hours of their patients on earth so comfortable and I am not casting as persions at all on the personnel but just on the surroundings of these morgues for the mourners.  A little more should be done and I should hope that in any future hospital a properly equipped morgue in pleasant surroundings is incorporated into the building itself, something like the present funeral parlours which have become very prevalent in our cities where the mourners can meet people who are sympathising with them in pleasant surroundings.</P>
    <P>The question of alcoholism has been touched upon.  We are not taking this problem as seriously as we should.  We all have first-hand knowledge of the damage done by alcoholism, the damage done to the personal life of the alcoholic, to his or her spouse, to the children, and even to the employer or employee. I would urge the Minister to have an in-depth study done on the damage which alcoholism is causing to the fabric of the nation and even from <Col N="754" /> a financial point of view and to alert our youth to the dangers of drink and to impress on them that if they drink they should drink temperately.  There are people who cannot do that.  They should be alerted to the fact that they cannot take alcohol and there is a danger that they will turn into alcoholics. Something on the lines of the no-smoking campaign should be embarked upon.  Intoxicating drink gives vast employment all over the country but no publican or vintner wishes to sell drink to an alcoholic.  I would urge the Minister, together with his Department, to advise teenagers especially in the post-primary schools.  Department officials, doctors and specially qualified people should give lectures to the students and make them aware of the possible dangers of alcoholism and the effect it will have not only on their lives but also on the lives of the people they come in contact with.</P>
