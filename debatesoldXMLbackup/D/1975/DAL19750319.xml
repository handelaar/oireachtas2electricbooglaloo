    <Title>Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Bill, 1975: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to simplify the procedure for promulgating certain pension schemes which under existing legislation cannot come into force unless and until confirmed by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Retirement benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force, including the Army Nursing Service, and the Chaplaincy Service are provided in Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes made by the Minister for Defence, with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service, under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Act, 1932, as amended and adapted.  Section 4 of the 1932 Act prescribes that no pension scheme shall come into force unless and until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been confirmed by resolution of each House.  Section 2 of the <Col N="628" /> Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act, 1968, exempts from the statutory requirement of confirmation by resolution of each House those pension schemes which provide for increases in retirement benefits arising out of (a) increases in remuneration or (b) increases in public service pensions generally.  Schemes outside these categories must come before each House for confirmation. There are two things to be said about this procedure: firstly, it takes up the time of the Houses discussing the detailed schemes, many of which though complex in form are of no great significance; and secondly, it may entail lengthy delays for people who are waiting to be paid the benefits. I say benefits advisedly, because while in theory a scheme may also impose reductions or limitations, in practice, the whole trend has been towards improvements.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to dispense with the requirement of confirmation by resolution and will thus assist both the House and the beneficiaries of schemes.  I well know the interest that this House has always shown in the welfare of our soldiers and veterans. The House will still be able to keep a watch on matters because of the provision requiring schemes to be laid before it with power to annul them.</P>
    <P>I may mention also that Deputies have on occasions expressed the view that the House could well be spared the necessity for confirming these pensions schemes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Every effort to simplify procedures in relation to Defence Forces pensions schemes must be applauded.  This Bill has been long overdue.  The Defence Forces (Pensions) (Amendment) Act of 1968 went some way towards simplification of the procedures and the issue of additional pensions.  I hope this Bill covers the situation in its entirety in relation to the classes catered for and that the Minister will not have to bring in additional legislation at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pensions play a very important part in the lives of such people, especially <Col N="629" /> on their release from service and delays in their issue or in the issue of increases often cause distress, as has been indicated in the Minister's brief.  A great many people leave the Defence Forces ill-equipped to enter the labour market, having given a life of service to the nation.  They are completely dependent on their pensions and any increases granted in them.  Anomalies will continue to arise in relation to pensions in general.  Service in the Congo, the Middle East, Cyprus and elsewhere may bring forward new problems in the future.  I hope that these men who have served in the interests of world justice and peace&mdash; some of whom are still serving in that cause&mdash;will benefit from this Bill.  It must be remembered that the men who have served the nation suffer many disadvantages on termination of their service.</P>
    <P>The pensions to which our Defence Forces are entitled following excellent service given and the risks they have had to undertake are minimal.  In fact, we do not give our Defence Forces sufficient in relation to pensions in so far as risks are concerned.  They are one section of the community who put their lives on the line in respect of service to the nation.  I trust the day is not too far distant when members of the Defence Forces, on termination of service&mdash;in addition to those who get pensions&mdash;will enjoy some of the back-up legislation such as is in existence elsewhere, for example, in the United States where there are the Veterans Readjustment Benefits Act or the G.I. Bill of Rights which would help people on their way after service.</P>
    <P>The best recruitment campaign &mdash;very often we see large amounts of money spent on such campaigns&mdash; would be a guarantee that we would look after our old soldiers.  I have no doubt but that the Minister is greatly concerned for the welfare of soldiers and pensioners.  The Bill is an indication of his intention to ensure the expedition of increases in their pensions.</P>
    <P>One wonders nowadays where are the members of our Defence Forces. We seldom see them in uniform. Perhaps were we to see them more <Col N="630" /> their services would be fully appreciated. It would follow also they would get the respect they deserve, on retirement, not alone from the State but from the public generally.</P>
    <P>It gives me great pleasure to support this measure which will streamline procedures in relation to the issue of pensions and increases to the members of the Defence Forces.  In due course I hope any other necessary or desirable legislation with a view to streamlining procedures in this regard will be forthcoming.  Certainly any such legislation will receive full support from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say on this Bill but there are a few points on which I should like to comment.</P>
      <P>There are many kinds of pensions now, for example, military service pensions, wound and disability pensions, special allowances and so on, and there are pensions for the nursing service.</P>
      <P>I want to deal very briefly with the special allowance.  These allowances do not come under the heading of pensions but they are regarded as such by the recipients.  The special allowances were introduced a number of years ago to help Old IRA men who do not qualify on other grounds, some of whom had been left in their declining years in semi-destitution.  Due to the loss of value in our currency, which is accelerating, I think we have come to the point when there should be a review of this allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appropriate annual sum is not bad for those under old age pension age, but, strangely enough, when they reach old age pension age the appropriate annual sum is reduced.  When a single or married person in receipt of this allowance becomes 70 an element of that pension is taken into account.  Such people need more money as they grow older, not less, and this scheme was introduced, as I say, to help to avoid hardship, especially for those who might not have many friends or immediate relations who would be prepared to look after them in their old age.  Early on quite a number of these people had to have <Col N="631" /> recourse to public institutions, and it was then recognised that something should be done, and it was done at that stage, to help them.</P>
    <P>I have been in close touch with the Department of Defence on and off throughout the years in connection with this scheme, and I can say that it is well and equitably administered, but I would ask the Minister to try to secure an increase in the appropriate annual sum in order to take account of the loss in the value of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister for Defence on bringing this legislation before the House.  I am sure every Member will agree that anything that speeds up the payment of Army pensions or increases when they become due is to be welcomed.  We should ensure that there is no undue delay in the payment of pensions to retired Army personnel, and it should be our desire that it would not be held up by discussion here.</P>
      <P>I am very glad to note that in the statement the Minister has covered some people who are often forgotten, that is, the Army nursing staff.  They do a wonderful job in their sphere of life but they are not in the public eye and we hear very little about them.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising the importance of keeping these increases in pension in line with the increases in the cost of living which can have an adverse effect on the income of these people who have given excellent service over the years in the interests of our country.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence, since he came to office two years ago, has shown great interest in the welfare of members of the Defence Forces and I think we can rest assured that, without bringing these matters before the House, he will do everything possible in the interests of those who have served this country well in the past and those who are serving at present and who in years to come will become entitled to retirement pensions from the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> I also welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it in.  I should like to support Deputy Carter in his plea for no reduction in the special allowance to Old IRA men who reach old age pension age.  I understand a special allowance is given because of the circumstances of a person who is not entitled to a military service pension. In the case of a person so entitled and getting a military service pension, no matter what the circumstances of that person when he dies, the widow gets something.  But if a person has a special allowance, given because of the circumstances of the family and because the person is in rather poor circumstances, the widow gets nothing on the death of the holder of a special allowance.  Rural Deputies are faced with this problem every other day and I want to bring it to the Minister's notice.  When old IRA men die their widows do not know the difference actually between the pension and the special allowance.  They hear that some widow down the road got something when the husband died and feel they should also get it.  Of course, they cannot get it and when we write we are given the answer, which is correct, that what was given to the widow was not a pension but a special allowance. I am suggesting to the Minister that if the circumstances of the person getting the personal allowance justify that allowance being paid, surely the widow of such a person should be entitled to something when her husband dies.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to waste the time of the House in talking further on this Bill but I would ask the Minister to have a look at this situation and ensure that something be given to the widow of an old IRA man who was drawing a special allowance.  I welcome the Bill very sincerely because anything we do by way of pension or otherwise for people who served the country well is well merited.  I know the Minister is interested in trying to improve the lot of these people and we on this side of the House welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House most sincerely for its kind reception of the Bill.  Deputy Dowling spoke his <Col N="633" /> first words for Fianna Fáil on Defence on this Bill and I welcome him in the task he has been given and wish him every personal success&mdash;with the accent on &ldquo;personal&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about the benefit of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  As I see it, the benefit will not be in increased payments to anybody &mdash;that is governed by other legislation&mdash;but in the expedition of payments and avoidance of delay.  For me since I became involved for the past couple of years and for everybody else it has been very annoying to be trying to get something through for which people down the country are waiting.  This involves money they can ill afford to be without but the business of this House is obstructing what is really only a mechanical measure without any controversial element.  It is not much help to people who have to wait perhaps six months before they get a cheque which is retrospective because they have been without the money during that period. In most cases these are people who are not blessed with much of the world's goods and they could benefit from prompt payments.</P>
      <P>What I would wish if it were possible&mdash;I am sure the House will agree&mdash;is to have a consolidation of all Defence Forces pensions schemes. But the pensions section of the Department of Defence is so hard pressed that the highly-technical staff required to do a good consolidation job has not been available.  I hope in the future to get down to consolidation which would help the Deputies and everybody concerned from the point of view of simplification.  It is difficult even when one has been in the Department for a while to remember and trace back through various Acts what the decision on a certain case was.  Consolidation would help considerably and we hope to have it but we have not been able to do it up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned about never seeing soldiers in uniform.  I agree.  I notice when I go around military barracks and in going to my office every day that when young men are leaving barracks they normally put on civilian clothes.  It is their <Col N="634" /> option and if they are giving good service to the State we cannot say too much but personally I would like to see them in uniform, say, in a café in O'Connell Street or going about their social occasions.  They seem not to do it just now and have not been doing it, as far as I know, for some years past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carter spoke of special allowances in a very constructive contribution. Special allowances are not affected by this legislation but, with the permission of the Chair, I shall take the opportunity to say something regarding special allowances.  Deputy Carter suggested that some people in their declining years would be almost destitute and that increases should be given as people become older.  The thinking behind special allowances is to help people whose incomes are very low.  It is the kindly hand of the State being extended to those who gave service in years gone by.  Neither the State, nor the Department nor any organ of the State wishes to be mean with or hard on these people.  The question of the increase which will arise on 1st July out of the budget is not agreed in detail at present between the State Departments involved but if my memory serves me right&mdash;and I am speaking from memory&mdash;the previous budget increase worked out at about 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>Only a very small proportion of old age pension is taken into account when arriving at the amount of special allowance to be paid if any amount is payable.  Where board and lodging is taken into account, this is only done when it has been given without hardship to the giver.  In a situation where a son runs a large farm or a prosperous business and his father is an applicant for a special allowance and is living with him, portion of the board and lodging would be taken into account because the son was suffering no hardship in doing what he should do&mdash;provide for his father in his declining years.  But where the giver would be suffering hardship in giving the board and lodging or help of any kind to a person who is an applicant for special allowance, that help is disregarded.</P>
    <P>I know it can be annoying to <Col N="635" /> Deputies when they make representations in this regard and find that the value of certain benefits accruing to the applicant is assessed at what they consider to be a rather high figure but they should take into account that any value put on it is only put on in cases where there is no hardship.</P>
    <P>While only a very small portion of the old age pension is taken into account in arriving at the appropriate figure on which a special allowance is payable, no account is taken of increases in social welfare payments. This has been the case for many years; it was done under a previous Government and the position has not changed.  Increases in social welfare benefits do not affect special allowances.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Governey for his congratulations and if I can speed things up in any way so as to serve the people in the Defence Forces I shall do so.</P>
    <P>The question of widows of special allowance holders as compared with widows of military service pensioners as raised by Deputy Callanan deserves comment.  A military service pensioner was subject to the most exacting investigation and he must have served in the three months prior to 11th July, 1921.  A special allowance applicant can be eligible if he was a member. The difference is quite striking.  The thinking, I would presume, on the part of various Governments over the years has been that where a widow of a special allowance holder fell to be a charge on the State on the death of her husband then it would be the duty of the State to support that lady through the normal social welfare channels.  I would agree that perhaps there could be a little fall-off in income as a result of that but that is the thinking on the matter and it has been the thinking for years.  The military service pensioner is in an entirely different situation. In fact, he could be a millionaire. He is not subject to a means test at all.  He has a pension for his service just as if I, Deputy Dowling or anyone else had been in the Defence Forces for a certain number <Col N="636" /> of years, would have it as of right and our personal incomes or personal positions at any given time would not affect our pensions.</P>
    <P>This is really a Bill to clear up delays.  It will do that.  I hope that in the years to come we will effect consolidation which would be of considerable help, even in the Department of Defence, I am sure, because they do not like going through knotty problems any more than anybody else.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining Stages today.</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1975: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this very short and simple measure is to raise the limit on the amount of land bonds which may be created and issued to make advances and pay the purchase moneys of properties taken over by the Land Commission in the course of their land settlement operations.</P>
      <P>Section 6 (1) of the Land Bond Act, 1934, imposed a limit of £10 million on the amount of land bonds which could be created and issued.  The limit was raised to £15 million by section 7 of the Land Act, 1953; to £25 million by section 2 of the Land Bond Act, 1964; and to £40 million by section 1 of the Land Bond Act, 1969.  I may say that the foregoing amending measures proved non-contentious and got speedy passage through both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land bonds are created by the Minister for Finance periodically, to meet the requirements of the Land Commission, usually by way of an annual order.  The most recent such order was made on 22nd January, <Col N="637" /> 1975, for an amount of one million bonds, bringing the amount created to date under all land bond orders since 1934 to £40 million, which is the total authorised under existing legislation.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide statutory authority for the supply of further land bonds, so that the work of the Land Commission may proceed.  On the basis of the current level of operations and taking into account the prevailing price of land, a sum of £20 million should be sufficient for five years and this is the amount proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Land bonds as a medium of payment for lands acquired by the Land Commission were first introduced in 1923 and since then some 1,316,000 acres have been acquired.</P>
    <P>In recent times, in common with other fixed interest securities, land bonds have not fared too well on the stock market, but I would hope that the latest series of bonds created&mdash; which bear interest at the rate of 16 per cent&mdash;will prove very acceptable to landowners.</P>
    <P>The concept of the voluntary purchase of land for cash on the open market by the Land Commission was introduced by the Inter-Party Government in the 1950 Land Act.  Since then successive Ministers for Lands have, each in turn, sought to obtain as big an allocation of money as possible for this purpose when the annual Estimates for their Department were being finalised.  While the Exchequer position, however, has always acted as an effective brake on ambitions in that direction, nevertheless in the 21-month period 1st April, 1973, to 31st December, 1974, the Government provided the Land Commission with an amount of £3.25 million for the purchase of lands for cash.  In the current year the sum provided is £2.625 million, which does not include the additional amount of £490,000 being made available to pay premiums and pensions to farmers who avail of the new retirement scheme.  Since the introduction of the system of cash purchases in 1950 to 31st December last, 57,500 acres had been purchased for £5,072,000.  The round figures for the <Col N="638" /> 12 months ended 31st December last were 5,700 acres and £1,092,000.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, all lands purchased under the retirement scheme&mdash;which I initiated in May last &mdash;will be paid for in cash.  In launching the scheme I drew attention to the fact that the incentives which it offered were very generous, indeed liberal in relation to our national resources, much higher than the EEC guideline amounts and up to the highest level on offer in any member state. I expressed confidence that there would be a substantial response to the scheme which was designed to enable a farmer, if he so desired, to retire with dignity and financial security after a lifetime of hard work.  Nor was my confidence unfounded, for the scheme has been very well received and in the ten months to the end of February, 1975, almost 1,200 applications for participation were received. The applications are being dealt with as rapidly as possible and in the cases considered to date nearly 300 farmers have been adjudged eligible to take part in the scheme.  In fact, some approved cases have been fully completed and the farmers concerned are already enjoying the undoubted benefit.</P>
    <P>It may appear to Deputies that I have digressed somewhat in referring to the purchase of lands for cash and to the retirement scheme, but it was necessary that I should do so if the importance of land bonds in relation to the land settlement programme is to be fully appreciated.  With the retirement scheme taking up so much of the cash available, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the general land acquisition should fall to be financed by land bonds.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimate for Lands in October and November last, and on other occasions also, Deputies on both sides of the House expressed the view that the system of payment of purchase moneys in land bonds should be done away with altogether.  While that is a view with which I would not find it hard to sympathise we have to be realistic and recognise that until the Exchequer is in a position to provide sufficient <Col N="639" /> funds to enable all purchases by the Land Commission to be for cash, land bonds will continue to play a part in the land settlement programme.</P>
    <P>During the year ended 31st December last, the total issues of land bonds amounted to around £4.5 million which was the highest ever figure for any period of 12 months, and represented an intake of some 13,000 acres. At the same date proceedings were in progress in respect of a further 60,000 acres, the purchase money of which would be payable in land bonds. These figures illustrate, far more eloquently than anything I could say, the necessity for the present Bill.  This measure will ensure that sufficient bonds will be available to enable the Land Commission to press on with the vital task of helping small farmers to get enough land to guarantee them a decent living for themselves and their families and it is on this basis that I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to know what exactly was in the Minister's introductory speech.  I thought it was customary on an occasion such as this that the Opposition were provided with a copy of the Minister's speech.  However, that does not change my approach to the Bill.  The Minister said this is a relatively simple Bill, but to me it is nothing of the kind.  It is a fundamental Bill which is concerned with the whole land question in Ireland and, for the past century, that has been a burning question.  It is more than 100 years since the 1870 Land Act was introduced. Since then through one means or another&mdash;principally through agitation and the foundation of the Land League in the latter part of the century&mdash;there has been perpetual concern on the part of what might be described as the peasantry of Ireland to have restored to them the land which had been removed from them by confiscation and settlement and plantation.  An enlightened British Government and the native Government assisted the peasantry towards such restoration.  The concern then was for the restoration of the land to the people of Ireland and the <Col N="640" /> destruction of the tyrannical landlordism which then existed.</P>
      <P>In earlier Acts there was an acceptance of the principle of land bonds for the purchase of land and that principle was fortified in the 1923 Act. In the subsequent 1923 Act, provision for the creation of bonds up to the sum of £1 million was introduced. In 1934, the new Land Bonds Act provided for the creation of land bonds to the extent of £10 million.  At that time it was hoped that that would be the end of the land bond system of purchasing.  In an effort to safeguard the interests of the vendor, the Minister was obliged to marry the interest on the bonds to the prevailing national loan interest rate.  This was an effort to guarantee that the vendor would get a fair price for his land.</P>
      <P>In 1953 permission was sought for the creation of an additional £5 million worth of bonds.  That brought the total up to £15 million.  The 1964 Act increased that amount to a total of £25 million.  Since then during every debate on the Estimate for the Department of Lands, the whole principle of land bonds has been attacked.  There is no need for me to give a litany of the names of Deputies whose interest in and knowledge of the land problem was without question.  It is rather significant that they were all critical of the purchase of land through the land bond system.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the estimate in 1973 Deputy Sean Flanagan, a former Minister for Lands, referred to Deputy L'Estrange who, over the years had been annoying him and other Ministers about the purchase of land through the land bond system, and said he hoped he was now happy because £1 million had been set aside in the capital budget for the purchase of land&mdash;we were moving away from the old land bond system and in future land would be paid for in cash.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the Dáil on 25th October, 1973, the Minister reiterated his criticism of the land bond system. As reported at column 631, Volume 268 of the Official Report he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power thought that £1 million was not enough for the purchase <Col N="641" /> of land in cash.  I agree that every Minister for Lands would hope to see the day when land is bought and paid for in cash and nothing else and we will work towards that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>I believe the Land Commission should pay market value.  Indeed, it was a previous Government participated in by Fine Gael and Labour who first introduced legislation making it compulsory for the Land Commission to pay market value. Admittedly they pay in bonds and, if we could get away from bonds, we would have an ideal situation.</P>
    <P>I would hope that everyone would aim at an ideal system.  If to get away from the bonds would be the ideal system why is the Minister now introducing a Bill which seeks an additional £35 million for land bonds?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The essence of my complaint is that up to 1969 permission had been granted for the creation of £40 million for land bonds but the Minister is now seeking permission to extend that to £60 million while at the same time he is expressing the hope that the system of purchasing land by means of land bonds will disappear.  That is an illogical situation. How can one hope for the removal of a system while making provision for its continuance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the farm retirement scheme.  I do not think that is very relevant in so far as the Minister is obliged to make provision for land acquired in that way by cash payments.  We are talking here about the situation where, generally speaking, land is not being purchased any longer from the big landowner or the rancher but where the Land Commission, more than ever before, are concerned with the purchase of land from the people of Ireland and from the former tenants of these landlords. The purchase of land by means of land bonds is not a fair or an equitable system in so far as the vendor <Col N="643" /> is concerned.  He is not paid on the day on which his land is acquired and it may be two years later before the land bonds are paid over to him and these would have depreciated during that time.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on the Land Commission to pay for land at open market value.  I anticipate the Minister referring later to the high interest rate in respect of land bonds but, unfortunately, because of the financial situation both at home and internationally, there is ample evidence to prove that land bonds will be at discount rate within six months, and that, consequently, the vendor is not getting a fair and equitable price for his land. There is an obligation on us to protect his interest in the same way as there is an obligation on us to help the weaker farmer to acquire a viable holding.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were seeking a lesser amount we could take it that he was anxious for the removal of the land bond system but the seeking of an additional £20 million is an indication of his non-preparedness to abolish the system or, else, an indication of his lack of success in impressing on the Government the need for the removal of this system.  There must be a greater effort towards making settlements by way of cash.  With this in mind, it is my intention to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief in my contribution but that is not to say that I do not consider this Bill to be very important.  It is very important and I am disappointed that a copy of the Minister's speech was not made available to us.  However, I accept what the Minister said in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been greatly concerned with the whole question of land bonds.  I consider this system to be a very immoral way of paying for land.  The State should honour commitments to pay a certain amount for land acquired and this amount should be paid within a certain number of years.  I can see the Minister's point of view.  I was very disappointed when, on our accession to the EEC, the land bond system was not discontinued for all time.  I expected that we would get an injection <Col N="644" /> of money from the EEC for land settlement.  The big problem with regard to the purchase of land by the Land Commission is that we have finished with buying up big ranches. We are now buying land from people who have it set.  The acquisition of land under the retirement scheme is a different matter.  Many Members are approached to have land acquired but people feel aggrieved that the only method of paying for such land is by land bonds.  Land set under the 11-month system should be included in the retirement scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a terrible state of affairs that the only system of paying for the land is land bonds.  I appreciate that the interest rate has been increased to 16 per cent but that will be very little in 12 months' or two years' time.  It has been stated that these bonds are redeemable but they are only redeemable on the Kathleen Mavourneen system, over 30 or 40 years.  I am aware that if one is lucky enough to come up in the lottery one can redeem the bonds but this is not good enough. Every loan floated by the State is redeemable in a specific number of years after it is floated and I cannot understand why the same system does not apply in the case of land bonds.  We all know the scourge that land bonds are and of how much they have fallen in value.  Some of them are not worth £30 to the 100.  The interest rate at the time they are issued is great and the land bond rate was always ahead of others but that rate does not remain attractive for very long.</P>
    <P>These bonds are absolutely useless and nobody will buy them on the Stock Exchange.  The Government should agree to these bonds being redeemable five years after issue.  If this was done the whole problem would be solved.  If I occupied the Minister's post I would insist on the Government of the day making these bonds redeemable within a period of five years.  It is immoral to expect people to accept bonds as payment for land when they are redeemable only by chance.  I accept the Minister's statement that we did not get sufficient money from the EEC to buy all the land required and that unless <Col N="645" /> land bonds are issued we will not be able to buy land, except through the retirement scheme for which £3 million is available.</P>
    <P>In my view £3 million is only a drop in the ocean.  We must continue to buy land and build up a surplus. I accept that the Land Commission give market value when they purchase land but it is only on paper because they pay by way of land bonds.  Farmers dread the thought of land bonds; they stink with the result that very few are anxious to sell to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Land bonds should carry a Government guarantee that they are redeemable after a reasonable number of years.  Earlier the Minister expressed his anxiety to get rid of land bonds but he has done little about it.  It is like the 14-point programme this Government got into power on.  I know we cannot get rid of land bonds but I believe it is possible to give the farming community a fair deal.  It is not surprising to hear people who are paid for land by land bonds expressing the view that they were robbed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to insert an amendment in the Bill making the bonds redeemable within five years after the date of issue.  We must create a pool of land but we will not succeed in doing so until we change the land bond system of payment.  The live horse get grass attitude of the Government in this regard is causing great concern to the farming community. I will not accept this Bill until it carries a Government guarantee that bonds will be redeemable at par five years after the date of issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the Minister was honest when he said that the Exchequer could not afford to buy all the land that is offered to the Land Commission.  That would cost in the region of £20 million for the current year.  In this regard it is pointless for any Member to suggest that because the Government cannot afford to buy all this land the country is bankrupt.  I welcome the increasing of the interest rate to 16 per cent and this, in my view, represents a substantial rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> Since 1923 land has been purchased with land bonds.  We all look forward to the time when land bonds will be done away with.  As some Deputies opposite pointed out, unless money becomes available from the EEC, no matter what Government are in power, there will be difficulty.  There are people who sell land to the Land Commission; there are others who sell in the open market.  There is a particular case in my constituency where one farmer sold a farm to another farmer at something in the region of £8,000.  The Land Commission moved in and put a stay on the sale of the land and the Land Commission are now buying the land; they will pay the farmer in land bonds.  This man, with the intention of buying land beside his homestead, sold a holding that was some distance from his homestead. He will now be debarred from doing that because, since he was paid in land bonds, he will not have the cash available to purchase this adjacent holding.  In cases like this the situation is utterly impossible.  The Minister and the Department should have a serious look at cases like this and pay these people in cash.  There are people who find land bonds a suitable medium of exchange because they are getting interest at the rate of 16 per cent.  In special cases, however, land should be bought for cash by the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important measure since it deals with the medium of exchange.  Regardless of the price of land, be it high or low, we shall have to find some agreement on a better system of exchange where buying or selling land is concerned.  Land bonds are security of a kind.  That is not the fault of the bond or of the system.  It is our fault because we have never sought to maintain current values in land bonds.  If one can hold a land bond from the date of issue to the date of maturity one gets one's money back.  If, however, one has to have recourse to the current market one will not get one's money back. That is about the size of it.  It is all very well to say it is regrettable we do not get money from Europe to buy land; I have known men who got <Col N="647" /> money from America to buy land and, strangely enough, they lost it.</P>
      <P>We should generate from our land our own system of money values.  If we are able to borrow on the strength of it, well and good, but we must bear in mind at all times that we should never borrow beyond our means.  I am not condemning the Minister now. Far from it.  There have been many Minister for Lands since 1923 but none has ever got around to the idea of putting current value into land bonds.  It would, of course, be a very difficult task.</P>
      <P>What is business?  Is it not based on trust, on confidence and on integrity? The land is here.  It has been here for a long time and our 12,000,000 arable acres will be here for a long time to come.  From that point of view it is a pity that we should have doubts about land bonds as a medium of exchange.  These bonds are as good or as bad as we make them, as good or as bad as the confidence of those who deal in them. We started off in the worst possible way where these bonds are concerned. Land values go up and down and the unfortunate position is that we will never be able to release enough cash to deal with land sales on a cash basis. Concommitant with the scheme under the various EEC directives where cash is indicated we should always be in a position to underwrite any land bonds coming on the market at current rates and ensure that the bonds maintain comparative value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that land bonds should have reached the stage at which they are regarded as not being worth the paper they are printed on.  The stock exchange deals in equities and stocks and shares and some stocks and shares reach a very high value but in many instances they are not backed by any relative values in the way that the land is.  Land became more attractive when we entered Europe and today it makes anything from £1,000 an acre to £2,000 an acre, and even higher. Be that as it may, land bonds should be currency for the exchange of land and we should be able to devise a <Col N="648" /> system to make them such currency. There are many people who would hold land bonds if they knew the bonds would maintain relative values. and could be cashed at any time or, at a time of emergency, turned into cash on a profitable basis.  This cannot be done.  This calls in question the methods of Governments at home and abroad.  It is very important when a Government security is issued that it is fully backed.  Small investors should be able to invest in the knowledge that at any time they can realise this asset to advantage.  This is the main reason why the land bond system has such a bad image.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the present Minister for Lands because this system has continued through the years.  We should realise it is something which is dealt with on the long term.  I believe we never will have recourse to enough cash to exchange all the land we would like to deal in.  We should, therefore, try to bring about a better land bond system.  These bonds at issue will be worth 16 per cent.  If one looks at the newspapers any day of the week one will see that certain land bonds issued in the past stand at a very low level now.  Every new issue has to be updated and a higher price offered on the market in order to attract custom.  This has the effect of depressing previous issues of land bonds.</P>
    <P>This applies even to national loans. All Houses of Parliament should call into question the procedures of Government in issuing securities which they are not able to back to the hilt.  We have an example of this outside, which I cannot go into, but if a predicted event takes place it will call into question the relative integrity of Governments, never mind business concerns.  Government securities are always in the limelight and under security and people expect a lot of value from them.  Nearly everybody in the House would agree that while we have our ups and downs in the farming system and while various methods of husbandry may be in-indulged in when we come to deal in land we should be prepared to back up whatever exchange we have to the hilt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> I am not as well versed in this as I should be and I am not a stockbroker. If I intended to buy land bonds I would like the advice of an experienced stockbroker.  I believe in any given year the value of land bonds cashed on the market is not very large.  If we had not this love-hate relationship in regard to land bonds we could do much better.  If we tried hard enough we could put a public face on them.  A number of people invest in securities of this kind on the long term as a rule so it should not be beyond the capability of the Government and their advisers to bring about a more equitable system in relation to land bonds.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I felt in a particular case that the Land Commission literally robbed the vendor of land.  He made some mistakes but everybody knows it is impossible for ordinary people to know everything about the various land Acts although some vendors pretend to be more stupid than they are in relation to them.  This man was relieved of his land in return for land bonds which only carried approximately 50 per cent of their primary value.  At that stage the land bonds were issued and the only opening the man had was to take up the matter at common law.  At the time I advised him to do this because I thought the Land Commission were getting away with a lot.  The system is very rigid.  I am not accusing the Land Commission or their personnel; I am accusing this House because it is here that the laws are made.  The land bond system should be much more flexible and we should seek to ensure that the bonds have the confidence of the community.  I do not understand why we do not do that.</P>
    <P>In the past many other Ministers for Lands introduced legislation regarding land bonds and they tried to write up the capital value of the bonds.  They had good intentions and Members gave their views on the matter; year after year various issues of land bonds were introduced and, because of the loss in value of the currency, a greater price was offered each time.  This had the effect of making the current issue of <Col N="650" /> bonds more attractive than previous bonds.</P>
    <P>If we intend to carry out the EEC directives and to administer the succession part of the Land Commission scheme we will need something more than cash.  We will have to get the confidence not only of the farmers, not only of those interested in the scheme from the point of view of retiring, and of the brokers on the floor of the stock exchange but of everyone who is interested in investment.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying the Minister can ask this House to write up the capital value of any range of bonds if the bonds lose their value on practically the next day.  If bonds lose their value faster than whiskey leaves a bottle at a spree, they cannot have the confidence of the people.  The Minister and the Government should try to get more security into lands bonds, they should try to move away from the position that obtained in the past, where if bonds were mentioned to a broker, a bank manager, a solicitor or an auctioneer he replied he would not take them as a present.  We can ask for as much capital as we like, we can mention any percentage figure we wish, but if the bonds have not the confidence of the people it will be to no avail.  The problem will be that people will ask for cash.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his achievements in the past few years.  He is a rural Deputy and he knows the needs and the problems of smallholders.  Anyone from rural Ireland knows of the problems of smallholders in the last 18 months.  The Minister is the most reasonable and approachable man and, although I have flooded him with applications for land division in my constituency, he has always received me in a very courteous way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a county that is called &ldquo;the premier county&rdquo;, that has the Golden Vale within its boundaries. One might think from that description that Tipperary, and particularly North Tipperary, has no problems and has no small farmers.  The opposite is the case. In one area in my constituency there are many smallholders whom I consider <Col N="651" /> qualify for the EEC disadvantaged area scheme.  These people are living on holdings of up to 20 acres in hilly country.  They have done a tremendous job during the years and have contributed to the economy of the country.  I am concerned about these people who have been reared on the land and want to remain there&mdash; but if young families are not allowed an opportunity to get a better living there is a great danger the flight from the land will continue.  If we are to save rural Ireland the work of acquisition and division of land must be expedited.  I compliment the local officers on their interest in these people. They are doing a good job but they are constrained by the provisions of legislative measures.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the issues of land bonds.  They have served their purpose but we must have cash payments in order to get the necessary land for the smallholders. The Minister said that the farmers' retirement scheme would be supported by cash payments.  I have no doubt the scheme will be a success but I am telling the Minister the time has come to examine the acquisition system so that in future land may be purchased for cash.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties may be encountered by the families of people who have sold land for land bonds.  The bonds may lose their value and, on the death of the owner, if cash is not available the land may have to be sold.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the scheme of land acquisition be speeded up. In the past year the Minister acquired 5,700 acres but I must compare that with the 57,000 acres acquired in a five-year period and with the fact that there are 12 million acres still available for acquisition.  If rural Ireland is to survive and if farmers are not to clear out, then we must ensure that a quicker system of land acquisition be initiated.  Otherwise smallholders will lose patience and will leave.  I appeal to the Minister especially on behalf of smallholders in north Tipperary, many of whom have been waiting for years for farms to be <Col N="652" /> divided.  They have gone through a bad period and they believe the Government should show their concern by giving them additional land.  I say that with full appreciation of the difficulties the Minister has to deal with.</P>
    <P>Land is very dear and when farmers want to buy it or sell it, it is cash on the nail.  Therefore, I suggest that the land bond system should be changed in some way.  Cash is the best form of barter from the point of view of farmers and if land were bought for cash by the Land Commission it would eliminate a lot of delays.  I congratulate the Minister on his efforts and appeal to him to have land division speeded up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is definite reluctance on the part of persons selling land persons from whom land is acquired by the Land Commission, to accept land bonds for numerous reasons.  First of all, land vendors are concerned because the bonds are not doing very well on the stock market and they are worried about their position should they have to cash bonds.  If the Land Commission were to offer cash for all lands on offer and which they propose to acquire, acquisition would be at a much faster rate and, perhaps, cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Farmers are well aware that land bonds are not doing well on the stock market and at the same time they know that if they get cash they can get from 12½ per cent to 15 per cent interest per annum on what their farms realise, depending on whether they invest on a 6-month or a 12-month call and the terms they negotiate. For this reason the time has come when the Land Commission should phase out the land bond system. The sooner this is done the better.  There is no doubt that the payment of bonds for land holds up acquisition and causes delays in the work of the Land Commission.  People are not so ready to come forward to offer land when they know they will be paid in land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="653" /> I know a number of cases where the Land Commission were able to tell vendors that they might be paid in cash and invariably the vendors were forthcoming and there was little delay in negotiating prices acceptable to both sides.  A lot of delay would also be avoided if the rule were eliminated whereby for land compulsorily acquired the price fixed by the land court is in bonds.  If it were left to the discretion of the court to decide the price on its merits land would be acquired in greater acreage more rapidly.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ask the Land Commission to settle as many cases as possible where there are disputes on prices before the cases are referred to the land court, which means endless delays and is an endless source of worry not only to vendors but to smallholders awaiting land division. Vendors are not sure that the Land Commission will not back down when they find that the land court has fixed a certain price.  In such an event vendors are kept waiting for nothing.</P>
    <P>I have said in the House before that the land bond system of payment should be phased out.  In this Bill it is proposed to increase the total value of bonds by £20 million in a five-year period.  In effect this means that bonds worth £4 million per annum will be issued.  The transfer of this amount to the Exchequer, having regard to its vast turnover in recent years, would not be an unreasonable burden. After all it is only one-seventh of the tax revenue from the recent increase in petrol tax.  It is not unreasonable to expect that this £4 million per annum should be transferred to the Exchequer.  Many industrious smallholders are concerned about payment by bonds.  They know that in many instances this system leads to extraordinary delays.  This, in turn, leads to a reluctance on the part of neighbours who intend selling their holdings.</P>
    <P>I ask the Land Commission to provide additional staff for the local divisional offices.  I often wonder how these men can carry out all the work they must do, particularly those in the counties along the western seaboard <Col N="654" /> who deal with applications for subdivision and the purchase of small parcels of land by non-nationals.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal in this Bill and to scrap the system of paying by bonds, as was urged by some speakers from the Government benches this morning.  I have held this view for some time and have mentioned it in this House on a number of occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the good work he has done in the short time since he took office.  We heard a lot about the uses and abuses and the value and lack of value of land bonds this morning. I agree with Deputy Carter when he said we are all partly responsible for the general approach to land bonds.  If one decries something long enough, eventually everybody will believe him.  We have succeeded in doing this with land bonds, in spite of the fact that they are worth 16 per cent per annum&mdash;a substantial amount of money even in present day inflated terms.</P>
      <P>The most significant thing which has happened in the last two years was the farm retirement scheme.  One might not think that in an area such as north-east Cork there would be a problem with subdivision and small farms.  It is accepted by the EEC that the size of a viable holding has grown from 30 acres; in future we will be thinking in terms of a minimum of 60 acres.  With that in mind we still have a long way to go.  While we might like to get rid of land bonds we must be realistic and face the fact that the Exchequer could not stand this type of loan and must substitute land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prime function of the Government and the Land Commission is to ensure that everyone in the farming industry will have sufficient land to make a decent living.  As I have already said, even in my area there is the immense problem of small farmers.  There are quite a number of farms coming available to the Land Commission at present.  Only last week we met the Land Commission about <Col N="655" /> the Fota estate.  I was very glad to be involved in this.  We got a sympathetic hearing from the Land Commission. They said they would be prepared to take over as much of the good land as was necessary for the relief of congestion.  There is congestion all over the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to discuss now the rules dealing with the second son.  At the moment a man must own land before he is entitled to more land.  It is time that was scrapped.  In the past the Land Commission over-did this migratory aspect and neglected the locals to some extent.  This was a bad idea.  That is especially true nowadays in view of the substantial cost of land.  We must now think in terms of the landless second son, or even the third son, if they are promising people.  Again I urge that we forge ahead with subdivision.</P>
    <P>Under the farm retirement scheme&mdash; which is working very well&mdash;we will be able to pay cash for this land.  In future there will be a large amount of land to be divided.  The only way this land can be acquired is by the use of land bonds. Where old people who are in need are involved, cash must be paid and in all cases, some cash must be paid.  In other words, I would like to see more flexibility. There is a rule which says that compulsory acquisition must be paid for in land bonds.  That should be changed because in the case of old people they are reluctant to leave the land.  In the case of land acquired compulsorily from elderly people, the same rules as apply to the farm retirement scheme should obtain&mdash;that they be left in their home with an adjoining field so that they might enjoy those comforts for the rest of their days.  Again with respect to old people in need of money, I should like to see some cash being paid out.</P>
    <P>The farm retirement scheme is not progressing as quickly as I would like. I know there are quite a lot of delays involved.  Indeed, that applies to the acquisition of land generally.  The point has been made already that we should consider the appointment of more field officers in the Land Commission. At present, I do not know whether or not the Minister realises this in his part <Col N="656" /> of the world, in the south the price of conacre has gone through the roof.  If people are to survive in the business of farming, if something is to be done for them, let it be done immediately.  I cannot see how that can be achieved unless more field officers are appointed to get on with the job.  I would not even wait until such time as these sheds, houses and so on were built.  I would allow the man in to get on with the job.  That brings me to the point I made initially, that the work of the Land Commission would be much more effective and simpler if more consideration was given to local smallholders in so far as it would eliminate delays and the expense of building dwellinghouses, farm out-offices and so on.  It is much more important to facilitate the neighbours.  I think people with up to 45 or 50 acres should be considered especially in my part of the country where there is a considerable amount of very heavy, wet soil, where very often one has the requisite number of acres but they are not worth much when it comes to efficient farming.</P>
    <P>The mileage clause applied in the allocation of land should be extended also.  With modern equipment and so on, there is no need for the clause to be so rigid.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Minister for Lands on his whole approach to the division of land, indeed everything that comes under his care, which includes forestry and so on.  Under his guidance a good job is being done.  In his reign, as it were, the farm retirement scheme is getting under way and a lot of essential work is being done.  The Minister should not hesitate to enlist all the help he can on the ground because that is where it is most needed.  Those of us who attend meetings around the country hear a lot of complaints about large tracts of land remaining undivided, being let out in conacre, with a lot of indecisiveness, but I am sure the Minister will get around to all of that in due course.  This seems to be a crucial year in farming.  I think we would need a sort of crash programme with regard to the allocation of land.</P>

      <P>In view of the urgent need this year, I would hope that all necessary help would be enlisted in the job of division of land.  While I am not in favour of land bonds any more than is anybody else&mdash;they are not the best way of paying for anything&mdash;we must put our priorities in order.  The priority of any Government is to ensure that smallholders, north, south, east and west are made viable.  Our available cash must be used to best advantage and quite a lot of it will be taken up by the farm retirement scheme.  Therefore, land bonds will be essential for quite a while to come.  The important thing is that the land be acquired and distributed amongst people.  We may talk forever about gas and oil, wealth under the soil.  We can talk about Navan and all of these things, all of which are good, but basically the long term wealth of this country is the soil, the wealth of farming.  The best industries will always be those based on agriculture.  If we are to survive as an agricultural community, we need to have viable holdings.  That is the first priority of survival which has been long recognised here and in other countries in the EEC.  We cannot go wrong if we continue as at present.  While one has a certain amount of sympathy with people who would like to receive more cash, the important thing is that the people acquiring land will be able to do so in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Let me again compliment the Minister on his good work.  I hope he will be around for a long time to continue it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it rather difficult to see the real purpose behind this Land Bond Bill, 1975, the Second Stage of which the Minister moved this morning.  I found it difficult to credit what I thought I heard.  That was why I was so anxious to get a copy of the Second Reading speech the Minister made, when he almost <Col N="658" /> created the precedent that a copy of his speech would not be circulated.</P>
      <P>I never did hear a Minister for Lands introducing a Land Bond Bill. The Minister mentioned that we had had Land Bond Bills for quite a period and that we had the limit raised to £15 million in 1953&mdash;when I was not here&mdash;to £25 million in 1964 and to £40 million in 1969, when I was here. In fact, it was the first time I heard a Minister for Lands introducing a Land Bond Bill with due apology, indicating that he would much prefer not to introduce such a Bill and indicating also that he agreed fully with all of the people in the House who expressed the view that land should be paid for in cash rather than in bonds.  Then he went on to say that while the view that land bonds should be abolished altogether was one with which he would not find it hard to sympathise:</P>
      <P>we have to be realistic and recognise that until the Exchequer is in a position to provide sufficient funds to enable all purchases by the Land Commission to be for cash, land bonds will continue to play a part in the land settlement programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in that view.  I fully accept that insufficiency of money from the Exchequer is his biggest problem, one which he indicated successive Ministers for Lands had experienced.  One of the things I dislike in the presentation of this Bill, seeking that the limit be raised to £60 million, was that the Minister painted a picture of that amount being sufficient for a five-year period.  In fact, the additional £15 million ceiling that was created in 1969 has been sufficient to buy the amount of land the Land Commission were able to acquire for the past six years.  He is now looking for an extra £20 million to cover purchases for the next five years.  I suppose that is reasonable in the context of inflation.  He said in his speech that since the introduction of the system of cash purchases in 1950 to 31st December last, 57,500 acres had been purchased for £5,072,000.  Roughly that would be a little less than £100 an acre for cash purchase.  He goes on to say that the <Col N="659" /> figures for the 12 months ended 31st December last were 5,700 acres and £1,092,000, which shows an average price of £200 per acre for cash purchase.</P>
    <P>The Minister then talks about the land bonds and it would appear, peculiarly enough, that in one way land bonds are proving more expensive from the State's point of view. The Minister says that during the year ended 31st December last the total issues of land bonds amounted to around £4,500,000, which was the highest ever figure over any period of 12 months, and represented an intake of 13,000 acres.  That means that the land bought through the land bond medium was at a price over £300 per acre, whereas when the Department of Lands were able to buy lands for cash, they were able to buy it, according to the Minister's statement, at £200 an acre.</P>
    <P>Therefore, a Minister for Finance, in the long term, would be very well advised in the national interest to make cash available to the Land Commission to purchase the land for cash, because it would appear that if the Land Commission had cash available to them, they would be able to satisfy the seller and, at the same time, satisfy the Exchequer by being able to buy land at two-thirds of the price they have to pay for it in land bonds.  It must be remembered that from 22nd January the land bond has to be backed and, if you like, the Minister for Finance has entered into an internal national debt at the rate of £16 per £100.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the success of the retirement scheme, and this arises from our joining the EEC.  There is a very complicated arrangement under the scheme whereby the farmer is paid cash and in addition to that gets a pension.  This scheme operates for, say, the 56- to 65-year-old farmer. I am wondering if the retired farmer could be given the choice of cash or bonds.  In taking up the offer he is paid £10,000 for his farm.  Suppose that farmer is the ordinary run of cute, hardworking farmer with his family reared and going away&mdash;that is the reason he is handing over his farm, that he has no son coming after him <Col N="660" /> to continue with the work&mdash;and he gets £10,000 in cash for his farm and his pension in addition.  He will search for a long time before he will get some place to put that £10,000 that will give him the 16 per cent return the land bonds give.  Therefore, he might opt for land bonds.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the Land Commission, under the arrangement we have had, may move in on a son of some big farmer with 200 or 300 acres. He is more of a gadabout, a Fairyhouse or Curragh man, than a farmer.  He sets the land and goes ahead to sow his wild oats.  The adjacent smallholders call to their public representatives and suggest the Land Commission should acquire it for distribution among deserving smallholders.  The result is that the Land Commission move in, and rightly so, on the land that is not being worked.  They pay this young man in land bonds.  At this stage he has accumulated a fair share of debt; the horses do not run fast enough and he gets tips from the wrong people.  He gets £50,000 or £60,000 or maybe gets into the wealth tax bracket; but the Minister for Finance can get after him there.  He goes to a solicitor and after about five years, probate having been taken out, and all the other matters that cause delay dealt with, his affairs are straightened out.  The land bonds have been lodged to his credit and interest is accruing.  However, at the stage that he can go about realising the land bonds, some Minister for Lands has introduced a new set of land bonds at 16 per cent, while his land bonds are at 10½ per cent or 11 per cent.  They are worth only £60 in £100 at that stage, and instead of the land appreciating arising from inflation, the bond has deflated to a great extent, and he finishes up with only 50 per cent of what he had five years ago, which means a net amount of 25 per cent of what he had originally.</P>
    <P>This man may be described as one of the idle rich that no parliamentary party represents.  There is nobody to care about him, but he has not been treated fairly or equally as a citizen of the State.  If he had enough money left to take the matter to the High or Supreme Court to find out whether it was constitutionally correct to deprive <Col N="661" /> him of his means of livelihood and compensate him eventually to the extent of only about 25 per cent of what the estate was worth, I wonder might some learned judge not decide in his favour at some time and create an enormous problem from the State's point of view.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the recent issue of land bonds and expressed the hope that the latest series of land bonds created, which bear interest at 16 per cent, would prove very acceptable to landowners.  Obviously, they will prove to be no more acceptable than land bonds of previous issues.  They are a disaster from the point of view of the man at present who is endeavouring to administer for his estate to qualify for the previous land bonds in which he was paid and which overnight would have dropped in value quite considerably. I heard Deputy Hegarty compliment the Minister, while saying that he did not like land bonds.  I noticed in a speech the Deputy made last year on the Estimate for Lands&mdash; through the courtesy of my colleague Deputy Tunney&mdash;on 4th July in Volume 267 of the Official Report Deputy Hegarty also complimented the Minister as he did today, and said he was very glad we were adopting a more realistic approach to the acquisition of land in that we were now prepared to pay the market value and prepared to pay cash.  I went through the Minister's introductory speech on that Estimate and do not know how Deputy Hegarty got that impression, that the Minister said they would pay cash and that we would have no more of these annoying land bonds.  Possibly he was assuming that with the introduction of the farmers' retirement scheme we would have an overall payment to all farmers in cash rather than bonds.</P>
    <P>I see Deputy Esmonde here and I was also interested in reading his contribution last year on 3rd July in Volume 267 of the Official Report, column 140.  I could be accused of taking Deputy Esmonde out of context, since he made a sizeable contribution, but he said that when the decision to acquire land was made it was <Col N="662" /> very wrong that the people should be paid in land bonds which have shown, over a considerable time, a chronic tendency to depreciate.  He said that if people's lands were being acquired they should be compensated in such a manner that they could put the compensation they received into something else and could keep pace with inflation and the depreciation of money.</P>
    <P>The Minister's answer to that is to come here today, having introduced the last £1 million issue by order of the Minister for Finance on 22nd January creating an amount of £1 million bonds, bringing the amount created to date under all land bonds since 1934 to £40 million, and provide that the series bear interest at 16 per cent.  I suppose Deputy Esmonde can say that the Minister has kept pace with inflation and depreciation in money if the recipient was in a position to hold on to the land bonds.  The glorious thing about land bonds is that they are not redeemable.  I often wonder if it would not be wiser for the Minister for Finance to float land bonds somewhat like the national loan and invite insurance companies and other investors to put money into them at 16 per cent interest and transfer the money so obtained to the Land Commission. But those land bonds are never redeemable.</P>
    <P>This morning Deputy Callanan suggested that the Minister should seriously consider building into this Bill a new section guaranteeing that the land bonds would be redeemable. The Deputy mentioned five years; I should like to stretch it another three years because of my knowledge of the slowness at the legal end in trying to get farmers straightened out.  Those bonds should be redeemable and if it is necessary&mdash;if we cannot do away with them altogether&mdash;that the State should have £20 million for the purchase of land through this medium over the next five years, some such guarantee should be introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hegarty spoke of the great value in the Irish soil and I fully agree with him on that.  I find it hard to understand why a Minister for Finance would not be able to provide <Col N="663" /> £4 million per year over the five-year period to make up that £20 million for the straightforward cash purchase of land.  I am not creating figures but simply going on the figures the Minister presented to the House this morning. Could the Minister for Lands prevail on the Minister for Finance to provide, instead of £20 million over five years in land bonds, a guarantee that out of the huge amount of capital that has to be found now especially when we are moving into a situation of such over-spending that we have anything from £130 million to £160 million being spent this year not being met from taxation this year, sums of £4 million per annum would be available over the next five years to purchase land?  As the Minister himself showed this morning this would enable the Land Commission to buy the land at 6.6 per cent of the price he is paying at present in land bonds and he is also building up a national debt of £60 million.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what former Ministers have done, in view of the enormous 16 per cent interest that has to be paid on land bonds in order to prevail on landowners and convince them when they are ceding land to the Land Commission that there is some justice in land bonds, I am putting to the Minister for Lands, to the Minister for Finance and the Government the urgent necessity of providing this £4 million per annum for the Land Commission.  It is only right to put on record that in my 14 years' experience as a member of this House the Land Commission is a much maligned organisation and is constantly up against the problem of becoming more unpopular with our farmers, whereas the local Land Commission inspector or agent should be the most welcome person around a farmer's place because he is calling on him with a view to improving his situation.  Admittedly, he is bad news from the point of view of the man who is setting his land or not working it sufficiently but the Land Commission come in for a lot of ridicule from politicians and from small farmers <Col N="664" /> who have hoped down through the years for an addition to their land.  I come from a rural constituency covering the centre of the country, the Counties of Laois and Offaly.  My experience is that the officials of the Land Commission are continuously doing their best to improve the lot of the small farmer and could do much more if they had the &ldquo;readies&rdquo; to do business with the very often not reluctant farmer.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that when notice is issued by the Land Commission to a farmer of their intention to acquire land the Land Commission cannot then pay in cash.  When the Land Commission approach a landowner with a view to acquiring his land and institute compulsory acquisition proceedings, the resistance comes under two headings: (i) he does not want to give up his land and (ii) he certainly does not want to give up his land for land bonds.  The Land Commission put a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and follow it up.  The case must go before the Commissioners to confirm that the Land Commission are to get the land.  Then a price must be agreed and if it is not they must go to the courts again for a judgement.  I have no doubt that nine out of ten disagreements would be avoided if the Land Commission could deal in cash.</P>
    <P>I accept that it may not be possible at the later stage of negotiation but at the initial stage, when notice is served on the solicitor or on the land owner, if a price could be agreed in cash much of the proceedings would be done away with.  The landowner's principal objection is the fact that he will be paid in land bonds. Nobody denies he will be paid the full market value for his land but when he eventually lays his hands on the bonds they have depreciated in value.  I imagine the new land bonds at 16 per cent will stay near par for quite a time but when this Bill is passed and we launch the next issue of land bonds at a higher rate of interest, by the end of this year, because I do not expect this £1 million will last very long and I take it the Minister wants this Bill as quickly as possible, the value of the present bonds will <Col N="665" /> depreciate.  I am surprised at the unimaginativeness of the Minister for Lands.  I am surprised that he has not been able to come in with a more comprehensive Bill than a copy of a Bill introduced in 1953, a replica of a 1964 Bill and a 1969 Bill, with his knowledge of the difficulty the Land Commission have had with bonds over the period.</P>
    <P>The Minister departed from the subject of land bonds in his introductory remarks and lauded his retirement scheme.  He said that one of the tremendous advantages of it was that all lands purchased will be paid for in cash.  In claiming credit for this he is condemning the Bill he brought in today and accepting the fact that the system of land bonds is basically a wash-out.  He said:</P>
    <P>In launching the scheme I drew attention to the fact that the incentives which it offered were very generous, indeed liberal, in relation to our national resources, much higher than the EEC guideline amounts and up to the highest level on offer in any member state.  I expressed confidence that there would be a substantial response to the scheme which was designed to enable a farmer, if he so desired, to retire with dignity and financial security after a lifetime of hard work.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a very sensible man, a man who has made sensible contributions in this House down through the years, on both sides.  I am sure he would like to be in a position to come in here with his next Estimate and announce that he has at last prevailed upon the Minister for Finance to provide sufficient money, say £4 million to £5 million a year, to enable the Land Commission to go ahead and really get down to the job with which they have been struggling for years, due to the handicap of land bonds. The Minister said in referring to previous measures which raised the limit:</P>
    <P>I may say that the foregoing amending measures proved non-contentious and got speedy passage through both Houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister came in with a replica <Col N="666" /> of an earlier Bill, just replacing 40 with 60.  The Land Commission have been doing good work but they have been doing that good work with their hands tied behind their backs.  I was influenced by the contributions which I heard coming from spokesmen of the Opposition when I was in Government. Land has always interested me. I was very interested in the contributions made by the Opposition in 1964 and in 1969 on the question of land bonds and how unsatisfactory they were.  I appreciated the problems of successive Ministers for Finance in making that type of money available to the Land Commission.  Now, when we have a new type of Government, when we are budgeting for a deficit of £130 million to £150 million, and when we find it necessary to hand out millions of pounds every day to subsidise organisations like CIE, and so on, why is it not possible for the Government and the Minister for Finance to make available annually a miserly £4 million to buy £6 million worth of land?  Over a five-year period, with £20 million in cash one could buy the equivalent of £36 million worth of land with a saving of £16 million at 16 per cent.  That would be quite an important saving from the State's point of view.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister between now and Committee Stage to have another chat with his colleague the Minister for Finance.  I have spoken before of the length of time it takes from the acquisition of land to its reallocation among small uneconomic holders.  When a constituent calls to me in 1975 and says that Joe Murphy's farm was taken over in 1971 and asks when it will be divided, I have to tell him that Joe Murphy's farm was actually taken over by the Land Commission last year.  He does not believe me because he read in the papers that Deputy O.J. Flanagan was having it taken over in 1971.  I have to write to the Land Commission and get a letter back saying that the compulsory acquisition proceedings had to be gone through and the land was actually acquired on 31st March last.  I send it on to my constituent who is rather surprised because he was promised it about two years ago. <Col N="667" /> Deputy Hegarty said land is held for far too long by the Land Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that also, but the Land Commission are wrongly blamed very often.  I condemn them for holding the land too long but a wrong impression is sometimes created.  The compulsory acquisition procedure and the price negotiations take time.  If we were dealing in cash we could solve 75 per cent of the problem and the economic holders who eventually get the land would have it three or four years earlier.  The land would be in better heart and the nation would be far better off.</P>
      <P>Taking into account the interest on the land bonds and their non-acceptability to the land owners, the Minister should be able to help the land Commission to get out of the rut in which they have been for a long time.  I have no doubt that the Land Commissioners would welcome this. The Minister could come into the House and, apart from praising himself on the farm retirement scheme which we left on the plate for him before we left office, say: &ldquo;Here is something we asked Fianna Fáil to do when they were in office.  They did not do it.  We are now doing it.&rdquo;  This is the same dose as before except that it is costing far more.  It is now costing us £16 in every £100 in land bonds. That is the major difference.  When we have reached that figure we have gone past the stage where we should be using the land bonds system which is so unacceptable to the farmers.  I suggest that the Minister should withdraw the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief because the Bill is restricted and does not give much scope for debate.  I have no doubt that the Minister would be delighted to be able to tell the House that he was in a position to pay cash for all the land acquired by the Land Commission.  My information is that far more cash was available to the Land Commission last year than in any other year.  I should like to know if that is true.  I hope some day the Minister will be in a <Col N="668" /> position to tell the House that there is sufficient money available to pay by cash for all the land acquired but, while there is a scarcity of cash and while there are difficulties in providing sufficient cash to buy the available land, there is no alternative to the land bond scheme.</P>
      <P>There is a revulsion against land bonds on the part of the land owners but I believe that if any other Government agency issued land bonds they would be more acceptable than they are from the Land Commission.  For years land owners have had a revulsion against the Land Commission as well. I do not share that viewpoint.  Anybody who represents a rural constituency has great experience of Land Commission officials at local level and at departmental level.  From my experience in dealing with Land Commission officials over ten years, I could not speak highly enough of them.  However, there is a need for somebody who would do a good public relations job in respect of the whole sphere of the Land Commission's activities.  The lack of a good public relations service is responsible to some extent for the degree of opposition among landowners to the land bond system.  Bad as is this system, it should be explained clearly that land bonds earn 16 per cent interest, a rate which would not be attracted by money invested in any other capacity.</P>
      <P>There are long delays both in the acquisition and division of land but any reasons for such delays should be explained clearly otherwise, the people concerned lose confidence in the Land Commission.  This is another reason for having a good public relations service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to note that there is progress in relation to the farm retirement scheme but it is difficult to understand how a man who wishes to retire from farming is paid cash for his land while land that is acquired, whether compulsorily or otherwise by the Land Commission, is paid for by way of land bonds.  I am aware of one case where, subsequent to the death of a person who had lived alone, the Land Commission were alerted to the fact that the deceased's land had been sold <Col N="669" /> to a local farmer.  As this man was not considered to be in need of land, the Land Commission acquired the farm by compulsory order and the land bonds were paid to the next-of-kin who totalled 21 people.  These land bonds are of very little use to that number of people.  What I would suggest is a system whereby portion of the land acquired would be paid for in cash and the remainder in land bonds. This would be more equitable.</P>
    <P>Regarding the subdivision of land to people in congested areas, it would be wise to devise some means of inducement to the allottees to pay in cash.  Perhaps they could be referred to the Agricultural Credit Corporation or some other lending agency. It would cost them less to pay in cash than to spread the repayments over a number of years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I wish the Minister well and express the hope that at a later date he will be in a position to inform us that there is a sufficient amount of cash available to pay for land that is acquired.  The present system of payment is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds are a State sponsored fraud and if this House passes this Bill so as to create a vast further quantity of land bonds, Dáil Éireann is perpetuating this fraud.  Like the Minister, I happen to be a solicitor and during the past ten or 12 years I have been involved on behalf of farmers in many dealings concerning land.  On many occasions I have had dealings with the Land Commission in this respect.  Consequently, I am aware of the position as are many other Deputies who have spoken today.  I have rarely heard a degree of unanimity such as that expressed today by Deputies on both sides of the House.  The only difference in what is being said from these benches compared with the Government benches is that the people opposite add that the Minister is doing a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any of us who is associated with land dealings knows that at this time of rapid inflation, land bonds are a fraud from the point of view of the people from whom land is being taken <Col N="670" /> by the Land Commission.  There are many people, lawyers and others, who realise now that the acquisition of land by way of land bonds amounts almost to expropriation of property. The Land Commission say&mdash;and correctly, so far as it goes&mdash;that they are giving full market value.  Nominally, that is true and has been true for the past ten or 12 years.</P>
    <P>The price fixed, often after long-winded procedure of appeals, on the face of it is approximately a fair market value but then the person concerned is told he will be paid in bonds.  Many farmers and land owners do not understand bonds very well.</P>
    <P>They assume that if they are told they are getting £50,000 for their farm that they are getting that amount. However, if they open the financial columns of the Irish daily newspapers of the last few days they will see that the current issue of land bonds, the ones in which people have been paid up to today, the 12½ per cent issue, are standing at £83.  For every £100 nominally that some landowner believes he is getting from the Land Commission he is, in fact, only getting £83.  From that the farmer must subtract stockbrokers' commission, if he is going to sell the bonds, and this amounts to about 1 per cent.  This means that he is getting £82 for every £100 he thought he would get.</P>
    <P>This is only in respect of bonds allocated since January, 1974.  Up to that time the allocation of bonds was at 9¾ per cent and, according to this morning's newspaper, they are standing at £62.25 and £62.75.  I know quite a lot of people, allocated bonds by the Land Commission in 1973, who have not yet received the bonds but the Land Commission insist, in spite of the fact that 12½ per cent bonds have come out since and that the Minister this morning announced that he is issuing 16 per cent bonds this year, that they will still get 9¾ per cent bonds.  In other words, if a person was selling these bonds he could do so at £62.25 or if he was buying them &mdash;I believe that nobody other than the Government stockbroker buys these wretched things&mdash;he would do so at £62.75.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> I have a case of a client of another solicitor in my constituency where a widow who sold her farm in 1973 to the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farms were sold in 1972, and years before that, but the Deputy has only made reference to those sold since 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. In the case I have in mind the woman in question sold the farm in 1973 to the Land Commission and she was allocated 20,000 bonds at 9¾ per cent. Through no fault of her own or of her solicitor and, in fairness, through no fault of the Land Commission, the transaction cannot be closed because there is someone in occupation of a small part of the farm who will not leave.  I made representations to the Land Commission that to pay this woman in the bonds which were allocated to her in 1973 would be grossly unfair because they are worth between 62 and 63 per cent of their nominal value.  The Land Commission replied to me, politely but firmly, to the effect that the bonds were allocated then and she would have to take them.  I believe the farm was sold for in the region of £20,000 but this particular lady will now get only £12,400.  I regard that to be as near expropriation of property as one can get.  The difficulty about this Bill is that it is perpetuating that expropriation, it is perpetuating that fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that this Bill is exactly the same as four earlier Bills referred to earlier; it is extending the ceiling of limit on the number of bonds that can be allocated.  None of us were very keen on bonds but if the arguments which were made against bonds on those earlier occasions were valid then&mdash;I believe they were&mdash;they are infinitely more valid now.  During those times we used have inflation at between 1 and 3 per cent per annum and in 1969 it was running at 5 or 6 per cent per annum.  Inflation is now running, on the last full year for which we have figures, at 23.8 per cent.  To take the last quarter for which we have figures, the quarter up to mid-February 1975, inflation would be running at the rate of 32 per <Col N="672" /> cent per annum but we still have this land bond saga perpetuated.</P>
    <P>I understand that somebody has or is contemplating an action in the High Court to have this bond system declared unconstitutional.  I do not know whether that action is being proceeded with but I hope it is and if it is I wish the citizen who is taking it every success in his efforts.  Looking at the matter if not from a purely legalistic point of view at least from an equitable point of view almost inevitably the man must win the case, and I hope he does.  Therefore, even if this Bill is passed it may well be that the whole system will be thrown out by the High Court or the Supreme Court.  If those on the other side of the House were to vote in accordance with the way they spoke the Bill certainly would not be passed but, notwithstanding their total opposition to land bonds being perpetuated, they will probably vote for it.</P>
    <P>In January or February of last year I tabled a number of questions to the Minister for Lands pointing out to him that the then current rate of land bonds at 9¾ per cent was somewhere between £80 and £82 and that people were being paid in those bonds which were only worth four-fifths of their nominal value if one could sell them.  The Minister told me that he had just made a new order bringing out 12½ per cent bonds.  He had no doubt they would stand at par for a good period and would prevent any injustice.  It is just 12 months since those 12½ per cent bonds were issued and they are now standing at £83 and the 9¾ per cent bonds which I complained about because they were standing at £81 are now standing at £62-£63.</P>
    <P>A number of people who were paid in those bonds did not realise the vital necessity of trying to sell them as soon as possible.  There were more people who were paid fairly substantial amounts of those bonds, like £50,000 or £75,000&mdash;only a moderately large farm is worth that nowadays&mdash;who found that they could not sell anything like that amount of bonds because the market could not bear them.  I understand that one of the few people <Col N="673" /> buying bonds at present is the Government stockbroker who more or less has to buy them in order to try to keep a market in them going but he is only buying them on behalf of Departmental funds, or whatever Government stockbrokers buy these things for, in order to create and sustain a market.  The real reason why very few private individuals will buy the bonds is that in practice they are irredeemable.</P>
    <P>What the Minister will obviously tell me at the end of the debate is that I am not strictly correct in that and that, in theory, they are supposed to be redeemable after 60 years, or some enormously long period like that.  I know there are annual draws held for the redemption of some of the older bonds but the amount redeemed each year is minute, a few hundred thousand pounds out of £10 million outstanding, and one's chances of coming up in a draw are negligible; they must be at least 1,000/1 against a holder coming up in any particular year.  In practice these bonds are redeemable but they are also, in practice, like the old British stocks issued away back at the beginning of the century at 2½ per cent and 3 per cent which are now irredeemable and the price of which has dropped in many cases to below £20 for £100 worth of stocks.  The unfortunate people are stuck with these and I am very much afraid that we are rapidly coming to the same situation where Land Bonds are concerned because, if 12 months after they were issued at 12½ per cent at the beginning of 1974, they have already lost one-fifth of their value and if, two years after the 9¾ per cent were given out, they have lost practically two-fifths of their value, that is ample proof that these bonds are little better than irredeemable pieces of paper and it is wrong for the Government at this time of rampant inflation, which will shunt the price of the bonds down further and further quicker and quicker, to perpetuate that system.</P>
    <P>This system was never totally satisfactory. It may have been reasonably satisfactory and not too unfair 20, 30 and 40 years ago when money was holding its value and when there was <Col N="674" /> only very limited inflation.  It is a totally different situation today with 8 per cent inflation in the last quarter alone.  If that pattern is repeated throughout the year it will mean 32 per cent per annum inflation.  One's imagination begins to boggle.  The Minister announced today that he was issuing 16 per cent bonds.  Unfortunately I will be proved right when I forecast that within a comparatively short time these bonds will stand below par.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  It is not so much that the interest rate is inadequate, it is the irredeemability of bonds and the lack of market which causes them to drop so quickly and so drastically.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect of paying 16 per cent on bonds which is important from the agricultural point of view and from the point of view of the division of land.  The annuity is directly related to the amount of interest payable on the bonds.</P>
    <P>For one year now we have had 12½ per cent.  Prior to that for some years we had 9¾ per cent.  We are now at 16 per cent.  I have had experience in the eastern half of County Limerick, where the land is probably better than average, of people refusing to take land when it was allocated to them on the ground that the annuity was too high and they could not afford it. In many cases the annuity was working out at more than would have been paid for conacre lettings of the same land, and a good deal higher in some cases.  These refusals were made in respect of land acquired by the Land Commission at a time when they were paying 9¾ per cent interest on bonds. This year we will have land coming in for division where the interest will be 16 per cent.  On the strength of that the annuity will be 50 per cent or 60 per cent higher and I believe the Land Commission will run into increasing difficulty from now on as a result of this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>People have refused land allocated to them in the last couple of years on the ground that it would cost them too much.  Perhaps <Col N="675" /> they would have been wise to take it and put up with the hardship and loss. As Deputy Donnellan suggests, inflation, which is the cure for all the ills as far as the Government are concerned, would then get them out of their difficulty.  I do not think that is the right approach.  I do not think one should have to depend on inflation to get one out of difficulty.  That will only create further inflation and it is a totally reckless argument to say one should depend on inflation bringing down one's real cost.  I believe these refusals of land in the last year or two were not confined to County Limerick. I believe they were repeated in other areas.  I also believe that the number of refusals will be much higher in future.</P>
      <P>Is the system of land acquisition and division subject to an annuity any longer appropriate?  When the Land Commission was established at the end of the nineteenth century its primary function&mdash;indeed, its sole function&mdash;was to vest in tenants land which they held under very insecure tenure, land owned by absentee landlords who had very little interest in the land other than as a means of income to support their social and other activities.  That situation has disappeared but the Land Commission is still struggling on more or less on the same basis.  It is worth recalling that, towards the end of his period as Minister for Lands, Deputy Seán Flanagan became convinced that the Land Commission as it exists was no longer appropriate and should be abolished. I believe he was right in that and, as time passes, I am becoming more and more convinced that he was right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the division and allocation of land should now be based solely on agricultural principles.  Whatever is likely to increase agricultural output as a whole should be the criterion by which land would be acquired and divided.  We should no longer tolerate this totally inappropriate system inherited from the end of the last century because it is no longer relevant.  One has, for instance, the situation where land is taken from first-class farmers because of local agitation.  My sympathy is nearly <Col N="676" /> always with those looking for more land but I also have great sympathy with those from whom the land is taken because I have come across first-class farmers who had their lands taken from them and divided into small allotments none of which would make an economic farm even when added to existing holdings.  I have seen over the past ten years many cases where a very good farm was divided in such a way that the total production from it after its division was probably less than if it was left with one good farmer in the first instance.</P>

      <P>I have frequently seen small farms taken over by the Land Commission.  Everybody knows that is done.  The Land Commission are foolish to do that.  In many cases it would be far better to sell such a small farm to a good farmer who did not have enough land and perhaps subsidise, as has been suggested, the loan which he would have to get from the ACC, his bank or wherever else he could get it, rather than divide it into units which are so small they are of little use to those who get them.  The proof of that is there are cases where people are now refusing land although they may have spent the last ten years agitating for division of land out of estates which were likely to become available.</P>

      <P>I am afraid we do not get that in Limerick so it does not arise.  I have seen land refused on the grounds that it has become too costly. The Minister will now have the worst of both worlds.  He will drive up the annuities on the land that will be divided and at the same time, even though the amount of interest seems abnormally high, he will have a situation in which within a comparatively short time the strong probability is that those bonds will fall below par and, perhaps, substantially below par.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that a little over a year ago when the Minister issued the 12½ per cent bonds he was in no doubt that those bonds would stand at or very close to par for a good period of time.  A year later they had been reduced by almost 20 per cent of their value.  In spite of the fact that interest rates are dropping throughout the world the value of land bonds is not going up.  On the basis of pure economic laws if interest rates generally drop the value of land bonds should go up but that is not the case.  The House should consider why this is so.  I suggest the reason is that there is no genuine market in bonds.  If you are allocated a large amount of bonds, such as £80,000 ar £100,000, and you put them all on the market together you cannot sell them because nobody will buy them.  The Government stockbroker takes a small quantity each day in order to maintain a market.  You are also faced with the difficulty that in practice the bonds are practically irredeemable.  A family could hold land bonds through three generations from grandfather to son to grandson and they would never be redeemed while they were in possession of that particular family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Land bonds were never completely satisfactory but at no time were they more unsatisfactory than they are at the moment because of the rate of inflation and because of the way their value has dropped over the past year.  It may be a cause <Col N="678" /> of amusement to Deputy Donnellan and other Deputies on the other side that people who thought they got land bonds to the value of £100 last year now find their value is only £82, less stockbrokers' commission, if they can sell them.  While this may be a matter of amusement to Deputy Donnellan and others, it is not a matter of amusement to the unfortunate people who have those land bonds and who are now without land.</P>
      <P>Earlier on I described this as a State sponsored fraud and if one analyses it one finds it difficult to disagree with that description.  It comes very close at least to partial expropriation of property.  There must be grave doubts now as to whether or not the whole system of land bonds is constitutional.  It is no harm to point out that the arguments which are valid at the moment may not necessarily have been valid ten or 20 years ago because the rate of inflation then was nil in some years and very close to that in most years and also because the value of bonds up to about ten years ago did not fluctuate very widely.  They moved very slowly and, perhaps, might go up or down a couple of points in a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but they went down often at the rate of one or two points per annum.  They are now going down at the rate of nearly twenty points per annum.  Something which may have been valid and not unconstitutional 30 years ago must very certainly be called in question today as to its constitutionality.  One of the tragedies about this is a lot of people who get those bonds frequently do not realise how valueless they are until after they receive them.  I know of people who were issued bonds which stood at £98 whom I advised to sell immediately.  They said: &ldquo;I will lose £2 if I do so&rdquo;.  I told them: &ldquo;If you hold on you may lose £10&rdquo;.  Those people some four or five years later are standing to lose up to £40 on every £100 bond, not just £2.  Even if the current issue of bonds were to stand at £98 as soon as they are issued <Col N="679" /> people are faced with a problem. Even if you read about them in the newspapers quoted at £98 you cannot actually get that for them because nobody wants to buy them except the Government stockbroker who will only take a small quantity.  Very often the price which appears in the newspapers as the price of the bonds is a false figure because the Government stockbroker only buys £2,000 or £3,000 in a day, or maybe up to £10,000, when there may be on offer in the Stock Exchange £100,000 or more.</P>
      <P>In the last few years, a moderate sized farm of 100 acres would have made £100,000 and a man who is lumbered with land bonds in that amount could spend the rest of his life trying to get rid of them.  The tragedy is that every week that passes he will get less.  Unfortunately, the only difference between what is now proposed to be issued and what was issued in the past is that the rate of interest is higher, that they will open at or close to par, that they may stay at or close to par for three or six months and then will begin to drop.  This will happen in the very same way the 12½ per cent bonds issued by the present Minister last year have dropped 18 points down to 82 or 83 points.</P>
      <P>We have heard approximately four speeches from the other side of the House and all the Members agreed with what Deputies Tunney, Lalor, Callanan and myself have said in relation to these matters.  We have stated the facts but, in fairness, I must say it is not just now that Fine Gael have become aware of the injustice of the system.  As long ago as 28th October, 1971, in a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Lands the then Fine Gael spokesman on lands, Deputy L'Estrange&mdash;who is still a Member of this House&mdash;spoke on this matter.  It was at a time when bonds were falling perhaps two or three points per annum and when inflation was at a rate of 5 or 6 per cent per annum.  At column 497 of the Official Report of that date he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I come to the question of land bonds.  We are all aware of the <Col N="680" /> appalling hardships which have arisen as a result of the depreciation in value of land bonds.  In some cases they have dropped 20 per cent.  That is unfair and unjust.  If we believe in cherishing all the children of the nation equally we should certainly see that the people are paid cash for their land.  It is not right that one section of property owners should be singled out to be paid in land bonds which depreciate so quickly.  As the Minister knows, that system delays and frustrates the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>That was said when land bonds were dropping two or three points per year. I wonder what Deputy L'Estrange would say in a year when land bonds are dropping at almost 20 per cent per year?  Surely everything he said then is ten times more valid now?  That was the official view of Fine Gael less than four years ago but in spite of that the Minister is now just creating more bonds and perpetuating this grave injustice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lalor and other speakers referred to the length of time the Land Commission take to divide land after they have acquired it, or apparently acquired it.  Frequently it is four or five years before anything is done and very often solicitors are blamed for delays in these dealings with the Land Commission.  Perhaps I might make the point to the Minister, who is a solicitor himself, that the Land Commission have retained a most archaic method of buying land. Could they not adopt the ordinary simple, straightforward way of buying land that private individuals adopt and not have this terribly long-winded system of going before commissioners, going to courts, going before examiners with schedules and having everything checked and treble checked?  It is quite unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Since the passage of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, the great majority of titles of agricultural land are absolute and if they are not absolute on the folio by virtue of that Act they become absolute on a dealing for value if the equity note is more than 30 years old.  In 95 per cent of the cases the equity note is more than <Col N="681" /> 30 years old.  Why cannot the Land Commission accept what is good enough for everyone else and not drag out the legal aspect of the acquisition proceedings in a way that makes it very difficult for solicitors to comply with their requirements?  People cannot understand that while they may sell their farm to a neighbour and have the transaction concluded in a month if they sell the farm to the Land Commission with exactly the same title it can take one or two years to conclude the matter.  Why should it be necessary to go to examiners and to courts in a most roundabout, elaborate and laborious way to get simple points clarified and accepted when an ordinary purchaser can buy without any difficulty?  I know the legal delays are only part of the general delay on the part of the Land Commission with regard to the division of land but it is one element in it.</P>

      <P>All I am pointing out is that the method adopted by the Land Commission with regard to the purchase of land is totally archaic and I challenge the Minister to deny <Col N="682" /> that.  An ordinary individual may buy a valuable farm for £100,000 and have the sale closed in three or four weeks but the same kind of transaction can take 12 or 18 months where the Land Commission are concerned. There is something wrong there.  The individual who spends a large sum of money on a farm is just as anxious to get a good and proper title as are the Land Commission.  If that can be done for an ordinary individual in three or four weeks, I do not see why it cannot be done by or on behalf of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that at a time of enormous inflation, with the clearest evidence of a huge drop in the value of land bonds in the last 12 months, the Minister for Lands is asking the House to enable him to perpetuate and to keep in existence for at least five years more a system that people on every side of the House know is unjust and inequitable.  By asking the House to pass the Bill, I regret to say the Minister is asking us to do something that will cause injustice, hardship and severe loss to many people in the next five years through no fault of their own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputy O'Malley is back with us and that he has made his usual valuable contribution.  He seems to have a very pessimistic view of the functions and operations of the Land Commission and their officers.  He may be influenced by happenings elsewhere but I doubt if there is justification for his remarks.  He described this Bill as State-sponsored fraud.  If that remark can be justified, I cannot understand why he has remained so silent during his years here when we had several Bills dealing with this question.  I suppose he had not the same freedom then as Deputies on this side have with our present open system of Government: we have freedom to voice our views on all matters. Deputy O'Malley had not the same freedom and neither had his colleagues, apparently, since 1922 when land bonds were first created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is necessary if we are to enable the Land Commission to function properly and to pay for the purchase <Col N="683" /> of land from now on.  We have the happy situation where we have 12,000 applications for participation in the retirement scheme.  All land paid for under that scheme will be paid for in hard cash.  The scheme is much more attractive than anything similar in the EEC.  The levels are liberal and this should encourage people who can no longer work their land to hand it over to the State for division.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy O'Malley's view that we should not divide small farms, I hold that people with a low acreage who adjoin such farms and who have a low output would benefit from even small allocations.  I disagree with the view that a smallholding would yield more if it were left to one new owner. Even a small addition to a farm will help to increase its production.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed that during the years land bonds have not fared well on the stock market but making pessimistic speeches in this House will not create the necessary confidence to encourage people to hand over their holdings.  Because of our EEC entry the situation has changed drastically in many respects and people who own land now are guaranteed prices in whichever area of production they are engaged, tillage, dairying or beef.  It would be a help to them to accept divisions of lands and in my county, where we have so many congests, I have never heard of anybody refusing a division.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, it would be preferable to create an atmosphere of confidence rather than to dwell on the theme of this being a State sponsored fraud as Deputy O'Malley did. Although saying that, I suggest to the Minister that in the years ahead he should make as much cash as possible available because people who sell land are not accustomed to going to stockbrokers to deal with their business.  They may need the money for other purposes and the price of land should be in a more convertible form than land bonds.  There is another way to overcome this problem. If people are not paid in cash it should be possible to allow a little more on the realisable value of land <Col N="684" /> bonds.  We talk about an issue of land bonds at 83 and it might be possible to have the value of such issues at higher rates.</P>
    <P>I would point out that despite the fact that many purchases during the years have been by way of land bonds, more than 1,316,000 acres have been purchased by the Land Commission. If the Opposition dwell on the unattractiveness of purchase by land bonds, we should like to know from them the alternative methods they suggest would be more efficient.  When the Land Commission buy land, delays are often caused by the establishing of title.  The owners might be overseas and it might be difficult to contact them.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals specifically with bonds and it is well to remember that in 1950 the inter-Party Government introduced the voluntary purchase of land by the Land Commission on the open market.  I do not know any better way of buying than on the open market.  The suggestion of improving the structure of the Land Commission does not come under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the payment in cash to those retiring. That is our immediate concern.  We have a pool of land available which could be handed over very quickly to the Land Commission and utilised for division.  In my view, the problem of creating adequate cash at this stage will not prevent a person from handing over his land to the commission if he considers it to be in his best interest.  I would prefer to encourage people to do this rather than to discourage them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will also be very brief. I was surprised to see this Bill to create additional land bonds being introduced.  I understood for quite some time that it was the policy of the Minister for Lands to phase out land bonds and finish the scheme.  I do not think anybody on either side of the House can find anything good to say about this scheme.  Although Deputy Taylor was right in much of what he said, he could not find anything favourable to say about the scheme.  In my view land bonds have <Col N="685" /> been the biggest single cause in slowing up land acquisition for many years.  As I said, I was under the impression that this scheme was to be phased out.  I am very disappointed the Minister has seen fit to continue with this scheme which has caused concern to so many people, especially those from whom land was acquired over the years.</P>
      <P>In my constituency the delay in the acquisition of land by the Land Commission in many cases often results in owners giving up their land because if they give it to the Land Commission they will be paid in land bonds.  These bonds in the past have proved unstable and unrewarding as an investment. This has resulted in a delay for the commission in acquiring land for division and has caused frustration to the owners and smallholders in the adjoining area who were expecting divisions.  A farmer who expects to be paid for his land in land bonds will do everything in his power to hold on to his farm rather than have land bonds in exchange for his holding. I hope this scheme will be the last to be introduced.  I also hope that the time will come when the Land Commission will be able to pay cash for any land they acquire.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note that the Minister proposes to pay cash to those retiring under the farm retirement scheme.  This is a very important scheme.  It would be detrimental to the agricultural industry, particularly in the western areas, if the scheme were to be tied up with land bonds.  I would like the Minister to give me a definite assurance on this because I am afraid that at some future date he may try to change it.  As I have said, it is time to phase out the land bond scheme.  It has been most unsatisfactory in the past and I am sure that no Deputy on either side can find anything good to say about it.  If we could find some way of trying the value of land to land bonds, the bonds at some stage might be used by those who have left farming to get back into agriculture, if they have not made the progress they expected in their new life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer in my constituency lost quite a considerable amount of money. <Col N="686" /> He sold his farm for £16,000.  A deposit had been lodged with his solicitor.  The Land Commission decided to acquire the farm.  If the sale had gone through he would have invested his £16,000 two years ago but because acquisition is a slow process, he lost on the deal and will be paid in land bonds.  Now he will not be able to start a new business as he intended.</P>
    <P>From their performance over the years I am sure nobody could say anything in favour of the bonds.  Is there any way in which they could be improved and so compete with other investments?  The Minister should look for alternative ways of financing land acquisition and so finish with land bonds.  If he did that, he would have the support of everyone in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot defend land bonds.  It was remarkable to hear the contributions from the Fianna Fáil Party who had been in Government for approximately 32 years. Over the past ten years I have made a contribution on the Estimate for Lands and complained about the land bond system where there arises the case of compulsory acquisition with the Land Commission paying land bonds.  Those people who are critical of the Minister today took a long time themselves to devise some other system.  It is a wonder they did not do so.  I know Deputy Tunney is not in the House very long.  As a matter of fact, I cannot understand why he is the Opposition spokesman on Lands at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if he ever becomes Minister he may devise a system to abolish these land bonds.  I would vote against this today were it not for the fact that it is necessary to have this issue of land bonds so that the Land Commission can acquire land and give it to small farmers badly in need of it.  I feel very strongly about that.  There is no way in which anybody can defend the land bond system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy <Col N="687" /> O'Malley.  It is a great pity he did not use those words when his Minister for Lands was in office or during the time when his party were in office.  It is a pity he did not persuade them, with his beautiful flow of language, to change the land bond system or provide cash.  I know it is impossible, with the resources at our disposal, to get enough cash with which to pay for all the land acquired by the Land Commission.  I repeat that I would vote against this Bill were it not for the fact that it is necessary for one reason only and that is to give land to small farmers because the Land Commission have not enough cash with which to purchase that land.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the farm retirement scheme.  I am glad that cash is being paid under that scheme but I am not satisfied there is sufficient activity in this respect on the part of the Land Commission.  I know inspections tend to be rather slow and finalisation of some cases takes quite a long time.  I see the Minister says, in the last page of his brief, that some of them have been finalised.</P>
    <P>My only reason for speaking was to express my deep resentment of land bonds.  They have caused a great lot of trouble.  I am aware of people from whom land was taken many years ago who, through perhaps lack of education&mdash;certainly through no fault of their own&mdash;are still in possession of land bonds worth nothing to them and about which they feel very sore. Perhaps the main reason why land bonds cannot be defended is the high rate of inflation which, as we all know, is not of our own making.  Land bonds now worth £116 will be worth only £100 in no time at all.  Perhaps there might be a swing in the opposite direction.  Certainly it would be necessary that there be such a swing in the opposite direction because people are very reluctant to accept land bonds which are worth nothing to them.</P>
    <P>Excepting the question of land bonds.  I should like to congratulate the Minister on all aspects of progress in the Land Commission, and particularly on the fact that since he became <Col N="688" /> Minister he has ensured that there were plenty of field officers operating in County Galway.  As a result of that, quite an amount of land which had been in the possession of the Land Commission for a long time, a lot of it up to ten years, is now in the process of being divided.  Therefore, I should like to thank the Minister on behalf of the smallholders in that direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I think somebody else offered before me.  I rise only to speak about land bonds and, in this respect, I would rather be on the other side of the House.  I am slow to criticise the Land Commission because my family has had long connections with it.  My grandfather was on the Congested Districts Board and my father was Minister in the Government that set up the whole system of land bonds.  Everybody in the House criticises land bonds.  I think I am longest here of those Deputies who spoke on this matter; I am 18 years in this House. Since I came in here, I never heard a person say a good thing about land bonds.  Those Deputies not so long here, like Deputy Callanan, Deputy Tunney and Deputy O'Malley, will not recognise that Land Commission problems form the bulk of our work in rural areas, certainly those west of the Shannon.  It is difficult to stand on this side of the House and say: &ldquo;Do not give land bonds&rdquo; because, if you do not give land bonds, you will have no money with which to acquire land and the small farmer will not get land. While all of us want to see the small farmers improve their holdings we must recognise that the man from whom the land is acquired is entitled to be paid properly and paying him in land bonds is not paying him properly. There are a couple of cases in my constituency at present causing a great deal of anxiety, substantial farms that have been acquired and the owners of which have been paid in 12½ per cent land bonds which would now stand at approximately 83.  With regard to one estate the land court awarded approximately £53,000 to the owner of the property and in the other, with which Deputy Donnellan is very familiar, approximately £25,000 was awarded <Col N="689" /> to the owner of the property.  One has only to do one's arithmetic to calculate how much money those people will lose.</P>
      <P>I find, no matter how one advises a constituent, he will not surrender until the last minute and, very often, he will get an extension on his time of possession, when the land bonds keep falling in value.  In the end, the whole thing is very unsavoury and a very unhappy position obtains.  Small farmers get land; they are delighted to get it and they turn the blind eye on the unfortunate man who suffers virtual confiscation. I have quite an obsession as to the morality of this.  It is one thing which is beginning to come between me and my night's sleep.  I think it is morally wrong to take land from any farmer, be he big, medium or small, and give him land bonds because they are not now worth the paper on which they are written.  It is no good saying to me: &ldquo;They are at 83&rdquo;.  Sure, they are at 83 but, if one tries to sell them on the market one will not get 83.  Indeed, if one can sell them at all, one will be lucky.  The Department of Finance will not accept them in payment of death duties.  One Department foists them on unfortunate people and another Department will not accept them.  It is wrong and we are all responsible. We were responsible in the early 1920s; Fianna Fáil were responsible in the 1930s and 1940s; we were responsible in the 1950s, Fianna Fáil in the 1960s and we are responsible again in the 1970s.  As far as I am concerned, this cannot continue.  I do not know what to advise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One advises the Land Commission to go ahead with the farm retirement scheme, and they are doing good work in that respect, making a pool of land available, paying the man in cash who surrenders it and everybody is happy. If they suspended the acquisition of land by land bonds for a few years, went ahead and divided the land they have in hand&mdash;certainly in County Galway it would take them all of their time to get rid of the land they have in hand as well as the land that will be surrendered to them by retiring farmers&mdash;and did not proceed with acquisition by land bonds, I do not <Col N="690" /> know whether that would make the small farmers happy.  As I see the situation at present, that is the only thing that would make me happy&mdash; that some better scheme be envisaged under which a farmer would receive adequate payment for his land.  At present, my sympathies are with the small farmer who is anxious to make a living.  I am all in favour of giving him a just amount of land but I am not in favour of doing so at the expense of somebody else.  At present it is the few who are being penalised while there are a large number being made happy.  Therefore, the few penalised are forgotten and they are not in a position to defend themselves. There is a system of acquiring land whereby if you are dissatisfied you go to the land court.  As far as I can see, nobody is satisfied with the land court. I am not satisfied with it.  I tried to criticise the land court on the Estimate for the Department of Justice and on the Estimate for the Department of Lands, and I was told it was not appropriate.  I do not know where you criticise the land court.  Be that as it may, my constituents, and I am sure the constituents of other Deputies, are not satisfied with the kind of treatment they get there.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands I could not vote for it.  I shall talk to the Minister afterwards. It is a long time before 10.30 tonight; there is all day tomorrow, and the Bill has to go through its other Stages.  However, I shall give the House one small example: in my constituency last year a person died under doubtful circumstances.  He had a large block of land bonds.  His widow told me she thought his big problem was that he was short of money, he could not sell land bonds, and the whole thing was too much for him.  I say this to the Land Commission officials and they say: &ldquo;We know it is wrong but do not blame us.  You are in Government now.  We have been in Government for only two years.  Fianna Fáil were in Government 32 years.  Everybody knows it is wrong, yet we go ahead perpetrating this injustice.  If we have any honesty at all we cannot continue this.  I should not be saying this from this side of the House but I could not live with myself if I did not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in other areas of his Department.  He has done a great job on the retirement scheme and also on the wildlife preservation and forestry end of his Department, and his officials are working extremely well in their areas.  They are not responsible for these land bonds.  We are responsible for them.  The buck lies here and we cannot pass it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has been any speaker who has said one word of condonation, not to talk about praise, on the matter of giving lands bonds for land acquired.  Land bonds are given only where there is a compulsory acquisition.  A voluntary acquisition can often be arranged for a cash consideration.  Payment in cash is the basis for the retirement scheme.</P>
      <P>I would describe this Bill in terms of &ldquo;needs must when the devil drives&rdquo;, and I want to explain what I mean by that.  Deputy O'Malley went back through the history of the Land Acts, and he was quite correct in saying that the early Land Acts were passed for the purpose of enabling the sitting tenant to acquire the landlord's interest and to make himself a fee simple owner in lieu of the very doubtful tenure he had experienced before that time.  We come to the case of the 1923 Land Act, which I would describe as the Cosgrave Land Act and which is probably the most important Act we have ever had in the land code, because that brought in a certain amount of compulsory acquisition of land that had not existed heretofore under the land code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Act had an extraordinary effect.  In many cases it actually compelled the tenants to become freehold owners whether they wanted to or not. I have spoken to some of the very elderly men still alive who came in under the 1923 Land Act for the first time.  Prior to that they qualified under the earlier Land Acts but preferred not to take the road that was indicated by the Land Act.  They were happy with their tenancy and with the circumstances under which they lived with the landlord.  Anyway this was <Col N="692" /> the effect of the 1923 Land Act and this policy has permeated the thinking on land law to this day.  It has gone to such an extent now that the Minister and his Department are getting constant goading from land owners to take acquisition proceedings and to push the acquisition provisions of the Land Act to the very maximum, and this has meant a larger requirement of money and resources to pay for the land acquired.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about the morality of land bonds because of the way they depreciate.  However, there has been another development in recent times which might dry up the tears of those people who weep about land bonds being given under acquisition. When the 25 per cent stamp duty was brought in to protect the land ostensibly for the people, many people managed to buy land because they had the resources and because they had the extra 25 per cent in their pocket.  I would hazard a guess that a lot of that 25 per cent was ill-gotten gains, a lot of it was got out of machinations in the last war, and land was bought here with that money from underneath the noses of the Irish.  I would not weep too many tears if those people were given land bonds for the land they had acquired, because they acquired land in circumstances that could not be regarded with any degree of pleasure by any genuine Irishman, and the sooner that land is back in Irish hands the better.</P>
    <P>Those words may sound unjust, having one law for one and another law for another.  I do not look at it that way.  The land belongs to the Irish people and, where possible, that land should be made available to Irishmen.  We have had a hard enough historical past without giving rise to events in the present which will create another historical past for future generations to deal with.  One will realise the necessity for this if one looks through my constituency and other constituencies and sees the amount of very fine land and estates owned by people who are not nationals and not even resident in this country.  They have a nominal steward from a nominal company, very often <Col N="693" /> a company in an office that is very hard to find.  It is only on a piece of paper in the companies office and on a plate in some other part of the country.  I am well aware that the Land Commission have had considerable trouble in trying to ascertain the real owners of some large holdings of land in my constituency, and that is the position in other constituencies as well.</P>
    <P>As a Parliament of Irishmen we should realise what the problems are and stop weeping salt tears about land bonds being given to that type of people.  They are only speculators. They are not genuine farmers or landowners, never were and never will be. It is our duty to get rid of that type of person from the land of Ireland. These people are no aid to the nation, no aid to their neighbours or to anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We know enough about our neighbours in a small nation like this to ask how certain people managed to buy land so quickly in such large amounts in certain rural areas.  One of the prize places for these people to buy land is my own county, Wexford, and there is pretty hard feeling among my constituents on this matter.  It is a very hot issue at present <Col N="695" /> and I would not like to see the Exchequer being plundered to compensate these gentlemen who have become new land owners.  Bonds are quite good enough for them and at 16 per cent they are being amply paid and there might be a chance of their paying a little tax on the dividends.  We know how money was being made in the recent past and there is not a lawyer in Ireland who does not know how it is done and that not a penny tax was paid.  I have referred to it on several occasions in this House and elsewhere.  I have claimed no privilege when speaking on this subject.  If those people are compensated by land bonds they are getting their just deserts.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think it is possible to have an improved arrangement regarding land bonds and I am inclined to agree with Deputy Lalor who mentioned a matter that I intended to mention myself, that the land bonds should be buyable by members of the public if they want to buy them and not just allocated as compensation on the acquisition of land.  You would then have a fund of ready cash.  I am certain many people would be interested in buying at 16 per cent, a good rate of interest, and possibly making some arrangement regarding tax in connection with those bonds. Possibly people in the higher tax-paying group would be prepared to subvent land bond issues occasionally. The bigger institutions might be pleased to do it and you would have a fund of ready cash which would certainly assist in the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as Deputy Lalor rightly said, the price paid per acre for land when paid in cash was a great deal less than the nominal price when land bonds were given as compensation.  There may be more than two reasons for that.  First, when cash is paid it is a sale by agreement; there is no contention; there is harmony between the Land Commission and the seller, whereas, when dealing with land bonds, the nasty words &ldquo;compulsory acquisition&rdquo; are associated with them and in those circumstances there is bound to be a bias.  First, the person <Col N="696" /> objects to being compulsorily acquired and secondly he objects to being paid in land bonds and, arising out of that, he sees that he might be left with a non-liquid, non-transferable security and possibly a depreciating one.  Therefore, he fights for the last penny and that costs money and means that the highest possible price is paid.</P>
    <P>To be fair, there is sometimes a misconception about the fixing of the price of land in relation to land bonds. I have been in a case where this was done by the High Court judge on appeal to the Appeals Tribunal when land bonds were standing at, say, ten points below par.  The necessary number of land bonds was allocated to my client on the basis that the price of the land bonds was 90 and my client was also allocated money for the intervening period when he was out of his money.  Fair compensation was paid in that case and the various weaknesses of the land bonds system were covered.</P>
    <P>One might describe land bonds as a Government currency, the Government's way of paying for land acquired.  We are now moving into the realm of capital taxes and this money paid by the Government is of its nature capital and I do not see why, if the Government demands a capital tax, that capital tax should not be paid in the Government's own capital currency.  In respect of death duties and capital tax, I think it is fair that the Government should accept land bonds to meet payment of such taxes.  If that provision were introduced and if land bonds were made available for purchase by the general public just as they would buy saving certificates in the Post Office there could be a constant cache that could be drawn on and bought by members of the public as they wished. Rates of interest go up as well as down and allowing for that, if the Land Commission are any way right regarding the interest rates on their bonds it seems that their issue of bonds would be a viable proposition in the financial world.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the question of the annuity being related <Col N="697" /> to the interest on bonds and he uses this as an argument against voting for the Bill on the basis that this high rate of interest is putting an undue load both on the Exchequer and on the purchaser or allottee, that this would have an effect on the annuity payable. It would, but only in a very small way because basically the price of the annuity, as to its greater part, is assessed and charged in relation to the actual cash paid per acre for the land acquired.  I think the Land Commission have failed to move with the times in just using the land bonds system and the complete acquisition of all interest in the land as being their way of dealing with congestion and allocation of estates.  I have often before suggested that a system of leasing would be a far better and quicker method of getting land allocated and might save the Land Commission capital they now have to spend on the acquisition of land and might make the entire process of acquisition and resettlement a good deal cheaper than it is.</P>

      <P>On 31st March, 1974, the latest date for which completed statistics are available, there were 530 mentally handicapped persons under 16 years and 150 over 16 years on the waiting lists of health boards for admission to residential centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of places for children <Col N="700" /> in the special residential centres rose by 192 in 1974.  The approved building and planning programme will provide a further 232 places for children.  It is expected that 20 places will become available in 1975, 22 in 1976, 90 in 1977 and 100 in 1979.  In addition, a large number of the adult places being provided will release accommodation for children on the waiting lists.</P>
    <P>The number of places for adults in the special residential centres rose by 221 in 1974 and there are a further 678 places in planning or being built. It is expected that 142 places will become available in 1975, 266 in 1976, 60 in 1977 and 210 in 1978.</P>
    <P>Proposals involving the provision of a total of 870 further places for mentally handicapped persons are at present under examination with a view to possible inclusion in the approved planning and building programme.</P>
    <P>Statistics showing the additional numbers of mentally handicapped children and adults requiring places each year are not available.  The results of a census of the mentally handicapped conducted by the Medico-Social Research Board are expected to be available shortly and will provide reliable information on which to base future planning.</P>

      <P>Increases in allowances of this nature are normally dealt with in conjunction with the budget proposals; while provision has not been made for revision of the allowances in question this year, the matter will fall for consideration in relation to the next budget.</P>

      <Col N="701" /> The allowances are payable in respect of all physically or mentally handicapped children who satisfy certain criteria.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concern of my Department with rat infestation is primarily in relation to public health and, in the <Col N="703" /> circumstances, my Department has not undertaken the economic exercise of estimating the annual cost to the economy caused by such infestation.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there has been some increase in the number of complaints of rodent infestation received by health inspectors.  The rodent population appears to fluctuate and I am not aware that it has been established with any certainty that there has been an increase in numbers in recent years.  The increase in complaints to which I have referred could be due to an actual increase in public sensitivity to the presence of rodents.</P>
    <P>Under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, as amended by the Health Act, 1947, the occupier or person responsible for the payment of rates on premises is obliged to destroy all rats and mice on such premises. Health boards are empowered to serve notices on the responsible person to take necessary control measures and court proceedings may be taken where appropriate.</P>
    <P>In 1973 a circular to health boards was issued by my Department pointing out that rodent control can be a serious problem and recommending that health inspectors should make repeated inspections of tipheads, major rodent harbourages and likely sources of infestation.  It was also recommended that consideration be given to the use of the services of specialist rodent control firms on a contract basis, the results being monitored by health inspectors.  If specialist firms were not employed health boards were recommended to consider employing a full-time local worker who, with basic training, could carry out the necessary measures.</P>
    <P>From a health point of view I am satisfied that the provisions and measures set out above are reasonably adequate and my Department is not accordingly considering the drawing up of a national plan in relation to this matter.</P>

Regulations are now being made to include these four and I expect those regulations will be in operation in a matter of a week or two.

The assessment was confirmed, on appeal, by an appeals officer whose decision is final in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.  The rate of unemployment <Col N="705" /> assistance payable to the applicant, subject to the fulfilment by him of the usual conditions for receiving it, is therefore £2.05 weekly which is the difference between the maximum weekly rate of £6.05 at present payable to a single man living in a rural area and the weekly rate of means of £4 assessed in his case.</P>

Following a reinvestigation, a deciding officer decided that the weekly rate of means, derived from capital and some property, should be increased to £2.95.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable was thus reduced to £3.10 a week, that is £6.05 less the revised rate of means.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the growing disquiet among insured married women at deciding officers' decisions to reject their applications for unemployment benefit on the basis of non-availability for work merely because they have a baby; and if, in view of the fact that there is no redress other than to an appeals officer, he will initiate legislation to amend the Social Welfare Acts to provide for appeal to an independent tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that claims to unemployment benefit made by insured married women following the birth of a child may be rejected by deciding officers on the ground that the mother does not satisfy the statutory condition which requires that a claimant to unemployment <Col N="707" /> benefit must be available for employment.  It is not the case however that such claims are rejected merely because the claimant has a baby.  Every claim to unemployment benefit is considered and decided in the light of its own facts and circumstances. Subject to title being otherwise in order, a claim of the kind in question is allowed where the deciding officer is satisfied that the mother is free and willing to resume employment by reason of alternative arrangements being available for the care of her child.  Moreover, claims initially disallowed by deciding officers in such cases are frequently allowed by appeals officers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, may I point out firstly than an oral hearing at which the woman can attend and give evidence in support of her claim is always arranged in appeals made in these cases.  Secondly, the appeals system provides for the attendance also of two assessors representing employer and worker interests respectively. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that a more elaborate appeals system such as the Deputy appears to be suggesting would be justified.</P>

Does he recall that in reply to a Dáil Question on Thursday, 13th February last, he stated that the income for nine months to the end of December last was £8,317,000, while the money paid out, including administrative expenses, was £2,943,000?

I agree it <Col N="716" /> appears that the scheme is in a healthy financial state and I am very pleased that it is.  As the Deputy is aware, previous schemes of a somewhat similar nature have run into financial difficulties and when one is introducing a new scheme one has a reservation that it might run into difficulties.  On the figures I gave and which the Deputy has quoted, it appears that this scheme will not run into such difficulties but it would not be wise&mdash; I am sure that on reflection the Deputy will agree&mdash;to start making changes in the financing and operation of the scheme until at least a 12-month period has gone by.</P>

      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that in the context of the enormous increase in the price of the stamp, involving employee and employer, in relation to the social insurance fund, it would be reasonable that they should expect, when the profit on income over expenditure in the pay-related benefit scheme is more than £5 million, that some assistance will be given to employers and employees in relation to the amount they have to pay?</P>

      <P>The Deputy, in the statement he has quoted, took me out of context.  I know he has not done so deliberately.  He cited a particular period when the scheme was in operation. It is not possible for any of us to assess on the basis of a 12-month operation of the scheme because the scheme has not been in operation for that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the outgoings on this scheme, less than £3 million in a period when quite a considerable amount of pay-related benefits must have been paid out because of high unemployment, should mean that the Parliamentary Secretary would have a reasonable idea as to the expected total outgoings in a 12-month period?</P>

      <P>Following discussions between my Department and Buncrana Urban District Council a house purchase scheme was approved which provides for gross sale prices for the houses built in 1954 of £3,639, £3,366, £3,274 depending on the type of house.  These prices are subject to generous reductions and a tenant who qualifies for the maximum tenancy discount can purchase his house for as little as £1,647 in the case of the larger house type or £1,392 in the case of the smaller.  I might mention that the net prices under the market value pre-1973 scheme for the houses in question were £2,310 for the larger houses and £2,170 for the smaller houses.</P>
      <P>For the houses built in 1962 a gross sale price of £3,295 was approved and a tenant of similar standing would pay slightly over £1,400 to purchase. All the prices were determined in accordance with the sales terms introduced by me in July, 1973 and are considered to be equitable to all parties.</P>

      <P>Surely I am entitled to ask a supplementary question on the provision of £7 million in order to find out what use is to be made of it.  I pointed out in my supplementary question that there are complaints from almost every local authority that not sufficient money is made available to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have already said that the Government gave £51 million for housing this year.  This is nearly three times as much as Fianna Fáil gave for housing for their last year in office. The officers of my Department are going to the various councils to find out what extra money they require. They will recommend to me and make an extra allocation to each local authority and this money will then be made available.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that his Department's house building cost index for January shows an increase of 2.5 per cent?  This index relates to labour and material only.  This constitutes approximately 65 per cent of the total cost.  The real increase, therefore, is approximately 3.8 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

These involve redevelopment at St. John's Square, Limerick, and open space and amenity development at Holycross Village, County Tipperary. Twenty-nine other schemes are being undertaken by local authorities, the Office of Public Works, and voluntary organisations.  Because of the number of bodies, both public and private, involved in projects, the reliance in some cases on voluntary labour, and the variety of schemes being carried out it is not possible to estimate the total employment content.</P>

    <Title>Portlaoise Prison Attempted Escape: Statement by Minister.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>At 8.22 p.m. on Monday, 17th March, a carefully prepared and elaborate attempt to effect a break out from Portlaoise Prison was made by a large group of prisoners there.  The group were at the time in the prison recreation hall where a film was being shown.  The sequence of events which ensued is as follows.</P>
      <P>The lights went out suddenly and, at a word of command, the prisoners threw themselves to the floor.  The doorway from the recreation hall to the yard was then blasted by means of an explosive charge and about 40/50 of the group rushed into the yard and towards a gate-way in the wire enclosure surrounding the yard, while the Prison Officers and the gardaí present were threatened by the remaining prisoners using chairs as weapons.  The emergency lighting system in the prison had automatically taken over from the main supply, which, it was later discovered, had been cut off deliberately by the creation of a shortcircuit not far from the prison.  The gate in the wire enclosure was also blasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At about the same time fire was being directed at the prison from outside and Army personnel returned fire. At approximately the same time a vehicle specially adapted so as to be, in effect, an armoured battering-ram for use against the prison perimeter <Col N="748" /> was driven right through a closed gate leading from the main Dublin Road to the prison farm and then in the direction of the prison wall.  A Garda car was immediately positioned at the farm gate to cut off the vehicle's retreat and gardaí from the area of the main gate of the prison moved towards the vehicle, which by then had come to a halt having been entangled with the protective wire fence which surrounds the prison wall. Two men are being charged in court today in connection with this particular incident.</P>
    <P>The prison had been placed on general alert and the prisoners in the yard were by this time covered by armed soldiers, some of whom fired warning shots and thereby forced them back inside the wired compound. After staying in the compound for some short time they re-entered the recreation hall and the cell block. Later it was established that one prisoner, Thomas Smyth, had been killed from a wound received outside the recreation hall and that two other prisoners had received minor injuries while in the yard.  It is not yet possible to say precisely how the injuries were received.  The results of tests on pieces of metal found in the dead man's body have not been received.</P>
    <P>At this point I want to make it quite clear that allegations or reports that official spokesmen have been asserting that the dead man was shot, or alternatively, have been asserting that he was not, are equally without foundation.  From the facts as estab lished to date it does not appear that the dead man was killed by a direct hit by a bullet.  The question whether he was killed by shrapnel from the explosion or from parts of a ricochetting bullet remains to be established by scientific tests of various pieces of metal.  The results of the tests will be presented publicly at the inquest.  The necessary tests were in progress yesterday and are being continued.</P>
    <P>The amounts of explosives used to blast the two gates were very small. A tentative estimate is that not more than 4 ozs. were used and possibly less.  A search of the prison and the <Col N="749" /> prisoners which was carried out on Monday night did not uncover any explosives or any other escape material.</P>
    <P>The foregoing is a summary of the main facts as known to me at this stage.  I regret that a life was lost in the course of this incident.  I am in no way qualifying that expression of regret if I immediately add that the responsibility for the death rests squarely and entirely on the shoulders of those who planned and those who helped in this attempt at escape in the full knowledge that the attempt could not but involve the most serious risk of death or injury to very many people &mdash; innocent civilians, prisoners, prison staff, gardaí and Army personnel.  The responsibility of these people for the loss of life is equally clear and equally undiminished no matter whether the death was caused by one of the explosions or by a ricochetting bullet or even by a direct hit.</P>
    <P>This was the latest in a series of attempts at escape by violence staged by prisoners belonging to this group over the last number of years.  As I have said previously, Portlaoise Prison is not a &ldquo;maximum security prison&rdquo; or a &ldquo;high security prison&rdquo;.  Such descriptions are wholly erroneous.  The simple fact is that we have in this State no such thing as a high security prison in the internationally - understood meaning of that term.  Apart from the physical deficiencies from a security standpoint of Portlaoise &mdash; or any other of our prisons &mdash; the fact is that to maintain a regime in the prison that would be consonant with the notion of high security would involve the imposition of such restrictions on the movement of prisoners, on the admission of visitors and otherwise as would cause considerable hardship and difficulty in the prison and give rise to public concern.  If further escape attempts are made, recourse to such measures may become inevitable but I am anxious to avoid them if at all possible.  Tightening of the regime has, of course, taken place.  Thus the Army and the Garda Síochána are now providing stronger support to the prison staff and recent experience made it necessary to erect a metal <Col N="750" /> grille in the visiting rooms between prisoners and their visitors: the security consideration that led to the introduction of the grille could otherwise have been responded to adequately only by more severe measures.</P>
    <P>Those working in Portlaoise prison have a difficult and dangerous task to perform but they should know that the Government and people are highly appreciative of the service they are rendering to their country and can be assured of continued support in the task of maintaining security in this institution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the statement which has just been made by the Minister there are a few queries and comments I should like to make briefly.  I would ask him if he is aware that there is considerable public disquiet at the fact that this is the third time in eight months in which explosives have been found in Portlaoise prison and it is the second time in that period in which they have been used.  Is he in a position to give the House and the country any form of guarantee that explosives will not get into this prison in future, where obviously there are very dangerous prisoners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter I should like to put to the Minister is this: The Government have had two reports by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay, one on security in Mountjoy and one on security in Portlaoise.  Neither of these has been published and the Minister on previous occasions when he was invited here to publish them after previous escapes or attempted escapes declined to do so.  Would the Minister not feel now that, in the light of the latest episode, which we all regret has happened, it would be appropriate to publish this report?  Many people are coming to the view that either the report was not of great value in itself, or, alternatively, the recommendations in it must not have been carried out or have been carried out in full.  I am not to be taken as alleging that either of these things is so, but I am saying that the public, in all the circumstances now and in the light of the most recent events, have the right to see <Col N="751" /> what was recommended in those reports.</P>
    <P>The third matter is that the statement as a whole seems to me to be unsatisfactory inasmuch as it does not give this House or the country any more information than was basically already available to them through the newspapers, and in particular it does not inform us whether the man who lost his life was shot by the Army or died in an explosion as a result of explosives which the prisoners themselves had apparently got into the prison.  A <i>post mortem</i> examination has been carried out, and one would imagine that, even for a layman, it should be possible to state, as a result of that, whether a bullet wound caused the death or whether it was a wound caused as a result of gelignite exploding.  I wonder could the Minister give the House further details on that point, as it is a matter of some importance that we should know that and that the country should know it.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I am very conscious of the problems that are faced by the prison officers, the gardaí and the members of the Army operating in this prison.  I am well aware of the enormous difficulties they face in trying to carry out their duties and I join with the Minister in extending to them the good wishes of, I am sure, everybody in this House for their safety and in expressing our appreciation of what they have done and what they will have to do in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the fact that in no sense can Portlaoise be now regarded as a high security prison.  That, unfortunately, due to the events that have happened, is rather obvious.  Is there any alternative arrangement that the Minister can now make in the light of what has been happening over the past 12 months in Portlaoise which would tend to prevent these things happening in future?</P>
    <P>I understand an inquest will be held and I should like to know whether all the circumstances surrounding this incident will come out or whether it will simply be a question of the cause of death.  If all the circumstances surrounding this affair were not to come <Col N="752" /> out at the inquest, would the Minister not feel that it would be in the public interest that some other form of inquiry would be held which would establish the facts of what has been a serious incident?  I say this in no way wanting to apportion blame in any form to anyone but I think it would be agreed on all sides of the House that it is in the public interest that the full facts of this unfortunate incident would be known.  I repeat that I have no wish to apportion blame to any particular person but it is a matter of great wonder and regret, not just to Members of the House but, I think, to many people in the country that for the third time in six months explosives should be found in this prison.</P>
    <P>Under the system of parliamentary democracy which we operate it is fair to say that the buck must stop somewhere and while I have no doubt whatever that the Minister personally has been making every effort over the past 12 months to ensure that incidents of this kind would not happen in future, nevertheless in accordance with our traditional parliamentary democracy he now has to face up to the ultimate democratic responsibility in this matter and if blame cannot be attributed to any one of his servants, the Minister himself will have to consider his own position by virtue of the system of responsibility to Parliament and the people which Ministers hold under our democratic tradition.  Otherwise, our parliamentary and democratic tradition is in some danger, perhaps, of breaking down if there can be constant failures in duty for which nobody appears in any sense to accept responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister gets in, may I ask just two questions? First, what are the orders under which the armed guards &mdash; that probably is the Army &mdash; what are the circumstances under which they are ordered to shoot at the prisoners and, in this particular instance, were they, in fact, given the order to shoot and did they shoot at the prisoners?  Secondly &mdash; perhaps the answer to this would cover the first &mdash; will there be, as has been indicated in various ways, any public <Col N="753" /> inquiry other than the inquest and whatever might emerge from it? Thirdly, would the answer to the various problems arising over the last eight months and particularly this week-end, be the repeal of the Act whereby political prisoners are held in Portlaoise or any other prison and if that would be the answer, do we not look rather foolish at the moment keeping these people in here who, if they were free, could walk the streets of Belfast and Derry due to a dispensation from Mr. Rees?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will comment briefly on some of the points that have been made.  Deputy O'Malley expressed a proper concern for the safety of the institutions of the State and was inclined to imply that because of my presence in my position that they were in some danger.  I should like to remind the House that these institutions have been in no danger from this Government since they took office.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Secondly, these calls for resignation are playing politics with what is a serious national issue. The calls for resignation were made when an escape occurred and we now have the ridiculous position that they are being made again when an escape was prevented.  The third point is that Deputy O'Malley knows, perhaps better than anybody in this House, that the Finlay Report because of the security implications contained in it is not fit matter for publication.  A further point is in regard to whether or not there are further explosives within the prison and so far as searching and care and a high standard of efficiency by the prison staff and the guards and the Army are concerned, and in so far as those efforts can be availed of, there are no more.  But this is not something on which I can give a categoric guarantee. Extra steps have been taken, as I indicated in my statement, by way of the provision of a grille to prevent any physical contact between visitors and prisoners.  This, I hope, will reduce <Col N="754" /> and, perhaps, eliminate the risk entirely.</P>
      <P>Again, as I indicated in my statement, if we were to have a prison that would be secure in the internationally accepted sense of a high security prison we would have to impose a regime which would lead to an outcry.  I am not ruling that out but, as I indicated in the statement, it is something which I would like to avoid if at all possible.  Deputy O'Malley did not consider the statement which he had an opportunity of reading in regard to the cause of death.  I indicated that fragments were taken from the dead man's body which are being subjected to scientific tests to establish their nature and until those tests are concluded and a deduction made from those conclusions one cannot be specific on this point.</P>
      <P>In regard to a point raised by Deputy Blaney and also by Deputy O'Malley there will, in effect, be a sworn public inquiry into this incident because an inquest will be held in accordance with law.  It is a matter for the coroner how he conducts his inquest and what information he seeks to have brought before him but I can assure the House that any information he seeks from my Department or any other Department will be willingly made available to him.  I am not prepared to discuss here the instructions which members of the security forces have in Portlaoise except to say that like every other citizen they are bound by those instructions and the legal implications of them.</P>

      <P>It is a brief question in regard to the reply which the Minister has been good enough to offer and it is on one of the questions I asked him in regard to the orders under which the security guards operate. I also implied, if I did not actually ask, a question as to whether the guards in this particular instance did fire or were ordered to fire at or on the prisoners.  If the Minister feels that this is something that for the moment he is not free to answer &mdash; perhaps it may require to be kept until whatever inquiry he has talked about is held &mdash; that is fair enough. But I should like to know if he can give that information whether, in fact, there was shooting at the prisoners and if so, whether the Minister can state this now?</P>

    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1975: Committee and Final Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope &mdash; I hope this is not a pious hope &mdash; that the number of Acts outlined in the definition section will in due process of time be consolidated into one Social Welfare Act.  The Parliamentary Secretary indicated on Second Stage that there are some 60 Acts and some 350 regulations in existence, apart from a great deal of precedent law on social welfare matters, and he undertook to examine the possibility of consolidating the law.  At the moment it is sometimes difficult to identify one's area of concern.  In the present situation it is impossible for people to know their entitlements or easily to identify such entitlements but there is an excellent publication produced by the officials of the Department; from time to time one hears criticism of departmental officials but this book sets out clearly <Col N="757" /> the entitlements of citizens and on cursory examination people should be able to discover their entitlements.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on consolidation. Nine Acts are specifically referred to in the definition section, which leaves a total of 51 Acts not referred to in this section.  Has a committee been set up within the Department and when does he hope the totality of social welfare legislation will be consolidated? I am not now being in any way critical.  I am, I hope, being constructive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these constructive comments by Deputy Andrews. The initial work towards consolidation has begun.  This is a very complex area and one which causes considerable inconvenience and difficulty not only for Members of the Oireachtas but for the officials and the statutory and voluntary social workers interested in this area.  Deputy Andrews, with his legal background and his interest in parliamentary work, will agree that consolidation is a very large undertaking because of the tremendous volume of legislation in this area which has grown up over the years.  I would not like to give the impression that a consolidating Bill will be before the House in the near future.  The Deputy will appreciate that would not be possible.  Consolidation will require very detailed tedious examination and co-ordination and this will take a considerable time.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's remarks about the officials of the Department. In recent times a very heavy extra burden has been placed on the staff of the Department because of the number of new schemes and the new approach to social welfare.  I can assure the House consolidation will be done as speedily as possible.  It would be optimistic to expect that we might have the measure before the House even next year, but the initial work has started and I am as anxious as Deputy Andrews that the work should be completed as speedily as possible.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="758" /> SECTION 2.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which requires rather close scrutiny to decipher its meaning.  One needs to peruse it several times to discover what exactly it means &mdash; it is couched in the kind of language in which one unfortunately has to couch these sections &mdash; in order to arrive at the kind of benefit or entitlement that finally emerges. Am I correct in thinking that a man or woman reaching 80 years of age is entitled to 70p more than those under 80 years of age?  That is my interpretation of subsection (3) of this section.  Section 2 (1) states:</P>
      <P>Section 77 of the Act of 1952 is hereby amended by &mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the substitution for subsection (2)  (inserted by the Act of 1974) of the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  (a)  A pension shall, in lieu of any other rate, be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  where the weekly means of the claimant or pensioner do not exceed £15&mdash;at the rate set out in Table A to this subsection,</P>
      <P>(ii)  where the weekly means of the claimant or pensioner exceed £15&mdash;at the rate at which, in accordance with that Table, the pension would be payable if the weekly means of the claimant or pensioner exceeded £14 but did not exceed £15, less £1 for each amount (if any) of £1 by which those weekly means exceed £15, any fraction of £1 in those weekly means being treated for this purpose as £1; provided that if the rate calculated pursuant to this paragraph at which, but for this proviso, the pension would be payable is less than 50 new pence, the pension shall not be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, with no disrespect to the draftsman of that section, whilst on perusal on a number of occasions it indicates it has a meaning it is a most complicated form of wording to arrive at <Col N="759" /> the intended meaning.  As I understand it, the means test is being effectively lowered by £1.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary deal with those points?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy's interpretation is correct.  I accept in all legal jargon used in the preparation and wording of Bills not only is it somewhat complex for Members of the House but it would be completely bewildering to members of the general public.  I am glad the Deputy in his opening remarks referred to what he described as the excellent publication by the Department of a booklet which sets out the entitlement of people in what I consider is a perfectly straightforward and simple way.  A person who wants to know what he is entitled to under any of the various benefits would not, I am sure the Deputy accepts, go to the Act and try to unravel out of its wording exactly what he is entitled to.  He would seek guidance by referring to the booklet published by the Department, which sets out, as I stated, in fairly straightforward and simple language exactly what people are entitled to.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy also appreciates, as we are dealing with legislation which affects all our citizens and must be open to legal interpretation, that while we might find the wording of it somewhat strange and at times somewhat bewildering it is necessary, because it is creating legislation, that careful legalistic wording be used in the draftsmanship of this Bill.  I do not honestly believe that poses any problem whatsoever to ordinary citizens because I think their references will be either direct to the Department or to the booklet to which the Deputy has so kindly referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage, in relation to the benefits in the Bill, the Parliamentary Secretary stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They fulfil the undertakings given to the people in the White Paper on &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; which stated that &ldquo;the Government <Col N="760" /> believe that those who are dependent on social welfare payments should be cushioned against price rises and should also be assured of at least an adequate maintenance of their position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other sections of the community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to go much further than that because if that were all that was happening it would mean those who were in poverty prior to the provision of the increases given in this Bill would still remain in poverty.  The Parliamentary Secretary further stated:</P>
    <P>The increases announced in the budget and provided for in this Bill do not just keep pace with inflation. They represent a real increase...</P>
    <P>The increases given in section 2 to pensioners are approximately 21 per cent and the increase in the cost of living, which was announced recently, was given at 23.8 per cent.  In that respect it is not a fact to say that the money made available improves the position of pensioners.  In my view it has the opposite effect because I believe it disimproves it.</P>
    <P>The actual increase in the cost of living of people on low incomes, such as those dependent on social welfare, is very much higher than the average percentage increase in the cost-of-living index.  This is because a very much higher proportion of the income of people in the lower income group is spent on food and fuel.  Therefore, the actual increase in the cost of living of social welfare beneficiaries, particularly those who depend on unemployment assistance and social assistance generally, is very much worse than the increase in the cost of living which was announced.  In my view the 21 per cent increase, which looks big as a figure, does not take into consideration the cost of living increase which was announced and especially it does not take into consideration the extra high percentage increase in the cost of living of those in the lower income groups.  The increases given here, far from improving the lot of pensioners, are not sufficient even to maintain the standard of living they had previously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Even when you peruse the book very diligently you have to refer to the Bill to answer the inquiries of many constituents.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary know how many people over 80 years draw social welfare benefits?  Could we reach a stage when we would say that a man who has reached 80 years of age, especially if he was a lower paid worker and perhaps because of illness or something else has not sufficient stamps to qualify him for a contributory pension, that although we may have a means test he might get a full pension?  That man might have suffered ill-health all his life and might not have been able to obtain a sufficient number of stamps to qualify him for a contributory pension.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider the possibility of giving such people a pension without a means test when they reach the age of 70 or certainly 80 years.  I am not referring to wealthy people but to those who may not have been able to obtain the necessary number of stamps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>To my surprise, Deputy Faulkner somewhat distorted the situation with regard to the increased pensions and the cost of living.  As I stated on Second Stage, with the implementation in April of the various improvements covered by this Bill the rates of social welfare payments will have been raised by this Government since 1973 by 66 per cent in the case of personal rates of benefit, 80 to 90 per cent for single parent families and 96 to 140 per cent for child dependent allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary including 1973?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am including from the budget of 1973.  The percentage increases I have quoted are a matter of public record and they can be verified. Anyone can do the sums, particularly Deputy Faulkner, and there is no question with regard to their accuracy. <Col N="762" /> In the same period the maximum rise in the cost of living has been 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>Therefore, when one relates the increase of 40 per cent which is the maximum by which the cost of living has increased since the budget of 1973 to the 80 per cent to 90 per cent increase for single parent families and the 96 per cent to 140 per cent increase for child dependent allowances, it gives total lie to the repeated suggestions in the House that the increases have not kept pace with the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Deputies should realise what has happened in this area in the last few years.  In July, 1974, there was an increase of 18 per cent and from 1st April there will be an increase ranging from 21 per cent to 23½ per cent while the cost-of-living increase has been about 16 per cent or 17 per cent at the maximum.  There is an undoubted improvement in the real standard of living of people who are in receipt of these benefits.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out before, I am not for a moment suggesting that in all cases these people are well off or that adequate provision is made for them. There are some areas in social welfare that are doing reasonably well but possibly in other areas they are not doing so well.  One of the great drawbacks has been the total lack of research by the Department of Social Welfare.  When I came into the Department not one halfpenny could be legally spent by the Department on any form of research regarding where the benefits were going and their effect on the various categories.  There was no scientific approach and there was no way one could get an overall picture of the effect these very large expenditures were having in the area of social welfare.  I am glad that now we have an allocation and that research can be and is being carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To state that the increases do not compensate for the increase in the cost of living is simply not facing up to facts that can very easily be checked.  Not only are the increases keeping pace with the cost of living but they have given a reasonable improvement in many areas.  One of the <Col N="763" /> most beneficial aspects is the review that will be carried out next October to ensure that the gains made will be maintained.  Deputies who do not speak factually about this matter are not doing any service to the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody on this side of the House said that.  The Parliamentary Secretary is merely reflecting his own prejudices by making a statement of that nature.  It is possible to juggle with figures to suit one's point of view.  One can misrepresent the total effect of increases by distorting percentages to suit one's case.  The reality of the position is as stated by the industrial correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15th March, 1975, when he stated that consumer prices rose by 8 per cent between mid-November, 1974, and mid-February, 1975, and by 23.8 per cent between February, 1974, and February, 1975.</P>
      <P>We come to the causes for the huge rise in the inflationary rate.  We know the Government have been blaming external sources, the Arabs in particular, for inflation in this country but a closer examination shows that it is not the case.  In their January report, the National Prices Commission quite clearly laid the blame for at least 50 per cent of inflation at the door of the Government.  They attributed the rate of inflation to the Government's attitude with regard to borrowing, either externally or internally from the banks, and to a quite unusual attitude with regard to public expenditure generally.</P>

      <P>To refer to the Parliamentary Secretary's reply to my case, I specifically asked him whether he was including the 1973 budget in the case he was making.  He said he was.  In that budget, social welfare benefits were increased, very largely because the Government had available £30 million in agricultural subsidies. Since then, social welfare increases have been tied very tightly to the percentage increases in the cost of living as announced by the Government.  In 1973-74, it was estimated the cost of living had increased by 18 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the levels of pensions.  The contributory old age pension granted in July, 1973, to a person without dependants was £7.30 and that was increased to £8.50 in July, 1974, an increase of 18 per cent, the same as the increase announced in the cost of living.  The point I made was that the increase in the cost-of-living index as announced was much lower than the increase in the cost of living of a person in receipt of a social welfare benefit.  I <Col N="765" /> explained why.  I am convinced that the increases given then did not compensate for the real increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>There is, of course, another problem. It is that the amount of money made available in July, 1973, £7.30, because of rising prices fell in value very rapidly so that by May, 1974, it would buy only £6.20 worth of goods, comparing values of July, 1973.  Because of that it was essential there should have been a much greater increase in all social welfare benefits to compensate for the real cost-of-living increase.</P>

      <P>I was surprised, having listened to Deputy Faulkner, to hear the unctuous claim of the Parliamentary Secretary that Deputy Faulkner had exaggerated.  The Parliamentary Secretary exaggerated out of all proportion. We are talking two years after the Coalition took office.  At that time they had the advantage of £30 million from the EEC agricultural fund.  In their three budgets since they have been paying for increases by extra taxation &mdash; indeed we are having weekly budgets.  The Parliamentary Secretary has been blowing about further increases in October.  The thing is that there have been further increases in taxation to meet those increased benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will have an opportunity of getting on his feet to tell us otherwise. I was glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary saying on behalf of the Minister for Finance that there will not be a budget before Christmas. In view of the fact that we have been having a weekly budget that is a big statement for him to make.  My main purpose in discussing this section is to get the Parliamentary Secretary to iron out an anomalous situation in relation to blind pensioners <i>vis-á-vis</i><Col N="766" /> old age pensioners.  Blind pensioners are not specifically provided for.  A blind pensioner who had been given £7.30 a week and who reaches the age of 68 will have that withdrawn from her and from 1st April her benefit will be increased by the appropriate amount, bringing her to the neighbourhood of £10.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary had a look into the possibility of tackling that specific problem to see if an amendment could be introduced to deal with such a case?</P>
      <P>While I am talking specifically about a 68-year-old blind lady, I know there are many more cases throughout the country.  While I appreciate that there are not too many cases involved, an amendment covering her case would not be very expensive. I know of a widow who, from last week, had her pension reduced from £15.10 to £7.80.  That was her compensation for reaching 68 years of age.  It would have been better for her if the old age pension age limit had not been reduced from 70 because she would then have enjoyed the benefits of the higher pension for another two years.  I am not advocating a higher age limit.  I am merely drawing attention to this specific case. This lady was in receipt partly of a blind pension and a contributory widow's pension of £7.80.  Would it be possible for the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce an amendment to cover this case?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews pointed out a few moments ago, there are many regulations and it was not possible for me to go through them to find the one appropriate to this case.  In the case of a widow becoming less well off by transferring from the widow's to the old age pension, can she opt to retain her widow's pension?  A regulation in the Department says that once she reaches the age limit for old age pension she cannot keep her blind pension but must transfer to the old age pension.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary use his ingenuity to ensure that the person who transfers from one pension to another will not lose financially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the requirement under section <Col N="767" /> 2 that the applicant for the old age pension must reside in the State for a five-year period subsequent to reaching the age of 50 years.  I have in mind a lady who returned to Ireland 12 months ago.  She had spent 46 years in Ireland before going to the United Kingdom.  She is now 68 years of age but will still have to reside here for a further four years before she qualifies for the old age pension. Can anything be done in such cases?</P>
    <P>I do not accept the Parliamentary Secretary's figures of increases of 90 per cent and higher since they took office.  As Deputy Faulkner pointed out, it was very wrong of him to take into consideration the increases of 1973.  What we really want to do is to match the increases in the cost of living in 1973 with that of 1974 and 1975.  Then it will be seen that the housewife's shopping basket can buy less for the £8.85 old age pension of today compared with what could be bought with the old age pension in July, 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with one section of this Bill but one would think we were having a budget debate from the number and range of issues raised.  As I stated before, there is no question about the benefits people in receipt of social welfare obtained and the factual improvements in their standard of living achieved over the past few years.  Anyone can compare the percentage increase in the cost of living with the percentage increase in the various rates of benefit which have taken place over the last three budgets.  It is clear that very substantial increases have taken place in the actual living standards of the various categories, ranging from 66 per cent in some cases to children's allowances which increased by as much as 360 per cent and single parent families from 80 to 90 per cent.  These are all readily available, verifiable facts.  We do not have to speculate about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lalor mentioned the old age pensioner with a blind pension.  I accept that this is a severe hardship. <Col N="768" /> I agree this is more heartrending because we are dealing with a blind person.  The majority of people when they go from an active working life to an old age or retirement pension find that they must survive on a fraction of what they were used to while engaged in productive work and earning a wage.  This is a sorry fact of our society &mdash; a society which the Deputy's party had a bigger hand in forming than my party had.  This is one of the things I hope we will be able to do something constructive about for every working citizen by the introduction of a pay-related pension scheme. At present there is no doubt that when a man who has been working all his life finds himself transferred from the position of receiving a reasonably good week's wages to reliance on our old age pension, as it now stands, he suffers a very severe cutback in his standard of living.  That is something I hope we will be able to rectify in the not too distant future by the introduction of a pay-related pension which would ensure that, after 40 and 50 years' contribution to our society by active work and participation in it, at least such a man would be left with some degree of comfort for himself and his wife at the end of those productive years.  Unfortunately, they are all in the same category at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue is that when a person reaches pensionable age he suffers a setback in his income.  The Deputy cited the question of a blind pensioner.  To do so makes it a very emotive thing but, if one stands back and looks at it, it applies to nearly every working person in our society who is not fortunate enough to be in certain types of employment, which are relatively few, and which give him a reasonable assurance, when he reaches retirement age, that he can keep somewhat the standard of living he has built up for himself and his family in the course of his working life.  Unfortunately, that does not apply to very many of our people.  I hope it is something we will be able to rectify.</P>

      <P>I think that is possibly the only exception.  As the Deputy knows, under legislation two pensions are not payable in this country.  But I said with that exception.</P>
      <P>The question of inflation is a real problem.  Probably it constitutes more of a problem for people on low incomes, such as most social welfare recipients, than for others.  In trying to deal with that problem we have made a new approach, that there will be a review in October &mdash; within a six-months' period &mdash; which, as the Minister for Finance stated, will ensure that the gains granted to social welfare recipients will be protected against inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner spoke about all the money Fianna Fáil would spend in the area of social welfare.  He spoke of the £30 million that fell into the Government's lap in 1973.  Of course, that did not happen; when we got to the cupboard the cupboard was bare, and Fianna Fáil left it bare.  We do not want to dig up history; we will come a little closer.  I had to listen here on Second Stage &mdash; and I heard it again today &mdash; to all that Fianna Fáil would do were they only back in power.  The fact remains that they did not do an awful lot in this area when they were there.  But what is much more important is what exactly are their intentions in this area even when they are in Opposition?  I shall tell you, and it is a matter for public record also.  Deputy George Colley, who was the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance, who was the Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil Administration, published on the 15th of January last &mdash; the morning of the budget &mdash; in <i>The Irish Independent</i>, an article entitled &ldquo;The kind of budget I would like to see&rdquo;.  Deputy Colley, in that article, listed what he would spend and where he would spend it. He quoted expenditure in the area of social welfare as £20 million.  They are not my figures.  I did not think this up.  Any Deputy who wishes can walk down the corridor to the Library and <Col N="770" /> get a copy of that issue of <i>The Irish Independent</i> of the 15th January, 1975.  Deputy George Colley, the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, the present spokesman of the Fianna Fáil Party in this area claimed, and stated publicly in that article, that he would allocate £20 million to social welfare.</P>
    <P>I had to listen during Second Reading and again today to accusations that we were not spending enough, that people were dying of starvation, that we are not keeping pace with inflation.  In fact, we have allocated £35,500,000 compared with the £20 million Deputy Colley, in his own article on the morning of budget day, stated he would allocate in the area of social welfare were Fianna Fáil back in power.  People should take note of that, that not only did they not do so when they were in a position but they were so conditioned to not doing it and neglecting that whole area, even in Opposition, they cannot raise their sights high enough. Even in Opposition when they have no responsibility for finding the money, no responsibility for its implementation, they can come only to a figure of £20 million compared with an actual expenditure of £35,500,000 by our Administration.  To talk of how badly we are doing in this area in the face of those facts I do not know.  God help us.</P>

      <P>It is an ascertainable fact; let there be no question about it. The point the Parliamentary Secretary is now making, on this section &mdash; which <Col N="771" /> is a development of what we were saying &mdash; is that the present Administration are spending £35,500,000 on social welfare.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is making that case &mdash; again, not to beat the matter of the social insurance contributions &mdash; he is clawing back £40 million out of this Bill.</P>

That is the reason why it is as well for us to point out that the Government, in giving on the one hand, are taking back with the other.  They are taking back £40 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It must, then, be challenged by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="772" /> and this is the place to do so. If the Parliamentary Secretary proves to our satisfaction that the total of income taxation being sought under this Bill is not £40 million &mdash; or the March budget as we describe it, dressed up as a Social Welfare Bill &mdash; then we would be delighted to accept his explanation of the figure of £40 million which has remained unchallenged and which we say is unchallengeable. If the Parliamentary Secretary will explain the figure of £40 million and state that it is a figment of our imagination, we will accept that.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary speaks also about percentages.  What we should be talking about here are the amounts of money being added to existing social welfare entitlements. The people who would benefit from the provisions of this Bill will not thank us as parliamentary representatives for talking of percentages.  What they are interested in is money in their pockets, not percentages.  What we must consider is the purchasing power of that money in the context of the most extraordinary inflationary situation that has ever faced the country. The remedy for this inflation is not being sought by the Government. What is important is the amount of the necessaries of life that these increases in social welfare will give to the recipients.  That is what we should be speaking about.</P>
      <P>We should also be talking about a programme, as we would describe it, of direct intervention by the community into the area where people are living in squalid conditions, where people are living in farmhouses on their own, cut off from the community. There are people living in such conditions in rural and urban Ireland.  Listening to the Parliamentary Secretary you would imagine that this Bill was the panacea for all the evils in society.  It is nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil should give a day to a discussion on the whole question of poverty.  The Parliamentary Secretary talks of the research he has conducted in his Department and the plans he has, and we look forward to evidence of that.  However, we as public representatives, <Col N="773" /> have an obligation, in the first instance, to relate our experience in the whole area of poverty in society and to give a lead as to how to cure this poverty.  When the Parliamentary Secretary set up a task force in his Department to deal with poverty he said there were a quarter of a million people living below the poverty line. I asked him on the Second Reading to define what he considered that line to be and that definition is still awaited.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary is making the case that this Bill reduces the number of people living in poverty, I can say that it does not. All this Bill is doing is compensating people with money for the increase in the cost of living.  It is not giving people a better standard of living nor uplifting the quality of their lives.  It merely compensates for the increases in the price of butter, the price of bread, the price of tea, sugar, milk &mdash; all gone out of control in the context of price increases.  Therefore, I do not think the Government should be patting themselves on the back for giving people that to which they are entitled. The Government who created the inflation are compensating for it by the social welfare increases which they are boasting about in this Bill.</P>
    <P>To go back to section 2 and to Table A, I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to comment on the means test and the situation where the weekly means of the claimant or pensioner does not exceed £6.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that is sufficient by present day values?  Does he not think he should increase it by more than £1?  The problem we face under Standing Orders is that we may not put down amendments which place a charge on the Exchequer.  In the normal way we would like to have tested the attitude of the Government by putting down amendments which would uplift the base of £6.  At the same time, we have to be a responsible Opposition. It is not good enough for us to say the base should be more than £6, £9 and so on down the line.  We realise that the cost would be considerable to the Exchequer.  Maybe the Parliamentary <Col N="774" /> Secretary would deal with that question.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews talks about the Bill's effect upon poverty. I am not suggesting for one moment that this Bill will eliminate poverty.  I have never suggested that, but I will say that, if anything, the change of Government has stopped a number of people from joining the ranks of the category of poverty, ranks that were built up over years of neglect.  I would refer to the results of a survey not done by any Government source but by an outside source.  Fianna Fáil either did not believe in research in this area or came to the proper conclusion that it would have been an embarrassment to get the facts.  The facts are that on the only figures that are available so far there are approximately 20 to 24 per cent of our people in poverty.  These figures were calculated around 1971 or 1972&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave these figures.  I do not see any reason to doubt them in the absence of any more authentic figures, but I honestly believe that the policies that were pursued by Fianna Fáil in this area were a recruiting sergeant for the army of poverty which we have and with which we are trying to deal today. I welcome the interest being shown by Deputy Andrews and Deputy Faulkner in this area.  You may look back over the records of the House and you will find that Fianna Fáil never acknowledge this problem.  They regard an acknowledgment that we had people in the category of poverty as an admission of their own failure and because it was that, they refused to acknowledge the problem existed. The first time they acknowledged it was when this Government brought the facts into the open and admitted the existence of the problem.  Some Fianna Fáil members see this as an opportunity, as a stick to beat the Government with.  We know that. Every time I speak on this subject, I fully realise the danger of handing them a political stick with which to beat me and members of the Government. I accept that political risk because <Col N="775" /> I am convinced that the first step that must be taken is an acknowledgment by all of us that this problem exists and to a large extent. Without that acknowledgment we cannot hope to cure it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about the easement of the means test and he spoke of £6 as a very low figure. It is not the figure I would wish to have.  I should like to see no means test at all but it is not possible to achieve overnight all one would like to achieve.  No matter how bad the system, if you see many things of which you do not approve, it is necessary to put something in its place before you tear it down.  You cannot abolish a system unless you have something to replace it with.  We are in the course of putting something in its place and have already taken a number of steps in that direction. We know what is required and we have come a reasonable distance towards our goal and we have work in hand to go the remainder of the way.</P>
      <P>The £6 may not be all we desire but the fact is that two years ago that figure was 50p.  It has gone from 50p to £6 in the space of two years.  That is reasonable progress and Deputy Andrews cannot make much out of that.  I accept that Fianna Fáil have difficulties in Opposition in this area because of their record in Government. That poses major difficulties for any Fianna Fáil spokesman.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is extremely sensitive as well as being rather insensitive.  He has said that he is going to introduce this or that programme.  Every piece of legislation in existence, almost without exception and every social welfare scheme no matter what the <Col N="776" /> Parliamentary Secretary may think about it or how it was done in an <i>ad hoc</i> or grasshopping situation &mdash; schemes introduced without much thought and so on &mdash; was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  Ninety-eight per cent of existing social welfare legislation was introduced by Fianna Fáil.  That is a figure the Parliamentary Secretary cannot challenge.</P>
      <P>What the Parliamentary Secretary has done in this section is consistent with what he has done in regard to all the other sections.  He has built on the foundation laid by Fianna Fáil and undoubtedly he has extended a number of benefits to other categories as the social demand arises.  That seems to be following the pattern set by Fianna Fáil.  The Parliamentary Secretary is extremely well-intentioned, and I say that without any equivocation, but well-intentioned promises must be followed by well-meaning action.  On the basis of what he has said we shall expect a revolution in the Department of Social Welfare.  He is correct in saying that the social needs and demands were not as evident heretofore and there was not as much need for people to involve themselves with the community on a voluntary basis.  Not much thought was given to the whole area of social entitlement and how one's fellow citizens were affected. The people now demand a greater concentration in this area and, as I said on the radio the other evening when the Parliamentary Secretary and I had a rather pleasant confrontation, I think social welfare will become one of the most important areas in the whole administration of Government.  I stand over that now and that is why I say we expect a great deal from the Parliamentary Secretary.  We look forward to what he says he will do.  I assure him that we shall in no way inhibit him or hinder him in the production of any worthwhile scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As he said, you cannot tear down a structure overnight unless you replace it by some more effective structure. The Parliamentary Secretary has promised that situation will come about.  We look forward to it and <Col N="777" /> will give him every encouragement to bring it about.  Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Secretary is introducing a Social Welfare Bill which produces nothing particularly new by the standards he sets himself but he is adding moneys to structures set up under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>There are some 60 Acts and 350 Regulations and quite an amount of precedent law in existence on social welfare.  Most, if not all, of that was introduced by Fianna Fáil and there is no gainsaying that.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that he wishes to introduce a codifying or consolidating Act which will consolidate all these Acts and regulations.  Examining existing legislation after 50 years to see how one can consolidate and codify it is a proper progression in any democratic society.  It is the sort of thing we should be doing.</P>

      <P>On many occasions the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary have compared the record of Fianna Fáil with the record of the present Government and they have referred in particular to the extra millions being spent on social welfare and the high percentage increases granted.  That type of statement is, of course, meaningless; it has no foundation unless it is related to the cost of living.  We are all only too well aware of the enormous increase in the cost of living over the past two years.  We are only too well aware of the highly inflationary situation in which we find ourselves.  Unless we are prepared to take these particular aspects into consideration it is not possible to make a realistic assessment. We have, therefore, to judge these increases in the light of the horrific increases that have taken place over the last two years.  The fact is that an increase of 5/- in an old age pension when prices were constant over a long period was a real increase.  The recipient could buy more.  It is quite a different matter in a highly inflationary period and it is not a reasonable argument, therefore, simply to say that we are spending more on social welfare than the previous Government spent and are a much better Government than they were because <Col N="778" /> of that.  In so far as I can ascertain from the figures available to me, the increase in the non-contributory old age pension is roughly 21 per cent: the increase in the cost-of-living index recently issued is 23.8 per cent and that 23.8 per cent is not in itself the reality.</P>

A person depending on a low income, such as a social welfare beneficiary, spends a higher percentage of that income on food and <Col N="779" /> fuel and has to meet a higher percentage increase in the cost of living than the average issued by the Central Statistics Office and it is important that these matters should be considered when endeavouring to improve the standard of living of social welfare recipients generally.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the differential in unemployment assistance as between urban and rural recipients.  The weekly rate of unemployment assistance applicable to a recipient in an urban area is £7.70.  A recipient living in a rural area receives £7.35; there is a differential of some 35 pence.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary be considering the abandonment of this differential?  If he is not considering it, why does he think it is necessary?  In the case of a person with an adult dependant there is a differential of 45 pence.  That is being preserved.  What is the cost of maintaining the administration of the differential in the context of urban and rural areas?  There may be good reasons for the differential but I have come to the conclusion, without bringing the politics of inflation into it, that one generally finds in rural areas that consumer goods are not priced very differently, if at all, from those in urban areas.  Consequently the distinction seems to me to be out of date.  That is my personal conclusion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This differential was introduced by a previous Administration on the basis that it was considered cheaper to live in a rural area than it was in a largely urban area.  Personally, I am not quite sure that that is true.  This, along with many other things in the social welfare field, will <Col N="780" /> be examined but I could not give any undertaking at the moment that there will be any immediate change in that situation.  In fact, I would have to look at it a lot more closely than I have had an opportunity to do up to now to see how much validity there was in the previous Administration coming to this particular decision and even if there was how much validity there is in it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine it was valid some years ago but not really valid now.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that £6.5 paid to a person with no dependants in rural Ireland is very low.  If that person is living alone I know that home assistance is available to him but I suggest it might be worthwhile thinking of some other way in which the amount of money could be raised to a more reasonable level.  Perhaps extra money could be paid to which he would have a right, rather than having the situation that he must look for the home assistance and the decision rests solely with the home assistance officer as to whether or not he gets it.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me that in such circumstances it might be as well to have some other way in which assistance could be made available rather than have it given in home assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but I am sure that he is aware it is the intention to bring in a reformed Home Assistance Bill in the very near future.  One of the provisions of that Bill will be that benefits will be given as of right.  This is an area to be looked at.  The number affected by the increases, for the information of Deputies, is approximately 62,000 applicants with 37,000 adult dependants and 102,000 children so a very substantial number of people are involved.</P>

      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House how many orphans are in receipt of orphans' non-contributory pensions?  One wonders, having considered the section in some detail and having gone into the general background of the proper principle of entitlements for orphans, at the idea of a pension of 75p per week and the cost of administering such a pension?  That 75p a week might be the difference between heaven and purgatory to the particular individual but, nevertheless, one must question such a pension when considering current day values.  The Parliamentary Secretary will probably say that this principle was set down by the previous Government but anything he might say about them will not be embarrassing to me because our record in the social welfare field is excellent.  The Parliamentary Secretary is merely building on existing structures and has not introduced any new structures.  He has extended the benefits to some degree. Would he answer my query in the context of the efficacy of 75p pension in relation to an income which may exceed £5 but does not exceed £6? No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary, who is very knowledgeable in matters of this nature, will give an adequate reply.  I hope my question will be accepted in the spirit in which it is asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome the reduction in the qualifying age to 67 years.  If we were to compare Fianna Fáil's record with regard to such matters, we could say we introduced the retirement pension for people of 65 years.  Those people in that category who reach the age of 67 will not receive any increase except for the fringe benefits.</P>
      <P>If a person aged 67 years is working and if he decides to continue working, I understand he is no longer insurable in the ordinary way.  If he wishes to continue employment, can he insure for occupational injury?  If he is insured for occupational injury, is this regarded as sufficient protection in the case of accidents?  Will it be regarded by the employer as sufficient protection in the sense that he will continue to keep that man in employment? A considerable number of people who are working at the age of 67 years are frightened that if they draw the pension and reveal their age they may lose their employment.  This is a matter that should be clarified by a positive statement.</P>
      <P>For example, recently a man came to me and told me his wife had reached the age of 67 years and he wondered what prospects she would have of getting a non-contributory pension while he was in employment. At first I thought it was a case where the wife was older than the husband, but when I questioned the man he told me he was 67 years but that he was employed and, therefore, did not want to draw the pension in case it would affect his employment. If a person is covered for occupational injury, is this regarded as sufficient cover by employers generally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person who has been stamping cards for years becomes pensionable and decides to draw the pension while continuing to work, what is his position with regard to health benefits?  What is the position of his dependants?

One can foresee that it will not be long until people retire at 60 years or 55 years, if they are not doing so already, and we will have to consider that situation well in advance.  Because of technological and scientific advances and medical disciplines, people are living longer and they will be retiring younger and I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will examine the proposals we have made about programmes of retraining people for retirement occupations.

      <P>The draftsman engaged in a piece of irony or sheer coincidence because this is numbered 13.  It is an unlucky section for those who are superstitious about number 13.  We would describe it as legislative subterfuge.  It is dressing up a sweet on the outside with all the attractions of the confections but inside there will be the bitter pill.  The section is well known to the people of the country but it has been very well played down by the Departments of Health and Social Welfare.  The GIS have not mentioned it at all.  One can appreciate why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition say that on its imsurabl <Col N="787" /> plementation it will mean taxation of an extra £40 million.  The Parliamentary Secretary has refuted that figure but he has not given an alternative one, whether the figure should be more or less.  This is a piece of penal legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned £35 million as being effectively provided for in the Bill. On the other hand, he rejects £40 million.</P>
    <P>Many people are not aware that this section proposes to raise a further £40 million in taxation.  The employer is to be charged 84p more and the employee 40p more for the insurance stamp, yielding £27 million and £13 million respectively.  By any mathematical calculation that is £40 million. The Government in this matter have been guilty of legislative sleight of hand.  On Second Reading the Parliamentary Secretary was asked what will happen to a figure of £5 million which is being collected under the pay-related benefit scheme.  We say that a figure of £8 million has been collected in the nine months up to 31st December last.</P>

    <P>This Government have raised £40 million under this section by directly taxing the employer and employee. Under the pay-related scheme £5 <Col N="788" /> million is still unaccounted for.

That is one of a series of questions which arises under section 13.  In our view, that section gives this Bill budgetary status.  Any Bill which raises £40 million is a budget by any standard.  We must question economic thinking behind a measure of this sort.

If you examine section 13 closely, Sir, you will see what the section does.  It raises income taxation by sur-charging the employer and the employee to the extent of £40 million. Under the heading of any economic thinking that is a budgetary charge. This Social Welfare Bill could be described as the March budget.

      <P>No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will say that all previous Bills increased social insurance contributions.  We are saying that never in the history of the nation has an income taxation charge been sought in a Social Welfare Bill.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell the House whether it is the intention of the Government to eventually divest payment of social welfare insurance from the Exchequer to the employer and employee?  Will he also explain why this progressive development is taking place?  To date that has not been satisfactorily explained.</P>
      <P>I am sure he will have enough to chew on these few points.  More specifically I would like him to deal with the £40 million increased taxation sought and the progressive divestment of the payment of the stamp on to the employer and employee from the central Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>When the budget provisions for social welfare purposes were announced, I put down a question asking the Minister for Social Welfare the price of the new insurance <Col N="791" /> stamps.  The reply I got was that the information was not yet available.  At that time I thought that a strange reply because I assumed that the Government would have done a thorough analysis of the cost of the increases announced in the budget and would have known immediately the cost of the stamp to the employer and employee. However the reply, while vague in itself, gave one very clear indication &mdash; that the increase would be exceptionally high.  Their hesitation in giving particulars was because they were afraid that whatever welcome might be given to the social and income tax provisions in the budget they would be more than cancelled by the new stamp price.  We now know the increase in the price of the stamp.  It has been widely described by employers as &ldquo;horrific&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions have also been very critical of it.  In so far as the workers are concerned, it has shown them that the much highlighted tax reliefs granted in the budget are a sham. What has actually happened is that they are no better off taxwise than they were prior to the budget.  The saving reaped from income tax relief is now being paid out by them on the insurance stamp.  The cost of the insurance stamp is now a tax in the real sense of the word, as Deputy Andrews has already underlined.  Up to recent times the cost of the stamp was kept within limits and little notice was taken of the relatively small increases in its cost which took place annually.  But I can assure the Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary that, henceforth, very particular attention will be paid to the increases because they now rank in the same category as income tax, VAT and the other types of taxation. The Government will need to exercise the same care in relation to increasing the price of the social insurance stamp as they do at present in relation to other taxation increases. Workers are particularly perturbed about the high contribution they must now make.  I might add that they are equally annoyed by the manner in which the Government dealt with this matter, pretending on the one hand to <Col N="792" /> be improving the workers' tax situation while at the same time planning to take money back from them through another type of taxation and this before the income tax relief came into effect.  It is very much on a par with the manner in which the petrol tax was introduced before Christmas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>The Deputy is now deviating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well beyond the time that the Government should introduce a straightforward budget packet, explain the real reasons for taxation and defend their proposals instead of dealing with such a serious matter in a piecemeal manner.  It shows a complete lack of planning by the Government which can have nothing but detrimental effects on the economy generally.</P>
      <P>Employers have described the increase in the price of the stamp as horrific.  It should be clearly recognised that the only way in which we can assure the under-privileged of a really fair deal is by developing the economy.  Over a short period it may be possible to improve the lot of those in serious need by transferring moneys from one area to another.  But unless we can ensure the development of the economy as a whole, a real improvement in the standard of living of such people will not be effected.  We can increase the percentage of the national cake apportionable to those in the lower income groups but unless we take steps to enlarge the cake as well the poor will remain poor.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the Government avoid taking any steps which might prevent or reduce economic expansion.  It is obvious to everybody that the increase in the price of the insurance stamp to the employer and employee is helping to undermine seriously any steps which had been taken already to encourage an expansion of the economy, such as, for example, the budget deficit.  There will be little doubt that in the highly inflationary situation in which we find ourselves, coupled with the very high unemployment figures&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy <Col N="793" /> is straying very much from the subject matter of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra impost of the social welfare contributions will have adverse effects on employment. Employers will be paying approximately £28 million extra this year in social welfare contributions, at a time when their greatest problem is shortage of cash.  This huge sum will more than offset the measures taken to give relief to firms.  It will reduce also the effect of the meagre expansionary provisions of the budget.</P>
      <P>We should remember also that a very large number of employers are small employers.  Many of them are finding it very difficult to keep going at present and this horrific increase in the price of the insurance stamp may itself force that type of employer to let men go.  Rather than improve the lot of those dependent on social welfare, we will be adding to their number.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech the Minister for Finance stated that he was proposing to transfer the State's contribution to the social insurance fund to the employer and employee over the next six years and that he was commencing this year.  Because of the rather involved way this section is drafted, it is very difficult to ascertain whether or not that is being done this year.  In any case, the argument he put forward was that it was necessary to do so in order to bring this country into line with the EEC situation. In the past the social insurance fund was made up of contributions of the employers, employees and the State, of almost equal amounts.  I see no reason why the State's contribution should be reduced, particularly this year.  In fact I can see a very good case for increasing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would question the reason why we should alter our system to bring it into line with the EEC situation. There is no EEC requirement of which I am aware which necessitates such a change being made and, therefore, we have no obligation so to do.  If our system is the one most suitable &mdash; and it would appear from our experience that at present it is &mdash; then I <Col N="794" /> can see no reason why it should not be continued for the present at any rate until the reasons for the change are announced by the Government and their merit discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>If the reason for the change is simply to get more money for ordinary Exchequer purposes, as was the case with the petrol increase, I am convinced that that would not be a sufficient justification.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the Government to ensure that the economy will expand, particularly for the benefit of those in receipt of social welfare benefits and to refrain from doing anything that might obstruct that objective.  It is not merely the Opposition in this House who have expressed concern about the increase in the price of the social insurance stamp, but concern has been expressed also by workers, employers and the media.  The Government might well take particular note of that.</P>
    <P>Sir, you ruled earlier that it was not in order to refer to the money which is in excess of requirements in the pay-related benefit fund.  I do not propose to go into any detail in relation to it except to say that there are at present approximately £5.2 million in excess. In this section it is proposed that the State, the employer and employee would contribute some extra money because of the current, exceptional, unemployment situation.  I think the amount it is suggested that the State would contribute is £7.1 million, which would leave about £7.9 million to be contributed by the employer and employee Taking those £5 million extra in the pay-related benefit fund into consideration, it would appear that the State proposes to contribute only the difference between those £5 million and the £7.1 million, which would be approximately £2 million, and that the employer and employee will contribute the remainder.  As I said at Question Time, I am convinced that something should be done in order to reduce the overall payments which are being made by the employer and employee and which are exceptional in this year.</P>
    <P>It is also stated in relation to this <Col N="795" /> extra special contribution that it will apply until 4th April, 1976.  From our experience we know that when 4th April comes there will be plenty of reasons found to continue it and I cannot see that it will ever be reduced. Again, I want to emphasise that this increase is far too heavy, that it will damage industrial development and in that way damage the prospects of workers in these industries.  In this particular year and in the present highly inflationary situation in which we find ourselves, the Exchequer should have found a great deal more money for this purpose than they propose to make available to the social insurance fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to these increases and also to the sloppy way in which the whole thing was brought about.  This increase was mentioned in the Minister's budget speech but no details were given, so that when speaking on the budget one could not attack, defend or even praise this matter.  We have got this now some months later and it is a punitive measure both on the employer and the worker at a time when we should be straining every nerve to try to create more employment.  This section will discourage the growth of employment. The social welfare stamp is becoming so dear that the employer may well say that if he could get rid of one employee he would save his wages and perhaps equate this with a saving on the social welfare stamp.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if any thought has been given to the lower paid worker.  Does he pay the same as the higher paid worker?  Over the years we have tried to bring some equity into the matter to help the lower paid worker.  There should be graded payments under this Bill.  The lower paid worker may find that he is far better off not working. I am not suggesting that many men do that type of thing, but the temptation is there, because, due to the crazy system of taxation, if a man works and wants to work to help to create wealth for the nation and for his fellow men, he will be penalised all the more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I remember reading <i>The National Partnership</i>, the White Paper issued by the Government.  While it promised certain increases in social welfare benefits, I cannot recall offhand that it threatened any further increases such as in the social welfare stamp. Over the years there has been an evolution, if not a revolution, in social welfare.  We have now reached the stage that we have to ask ourselves what is an improvement.  Certain benefits are increased but this is nullified by the inflationary situation. Then we have a Government measure which cannot be called deflationary but which will add to that inflation and have the effect of depreciating the take-home pay of the worker.  We can see, therefore, that the Government's whole attitude to taxation and the financing of social welfare benefits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I admit to the Parliamentary Secretary that I had some difficulty with the Bill, but I had not half as much difficulty with it as the Government had.  If there is another budget and more taxation with no specific mention of an increase in the stamp, are we to take it this may well happen before the year is out? This is what we have to try to find out from the Parliamentary Secretary who has devoted a great deal of his time to this.  I suggest that if he is going to hail this legislation as a step forward he should try to reconcile that with the fact that it will be a step forward and will not merely further increase taxation on any employed person.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, is any relief given to a voluntary organisation which has to employ a full-time typist or somebody similar?  Will they still have to pay the full price of the stamp?  We are penalising them enough.  When replying, the Parliamentary Secretary might clear up these few points.</P>

      <P>It is quite true the amount of the increase was not announced in the budget.  Opposition <Col N="802" /> speakers have been trying to put it across that this was a new departure. They know quite well it was the normal procedure, applied year after year since the introduction of the stamp. The procedure is that the Minister for Finance announces a certain increase but he never &mdash; I stress &ldquo;never&rdquo;&mdash; announces what the increase will be. Never has the increase in the stamp been revealed until the Social Welfare Bill was circulated.  This kind of misrepresentation is not even good politics. It is not good sense.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  The average earnings of an industrial worker in September, 1974, were £43 a week. Deputy Fitzgerald, shadow Minister for Labour, must be aware of the inaccuracies that have been trotted out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not try to cloud the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kind of figure any shadow Minister should have at his fingertips.  Of course, wages have increased fairly substantially since September, 1974.  There have been developments on the wage front. However, taking the September figure of £43 a week, the tax gain for a single man is £26.25; for a married man without children it is £42 and for a married man with two children it is £46.18.  The big discovery Deputies opposite appear to have made in this field of social welfare is the additional 10p a week.  As I said earlier, workers want some degree of assurance and some sense of security <Col N="804" /> in this very unpredictable period from the point of view of employment.  If a worker were unfortunate enough to be unemployed for one week in the next 12 months he would recoup the 10p plus any increase put through now.  Deputies opposite talk as if they had found some tremendously contentious item.  They have not.  It does not exist.  First of all, they tried to misrepresent the position by arguing that the increase was not announced in the budget.  They tried to pretend this was unprecedented though they knew very well it was normal procedure. As spokesman for Labour, Deputy Fitzgerald may recall that the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, asked that the Minister for Labour be brought before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for discussing a particular matter before the Bill had been introduced. The normal procedure applied in this case.  There was only one departure: there were two by-elections in Galway and on the Monday before polling day we published the total amount of the increase in the stamp.  That was a departure.  Had Fianna Fáil been in office and thought that this kind of publication might be politically damaging in the by-elections we would have waited until the Thursday or the Friday after polling day to find out the price of the stamp.  We had no fears in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>We respect the intelligence of the workers to realise if we are going through a severe economic crisis and there is large unemployment they must contribute in some way towards the added necessary protection for them during that period. That is the political bone the Deputies have been worrying for God knows how long.  They should face up to the realities because there are very little pickings on it.  If it gives the Deputies any consolation they are welcome to chew away for another while.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Parliamentary Secretary. He reminded me of the boy at school who committed a childish prank who went home to his father and told him he did not do it.  As he looked across at us in a most apologetic kind of way he was also trying to tell us that he did not do it.  I am afraid, no matter how he sets out to convince people, it will be forever remembered that he was the man who increased the cost of the social welfare stamp by this enormous amount at a time in the history of the country when the working people never needed support so much.  He will also be remembered as the Labour Parliamentary Secretary who turned his back on the working man and on the people he allegedly represents.  I am sure recent events are omens in themselves and indicate clearly to him that even at his own organisation level difficulties have arisen and the people there have seen the light and seen that the happy Coalition days are over, the bonanza he spoke about, where social welfare is concerned, is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could go into detail, if I was allowed to do under the section, and tell the Parliamentary Secretary why that bonanza was achieved and what little credit was due to the present holders of office.  We have £40 million budgeted for by the Parliamentary Secretary on the instructions of his colleague the Minister for Finance.  We naturally cast our minds back to when the Minister for Finance sat in a stoney silence the night he introduced his budget.  When he was asked by Deputy Dowling how much the stamp increase would be he refused to answer.  Nobody then believed that any Parliamentary Secretary or any Government could bring about an increase in the cost of a stamp of almost 40 per cent.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell me when was the last time we had an increase of this magnitude in the cost of the social welfare stamp?  What research did he do into the effect this <Col N="806" /> will have on the working people?  The Parliamentary Secretary's officials are good at producing figures which try to create an impression.  He may say to me that the average wage of an industrial worker in this country is £43.  I would love to believe that every worker was earning that money.  The emphasis is on &ldquo;average&rdquo; and we must remember that many people are not earning that amount of money.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary allegedly claims to be the man championing the less well off in our society. We also have a Government who talk about the redistribution of wealth. They should change that title to the creation of poverty.  Never have a Government, in the short period they have been in office, created so much poverty as this Government.  I believe the Parliamentary Secretary, as distinct from the others, was sincere in his utterances but it is now obvious he has no more interest in the ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>Last November we had an increase in the cost of the social welfare stamp. We were told that the working man would have to have his health contribution in the stamp increased.  The Parliamentary Secretary will probably say that was not his function, that it was his Minister who imposed that increase. The Parliamentary Secretary is imposing the present increase and we will have another increase.  In other words, we will have had three increases in the space of four months. This Bill imposes an increase of £1.25p in the price of the stamp, divided between the employer and the employee. I am not concerned about the extra imposition on the employer.  I advise the Parliamentary Secretary to listen carefully to me because I will hang this around his head in six or 12 months' time.</P>

      <P>I will say to the Parliamentary Secretary in six months time that he was the cause of losing this or that job because he is telling the employer that he must pay 80p extra per employee per week.  I understand for the ordinary male employee the cost of the stamp, holiday pay and superannuation will be £7.50 per week. This is around the figure the Parliamentary Secretary spoke about.  This imposition will cut down on employment and increase the unemployment situation.  Is the Parliamentary Secretary determined, like some of his colleagues in Government, to create a country where eventually there will be no work available?  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has been led astray and advised by people in a certain way.  He should go back and research this thing because I believe, slowly and surely, the Government are grinding the wheels of industry to a halt. The Parliamentary Secretary looks dubiously at me and indicates I am not sincere in what I say.  Have we not over 102,000 unemployed in the middle of March?  In addition to that there is a lack of confidence in people, a fear of the awful word &ldquo;redundancy&rdquo; and of receiving notice, a fear of going in on a Monday morning and being told their jobs are gone and they are being laid off.  The Parliamentary Secretary is asking for 80p extra from many employers who are in difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about employees working in certain specific industries. Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me how many industries have not yet implemented the final phase of the 14th round agreement?  How many of them have not implemented the first phase of the 15th round or part of it?  Why is that?  Why is there an escape clause in the new wage agreement? It is simply because so many firms and industries are tottering. The employer is being loaded with more burdens in an already critical situation.  My concern is not for the employer in such circumstances but for the many employees.  If, as a result of this measure, a firm decides to economise and to cut its work force, the Parliamentary Secretary must accept responsibility for the <Col N="808" /> redundancies created.  Under this section the employee is asked to pay an extra 45p.  Before Christmas he was asked to pay 11p&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am warning the Parliamentary Secretary of the situation that exists.  He is a Labour Party member but he does not appear to have concern for the people who have not been paid increases under the 14th and 15th wage rounds.  Is he aware that they may not be paid those increases, that, in fact, many of the workers are on a three- or a four-day week?  If I were Parliamentary Secretary in those circumstances I would resign or I would be frank with people and admit I had let them down.  I would not deliberately tell untruths and misrepresent their situation and I would not ask them to accept another burden.  If the liaison of the Left means anything, the end of the Labour Party is in sight and obviously the political career of the Parliamentary Secretary is in danger. For that reason I advise him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did a lot more for the working people of Ireland in a practical way; I created jobs for them and I worked with them.  Because of the Parliamentary Secretary's sour grapes he is being most personal in this House.  I am not making any jokes about the working people and if the Parliamentary Secretary alleges I am doing so I can only say shame on him.</P>
      <P>By imposing this extra cost on the working people, not only is the Parliamentary Secretary saddling them with more burdens but he is putting jobs in jeopardy.  I know of many firms&mdash; I can name them&mdash;where the wage agreements have not been honoured and where jobs are in jeopardy.  The Parliamentary Secretary should be ashamed of introducing this Bill in the present circumstances.  I am glad we are opposing it; I am convinced it should be opposed every inch of the way.</P>
      <P>Today we had a discussion on pay-related benefits.  We found there was a huge income in the first nine months of the year, one that was well in line with budgeted figures.  However, the expenditure was only equivalent to about one-third of that amount.  That extra revenue obtained by the Government should have been utilised so that the extra increases sought under this section would not be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few minutes ago the Parliamentary Secretary said there has been no increase in social welfare contributions since last November.  From April next an employee will have to pay £1.95 for his social welfare stamp.  That man will not be concerned about how this amount may be broken up; all he is interested in is the fact that he will <Col N="810" /> have to pay practically £2 per week. Despite what the Parliamentary Secretary may say, there was an increase of 11p in the cost of the stamp last November, there has been the huge increase of 45p and now the employee is being asked to pay more.  There have been three increases in a few short months in the cost of the social welfare stamp.  The amount will cover three different contributions but it all comes from the pocket of the working man.  The Parliamentary Secretary will have to answer the questions of the people when the time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion has been deliberately led into a debating <i>cul-de-sac</i> by the Parliamentary Secretary and, having reached the wall at the end, we must pull back and get to the basis of Fianna Fáil's opposition to this section.  The Parliamentary Secretary has avoided challenging the figure of £40 million which we say will be collected when section 13 becomes law.  I do not know if, in the excitement of his contribution, the Parliamentary Secretary deliberately did not deal with the figure of £40 million which we say will be collected but we would like to know if that will be the case.  Equally, we should like to know what the Parliamentary Secretary has to say in relation to the £5 million which is the surplus collected under the pay-related benefit scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner put forward a clear articulate argument on the matter of the £5 million being collected under the pay-related scheme, composed of £8 million in contributions up to 31st December, minus outgoings of £3 million.  This is public money.  We know it is there and that the Parliamentary Secretary can identify it.  We should like to know what will happen to it.  We suspect what will happen to it but we are entitled to keep our powder dry in that respect. I should like to place that specific reference on the record of the House because we can refer to it later when our suspicions become fact.  We are entitled to have this information from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not sit in judgment on the <Col N="811" /> contribution of any Deputy as to its electoral value or otherwise but the Parliamentary Secretary in some way appeared to have cornered the market, as it were, in defence of employees&mdash; how concerned he is about them. How concerned is he about them?  He has now increased their social insurance contributions by 40p a week.  We consider this to be a penal taxation. Let us be clear that in all the juggling of percentages that has taken place there has been nothing like this form of taxation in the history of the nation.  Employers and employees are being asked to pay a combined amount of £1.25 per week extra making the total contribution £4.23 per week for men, of which the employer will pay £2.59 and the employee £1.64.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not washed his hands of the record number of unemployed in the history of the country.  Without engaging in gobbledegook or economic speculation, this will act as a disincentive to employment of extra persons by any employer, or to increasing his productivity. On the January budget we stated that industry should receive £25 million in reliefs.  It got £13 million in tax concessions.  Now what happens? Industry is being asked to pay £27 million in real cash terms.  This Bill proposes to claw out of industry that massive sum.  I called this section &ldquo;unlucky 13&rdquo;.  Not only is it unlucky for the employers but because of its disincentive to employment it is unlucky for the employees.</P>
    <P>The tax reliefs given in the January budget were offset by the imposition of £48 million in new taxation.  I do not want to go over the ground covered by other Deputies but there was new taxation of £50 million before Christmas.  The Parliamentary Secretary would like to suggest that the Opposition lack concern for the workers.  Of course we are concerned for the continued employment of every worker in the country as well as for the creation of new jobs.  In our concern for the worker we must also be concerned about the employer because if an employer goes out of business so do five, ten, 20 or 30 of his workers.</P>
    <P>If there is more unemployment the <Col N="812" /> Government will have to share the responsibility because of the imposition of this extra taxation of £40 million. At the beginning I described it as legislative subterfuge, legislative sleight of hand, and anything the Parliamentary Secretary has said on this section has not changed my mind.  It is not my function to stand up for the employers but if they go out of business workers will lose their jobs.  The work force of this country have done their duty well to the well-being of the nation.  We appreciate that and let it not go abroad that we underrate their contribution.  What we want is work for them.  There are 102,300 people unemployed today.  Our great economic soothsayer, the Minister for Finance, has said the situation will improve in the second half of the year.  We hope it will and any encouragement in that direction that we can give to the Minister for Finance will be willingly forthcoming.</P>
    <P>We do not require a lecture on the philosophy of keeping people at work. The Government philosophy in that respect has been found to be badly wanting.  The Parliamentary Secretary must try to defend an indefensible position: he must say that the economic problems besetting us have their origin in external rather than internal causes.  That is not so.  If we pick up a newspaper any day we will find figures quoted showing what the realities are in regard to the control of inflation.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> last week, with the compliments of the National Prices Commission, it was pointed out that the Government have been borrowing too much both internally and externally.  I should now like to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of Saturday, 15th March, 1975.  I have already quoted the first sentence of this contribution to the newspaper by its industrial correspondent. The heading was &ldquo;Prices up by 23.8 per cent in 12 months&rdquo;. It read:</P>
    <P>Consumer prices rose by 8 per cent between mid-November, 1974, and mid-February, 1975, and by 23.8 per cent between February, 1974 and February, 1975.  Much of the quarterly increase was due to the increases in drink and tobacco <Col N="813" /> imposed by the January budget and to the higher price of petrol.</P>
    <P>The Arabs did not increase tobacco.</P>

What is happening to the balance of £5 million collected under the pay-related benefits scheme?  Why is this surplus not being used for the purposes of this section?</P>
      <P>How was the figure of 31p&mdash;21p to be paid by the employer and 10p to be paid by employee&mdash;arrived at?  As the Parliamentary Secretary said, this will cease operation on the 4th April, 1976.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not yet explained how these projections were arrived at and he must have the answers to those questions.

      <P>I find myself in a very difficult situation. The debate on this section which deals specifically with an increase in the cost of contributions has developed into what might be called a budgetary debate, or even a debate on the Estimate for the Department. I am not casting any reflection on the Chair because, irrespective of the rulings of the Chair, Opposition Deputies have persisted in trying to get on the record what they consider is a great political find and will benefit themselves and their party.  That is the only explanation one could give to the repeated flaunting of the rules of procedure of the House and of the rulings of the Chair.  However, if that is the way they feel they should deal with this Bill, that is their business. However, it is a regrettable situation.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are trying to misrepresent what is happening.  To try to say that this is the first time the stamp has been increased is ridiculous.  The price of the stamp has increased over the years.  We could repeat ourselves <i>ad nauseum</i>.  It is very difficult if one is to observe the rulings of the Chair and the procedure in the House to confine oneself to what is relevant to the section and to speak at length without repeating oneself several times or ranging over a wide field not related to the section.  I do not intend to repeat myself nor do I intend to range outside the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financing of the social welfare system has gone on year after year by increasing the price of the stamp&mdash;a certain proportion being paid by the employer, the employee and the Exchequer. In my opinion no thought has ever been given to whether it was the right way to finance social welfare or if there were alternative ways of doing so.  If there were alternative ways, they should have been examined. Personally I do not believe it is the best way to finance social welfare.  I also believe that the flat rate increase in the price of the stamp is not fair or equitable in all cases.  I think it <Col N="815" /> militates against the lower-paid workers.  I have said that and I believe it.</P>

      <P>We on this side of the House were the first to question the financing of the social welfare services. In fact, the first time it was ever questioned in this House was by me in the Estimates speech for the Department of last year.  We have now announced in the House, although apparently it does not register with people across there, that we are examining the whole question of the financing of the social welfare services.  I think there is a fairer way to do it and I sincerely hope that in the relatively near future we shall be able to come up with proposals along those lines.

However, what I am saying is that even if I believe it may not be the best way to deal with the financing of social welfare, it is not possible to change it until one has something better with which to replace it.  We are now examining whether or not there is a better way to do it.  If we come up with a better way, we will introduce legislation to finance the services in a different way. As I said before, in relation to something else it is neither wise nor possible to tear down an existing structure <Col N="816" /> until one has something better with which to replace it.  We are examining the possibility.  We hope there is a better way of doing it and if there is we will bring it before the House for approval.  I do not think there is anything else can be said relevant to this section without repeating oneself or else range all over the show as if it were a budget debate or a debate on the Estimate for the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to exhaust either the Parliamentary Secretary or the House.  Far be it from me so to do.  But the Parliamentary Secretary does make the point that there is nothing more relevant to be said on the section.  But there is.  There are two matters which he appears to be ignoring.  I do not think he is doing so intentionally but I would ask him to reply to two specific questions I posed repeatedly throughout my contributions on section 13.  The matter of the figure of £40 million is to be raised under section 13.  I will put my question in a different fashion.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary got a figure for the increase which will be raised by the imposition of £40p per week on employees and 85p a week on employers? How much will that income be on an annual basis?  He must have that figure.  He must be able to tell us how much this section will raise by way of increased contribution on the social insurance stamp.</P>
      <P>The second question I would pose is how was the figure of the special increase arrived at&mdash;the 10p to the employee and 21p to the employer, giving a total of 31p?  We are entitled to have that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already agreed with the Parliamentary Secretary on what I would regard as the other matter extraneous to section 13.  He stated that one cannot suddenly pull down a structure without having something with which to replace it.  Of course, we accept that entirely.  Without any doubt one cannot do so without having something better with which to replace it.  But, to return to the two questions I should like to have answered, I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that if we get a reasonable <Col N="817" /> answer then we will put the section to the test of the House.  I cannot go any further than that.</P>

      <P>What it is doing is that in the Estimates for the Department, which were published some time ago, we now realise&mdash;in fact, they are published figures&mdash;that the numbers of people who have been unemployed due to factors of which the Deputy and everyone else is aware have increased and there will be an increased demand on the unemployment fund as a result.  As the Minister for Finance stated, the £15 million is to cater for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we might be able to sort this out a little more if we look at what I conceive to be the mechanics of this.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that, in the first instance, the money is collected by means of a stamp?  That means that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs sells so many stamps.  Is that not really what happens?  Therefore, in the first instance, the revenue goes into the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, through that channel, finds its way into the central Exchequer. When the Minister's Department pays out benefits, they are paid from funds that come from the Exchequer, paid out of the Exchequer so that the flow of funds &mdash; and please correct me if I am wrong; I am trying to get a picture in order to lead to another question&mdash; in this case is as follows: both the employee and the employer contribute the moneys through the channel of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, and that goes into the Exchequer.  That is money into the Minister for Finance, and money out is the disbursement from the Exchequer to the Parliamentary Secretary's Department for the purpose of social welfare.  Therefore, it is a question of balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we do not know is how closely the Minister for Finance has balanced things, because it would be unreasonable <Col N="819" /> to expect that there would be a mathematical balance down to the last stamp.  It simply does not happen in that way.  However, I think the Opposition are entitled to ask the following question: is that sum of money based solely and fairly accurately on the requirements of the Minister's Department or is the Minister for Finance collecting more through the stamp than he needs to give back to the Department of Social Welfare?  With that machinery it cannot but be an estimate for the Minister's Department and the only estimate the Minister can give in order to arrive at the increase in the stamp is on the basis of two pieces of information, that is, the numbers on the books.  That can be a fairly accurate figure and is available to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Is the 31p or the rest of the stamp closely related to that?  Let us take them separately, the increase in the ordinary contribution and the special increase for unemployment.  As far as the increase in the ordinary contribution is concerned, I imagine that a reasonably accurate estimate can be made from the books of the Department as to the sum required and I hope that the stamp is closely related to this; in other words, that the Minister for Finance is not taking a chance on the Department nor getting a rake-off from the Department.  I am not accusing anyone of using those possibilities but they are there.  The possibility is there for the Minister for Finance to underestimate and not provide enough and hope to goodness that there will be fewer claims, to overestimate, or hit the best balance possible.  What I want to know is, is it an accurate estimate?</P>
    <P>As regards unemployment another factor comes in.  This is the question of the statistics of probabilities and in estimating the 31p the Parliamentary Secretary is on a different level.  Here is something outside the Parliamentary Secretary's direct information from his Department.  One freely grants that there is an element of uncertainty in this.  On what basis is it estimated that it is required to levy 31p per stamp in order to cope with prospective unemployment claims?  We <Col N="820" /> are not in a position to discuss this unless we have two bits of information: first, what estimate of rapidly rising unemployment is taken?  I am not asking that for political purposes or to knock the Minister about the head about unemployment.  There is an economic situation here and, as I have said on other occasions, let us all face it and do our best.  Certainly, having made the first estimation of the increase, the Minister will have in his Department the information to say how much benefit is required on the increased figure.  It can be averaged over the number of stamps he knows about in the first estimation and then 31p can be arrived at in that way.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to ask these questions not having been given the information which would categorically refute the possibilities I have mentioned. I take it the Parliamentary Secretary does not regard me as being unfair in putting it to him in that way.</P>

      <P>We need those basic elements to give us some idea: the unemployment increase is of such an order or is feared to be, because that is all it can be, and, please God, it will not be as bad as he fears, and if for that reason he has a surplus, we shall be delighted to see it because it is socially desirable.  We also need to know the number of contributors that are likely to be involved.  If there is unemployment there will be fewer contributors and unemployment may be associated with not only fewer employee contributors but fewer employer contributors.  I am not exaggerating when I say that there is a very heavy burden coming on employers now.  If there is any employment content at all the strain from this source is being felt and I do not think that is an immoderate statement. Would the Parliamentary Secretary answer the question about the figures?</P>

      <P>As Deputy de Valera pointed out estimating for anything, and particularly social welfare, is far from being an exact science.  It is very difficult, if not impossible, to <Col N="821" /> forecast with accuracy what will take place in various fields that affect social welfare.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the question of revenue being collected by way of stamps purchased through the Post Office and that the Post Office sent the proceeds to the Exchequer.  That is not quite the case: they go from the GPO to the social insurance fund. As the Deputy is probably aware, this is always based on an estimate of what will happen and it is impossible for anybody to say now how many will draw disability benefit, how many will be sick or unemployed or how many will draw unemployment assistance between now and next year.  One must judge in the light of experience and current events.  Sometimes you are nearer right than others but you never hit the target dead on.  This is all done on the basis of contributions from the Exchequer, the employer and the employee and calculated after the event has taken place.  I am sure that Deputies will appreciate that while it is difficult in a normal year to make accurate predictions there was a much greater element of risk of error this year in regard to unemployment.  One had to judge on past experience and what was currently happening and predict as accurately as possible how long this trend would continue, when it would peak and when it would come back to what we regard as normal proportions.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister for Finance took all these factors into account when he predicted that we would need approximately £15 million more than had been allowed for in the Estimate for the Department in order to ensure that sufficient money was available for those who became unemployed.  At best one makes an educated guess as to what the developments will be and if that is true in a normal year it is even more true in the circumstances of the last few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This worldwide recession, according to the OECD predictions will be ended a little earlier than most people expected.  Some OECD commissioners concerned with economic affairs have predicted that it is ending.  I do not know if it is a true trend or not, <Col N="822" /> but there has been some decrease in the number of unemployed and in the number on short time in recent times. I fully accept the Deputy's comment when he expressed the concern of all of us at the number of unemployed and the desirability of doing everything possible to ensure that number is kept to the minimum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I completely understand the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary but I think the time has come when we should trust ourselves with information and the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Finance would do a great service to the country if, in matters like this, there was very full disclosure even if it involved the possibility of giving a political stick to an opponent to use.  These sticks will be used in the political battle in any case and it is, perhaps, better that they should be factual rather than fanciful if they are to be used at all.</P>
      <P>I ask for this information because it is very hard in the absence of it to form a reasonable judgment and do what the Parliamentary Secretary wants and what any reasonable Deputy in the House wants&mdash;help in this particularly serious situation. One of our serious objections to this section and to the legislation as introduced was that while it caters for a problem, the cure tends to aggravate the disease.  As the section stands&mdash; apart from trying to get information on which to judge the validity of the increases proposed&mdash;we have legislation here which, while it is palliative and I am sure necessary to some degree to treat the disease, at the same time it aggravates or tends to aggravate the disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment has increased and for the moment we shall attribute that to general recession, blaming nobody in particular for it.  It is a fact, and in that situation you must provide for the increase in unemployment by putting on this 31p levy.  On the other hand, there is inflation and to keep up the social welfare level&mdash; here one might argue with the Parliamentary Secretary although it might be unpopular that he could have made the adjustment in another way; that <Col N="823" /> is beside the point I want to make&mdash; the method of payment he is adopting is aggravating both inflation and unemployment.</P>
    <P>You increase the benefits and the contributions.  If you like, this is a typical commodity price increase.  It is a typically inflationary factor.  It is contributing to inflation.  On the other hand, it is contributing to unemployment because from information I have collected there will be firms at the point where this may prove to be the last straw that breaks the camel's back.  In that event you will be encouraging unemployment.  The Parliamentary Secretary may ask me to give him a specific case, but I hope that this fear is not sufficiently grounded to be really dangerous.  The increase in the cost of labour which this will necessarily involve will mean the discouragement of employment.  It is mainly on that ground I find the section objectionable.  This will aggravate the disease it is alleged to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will not say &ldquo;cure&rdquo;.  I say palliate.  This is not a cure.  The Parliamentary Secretary talked about the financing of the whole system and I have a great deal of sympathy with what he said.  I find it very hard to see how, without a revolution in the whole system, there could be a sudden change.  In the absence of the information the Parliamentary Secretary has not given us I cannot be very specific but I wonder <Col N="824" /> if, in an exceptional case like this, having regard to the taxation imposed over a wide area and over so many items, a straightforward subsidy from the Exchequer would not have been the most economic, the cheapest and most effective way of dealing at least with this 31p increase in unemployment assistance.  Would that involve less administration?  Would it be a less costly method and would it give the Minister greater elasticity?  I confess I cannot answer these questions in the absence of the specific information I have tried to indicate to the Parliamentary Secretary is so essential. One is indulging in guesswork. It is an unhappy position for the House to be left with guesswork when it comes to deciding, as the House will decide, the fate of this section.  Will the Government have so many votes and the Opposition so many votes?  Is that the way in which a serious matter like this should be disposed of or will we come to specific conclusions on a reasonable basis on this section?  That cannot be achieved without much more detailed information than we have at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a new concept introduced into social welfare legislation by the Government and we must give them credit for introducing what might be described as a compensatory section to deal with inflation. The Government are responsible for the legislation introduced and it is understandable that they would take measures to guard themselves against their own misdoings.  We can expect consumer prices to increase in the coming year by 25 per cent&mdash;some economic pundits forecast that they will increase by 30 per cent.  The erosion in the benefits between 1st April and next October will be in the region of 6 to 10 per cent and there will be a decrease in the value of benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the social welfare increases were first announced in the budget last January inflation has taken care of 6 per cent of the increases.  In fact, they will not take effect until 3rd April or 4th April next.  Effectively the benefit of the increases that have not yet been paid has been eroded by about 6 per cent.  No doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will suggest my figures are wrong and, having regard to the way the Dáil operates, there will be charge and countercharge. It is my belief that between <Col N="827" /> the time the increases were announced in January, 1975, and next October when they will be reviewed, inflation will have taken at least 10 to 15 per cent of the purchasing power of the increases.</P>
    <P>We welcome the section.  However, as I suggested during the Second Stage debate, the Government need not be particularly proud about this section. It is a natural development of an inflationary economy; it is an economy that appears to be controllable but is not being controlled.  Because of the intention behind the section we do not intend to oppose it.  On the contrary we welcome it but we do so with the reservations to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is necessary to allow for the increases to be paid in October, to ensure that the increases provided in the budget this year will retain their purchasing power for social welfare recipients.  I regard the innovation of a review&mdash;other than an annual review&mdash;as a welcome and progressive move.  It was something that we had been seeking without success when we were in Opposition.</P>
      <P>In September the House is normally in recess and it would not be possible to adopt the normal procedure of coming to the House then, getting the Bill passed and thus providing for payment of the increases in October. I am glad Deputy Andrews has accepted the progressiveness of this measure and I appreciate the welcome he has given this development.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be good enough to give the House a fuller explanation of the operation of this section?  I appreciate that it entitles people to continue to be voluntary contributors but I should like a more explicit explanation. I do not wish to be critical of the drafting of every section&mdash;in fact, this is probably one of the least complex&mdash;but for the record it might be as well to explain in layman's language <Col N="828" /> the meaning of the section.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this section which grants entitlement to a person who was once a voluntary contributor to become a voluntary contributor once more. Since all workers were compulsorily insured the right to continue as a voluntary contributor was taken away and I think the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that this created a considerable amount of dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>If a person who was a voluntary contributor is readmitted, will be start his payments as from 1st April or will he pay the back payments he would have paid had he been allowed from the outset to continue as a voluntary contributor?  As numerous people were involved in this and as it created considerable dissatisfaction, I would suggest that as much publicity as possible be given to the fact that those who once were voluntary contributors will again become voluntary contributors.</P>

      <P>This is a very desirable addition to the Bill.  People who had built up entitlement during a considerable number of years found that in certain circumstances they lost this entitlement.  This is a means of allowing them, if they so wish, to continue full coverage.  Deputy Faulkner asked whether they should pay from 1st April next.  I had not got the information but I think that if it interferes with their entitlement in any way they would be asked to pay retrospectively but that if it did not they would not have to do so.  I am sorry I do not have the information but I will give it to the Deputy in the immediate future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1975,</P>
    <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on the 12th March, 1975.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this order is to increase as from 7th April, 1975, the rates of weekly contributions to the redundancy fund.  My authority to make this order is contained in section 28 (3) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  There is an obligation under section 5 (1) of the same Act to obtain an affirmative resolution from each House of the Oireachtas and I am now complying with this statutory requirement in this House today.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Redundancy Payments Acts is to compensate employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their own.  Our system of redundancy payments recognises that employees build up property rights to their jobs and that when they lose those jobs they are entitled to compensation for this loss.  This compensation is paid in the form of a lump sum payment and a series of weekly payments related to length of service, age and previous earnings.</P>
    <P>Western economies are at present suffering from the most severe disruption experienced since the second world war.  Unemployment in the United States of America is now more than 8 per cent, an increase of almost 100 per cent on 1973 levels. The recession in America is the deepest experienced since the war, and the OECD suggest that real GNP could fall by 4 per cent.  For the OECD area as a whole, the estimates of growth have been reduced, indicating the world-wide nature of the present recession.</P>
    <P>All countries of the EEC have been affected by the slow-down in world trade brought about by the increase in oil prices.  Unemployment in the United Kingdom is now more than 750,000.  In France unemployment is higher again.  Germany now has almost 2 million unemployed and on short time.  Ireland has also been affected <Col N="831" /> and during the last three-quarters of 1974 unemployment rose and brought with it a large increase in the number of redundancies.  In an open economy such as ours it is inevitable that our economic well-being depends to a large extent on events outside our control.</P>
    <P>The necessity for seeking increases in contribution rates arises in part from the fact that the incidence of redundancies which qualified for payments under the Redundancy Payments Acts was greater in 1974 than expected and the reserves of the redundancy fund have accordingly been depleted.  In 1973, statutory notifications of 7,504 qualified redundancies were received from employers.  The figure notified for 1974, was 11,202.</P>
    <P>The reason for increases in the contribution rates is not entirely due to the employment situation.  Because of the exhaustion of the reserves of the redundancy fund, I have had to make the interim arrangement with the Minister for Finance under section 27 (2) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, for what I might describe as overdraft facilities from the Exchequer. Money borrowed in this fashion must be repaid with interest and I must provide for this repayment.</P>
    <P>The payments out of the redundancy fund are to a large extent dependent on the rate of wage increases and social security benefits. Contribution to the fund are, however, not linked to increases in other areas.</P>
    <P>Wage increases were a factor in the depletion of the fund's reserves during 1974 inasmuch as higher lump sums and weekly payments were payable to redundant workers.  In a situation of increased unemployment, expenditure on weekly payments tends to reflect economic conditions.  In the second half of 1974, expenditure on this front increased and I am providing for a continuation of this trend into 1975.</P>
    <P>A contributing factor in the depletion of the funds reserves, coupled with the other factors already mentioned, was the improvements which I effected in the redundancy scheme last April.  These improvements <Col N="832" /> brought non-manual workers' earnings of more than £1,600 a year into the redundancy scheme thus increasing the numbers eligible for payment.  I also increased the number of weekly payments payable to workers of more than 51 years of age and raised the limit of the total of weekly redundancy payments plus social welfare benefits to 100 per cent of pre-redundancy pay.  These improvements have added substantially to the cost of the scheme and are in line with the Government's commitment to protect the living standards of the less well-off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The redundancy fund was established under section 26 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  Section 27 of the Act provides that the fund will be financed by way of weekly contributions by employers and employees. There is no contribution by the State other than possible periodical repayable loans of the type I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the draft order which I have laid before the House, I am proposing an increase of 5p in the weekly contribution, divided as to 3p for employers and 2p for employees, with effect from 7th April next.  Accordingly, if both Houses approve of my proposals, the contribution rates as from 7th April, will be as follows:</P>
    <P>male worker 18p, of which the employer will pay 13p and the worker will pay 5p,</P>
    <P>female worker 17p, of which the employer will pay 13p and the worker will pay 4p.</P>
    <P>I expect the new rates of contribution to bring in an additional £1.3 million to the fund over 12 months.  Contributions to the fund are incorporated in the social welfare stamp and the money so collected is transmitted to my Department by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Within this statutory obligation to have a redundancy fund, the general aim is to try to maintain the fund at a level sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure and to have a modest reserve in hand at normal times.  It has not been my intention that the redundancy <Col N="833" /> fund should build up a large reserve and consequently in times of economic setback it is necessary to increase the contributions to meet increased obligations.  An element of uncertainty is, of course, implied, related primarily to the employment situation, and changes in the rates of contribution become necessary from time to time.</P>
    <P>Turning to the future prospects for employment, account must be taken of recent developments.  The Industrial Development Authority last year approved projects which will provide more than 25,000 new jobs.  This is the largest ever number of jobs approved in any year since the inception of the IDA.  The present year will be extremely difficult due to the fall off in investment which is evident in all major economies to which I have referred, but the IDA are intensifying their marketing activities and have set themselves a higher target of 23,000 job approvals for the current calendar year.  In his recent budget speech the Minister for Finance announced increases in the public capital programme designed to create employment. The allocation for capital investment in, and loans to, industry was increased by £26 million.  This represents a 41 per cent increase on the 1974-75 estimate.  The purpose of this increase is to create new jobs to replace those which have been lost.</P>
    <P>In response to growing unemployment Córas Tráchtála Teoranta initiated in January a special action programme to assist exporters experiencing short-term difficulties in their main markets.  Vigorous marketing drives are being undertaken in 17 countries with a special emphasis on those economies which have the capacity to import Irish goods, notably oil producing countries including Nigeria and the Middle East.  The initial response is encouraging and the number of different marketing activities in which CTT are engaged is about three times the level of past activity.</P>
    <P>On the question of manpower policy I stated publicly last year in the event of unemployment increasing the Government would increase the amount of money available to AnCO, the Industrial <Col N="834" /> Training Authority, for the expansion of their training facilities. This commitment has been honoured and the total provision made in the budget was for £5 million.  This was an increase of £3 million on the amount for the nine-month period up to December last.  Since much of the expenditure is supplemented by grants from the European Social Fund, AnCO will have available to them a total sum of about £9 million for current expenditure in 1975.</P>
    <P>This provision will enable an extra 2,000 adults to be brought into full-time training and will mean that the total number trained by AnCO during the present year will be more than 6,000.  AnCO will be paying special attention to the problems of redundant workers and their retraining for expanding industries.  A major benefit of this increased training is that when the upturn in the world economy, which is expected towards the second half of this year takes place, Ireland will be better placed to take advantage of the economic recovery.  We will, it is hoped, have a stock of highly trained work people ready to take up employment as new and existing industries expand.</P>
    <P>Recent indications from the monthly survey of business opinion and from the trend of unemployment statistics would suggest that we have passed the worst period of unemployment, and that the situation is likely to improve substantially in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to approve of the draft order entitled, Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1975.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get a copy of the Minister's speech but I listened very carefully to it.  I oppose this order which increases the rate of the redundancy payments contribution. I was disappointed at the amount of information the Minister gave the House.  I want to be very explicit.  The handling of the redundancy situation in general and the employment situation by the Government has been deplorable and to the detriment of the <Col N="835" /> Irish worker.  In recent times this worker was burdened with an increased contribution on the social welfare stamp.  In a very short period this is the third increase in that stamp. Despite what the Minister for Labour or the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare might say, the overall effect is that the working man is being asked to pay a weekly contribution of £1.95p.  Particularly for the lower paid sections of the community, this amount being imposed by the Minister for Labour is the straw that broke the camel's back.</P>
      <P>First, there was an increase in the health contributions, tonight we had the Committee Stage of the Bill which imposed an enormous increase on the social welfare part of the stamp and we now have the added increase on the redundancy payment.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not explain about the size of the reserves, the amount of money needed, excess of income over expenditure and <i>vice versa</i>, for the current year.  It would appear that these are normal matters about which the House should have been given details. Instead he went on to tell us how many jobs it was hoped to create this year.</P>
      <P>We in the Cork area were told recently that a major industrial enterprise which would have employed 1,000 jobs on construction work and 600 or 700 jobs at the finished production level, has fallen down and has been shelved temporarily.  Am I to deduct 2,000 jobs from the Minister's figure for the jobs to be created this year?</P>
      <P>There are many other reasons why I oppose this motion.  I am concerned about employment all over the country.  At present there are 102,000 people unemployed.  I am disappointed at the lack of Government action on this subject.  I cannot accept the Minister's point that this is a downturn. We are in the second half of March&mdash;a period which normally led to a major downturn in the unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely that small downturn in that period must be regarded as a very serious one, one of concern to all of <Col N="836" /> us and particularly of concern to those people who are not only unemployed at present but those who, as a result of this and the other measures taken tonight, may be facing further redundancies.</P>
    <P>I want to bring to the attention of the Minister the situation that exists at present.  I am not making a case for the employer, as such, but I am concerned about the position of the employee now.  Many firms up to the present date&mdash;and I am sorry to say there are far too many&mdash;have found it impossible to implement the final phase of the fourteenth round wage agreement, have found it difficult and, in many cases, impossible to implement the fifteenth round.  Again, there is an escape clause in this new wage increase.  Is it not now apparent that workers in such industries are not keeping pace or progressing with workers in other industrial sectors?  Is this extra imposition of an increase on the employer going to affect very many more jobs and create a situation more serious than the one at present obtaining?</P>
    <P>Of course, I am glad to say this is a measure which was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  At that time redundancy was regarded as a safeguard or compensatory measure, or one of consolation to a worker who, because of a particular set of circumstances, might be laid off.  It was never contemplated that redundancy would become such a well-known, feared and dreaded word in Irish homes.  In addition, there is being created a lack of confidence, because of job losses.  Again, I must be terribly critical of the Minister tonight for going over old ground, playing the old record that has become so boring, of the situation obtaining in other countries. I think it was in Saturday's <i>Irish Times</i> we read an economic correspondent's appraisal of the contribution of the Government to the present hopeless inflationary situation.  To a very large extent that leads to job losses and the redundancies we now face.  I must be critical also of the lack of effort by the Government, by the Minister and his Department.  The Minister did not impress on his colleagues <Col N="837" /> the necessity for remedial action to be taken in time to prevent the unemployment situation reaching its present proportion.  I do not want any Minister telling me that was not possible because I can tell him in many ways and places where such assistance would have saved quite a number of jobs.</P>
    <P>If this measure&mdash;which I regard as the last straw, breaking the camel's back&mdash;together with the others going through the House tonight puts even ten more men out of work&mdash;as I fear it might&mdash;I believe on fairly strong evidence that the total cost of an employee's stamp, plus holiday pay, superannuation contributions and so on will now be in the region of £8 per week.  I am concerned about the firm employing, perhaps, 100 men reducing that number in order to save paying this increased contribution by ten or 20 as the case may be or a company employing, perhaps, ten people reducing that figure to eight and a company employing four reducing it to three.  I am afraid the Minister's action in addition to that of the Minister for Social Welfare will have detrimental effects on many industries throughout the country added to the inability of the firms I have mentioned to keep up-to-date with the fourteenth, fifteenth and now the new wage agreement.</P>
    <P>That creates an undesirable situation because there are people who just cannot keep pace.  They have to bear the increased cost of living being experienced by every other person but because of their particular line of employment or the problems inherent in it they have to settle for proportionately less money.  Preventive measures should have been taken by the Government. In my opinion an emergency exists, an emergency that makes it incumbent on the Minister of the day to take any measures open to him to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>We are given to understand that in the first nine months the pay-related benefits scheme is in line with projected revenue, with projected income. We are given to understand also that the expenditure on this scheme is only approximately one-third of that projected. <Col N="838" /> If that be the case, surely the Minister could seek to have the surplus sitting in that fund, at a time when we cannot afford to have surpluses existing in any fund, transferred as an emergency measure to the redundancy fund giving him the £1.3 million he seeks.  That would be a very simple operation.  I am glad the Minister mentioned specifically what it is hoped to earn in revenue on this scheme through this contribution. That was something we failed to elicit from the Parliamentary Secretary on the question of the social welfare stamp.</P>
    <P>We are concerned because we are leaning now on the working people, on the people already leant on by social welfare and by way of increase in health contributions.  I feel it will create further unemployment which will not help the situation.  In addition, there are the extra increases that have been imposed on the price of the stamp over a period.  I accept that there have been increases in the contributions paid out over the years&mdash; the contribution towards redundancy, when it was considered to be a compensatory measure, which I understand in 1968 was approximately £400,000, but which last year was almost £3 million.  The Minister has not given us figures for the current year.  He has not said what condition reserves are in.  He has intimated that there is an overdraft.  He has not indicated its size.  That is information that should correctly be laid before the House.  The remedy being taken, again, is the extra imposition of taxation with no remedial action having been taken in time to rescue the many jobs that could have been saved had Government action been implemented in certain fields of industry and not have this frightening unemployment figure, this frightening lack of confidence, discrimination against workers in certain industries because of their employers' inability to meet the different wage increases agreed over the past year.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again the fact that I am concerned that each time a Minister of this Government speaks he does so with emphasis on the outside <Col N="839" /> factors affecting our economy. That tune is worn out.  He tells us also of the pie in the sky and of the jobs that are coming.  I sincerely hope these jobs are coming but I have already instanced one major shelving in Cork and I want to know if that has been included in the figures the Minister has given this evening.  There is also the precarious situation of the school leavers this year.  What opportunities are there for these people? Where do they go in an employment situation such as the current one?</P>
    <P>If I may go to the rates for a moment, we are talking about an increase for the employer of 3p, an increase for the male employee of 2p and for the female employee of 2p. However, if we look at the percentage increases on these rates we shall be amazed to see that in 1972 the total contribution was 8p, 5p from the employer and 3p from the employee, and now the contribution is 18p, 13p from the employer and 5p from the employee, an increase of two and a quarter times; in the case of the female employee the 1972 figure of 6p has gone to 17p, nearly three times.</P>
    <P>This is something that we on this side of the House cannot accept.  We believe the lack of action in aiding industry and the creation of inflationary conditions, have contributed enormously to the present redundancy situation.  The imposition of a further burden of taxation means that under this Coalition Government we have gone from one budget per year to two budgets per day.  We have had one enormous imposition tonight on working people in relation to the social welfare stamp; and we have the second one within half an hour.</P>
    <P>We intend, on behalf of the people who are suffering under this extra weight, to oppose it by our vote as well as by our voice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable enough that Opposition speakers should seek to keep the facts of what is happening in the world out of this discussion, but of course we cannot, since the subject matter we are dealing with here relates to certain of <Col N="840" /> the unemployment problems in the country at present, an employment situation which is very deeply affected by what is happening both in our main markets and what is happening in general to investment around the world in other developed countries.  The tune may be an old one and the Deputy may be tired of hearing it, but if one is to speak realistically of the situation before us one must refer to that.</P>
      <P>In speaking of this fund one must advert to the encouraging features that are in the immediate future, the kind of jobs that are being brought to the country by the Industrial Development Authority and by Córas Tráchtála which, I suppose, are the main State agencies for the creation of new jobs.  These State agencies have reported very encouraging information for the coming year in the number of new jobs expected here.  It is only honest to remark that this problem of the downturn in all of the economies with which we deal must, as long as it persists, continue to affect performance here at home.</P>
      <P>The Opposition spokesman, Deputy Fitzgerald, referred to an economist whose comments he read in Saturday's <i>Irish Times,</i> as to the culpability of the Government towards certain of the economic problems we now face, and the contribution which Government expenditure had made towards home inflation. The Opposition cannot have it both ways.  Every day at Question Time the Minister for Local Government is assailed to increase the amount of cash available to building to save employment.  The same thing goes for other Ministers in the various Departments. Those who attack Government expenditure in the capital area are attacking the main weapon available to the Government to maintain employment in areas that are threatened with growing unemployment.  Who is there to say that in the building industry, without Government assistance and aid, aid which has been given by the Minister for Local Government, there would not be far greater unemployment in that industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there is a degree of loss of jobs in that industry but it is not as serious as the Deputy opposite would suggest.  As the Deputy knows, we are building more houses than any other Administration has done in the history of the State. That again is a matter of statistics. The degree of our unemployment, which is not as bad as in other countries, is mainly due to international recession.  The Government are not attempting to evade their responsibilities in stating that that is the major cause of the economic situation before us.</P>
      <P>In regard to Government expenditure, the Deputy may have noticed the conclusions of the European Economic Community's Finance Ministers yesterday when they called upon the Irish Government not to be disheartened by the present deficit in our balance of payments but to continue our attempts to maintain home demand, to keep up the level of capital expenditure in an effort to protect employment as far as possible against these adverse international circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy contended that the increases looked for here may cripple employers.  He paints a picture of employers letting their workers go because of the increase we are looking for here in the stamp.  I have been connected with two increases in the stamp.  The last increase was totally the responsibility of the employer. There was no increase asked of the employee.  On this occasion we are looking for such an increase, but it is a reasonable one when you think of <Col N="842" /> the extra demands there are on the fund, demands which are in part attributable to the increasing number of redundancies and in part also to the improvement in the scheme itself.  The scope of the scheme has been widened. Because of the improvements brought in last year we have included in the scheme non-manual workers over £1,600 a year and there are also the improved benefits available to the worker in the older age group.  All of these benefits make extra demands on the fund and that is why we are recommending 5p extra on redundancy contributions, apportioned 3p on employers and 2p on both male and female employees.  This, it is hoped, will bring in additional £1.3 million to the fund over the 12-month period.</P>
    <P>The Deputy sought details of the reserve position.  The full account for the year 1974 will, in due course, be laid before the House in accordance with section 26 (8) of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  However, it has not been my pride and joy each year to point to the level of credit and say this is the success of the fund.  Rather it has been my attitude that the less that was in the fund the better in the sense that, even in the good times, we should constantly improve benefits payable from the fund.  In my opinion and that of my officials concerned with this matter the level in the current year would not permit us to carry out all the obligations of the fund without this increase at present. When account is taken of liabilities from previous years and claims on hand at the end of the year, the actual reserve in the fund makes it necessary to seek this increase now.</P>

      <P>In looking for this increase we believe we are asking for a realistic figure and that there are solid grounds for giving advances <Col N="843" /> to those who may be involved under these provisions.  The Deputy did refer to the unemployment situation and said there had been an improvement but one would have expected, ordinarily, a better improvement in March.  Yet, over three weeks there has been a drop in the number on the live register and, coupled with the seasonal upturn and what some of the authorities regard as a general improvement in the employment situation later this year, there should be an overall improvement in the employment situation.  Although I accept that an Opposition Deputy may properly draw attention to the problems we are at present facing in employment, I would say that the level of expenditure by the Government shows our concern about the matter which will continue to have our active consideration.</P>
      <P>I have pointed out the amount of cash we are spending in the direct manpower area.  In the current year, between the social fund and home resources we shall be spending about £9 million.  That is the way to prepare. The present recession can only be temporary and we must be in a position to avail of the recovery when it comes.  I hope that when the recovery does take place we will have these people trained in this recession period. That is why this year we shall be spending the largest amount ever spent on manpower training in the history of the State.  Nine million pounds is an enormous sum and will stretch all our facilities to the maximum. We shall not spend any of this money on a building programme.  It will be spent solely in using existing facilities and arranging for staff to take on extra shift work.  As the unemployment situation leaves us with more young people seeking extra skills we would hope to provide them with those skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the postponement of the Dupont enterprise in the Cork area.  That is purely a postponement, I understand, and the company continues to be interested primarily in the Cork area as an area of development.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan):</i> I explained this morning when introducing this measure that the purpose of the Bill is to give permission for increasing the <Col N="846" /> ceiling for land bond orders from £40 million to £60 million.  It is an enabling measure.  It is not true to say it is introduced for five years or for any specified period.  If and when the Bill becomes law the Minister for Finance will have power to create an issue of land bonds to the extent of £20 million in one issue.  He may create £20 million worth in one year or he may never create any land bonds.  It is, as I say, purely an enabling measure.</P>
      <P>Land bonds were first introduced as far back as 1923 and have since then been by and large the method adopted for paying for land purchased or acquired by the Land Commission.  The limit first imposed on land bonds in 1934 was £10 million.  In 1953 the limit was increased to £15 million; in 1964 it was increased to £25 million and as recently as 1969 it was increased to £40 million.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year the Minister for Finance created a further issue of £1,000,000 bonds and thereby brought the total issue to £40 million.  It is because that limit has been reached that this Bill is necessary to enable the Minister for Finance to create further land bonds for the purpose of enabling the Land Commission, in turn, to operate in so far as they are still operating through land bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing briefly now with the history of the Land Commission, from the time the commission first started to acquire land compulsorily until 1950 there was no obligation on the Land Commission to pay market value for land compulsorily acquired.  Their only obligation was to pay such price as might be considered fair to the State, the Land Commission and the vendor.  Invariably the price was less than the market value because, in arriving at the price, the Land Commission bore in mind the price they would have to charge allottees.  That was, of course, manifestly unjust.  A man had his land taken compulsorily from him and he was not entitled to the market price of the land.  I said earlier&mdash;I put it on record again now &mdash;that it was an inter-Party Government, through the then Minister for Lands, the late Joe Blowick, who introduced a Bill in 1950 obliging the Land Commission for the first time <Col N="847" /> to pay the market price for land and ever since the Land Commission have paid the market value, even when operating in land bonds.</P>
    <P>It would appear from the figures produced by Deputy Lalor today that the Land Commission, when paying in bonds, actually pay more than the market price because Deputy Lalor had figures which showed&mdash;indeed, correctly&mdash;that the price per acre in land bonds is, percentagewise, quite a bit more than the price per acre in cash.  When the appeal tribunal are adjudicating on price they do bear in mind the fact that payment is being made in land bonds and these bonds are at a discount.</P>
    <P>The bonds have been criticised on a number of grounds.  It was stated that there is no redemption date for land bonds and it is in the nature of a lottery as to whether one ever gets paid at par.  That is not so.  The Land Bond Act, 1934, provided that the Minister for Finance might redeem bonds on the expiration of 30 years from the date of the passing of the Act, making 23rd March, 1964, the date on which land bonds could be redeemed.  In 1957, however, a Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance amended the 1934 Act and extended the period by providing that the optional date for redemption would be 50 years from 1934, thereby providing that land bonds could not be redeemed before 1984.</P>
    <P>It is rather extraordinary now to hear Members on the opposite benches so concerned about those who are selling their land to the Land Commission or having their land taken from them when we know that from the time they took office until 1950 they operated a system under which the market value was not paid for the land and, on top of that, in 1957 they introduced a measure which extended the date for optional redemption from 1964 to 1984.  During this debate several Deputies demanded that land bonds be phased out.  That is exactly what the Government are doing and I hope the happy day will come during my occupancy of this portfolio when they will disappear and will be completely <Col N="848" /> substituted by cash.  I want to put on record that I have provided more cash for the payment of lands purchased by the Land Commission in the last two years than Fianna Fáil ever did in their entire term of office. I do not think that is any exaggeration.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made that land bonds are a bad method and an unfair way of paying for land.  The same people have complained that there is undue delay in distributing lands purchased by the Land Commission. I find in the budget for 1972-73 that the former Government provided a total of £225,000 for the purchase of land by the Land Commission and of that sum £100,000 was drawn from subhead A for the payment of salaries to Land Commission inspectors and staff in general.  A sum of £225,000 is a miserable sum to provide for the purchase of land but it is even worse when we find the former Government sucked £100,000 of that from the account for salaries. The explanation for that is that the previous Administration allowed the staff of the Land Commission to be depleted.  They allowed the inspectorate to run down and they did not fill vacancies caused by deaths or resignations.  They transferred some of the money provided for salaries to the subhead for the payment of land.  Is it any wonder that I found when I came into office that there was quite a backlog of land waiting to be divided?  The inspectors were not there to do the work and the work fell into arrears. I am very glad to say that in the first budget we introduced the amount provided for the payment of land by cash was increased for the effective £125,000 provided by our predecessors to £1 million in 1973-74.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The money was provided by this Government and that is what matters.  We provided £1 million in that year.  In the following year, 1974, we provided £2,250,000 for nine months and for the current year £2,625,000 is provided. The net result of those operations <Col N="849" /> is that my Department have at their disposal this year £2,625,000 for payment for land in cash under the EEC retirement scheme.  I want to remind the House that not one penny of that money will be provided by the EEC funds.  It is all coming out of the pockets of the taxpayers.  For payment of land purchased by the Land Commission in the current year, other than through the EEC retirement scheme, there is available £1,292,750. In other words, taking those two figures together and the sum of £490,070 for life annuities under the scheme, approximately £3,800,000 is available this year to the Department for payment for lands in cash as against a paltry sum of £225,000 when we came into office.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The House was dissolved on 5th February of that year and the new Government took office on 14th March.  I think the budget was introduced in May of that year.  A sum of £1 million was negotiated by me and the money was provided by the Government.  It is all right saying that the former Administration had plans for this, that and the other thing. Whatever they had plans for they left office and they did not implement them.  We drew up the budget and we provided £1 million in 1973-74.  We <Col N="850" /> provided £2,250,000 for the nine months in 1974 and we are providing £2,625,000 in the current year as against the former Government's best in 1972-73 of £225,000.  If the Deputy would like to have a discussion on their operations from 1968-69 on it was worse they got instead of better. In 1968-69 the former Administration provided £430,000.  In 1969-70 Fianna Fáil provided £600,000; in 1970-71 there was £400,000; in 1971-72 there was £150,000 and in 1972-73 there was £225,000, made up of £125,000 which was provided and £100,000 which Fianna Fáil pinched from salaries.  That is not a record of which Fianna Fáil may be proud.</P>
      <P>I am glad we have provided so much money for the purchase of land in cash.  When we came to power we were saddled with a 9¾ per cent bond left by our predecessors and we replaced it with a 12½ per cent bond. The bond now in operation is a 16 per cent one and there is no doubt that having regard to the trend in interest rates that bond will stand at par for quite a while.  Only £1 million has been issued and if the worst should happen&mdash;I do not think it will, nor do I think Deputies opposite believe it will happen&mdash;when the next bond order is made it can be remedied.</P>
      <P>I do not think any good is being done to the farming community by preaching doom and disaster.  Some of the speakers on this side of the House mentioned that today.  It is better to be optimistic and cheerful.  Listening to debates in this House towards the end of last year, I was very depressed with the predictions that were made about the animals that would die. There were statements made that the roads and fields would be filled with cattle that had died of starvation. That kind of wild speculation encouraged farmers to get rid of lands and to give their cattle away although we advised farmers that they should keep their cattle.  Cattle prices have never been so good and in every provincial paper there are many advertisements stating that bales of hay are for sale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advice given to the farmers by <Col N="851" /> some Deputies in this House was not good and it cost the farmers a considerable amount of money.  I am glad to hear that factories such as Burnhouse and Monnery By-Products who process worn-out animals were never so short or raw materials.  Long may that situation continue because it shows the cattle herd is in a healthy state.</P>
    <P>It is not a useful exercise to tell people that land bonds are worthless. The 16 per cent bond is excellent and I have every reason to believe it will maintain its value for quite a while. The Opposition could only provide £125,000 for the purchase of land at a time when there was not a world recession, when there was no economic blizzard and when, according to them, the economy was booming. When Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, left office on 14th March, 1973, he referred to the strength of the economy and said the country was in a strong, healthy financial position.  In that climate and in those circumstances he could provide only £125,000 for the purchase of land but for last year and this year we are providing approximately £2½ million and we have a fund of £3,800,000.  The Opposition will not be regarded as serious; they will be regarded as playing politics with the restructuring of land and with bringing the size of small farms to a viable unit, just as they played politics with the cattle difficulties last winter.  They were proved wrong then and they will be proved wrong now.</P>
    <P>They are asking us to provide another £3 million to £5 million to finance the complete and utter purchase of land by cash in one year. They are doing that at a time when they criticise the budget for having too high a deficit, for imposing too much taxation and for borrowing too much from abroad.  Where will the money come from?  Do they think we should introduce this innovation this year in the difficult economic climate now prevailing, when they could not introduce it in their 16 years in office?  During that time they did nothing, good, bad or indifferent to <Col N="852" /> improve the position of the vendor of land to the Land Commission. Nothing had been done since 1950 when Deputy Blowick was working in this area.  I would ask the Opposition to come down to reality because they will not be taken seriously by the people.</P>
    <P>They are asking for a complete departure from the traditional system of purchasing land at an expense of approximately £5 million.  They are doing it at a time when money was never so scarce, when the priorities of the Government are to divert all moneys that are available towards keeping unemployment to a minimum and towards putting money into productive investments so that the poorer sections may be cushioned against the unavoidable increase in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callanan made what appeared on the surface to be a reasonable proposition, namely, that bonds should be created for a short period and that they should be redeemable at the option of the holder after five or seven years.  On the face of it it looked a reasonable proposition but when it was investigated and considered it was found that the sinking fund to operate it would have to increase by an extra 5 per cent, giving a total annuity of about 21 per cent. Assuming that land was costing about £500 per acre, the cost to the allottee would be about £100 per acre.  I can imagine the howling in this House if a suggestion were made that the annuity on land would not be less than £100 an acre, and in many cases it might be considerably more.  Every rural Deputy would be up in arms, saying it was an intolerable situation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Esmonde spoke about hardship cases.  Of course there are cases of hardship.  We are doing our best to phase out land bonds and any reasonable Deputy will agree that an increase from £225,000 to £2½ million per year is not a bad start?  I believe it is necessary to continue what we call the traditional operation of the Land Commission to acquire land through their compulsory powers in order to prevent speculation and to ensure that vast tracts of land do not get into the hands of people who are not farmers.</P>
      <P>People who acquire land in that way do not deserve to have tears shed for them.  I propose to give the House a classical example of that type of speculation.  I know of 329 acres of land purchased in 1972 for £77,000 by a man who was not a farmer and who did not live within miles of that farm. Deputies cannot blame me for not having prevented him from buying in 1972 because I was not Minister for Lands then.  Recently that man accepted a price awarded by the Appeals Tribunal of £164,000 in 16 per cent land bonds.  He is getting too much.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Lalor and I are talking in the same language but about different farms.  A few years after Deputy <Col N="854" /> Lalor came into the House there was an instance in his constituency which is a replica of the case I cited.  We should not be too concerned about land bonds because the 16 per cent bond is a very good one.  That type of investment is availed of by institutions and companies to set up pension funds&mdash;people who do not want early redemption.  It is the best gilt-edged security on the market today.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies dealt with points which would have been more relevant on the Estimate.  I should have started my reply by saying that copies of my speech were not available when I introduced the Bill.  It was a mishap. I am glad to see Deputy Tunney in the position of spokesman for Lands. I hope we will get on for a long time, both of us in the same position.</P>
      <P>The Bill was attacked on the basis that I should be phasing out land bonds.  I hope I have convinced the House that I am making a genuine effort in very difficult circumstances. It is not true to say there is not a market for land bonds.  The Government stockbroker is obliged to purchase all the bonds that come on the market.  I should point out that fixed interest securities also have fallen on the market.  Governments during the years have issued long term loans at five, seven and eight per cent and they are not redeemable until the 90s. People put their money into these securities on the advice of the Government of the day and usually of the Opposition of the day.  National loans of five, seven, eight and nine per cent are now standing at very low rates if people have to sell.  Their guarantee is that the Government stockbroker will buy them.  I do not think any Deputy can genuinely distinguish between them and land bonds.  People bought these securities so that they could provide money for themselves in later years.  They have found that national loans have fallen dramatically over the years.  Land bonds are no worse.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> It may be lottery but the money was paid out.  I do not think anybody can say that that sum is a mere bagatelle. As the years go on, the amount of land which will become available under the EEC scheme will make it less necessary for the Land Commission to resort to compulsory powers.</P>
      <P>I know the Deputy is interested in figures.  Under the retirement scheme 74 cases were processed and provided a pool of land of 2,807 acres.  That was a small number of cases but a fair amount of land.  As this scheme is understood and gets going properly, it will provide a worthwhile amount of land and so relieve the Land Commission from the necessity of having to acquire land compulsorily.  At the same time, I would not like to see the compulsory powers of the Land Commission abolished.</P>
      <P>In his speech today Deputy O'Malley appeared to out-Mansholt Mansholt. He gave the impression that what mattered was the amount of return to be got out of a farm.  That could be pursued to its logical conclusion.  If you had a 300 or 400 acre highly mechanised farm, it would produce more than six 50-acre farms.  I would not agree to that proposition.  I believe that we should continue to bring the small farm up to a viable size.  That is what the Land Commission propose to do.  There are two ways of doing that. Firstly, this could be done through the retirement scheme.  That is a painless and voluntary method under which people who retire from farming make their farm available to the Land Commission or to a local farmer direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the Land Commission should have power to ensure that land is not controlled by a few people or that speculators do not rush in to buy <Col N="856" /> as they did in anticipation of our entry into Europe.  The Land Commission should retain their compulsory powers. I am very glad other Deputies agree with me.  Deputy Callanan, Deputy Lalor and others who have the figures will agree that we should not have any sympathy for these get-rich-quick merchants who bought land in areas where there already was congestion.  In 1971 and 1972 they bought land for £77,000 and the market price for that land is now fixed at £164,000.  In my view it would be very bad to give them cash.  My only regret is that they are getting a bond which is as good as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I agree.  I was about to develop the point.  Deputies must look at this matter realistically.  They will then come to the conclusion that I am doing what I was asked to do.  I am acceding to the request made to me this morning to phase out land bonds. I am phasing them out in the best way possible.  They are gone completely as far as the scheme is concerned. People can avail of the scheme and be paid in cash.</P>
      <P>Almost £1 million is available for the purchase of land outside the scheme.  My hope would be that the Land Commission would avail of that money when dealing with hard luck cases.  I can see that it is very difficult to decide which of the hard luck cases is inflicting the greatest hardship. With the money provided under this scheme and the very considerable amount provided outside the scheme, I believe we have gone a long way towards this, much further than Deputy Tunney's predecessors in this office did over the last number of years.  If Deputy Tunney had been Minister for Lands since 1965, he might now have reached the stage where we would not be paying for cash-in land bonds.  If I had been Minister for Lands from 1965, and travelling nearly as fast as I have been since 1973, there would be no land bonds now and plenty of cash.</P>
      <P>We are in a very different economic climate, a time of high interest and scarcity of money, not alone here but all over the world.  That is conceded. This is the time that I am asked to jump in at the deep end.  I have not pleased some members of the House when I went half way&mdash;I even went more than half way&mdash;to meet their requests.  In 1975 I provided £3 million in round figures available under the scheme&mdash;I think Deputy Callanan was shocked to hear that&mdash;and over £1 million carry forward from last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we have to remain back at this hour of the evening on this question&mdash;Question No. 30 on today's Order Paper&mdash; regarding the provision of money for housing in County Kerry for the current financial year.  It is not entirely my fault.  I sought certain information in putting down this question to the Minister for Local Government today and I intended to seek further information arising out of the reply by asking further supplementaries. I was merely able to ask one supplementary before you, Sir, called the next question.  At that stage there was no alternative for me but to state my intention to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>My question to the Minister read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ask the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the allocation of money by his Department to Kerry County Council for the financial year 1975 falls far <Col N="859" /> short of the total amount required by the council to achieve its housing targets for (a) the erection of new council houses and (b) the payment of supplementary housing grants and housing loans; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his reply, stated that Kerry County Council informed him that their original capital allocation for 1975 was inadequate, that he had authorised an interim increase of £150,000, and that he would review the position following a thorough examination of the council's housing programme.  He stated also, at the end of his reply, that he had received a request from the council for a supplementary allocation of £150,000.</P>
    <P>I was not, and am still not, sure whether this is the same £150,000.  As the Minister is probably aware, Kerry County Council prepared a programme this year under which they intended building 300 council houses. There are approximately 800 persons on the housing waiting list.  I regard that target as being reasonable, having regard to the number of persons on the waiting list and to the staff employed by the council to supervise the erection of those houses.</P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister is it not a fact that the council submitted an estimate some time ago to his Department saying they would require a sum of £1,513,000 to finance this programme? I believe that is the sum required.  It is a reasonable figure when one considers the average cost of building a single rural house and the cost of building a house in a group scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department of Local Government informed the county council that their allocation for the year was £850,000 which included £201,000 in respect of houses being built by the National Building Agency.  When the council received that notification with no guarantee, in writing, that they would receive more, they had no option but to adopt a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; attitude with regard to achieving the target of 300 houses this year.  The Minister is probably aware that it <Col N="860" /> costs between £4,000 and £4,400 to build a single rural house now in Kerry.  The average cost per house in a group scheme ranges from £5,000 to £5,500.  A few years ago, around 1972, the average cost per single rural house was approximately £2,300 to £2,400. Therefore, it is evident that far more money is required this year than in previous years in order to build even the same number of houses.  There is no doubt but that the provision of houses by the county council and by the urban authorities in Kerry is one of the greatest needs of the county. Apart altogether from the numbers on the waiting list of Kerry County Council, there are hundreds on the waiting list in Killarney and Tralee urban councils.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that there is a young population in Kerry, that people are now getting married, settling down and looking for homes of their own at a much younger age than heretofore.  In addition, people do not expect now to be so long on the waiting list for houses.  We must remember that, whatever the Minister may say, during the period when the previous Minister for Local Government was in office the number of houses built in the country rose rapidly within a few short years from 15,000 per annum to 22,000 per annum.  I believe that the groundwork was laid at that time for achieving a target of at least 25,000 houses now.  I believe monetary provision should be made for building more and more houses as the years progress, particularly when we take into account the ever increasing costs of building materials, labour and all the incidental expenses that go with the provision of local authority housing.</P>
    <P>I could not see any other step which Kerry County Council could have taken but to slow down on their programme when they were notified&mdash; even allowing for the extra £150,000 &mdash;that they would not get only £1,000,000, whereas, in fact, £1,500,000 approximately is required to meet the target for the current financial year.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister stated in his reply that the council's housing programme <Col N="861" /> and capital requirements were being examined locally by officers of his Department.  I know also from other local authorities that it is the intention of those officers also to visit other housing authorities, I presume, with a view to distributing the additional £7,000,000 the Minister has made available for housing this year.  I am concerned particularly about the fact that a sum of £540,000 only has been approved so far by the Minister for the payment of supplementary housing grants and loans for the present financial year when the firm estimate submitted by Kerry County Council, I understand, was a figure of at least £900,000.</P>
    <P>It is all right to say that this amount of £540,000 was related to an allocation of 60 per cent of the 12 months' equivalent of the allocation for the nine-month period to 31st December, 1974, but the council have no guarantee in writing so far from the Department of Local Government that they will get more money.  They have not been told that they will get the £900,000 which they anticipate they will spend by dealing adequately with all the applications for supplementary grants and loans.</P>
    <P>There are many people in Kerry who are concerned that the council have not been told they will get what they require to pay the supplementary grants and loans.  Applicants are afraid that the council will be dealing more harshly with applications, particularly for loans.  What else can the council do but slow down the number of approvals for loans when they have been guaranteed so far only 60 per cent of the amount they estimate they will require for the coming year?</P>
    <P>We must also remember that due to the high interest rate charged by the banks on bridging loans, applicants for loans are seeking payment and are ready to receive payment far quicker than they were when the bank interest rates were much lower.  Applicants now make sure their solicitors and legal advisers get titled documents ready as soon as possible so that the mortgage can be prepared and payments made in some cases when work <Col N="862" /> only commences on the building of a house.  This is in order to avoid the heavy interest payments on bridging loans.  This, in turn, means that there will be a very heavy draw during this year on local authority loans.  That is another reason why we think in Kerry that our estimate of £900,000 is probably very conservative and that we may require more money still before the year is out, that is if people now draw their loans at a faster rate than they did heretofore.</P>
    <P>I have noticed of late as well that the county council are dealing with applications for housing reconstruction loans only in respect of houses where the occupants require additional accommodation.  This is not as it should be, because the vast majority of people who applied for reconstruction loans are merely reconstructing and improving their existing dwellings and are not building additional accommodation in order to relieve overcrowding. I believe the council should be in a position to allocate housing reconstruction loans to applicants who merely require the loan to enable them to reconstruct and improve their existing houses.</P>
    <P>I should like to get a guarantee from the Minister that he will provide for the council whatever capital allocations they require in respect of new houses, that is, up to the estimate of 300, and also for the payment of supplementary grants and housing loans.  There is one type of answer which I hope will not be forthcoming, that is, a statistical one which will give the amount of money allocated in previous years to the county council and to the urban district councils in Kerry.  These statistics bear no relationship whatever to the current year having regard to the ever-increasing cost of building materials and to the increasing cost of providing local authority houses generally.  We should also bear in mind that there is an ever-increasing demand now on local authorities to provide houses for persons who would normally build themselves if the ceiling of £4,500 for the local authority loans were increased. It is obvious that people can no longer build themselves by way of loan and <Col N="863" /> grant, even assuming that many of them can purchase the site themselves.</P>

      <P>Yes.  At least this is my experience of late.  I should like to get a straight and unconditional guarantee from the Minister that the council will get the amount of money required to carry out their programme for the current financial year.  In asking this I do not wish to make a political football of the housing situation in Kerry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>Napoleon used to say that every infantryman carried a field marshal's baton in his knapsack.  If he came back here he would be a little confused at all the potential field marshals that are in the Fianna Fáil benches.  Indeed, Deputy Faulkner had to exercise authority today to get an opportunity of asking a supplementary on his own question.  Everybody in Fianna Fáil feels he would make a better shadow Minister for Local Government than Deputy Faulkner. We have the example here tonight of Deputy O'Leary who could have pursued this question because the Ceann Comhairle was quite generous and allowed two or three supplementary questions after Deputy O'Leary had asked for the matter to be raised on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I have no objection at all to coming back here at night to answer questions, but I admire the hard neck of people who come in here with questions on the Adjournment.  Either they do not do their homework beforehand to find out if, in fact, they are on firm ground or, alternatively, they just chance their arm and feel that if they are able to get a few lines in their local newspaper&mdash;<i>The Kerryman</i> in this case&mdash;it will be all to the good.  As a person who has been here for a very long time, I would advise that this is very bad tactics.  I do not like to see even my political opponents doing what has been done here two or three times in the last week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record has to be put straight. Kerry County Council, of course, <Col N="864" /> asked for a very substantial amount of money for local authority housing &mdash;£1,229,000 to be exact.  They were told that they would get £850,000, which was 60 per cent of last year's, and that this would keep them going into June until we found out exactly what the position was. They said this was not enough and on 30th March they were told they could have another £150,000 to keep them going until June and that a review would take place early in the following month and that their claim for extra money over the £7 million which the Government gave would be finalised in July in conjunction with any other claim.  Therefore, they were covered for any new work they wished to start in the interim.  I know efforts are being made to prevent new work from being started and to sabotage local authority programmes. I am surprised at Deputy O'Leary lending himself to this sort of thing.  He may not understand what is behind it but some of his colleagues understand it very well.  I imagine he would be interested in housing people eligible for local authority houses.  So far, Kerry County Council have had more than enough to keep them going until the end of June when the position will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Before this, in 1972-73 capital expenditure on local authority houses in Kerry was £407,905; in 1973-74, £531,925.  In 1974, the capital allocation for nine months was £650,000 which would be equivalent in 12 months to £867,000.  In 1975, the basic allocation, plus additions and authorised overdraft is £1.1 million.  To get so much at the start out of £1,229,000 is doing pretty well.  Perhaps the Deputy was not aware of it but those are the facts.  The authorised expenditure so far this year is £1.1 million against a little over £.4 million in 1972-73, nearly three times as much as was given for the whole year.  I do not object to constructive criticism but I object to people trying to give the impression that things are other than what they really are.</P>
    <P>The increase in the programme itself is very interesting because in the year up to 31st March, 1973, completed <Col N="865" /> local authority houses in Kerry were 141 but up to 31st December, 1974, 207 were completed.  Under construction up to 31.3.73 were 47 while under construction up to 31.12.74 were 198.  At tender on 31.3.73 there were 113 while on 31.12.74 the figure was 135.  At planning on 31.3.73 were 224 and at 31.12.74, 404, a total of 525 as against a total at 31.12.74 of 877.  The additional sites available on 31.3.73 were 861 while on 31.12.74 the number was 1,054.  And Deputy O'Leary says we are not doing enough for local authority housing.  I think that is the answer.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary mentioned a target of 300 houses in 1975 for Kerry County Council.  I welcome this scale of output and assure him that the programme will not fail for want of capital but in recent years the total number of houses built in Kerry by the county council and the urban district councils of Tralee, Killarney and Listowel was in 1971-72, 252; in 1972-73, 175; in 1973-74, 153 and in the nine months of 1974, 141.  The county council had 198 houses under construction at the end of last December.  Normally 70 per cent of the houses in progress at the beginning of the year are completed the following year and 70 per cent of 198 would give about 140 completions.  Deputy O'Leary might be able to tell me where the other 160 houses will come from.  Are fairies at work in Kerry again completing another 160 houses of which we know nothing in the Department?</P>
    <P>Expenditure by Kerry County Council on house purchase loans and supplementary grants has been as follows: in 1972-73 the total was £490,248; in 1973-74, £684,859 and and for the nine months of 1974, it was £794,054.  An additional allocation of £540,000 for loans and grants was notified to the county council last month at the rate of 60 per cent of the 1974 expenditure to cover requirements until next June.  The council sought an immediate increase and a further £150,000 will issue next week. This brings the allocation for the first three months of 1975 to £690,000, or <Col N="866" /> £200,000 more than the total spent in the full year 1972-73.  The council have been told that if a need for extra finance is established in the coming months extra money will be provided.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of last year when it became clear that the very extensive increase in building which was taking place would require extra money, the Government provided that money, amounting to £9 million plus £6 million plus £1½ million.  That has happened twice since I took over as Minister after we had given fantastic increases on what was given by Fianna Fáil.  When extra money was required we made it available; if more money is necessary to complete our programme, of course it will be made available.  We have proved that; we did it before and we will do it again. It is a bit much that people should cry &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; even though they know the facts do not warrant it.  Deputy O'Leary is an intelligent man and was a county council official and can read figures&mdash;there are people here who cannot do that.  He should be able to read the figures and not take what is obviously told to him by somebody else about how bad the situation is.</P>
    <P>I shall not quarrel with Kerry County Council if they need to build more houses.  Of course, they need more local authority houses as is the case throughout the country.  That is not my fault.  I would quarrel with the figure Deputy O'Leary gave when he said that over 22,000 houses were built.  In fact, the last figure produced by my predecessor was 21,500 and 2,000 of those were built in the previous year.  We shall not quarrel about that; the grants were paid on 21,500 and we can accept that figure.  The best Fianna Fáil could do as regards local authority houses in their best year over the whole country was slightly over 4,000 houses.  We have topped 7,000 this year; we were pretty close to it last year.  And Deputy O'Leary says we are not doing enough for local authority housing.  I assure him that if I have my way, as I expect, in the years to come I will ensure that we will provide enough money for housing of every kind and particularly <Col N="867" /> local authority houses because I appreciate the necessity for such houses in the case of those unable to provide them for themselves.  The question of bank overdrafts and so on is a lot of nonsense.  As far as Kerry County Council are concerned, Deputy O'Leary, being a member of that council, can get them to ensure, if they have not already done so in their provision for loans, that loans will be given for any type of construction or repair they wish to include. That is a matter for the county council with which the Government have nothing to do.</P>
    <P>I suggest Deputy O'Leary would be <Col N="868" /> better off if he talked to the county council and persuaded them to give money for this purpose.  I should be annoyed if I felt that efforts would be made to prevent people from building additional accommodation or carrying out reconstruction they require because money was not being made available by a local authority.  They have no instructions from my Department to do this.  I should like to see all this building being done.  This is a matter for Kerry County Council and the Deputy should not try to lay the blame here where there is no blame.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at present to arrange installation of a telephone for the person named by the Deputy as provision of service requires abnormal linework between the applicant's premises and the nearest common cable route.  There are some 1,500 other applications in the Cork area similarily deferred because of the abnormal linework involved.  It is hoped to start clearing them in the latter part of this year but it is likely to be the second half of 1976 before the application in question can be met.</P>

      <P>I presume that what the <Col N="746" /> Deputy has in mind is that a principal teacher or vice-principal who acts as secretary to a board of management has no voting rights.  This is in line with the procedure adopted for community schools.  The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that a teacher who is a member of a vocational education committee may, by virtue of such membership, be elected to serve on a board of management with full voting rights but may not serve on the board of management of the school in which he is employed.</P>
