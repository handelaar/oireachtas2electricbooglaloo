      <P>In view of the horrific events over the weekend in the North of Ireland will the Taoiseach, at some stage during the Dáil sitting this week, indicate to the House the communications, if any, he has had with the British Government expressing our concern at the mounting tone of <Col N="554" /> sectarian violence in the North.  I say that in view of the fact that this has already been discussed in the House of Commons and will be raised tomorrow at the Convention.  It is important that we have an opportunity of hearing what steps our government have taken to communicate our concern to the British Government.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into an area of controversy but the Minister is responsible for the terms of legislation he puts before the House and if the terms of legislation mean what we think they say, in other words, that he is passing on or proposes to pass on to traffic wardens matters that would normally be the function of trained and qualified policemen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important piece of legislation and one that is <Col N="556" /> long overdue.  It extends the duties of traffic wardens and this is necessary, particularly when one considers the time taken up in courts by gardaí on minor traffic offences.  It is necessary that we should have some streamlining in this area.  The duties could be extended to ensure a free flow of traffic because I do not see why it is necessary for a guard to be on traffic duty.  The duties of the traffic warden could be extended so that he could control the flow of traffic through our cities.</P>
      <P>We all realise that parking is a big problem.  I have come across quite a lot of cases in the city where large lorries park in the inner city residential areas and because there is no prohibition on this sort of parking they cause great annoyance and concern to the residents in those areas.  We are encouraging people to live within the city centre but that is not much use when those lorries are allowed to park right outside a house.  Many of the houses have no front gardens so we can understand the problem the lorries are causing.  Some law should be passed whereby only private motorists living in those areas could park there and heavy lorries would only be allowed park in certain designated areas.</P>
      <P>Parking meters are very essential in the city areas but people living in those areas have no parking facilities. We should have some legislation to give people living in the central city area parking facilities beside their homes.  This could be done by a special permit or a special disc for them indicating that this is residential parking.  It is wrong not to provide parking facilities for people living in those areas.  People are being forced to live outside the city area. We want to encourage them to come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great hazard is caused by large trucks parking on road bends and at parts of roads which do not have adequate lighting.  This is very dangerous. We should look at the whole question of parking facilities for heavy transport coming into the city, which is likely to increase in the future. There should be designated areas for <Col N="557" /> those heavy lorries and they should only be permitted to park in them. This would eliminate the problem of accidents.  We all know of cases of cars running into the backs of trucks which are either badly lit or are without any lights at all.</P>
    <P>Has the traffic warden the right to stop cars and have them checked for tax discs?  When he is walking around and notices a car without a tax disc or one out of date, does he just take the number and have a summons issued later?  Does he check for insurance? It does not seem to be in the Bill but if he is checking the tax discs I suggest that the person should be asked to produce his tax disc and insurance certificate to the local Garda station.  A tax disc could be missing and the driver might not be aware of it.  It would be much better to ask him to produce the relevant proof at the Garda station rather than have the matter as it is in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We will have to expand the traffic warden staff and we will have to look at an adequate training programme for them.  If we are giving them new responsibilities it is desirable to ensure that they are trained in courtesy and dealing with the public.  The traffic warden should be given a basic training in the law, particularly in regard to the responsibilities he caries so that whatever he does is within his terms of reference.  We should ensure that he does not overstep his authority.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is important to give traffic wardens maximum responsibility. They will do a much better job as a result and the traffic will flow more freely.  This should relieve the Garda of quite a lot of work in relation to traffic so that they can spend more time on crime prevention and law enforcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The leader of the Fianna Fáil Party this morning, when told by the Minister for Local Government that this was effectively legislation which was on the stocks before Fianna Fáil went out of office, made the point that each Government must stand over their own legislation. <Col N="558" /> When we were in Government and I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach I did not notice any legislation of this kind before the Government. While I do not suggest that the Minister for Local Government is attempting to mislead the House those of us who were not acquainted of that legislation pre-Coalition Government days should not now have it wrapped around our necks that it was Fianna Fáil legislation.  It is the legislation of this Government and they must stand over it.  We totally disagree with this legislation in relation to a number of areas which are of great concern in relation to the role of our Garda.</P>
      <P>The Government must accept responsibility for this legislation.  I am sure when the Minister for Local Government is replying he will tell us if the Government, he and the Minister for Justice, have had consultations with the various Garda representative bodies.  Let us be clear that we are not being critical of the personalities of the wardens or questioning their integrity.  These are people who are employed to do a particular job and they have been doing it within their terms of reference.</P>
      <P>What we are concerned about is the role of the Garda Síochána and the erosion of their responsibilities by an untrained force of men called traffic wardens.  At the moment traffic wardens affix a ticket to a car windscreen. The fine may be paid to the Garda Síochána and this is processed through an office presided over by a sergeant of the Garda Síochána.  To date the traffic wardens have been under the control of the Garda Síochána, and that is the way we on this side of the House would like to see it continuing, but after the message of this Bill the situation will become different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of consultation, which we say did not take place with the Garda Síochána Representative Bodies before the introduction of this Bill, it is as well to remember what has been said in the past by a number of Ministers but more particularly by the Minister for Justice in the <i>Garda Review</i> of October, 1973.  On the Garda role the Minister for Justice, <Col N="559" /> Deputy Cooney, stated that he would at all times be in the fullest consultation with the Garda Síochána.  Here is one case where the Government were not in full consultation with the Garda Síochána.  This belies the socalled open Government about which we hear from time to time.  This Government are as open as they want to be, and if there are any secrets to be kept they will keep them as best they can, but again the Minister for Justice is inclined to give away Cabinet secrets and do away with the whole concept of Cabinet collective responsibility.</P>
    <P>However, in regard to open Government and non-consultation with the Garda Síochána in the context of this Bill, it is interesting to note that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is conducting a public debate with the RTE Authority, and the Minister's own party have given lip service to the whole concept of industrial democracy. Surely, in the light of that background and thinking, the Garda Síochána, who enjoy the highest respect and confidence of the community, should be consulted on a Bill of this nature, a Bill which is eroding further their responsibilities in relation to law enforcement.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to engage in inflammatory language or the langguage of the demagogue, but one can understand the feelings of the Garda Síochána in relation to this legislation. I am presuming they are annoyed at the erosion of their authority as regards law enforcement.  This Bill, for the first time, gives legitimacy to doubts about the Government's attitude on the role of the Garda Síochána in relation to the citizen. The garda is a highly trained and skilled person when he takes up duty for the first time.  He has had an extensive course of training in crime detection and in public relations with the ordinary citizen.  He has behind him all the training and discipline of a respected force.</P>
    <P>So much for the garda and the manner in which he is educated to confront the citizenry.  Then there are the traffic wardens who as I say, without being critical of them personally, <Col N="560" /> are as I understand it, in the case of the Dublin city area, brought to the Mansion House for three or four days under the control of a sergeant of the Garda Síochána.  They are given a short course in how to perform the 11 functions which are now within their competence.  These 11 functions are under traffic control regulations, and I shall deal with those functions later on.  This group of people are not trained to deal with the citizenry, and let us be fair about it: the motoring population are probably one of the most harassed groups of people in the country.  Only a short time ago the price of petrol was increased out of all proportion, and we are informed this morning we are going to have a mini-budget. Are we certain that within that mini-budget on Thursday week the road tax will not be doubled, as has been suggested?</P>
    <P>Now what the traffic wardens are being instructed to do is to take the names and addresses of citizens who can be fined £20 if they refuse to give this information to this untrained body of people.  Worse still, in our view, is that the Bill intends to take the control of the traffic wardens from the Garda Síochána and give it to the local authority.  The local authority will now perform the functions of the Garda Síochána in relation to traffic offences and offences related thereto.</P>
    <P>That is an appalling concept.  If the road traffic laws in a local authority like Dún Laoighaire are to be applied in this way, what happens&mdash; possibly this is only theory&mdash;if a traffic warden and a garda approach the same car whose owner has not got his tax disc displayed?  Who takes precedence in that case, the garda or the traffic warden?  I would not suggest there would be a public row between the two, but there is the possibility at least of confusion in such an instance. The traffic warden could tell the garda: &ldquo;I am working for the local authority.  You have nothing to do with me&rdquo;.  The garda might say: &ldquo;I am a member of the constitutionally established law enforcement agency. It is my function&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There could be confusion and <Col N="561" /> doubt and an undermining of the properly constituted law enforcement agency.  The traffic warden is now being given power to take the names and addresses of persons to be prosecuted and this is another direct intervention into the citizen-garda relationship.  The citizen does not consider it a hardship to give his name and address to the Garda Síochána.  He has been trained to realise that the Garda Síochána are entitled to have that information and that if he refuses to do so he could be arrested.  According to the Bill, the warden will be entitled to seek the information and if it is refused by the citizen he is then liable to a fine under section 6:</P>
    <P> (1)  The Minister may make regulations prescribing any matter or thing referred to in this Act as prescribed or to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious new departure from the functions, as we see them, of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>One wonders whether local authorities have a full ready-made type of operation available to them as is available in a Garda station in relation to the provisions of this Bill.  The law officer in each local authority area will be responsible for the enforcement of the Act.  The law officer in the local authority area of Dún Laoghaire is an extremely able man of great integrity.  Is it fair to him to add extra burdens to his already over-burdened position?</P>
    <P>In addition to extra traffic wardens, local authorities will need extra staff to operate the Act as envisaged here and that is another cause for serious concern.  The Minister has not <Col N="562" /> told us how many new traffic wardens will be employed and, if the circle is to be completed, how many extra ancillary staff will be needed throughout the country to administer the new traffic system.  The most serious aspect of it&mdash;I would re-echo what Deputy Faulkner has said in this respect&mdash;is that until such time as the Bill is explained fully to us we will have to put our own interpretations on its effects and these will hold good until they are disproved.  For instance, we can put our interpretation on section 3 (1), and it is a fair enough interpretation until it is dislodged by the Minister.  The subsection states:</P>
    <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973 and the offence under regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by those regulations a licence in respect of the vehicle issued under that Act.</P>
    <P>I accept that before any of these regulations in relation to any offence under the road traffic code are implemented they have to be laid before the House and must remain there for 21 sitting days and then they become a matter of law if they have not been challenged.  We all know about these regulations and I often feel there should be another method through which the existence of such regulations would be brought to the attention of the House.  Effectively, the laying of regulations before the House means that they are placed in the Oireachtas Library and this method gives me the impression of legislation by stealth.  I know our Government did it but the present Government do it far more often than any other Government in the past.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the more serious aspect of section 3 (1) is that any offence under the Road Traffic Acts can be handed over to the jurisdiction <Col N="563" /> of the traffic wardens.  We may have some doubts about the validity of that interpretation of the subsection but it must remain until the Minister tells us otherwise.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to take that concept a little further.  If the Road Traffic Acts apply to such things as non-display of tax discs, the legislation also relates to drunken driving, dangerous driving causing death, dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm, dangerous driving <i>per se,</i> careless driving, driving without due care and attention and all the rest of it.  It applies to driving a defective vehicle and all the umbrella offences that come under that category.  That being so, can we see the day when the duties of traffic wardens will apply in these areas?  Will traffic wardens be allowed to deal with these extremely serious offences?  Will they be allowed to apply the law in regard to these offences?  Section 3 appears to have that meaning.</P>
    <P>In relation to this matter, the 15th Interim Report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure discusses the whole matter of on-the-spot fines.  It is a continuation of their 5th Report and they were asked to deal specifically with on-the-spot fines.  It is a very interesting discussion on the whole morality of on-the-spot fines and paragraph 7 of that report sets out the guidelines as follows:</P>
    <P>In general, we are of opinion that offences which could be suitably disposed of under the &ldquo;On-the-Spot Fines&rdquo; system would be summary offences in respect of which:</P>
    <P> (a)  there is no appreciable degree of moral culpability,</P>
    <P>(b)  a small fixed penalty would be appropriate, and</P>
    <P>(c)  there would be little occasion for controversy as the offence committed would be visually apparent </P>
    <P>That is an extremely important phrase&mdash;&ldquo;that the offence committed would be visually apparent&rdquo;.  The committee then discussed the matter further at paragraph 8:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Applying the guidelines mentioned in the previous paragraph we are of opinion that the most suitable type of additional offences which could be dealt with under the system are those relating to:</P>
    <P> (1)  Construction, equipment and use of mechanically propelled vehicles (under the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended);</P>
    <P>(2)  Lighting of mechanically propelled vehicles (under the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963, as amended);</P>
    <P>(3)  Driving mechanically propelled vehicle at speed....</P>
    <P>(4)  Failure to display tax disc on mechanically propelled vehicle (under the Road Act, 1920, section 5 (6) and the Registration and Licensing Regulations, 1958 and 1962);</P>
    <P>Effectively, this Bill is uplifting one aspect of this interim report and making law of what the report suggested.</P>
    <P>(5)  Allowing identification mark on a mechanically propelled vehicle to become not easily distinguishable (under the Road Act, 1920 section 6);</P>
    <P>There are other very interesting on-the-spot fines suggested:</P>
    <P>(6)  Having wireless set or television set without holding a broadcasting receiving licence...;</P>
    <P>(7)  Failure of keeper of dog to pay dog duty...;</P>
    <P>(8)  Street trading... without a street-traders' certificate granted by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána (under the Street Trading Act, 1926);</P>
    <P>(9)  Stall-trading without a street-trader's licence granted by Dublin Corporation...;</P>
    <P>(10)  Depositing litter on street (under local bye-laws);</P>
    <P>(11)  Failure to make an annual return to registrar of companies (under the Companies Act, 1963, sections 125, 126, 127 and 128);</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> (12)  Failure to make an annual return to the Registrar of Friendly Societies...; and</P>
    <P>(13)  Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950.</P>
    <P>The members of the committee stated that on-the-spot fines should be extended to those offences.  The committee were silent about who would administer the on-the-spot fines.  Traffic wardens will not administer the food hygiene regulations.  Will they administer on-the-spot fines for depositing litter on the street, for street trading or the failure to make an annual return to the registrar of companies?</P>
    <P>That brings us to another argument which has some validity and flies in the face of the philosophy contained in this Bill.  Should we have a specialised force&mdash;and this is a most important phrase&mdash;under the control of the Garda Síochána to deal with much of what has been suggested by that committee? Should this specialised force be members of the Garda Síochána specially trained to deal with this aspect of law enforcement?  Should they be in addition to the existing force of the Garda Síochána?  In my view, this is a matter for public debate.  I hope when Government speakers are replying they will realise that the Opposition were serious about a public debate on this subject and answer these questions: should traffic wardens be members of the Garda Síochána?  Should they be given a lesser type course than that given to the garda going on the beat for the first time?  We are not suggesting that this should happen but we are opening a debate on the subject. These are relevant arguments which can be dismissed or accepted, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>I realise that I have strayed from the principles of the Bill to some degree but my point in bringing up the 15th Interim Report of the Committee of Court Practice and Procedure was to refer specifically to paragraphs 8 (1) and 8 (4).  It was very interesting to note that there was a dissenting voice from a member of the committee to the totality of paragraph 8.  The dissenting voice is a respected member of the judiciary&mdash;High Court Judge John <Col N="566" /> Kenny.  On the 23rd July, 1971, in a note of dissent by Mr. Justice Kenny on paragraph 8 (1), dealing with the construction, equipment and use of mechanically propelled vehicles under the various Road Traffic Regulations, as amended, he said:</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the recommendation in paragraph 8 (1) that the &ldquo;On-the-Spot Fines&rdquo; system should be applied to offences in connection with mechanical or other defects in motor vehicles.  I think that a person who drives a motor car which he knows has a mechanical defect or smooth tyres or bad brakes, commits an offence which involves a high degree of moral culpability.  There is little difference in moral blame between the offences of driving when drunk and of using a motor car which is known to be defective.  I do not agree that a small penalty is appropriate for such a crime and I am convinced that the nominal penalties (10p for each defective tyre) which are imposed in some District Court areas for offences of this type have led to the view that they are trivial.</P>
    <P>The application of the &ldquo;On-the-Spot Fines&rdquo; system to these offences will confirm the view that they are not grave.  I find it difficult to believe that anyone can think that a fine of £2 is appropriate for a case where a person drives a car with brakes or tyres which he knows are defective.</P>
    <P>The number of serious accidents will contiune to increase unless we take effective steps to punish those who drive defective vehicles.  I hope that the next Act amending the Road Traffic code will provide for a mandatory disqualification from driving of one year at least when a person is convicted of driving a defective vehicle.</P>
    <P>I do not fully subscribe to the views expressed by the judge in relation to the actual punishment of the driving of a defective vehicle although I accept that driving a defective vehicle is a very serious matter.  Whether one should go as far as he is urged by Mr. Justice Kenny is a matter for <Col N="567" /> another day's debate.  Mr. Justice Kenny's submission is of very high relevance to what we are discussing here.  If this Bill is dealing, as we are being led to understand by the Minister, with tax discs and the shifting of the functions of the traffic wardens to the local authorities&mdash;and Mr. Justice Kenny considers that defective vehicles are the same as a drunken man driving a car&mdash;it would appear that at some future time, by regulation, for any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973, road traffic wardens can be given power to examine vehicles for defects, and so on.  According to Mr. Justice Kenny, this is a matter of high moral culpability.  If we are serious about law enforcement are we to hand over this area of law enforcement to untrained people?</P>

      <P>The Minister has now suggested that is not the position. We have grave doubts about that suggestion.  I urge my colleagues to take note of the dangers in section 3 which provides:</P>
      <P> (1)  This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973, and the offence under regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by those regulations a licence in respect of the vehicle issued under that Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  Where a traffic warden has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed an offence to which this section applies, he may deliver to the person a notice in the prescribed form stating... </P>
      <P>and so on.  This is in compliance with section 103 of the Road Traffic Act, as we understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> We are concerned that this Bill might extend the functions of the road traffic wardens.  If the Bill deals specifically with the non-display of road tax discs, there is no reason why the traffic wardens should not operate that regulation and why they should not bring to the attention of the authorities the fact that people are not displaying them, or have not paid their road tax.  We have absolutely no objection to that.  We object to law enforcement being taken away from the Garda and handed over to the local authorities.  I do not wish to underrate the functions of the local authorities but the principle is there, the principle of shifting law enforcement away from the Garda.  This is a small erosion, but it is a beginning. We see it as a dangerous beginning in shifting the functions of law enforcement from the Garda to an untrained and, perhaps, an undisciplined group of men and women.  That is the principle we see being eroded in this Bill.</P>
    <P>If the traffic wardens are to be given the authority to enforce the road traffic regulations under the guise of a minipolice force, can traffic wardens join trade unions?  This is the logic of the argument.  If traffic wardens are to be given the same powers and functions as the Garda in relation to this type of law enforcement, can the Garda ask the Minister for Justice if they can join trade unions?  Over the years the Garda have shown themselves to be disciplined and dedicated and loyal to the nation.  They have not been found wanting in that respect.  As we understand it, the Garda think that if a Bill of this nature is to be introduced into Dáil Éireann they should be consulted about it.  They have a legitimate complaint if they are not consulted about it and they must find some machinery under which they would be consulted automatically.  Were the traffic wardens or their representatives consulted? Were they told they were to be given these additional functions?  Were the Garda told either separately or with the traffic wardens that these functions were being handed over to the traffic wardens?  These questions must be answered.</P>
    <P>At the moment a group of management consultants are examining the <Col N="569" /> role and the functions of the Garda. We urge that those people who will be engaged in the administration of this legislation should be consulted. This should be enshrined in the report of the management consultants to their superiors and to the Minister for Justice.  If a function of a Dáil Deputy were to be given to a county councillor, I am sure Dáil Deputies would take great exception to not being consulted about it.  That would appear to be the situation here.</P>
    <P>The following are 11 parking offences: Standing a service vehicle for hire at a place which is not an appointed stand, failing to bring an omnibus wholly within road markings and stopping place or stand, parking a vehicle wholly or partly within roadway markings at an omnibus stopping place or stand, parking a vehicle in a place prohibited, parking a vehicle at a time prohibited, parking a vehicle for a time prohibited, parking a vehicle in a manner prohibited, parking a vehicle in a parking place in which parking is subject to the payment of fees without paying the specified fee, parking a vehicle in a parking place in which parking is subject to the payment of fees without paying the specified fees (a) at the time and (b) in the manner specified, parking a vehicle other than a vehicle of a specified class, and stopping a vehicle on a clearway.</P>
    <P>These effectively are the functions which the traffic wardens fulfil at present under the control of the Garda Síochána in that the Garda administer the fines.  We are being asked to give additional powers to this group of individuals who were set up to fulfil a particular function, the enforcement of parking laws.  We accept responsibility for setting up the traffic warden service but we do not want to give them responsibility for carrying out functions of the Garda.  This Bill introduces that concept and effectively erodes the functions of the Garda Síochána in the area of law enforcement.</P>
    <P>The motorist, apart from not being provided with proper streets in which to do his business and get from A to B, particularly in Dublin, in the <Col N="570" /> shortest possible time will now be subjected to the attention of untrained individuals who can confront him and ask for his name and address. If this Bill becomes law, as it will, having regard to the numerical strength of the Coalition, would the Minister, when replying, give some undertaking that traffic wardens will be given extra training courses?  The citizens are entitled to an assurance that the people who confront them are people who know how to deal with them.  This is not unreasonable and I am sure the Minister will give it reasonable consideration.</P>
    <P>These are our basic arguments against the Bill.  The Minister did not make clear the effects of section 3 (1) and we are rightly concerned about this section.  The Minister may say that the Garda have many other functions to carry out but the additional powers given to these traffic wardens is a matter of concern.  The local authority are now taking over the administration of road traffic offences in relation to the 11 I have desribed and the one outlined here and any additional ones the Minister may care to make from time to time by regulation. The most worrying feature of this Bill is that in respect of any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973, power may be given to the road traffic wardens, by regulation, under section 3 (1).  The Minister has suggested that is not the situation and if he can prove that we will accept it and concede that our suggestions are not correct.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman on Local Government, Deputy Faulkner, applies his mind assiduously to anything he does and having read this section and applied his mind to it, he is entitled to interpret it reasonably and responsibly.  In his opening speech he interpreted the section as he saw it and, indeed, having applied my own mind to it, I agree with his interpretation of it.  We accept that regulations must be introduced but, as we understand it, any offence against the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973, may be handed over to the traffic wardens, an appalling concept which effectively does away with the jurisdiction of the <Col N="571" /> Garda Síochána in regard to some very serious offences under that code.</P>
    <P>If the section does not have the effect we say it has would the Minister consider putting the section into comprehensible language which does not give the impression it gives at present? The House is entitled to have comprehensible legislation.  If the Minister says the section does not have the effect we think it has, it is not our fault when we read the section as it stands.  It is absolutely reasonable that the spokesman on Local Government should read the section as he has presented it and it would be unreasonable of the Minister to adopt an aggresive attitude about it.  If we are incorrect in this case, we shall be the first to admit it and I hope that the Minister will accept our interpretation is made <i>bona fide</i> in the absence of the service available to the Minister and that we are entitled to voice our interpretation in a responsible manner.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Bill has not yet been mentioned and might be mentioned now.  I understand the local authorities will now administer the fines taken up under this Bill.  One can only speculate in the absence of any relevant information.  Probably I should have the information readily available to me but I have not.  The traffic wardens will be paid by the local authorities.  But if, say, there is a corps of 20, 30 or 40 traffic wardens in an area in which all the citizens are law abiding in the context of the road traffic code so that there are no moneys accruing to the local authorities as a result of fines for traffic offences, would the local authority use moneys collected by way of rates to pay traffic wardens?  If so, will there be a further increase in the penal taxation of rates paid by urban, suburban and rural dwellers?  Can we expect there to come a day when the traffic wardens will become a burden on the rates?  Section 8 tells us that with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the Minister may make grants towards the expenses under this Act of a local authority.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in the final analysis, the administration of the Act will lie with <Col N="572" /> the Department of Local Government. We are told in section 9 that:</P>
    <P>The expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>These are preliminary observations on the Bill.  In the light of the Minister's replies to the questions raised we shall have to consider whether to table a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  I have the authority of our spokesman on Local Government to say this.  We have considered the Bill seriously and await the Minister's reply to the Second Stage debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to Deputy Andrew's contribution and I agree with him in his old-fashioned liberal approach, the suspicious approach, to anything which looks like an unnecessary extension of policing in a society which has all too good reason to fear any such extension, particularly when considering the experience of other countries.  I agree that the conferring of police powers or, something in the nature of police powers, on relatively untrained people, would not be desirable. I agree also that the more serious the offence the less desirable that that should happen.  However, I would draw attention to the fact that only a very arbitrary line separates, in many fields, the work done now by the Garda and the work done by a variety of other people.  In this country, as well as in others, the task of law enforcement must be carried out by people, not all of whom are part of the regular police force.  Otherwise, no country would be able to sustain a police force big enough to do all the necessary jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was different a couple of hundred years ago when the State did not take on itself more than the most limited tasks, such as the repression of serious crime, and when it relied on savagery of sentence in order to deter crime rather than the efficiency of prosecution by police officials.  In those times it was all right to rely on <Col N="573" /> an almost skeleton staff of local constables backed up now and then by, possibly, a posse.  The sheer size of functions is so great now that to have them conducted entirely by the police force would require a force of dimensions that would not be practicable or desirable.</P>
    <P>Within the past few moments I have thought of a number of areas in which law enforcement is carried out by bodies other than the regular police force.  For example, we have had school attendance officers since the twenties.  There are price inspectors under the orders of the Department of Industry and Commerce. There are health inspectors who have amazingly wide powers, who can batter down a door and invade a premises without the permission of the owner merely to ascertain whether there has been committed inside an offence against sanitary standards.  However, these people can eventually require the assistance of the Garda.  There are people, too, who are employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for the purpose of enforcing the law regarding television licences.  There are people employed by boards of fishery conservators in order to prevent poaching and there are customs officials at whose instance enormous fines can be imposed.  A striking example in this regard is the protection of our maritime fisheries.  The law which prohibits fishing by non-nationals in Irish territorial waters is not enforced by the Garda.  They could not assume this function without having a marine or naval service so the law is enforced by sailors.  On foot of what these sailors say, enormous fines can be imposed by the court and gear and catches can be confiscated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is already in existence a positive army of people in all walks of life who are enforcing the law in matters immeasurably more serious than the non-displaying of a tax disc or parking in an incorrect position on the roadway.  Therefore, I do not want anyone inside or outside of this House to go racing around in alarm at Deputy Andrews's words. We are not creating extraordinary <Col N="574" /> additional powers with constitutional dimensions which must terrorise the decent liberal conscience.  The intention here is to confer a relatively minor additional function on an organised body of men already in existence.</P>
    <P>The point of view articulated by Deputy Andrews and possibly by others is essentially that all law which can end in a penalty ought to be enforced by the police.  That might have been fair enough once upon a time in a relatively settled era&mdash;for example, in the years 1910 or 1950&mdash; and I am taking these two years arbitrarily because they were fairly settled years in the unhappy history of this country.  It was all very well for the constable in 1910 or the garda in 1950 to spend his morning peddling out to see if a farmer had a licence for a bull, to see if he had cut thistle, ragwort and dock which had been growing in his fields, or to spend his time issuing prosecutions for not having dog licences.  Those days are gone and they will not return until quite different political conditions, such as we have not experienced for the last six or seven years, return.  We are now in a situation where all you have to do is to go into the Library and look at the newspaper file of the last week. We are now in a situation where a funeral requires an escort of hundreds of gardaí and where at commemorations an escort is required not only of hundreds of gardaí but also of soldiers. These are not the conditions in which it is reasonable to ask the gardaí, the ordinary police force, to spend their time worrying about tax discs or parking meters.</P>
    <P>I picked up this morning's Order Paper when I was having breakfast and looked through it, as is my habit, and I just happened to notice&mdash;it came back to me when I heard Deputy Andrews's speech&mdash;a whole raft of questions down to the Minister for Justice and I take the liberty now of reading to the House Questions Nos. 55, 56 and 57 of today's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>55.  To ask the Minister for Justice if, in view of the recent spate of robberies in the Minane Bridge, <Col N="575" /> Nohoval and Belgooley areas of County Cork, he is taking steps to strengthen the Garda force in the area.&mdash;Deputy Gene Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>56.  To ask the Minister for Justice if he will consider increasing the strength of the Garda force in the village of Dromahair, County Leitrim where there is now a sergeant and one garda.&mdash;Deputy Joe McLaughlin.</P>
    <P>57.  To ask the Minister for Justice if he has any plans for an increase in the number of gardaí stationed in Malahide, County Dublin.&mdash;Deputy Raphael P. Burke.</P>
    <P>This situation reflected by these questions and others is that Garda stations up and down the country are stripped. We know why they are stripped.  We are not debating the political issues behind the necessity for stripping them but every day this House sits and the Minister for Justice is called on to answer questions he has to answer questions bearing on this very matter: why can the gardaí not do this, that and the other?  Earlier on on today's Order Paper there are questions as to why there are not more speeding prosecutions.  I have to write to the gardaí in my constituency occasionally, and let me acknowledge here that I have had the most absolute and unfailing courtesy and consideration from them, to ask them to do the impossible, to deal simultaneously, a small Garda force, and small because its members are engaged in dealing with subversion, with problems created by the itinerants, by speeding cars, by rioting teenagers after dances.  The situation is impossible. It simply cannot be done. The gardaí make a valiant attempt to do it, and everybody honours them for it, but the kind of problems which are met nowadays which the Garda have to deal with are beyond the physical powers of a body of some 6,000 men.  It just cannot be done and it never could be done since the State took on in the disturbed political conditions of the last few years the range of duties it has now assumed.  Enforcing television licence fees, enforcing <Col N="576" /> vice regulations, enforcing sanitary regulations, enforcing fishery regulations, and so forth, these things have had to be confided, may I say, to a positive army of other people.  That is not a new story.  It is an old, old story and I am perfectly certain Deputy Andrews would acknowledge this if he were here.  I say all this merely to warn the House and anybody who may have been listening to him not to get this thing out of proportion and not to assume we are speaking here of some new, amazing encroachment on the citizens' liberties which requires condemnation or unfavourable scrutiny.  Everything requires scrutiny here but what is happening here is a very, very trivial thing compared with the extensions of the law enforcement powers of people who are not policemen over the last 50 or 60 years.</P>
    <P>The only other thing I want to say arises from the criticisms of Deputy Andrews and, I think, of Deputy Faulkner on the phraseology of section 3 (1).  If I understand their argument it is to the effect that the way in which the subsection is phrased makes it possible for traffic wardens to be employed in the tracking down of even the most serious offences under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, such as dangerous driving causing death, driving under the influence of drink or under the influence of drugs. I must admit&mdash;I make a present of this to the Opposition&mdash;I certainly would not be happy to see people who were not very specially trained given such wide functions and I presume that is the reason why the powers are not being conferred in a blanket way and why the Minister for Local Government must consult with the Minister for Justice before making any such regulation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition would be quite right not to let us get away with an assurance which is not to be seen anywhere in the Bill and I take it the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government will not confer, except in conditions of desperate emergency, the enforcement of the laws against serious traffic offences under the 1961 Act on relatively untrained <Col N="577" /> men.  I take it no Minister for Justice and no Minister for Local Government would be so unreasonable. It may be that that is not the intention.  It may be that, when this Bill leaves this House, the subsection will be differently phrased.  I hope I shall not be misinterpreted now when I say that, against the background of what I have been saying, there are quite serious offences, such as customs offences and so on, which are tracked down by people who are not policemen; they are trained in their own particular branch.  I do not see any reason of what I call principle&mdash; I can see incidental reasons of desirability to the effect that we cannot allow an elderly man, for instance, who is not sufficiently trained to track down very serious traffic offences; I can see that argument quite well but I cannot see, in principle, why anyone who is not a fully fledged member of the Garda Síochána should not be given some function in the matter of tracking down and bringing to justice even the more serious traffic offences.  I hope I am not horrifying anyone in saying this and I think that is not the intention of the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Deputy means and I believe the court, when called on to decide the validity of a regulation which conferred, as the section stands, power on a traffic warden to initiate a prosecution for drunken driving would have to look at the section as a whole and would have to say that it is quite clear that any offence of this kind was not intended. I do not mean to deliver a lecture to Deputy Faulkner who is perfectly right to take the layman's approach to this Bill because it is laymen it will affect but a court interpreting any section of the Bill will look at it in the context of the whole and a court asked to say a prosecution for drunken driving could be initiated as the Bill stands by a traffic warden would look down the section, would be invited <Col N="578" /> to do so by counsel, and would look beyond subsection (3) and find reference to the fixing to a vehicle of a notice in the prescribed form.  That clearly could not be the intention of the Legislature and neither is it our intention in regard to a prosecution of this kind.</P>
      <P>The only way to initiate a drunken driving prosecution is by going straight to the man not the vehicle.  It seems to be clear from the phrase to which I have adverted that the offences, which this section envisages, are offences which are absolutely evident and visible on the face of a stationary vehicle.  I do not want to prejudge what the Minister may say but it might be desirable if that were said more clearly.  It seems to me looking at the section as a whole, that it could not be reasonably taken and would not be taken by a court as empowering those two Ministers, as the section stands, to bring drunken driving within the purview of the traffic warden.</P>
      <P>There is one very small point, which may be only a drafting point, which I would like the Minister to look at. I see that in subsection (2), clause (b) of section 3 there is a reference to a prescribed amount but I do not see, unless it may be in some other Act, any reference to who is to prescribe the amount or how the amount is to be prescribed.  I see a reference at the top of the subsection to a notice in the prescribed form.</P>

      <P>We have had so many restrictive measures introduced on road users that I often wonder if we are committed to a punitive campaign against road users in general as a cover up for-our failure to effect a proper facilities for road users.  While it may be most difficult for any Government to provide this perfect road code and provide all the things necessary for it, we are dealing rather harshly with road users in general and car owners in particular.</P>
      <P>I will deal with the matter in the context of Dublin because that is the area I know most about.  There would be less need for traffic wardens if we could provide sufficient parking space. We should not blind ourselves to the fact that we are rather unjust to motorists.  Rumours last week suggested that the Government may double road tax on cars.  We probably will know that on Thursday week. We had a punitive imposition on petrol at the end of last year.  I regard the new measures as a type of cover-up for our failure to provide proper throughfares, proper roadways and access roads so that we can have some type of civilised road pattern.</P>
      <P>I have nothing whatever against traffic wardens.  They do a good job but I fear any extension of police powers to traffic wardens when such people have not been trained for this. The Parliamentary Secretary stated that various posts, such as health inspectors, had a kind of police duty.  He also mentioned other areas.  He made a very good case for the employment or more gardaí.  An Opposition should be vigilant and ensure that we do not lightly pass legislation which will confer on generally untrained people powers which are required for a very well trained police force.  It is the duty of an Opposition in a democracy to watch such measures as this and ensure we do not wake up some morning and find ourselves with an overdose of various degrees of police force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The Garda, as everybody will agree, since their inception have given a very good service to the community and their integrity is beyond doubt.  The traffic wardens in the short time they have been here have also shown they can perform their limited duties in a very satisfactory manner.  I want to see the division of power all the time, that the Garda are the police force appointed under the various Acts and that we hold them in respect and have trust in them to do their many duties, some of which are very dangerous nowadays. We should not suggest, as the Parliamentary Secretary did, that because of their numerous duties, we should take some duties from them and give them to a lesser force.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the Bill which gives protection to traffic wardens and I agree with it.  Some of our traffic wardens, both men and women, suffer violent abuse from some motorists because they are doing their duties.  I mention that because I respect the status of traffic wardens but I will not agree to giving them the powers of gardaí.  They were not recruited for that and they were never meant to have such powers.  While the Minister may say the Bill is a replica of one the previous Government were preparing we do not accept that.  I could never find myself agreeing to pass on the power envisaged in section 3 to any man or woman who gets a week's training and is turned loose on the streets.  They do their work at the moment without fear or favour.</P>

      <P>I will make my contribution in spite of the interruptions by the Minister.  The Minister is extending the powers of the traffic wardens at a time when most people do not want that carried out.  I should like to know what the attitude of the Garda is with regard to this.  Have they been consulted?  Will the Minister have it bulldozed through this House and then say to the Garda that they will have to take it whether they want it or not?</P>
      <P>Some of the controls introduced in recent times on road users are necessary but all the controls are against the motorists.  We have had no-parking signs, yellow lines, parking meters, traffic wardens and the towing away of cars.  In my view this is a cover-up for a lack of progress in the design and provision of a proper road pattern so that road users, motorists and pedestrians, can be given the greatest degree of safety.  This Bill should be withdrawn until the Government produce a road plan and a highway code. Otherwise we are papering over the cracks in the whole structure of transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will give extra powers to traffic wardens but we do not know whether it will be effective.  If the powers in the Bill are so small I do not know whether it is worthwhile writing any regulations into it.  Motorists are now suffering from what could be called &ldquo;trafficitis&rdquo;.  This <Col N="582" /> applies to all our citizens because of the great increase in the volume of traffic using the roads which were constructed many years ago.  I feel sorry for the old person who has to cross our thoroughfares and for the motorist, who, because of his business, must park within the precincts of this city.  In a lot of cases the motorist must park a long way from his business and sometimes when he returns, he finds that his car has been tampered with and items in it stolen or damaged.  We do not need an extension of the duties of the traffic wardens but an extension of the Garda and the provision of proper highways.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that motorists are not to blame for a lot of their own troubles; they are in many respects and we are all inclined to bend the rules if we can.  I should like to pay tribute to the traffic wardens who put tickets on all cars whether they are owned by Deputies or anybody else. They act fairly in this regard.  I received tickets when I deserved them. I mention this to show that I am in no way prejudiced against traffic wardens. Indeed, I can claim some credit, with my colleagues in Dublin Corporation, for being the first to introduce the school warden service which has since spread throughout the country.  It is wrong to impose on the traffic wardens the duties of gardaí which will leave these wardens open to more danger.  The Minister should ensure that traffic wardens remain traffic wardens and that they will not have imposed upon them the responsibilities of gardaí when they have not been trained for that job.  We are sending out men and women on to our streets and expecting them to be as efficient as a fully trained garda.</P>
    <P>When these wardens accepted the job from the municipal and local authorities they understood that their job was to prevent the chaos on our streets but now their responsibilities are being extended and it is possible that in a few years their responsibilities will be extended further by another Bill.  I agree that it is not easy to solve the traffic problem in our cities but it is not being helped by the latest menace on our roads, <Col N="583" /> the juggernaut.  These vehicles are parked after hours in residential areas. One man told me that even if he had to pay a fine for parking in a residential area it was a cheap way of getting protection for his vehicle during the night.  While the people in those residential areas resented him parking there the fact that the crime rate was low in these areas meant that his truck was safe during the night.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be better employed trying to sort that problem out than extending the powers and responsibilities of the traffic warden. This move may result in an imposition on the local rates because although the Minister may say that help may be given by the State to the running of this service he warns us that he would not be generous in this regard. We may have a situation where the Garda will be taken away from their duties and the ratepayers will have to pay for those who replace them, the traffic wardens.  I understand that the traffic section of the Garda Síochána had the patrol cars which were at their disposal taken away from them. I serve on the traffic committee in this city and at each meeting we are given a lit of new prohibitions by the Garda.  Some of them are necessary but this is happening every month. For this reason the duties of the traffic wardens will be increased monthly. In a short time, with the number of restrictions and the increased power of wardens, it will not be the best city for a motorist.</P>
    <P>The Government are not facing up to the problem of traffic control and this measure will not do much to help in this regard.  If the Minister feels it is a harmless Bill, I wonder why it was introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the word that was used.  We can expect that this one is not innocuous.  It may be annoying without being innocuous, but what we have to sort out is the question of giving traffic wardens the powers of a garda.  That is what the whole Bill is about.  We are in agreement with section 1 in so far as it gives protection to traffic wardens in doing their present job, but central and local government must face up to the fact that there is a great problem on the roads and that it can only be solved by a comprehensive policy of road and traffic control and not by expanding the powers of traffic wardens in this short Bill.  I do not expect the Minister to perfect all our road systems by waving a magic wand, but he would be far better employed if we were studying how best to help the road user rather than how to punish him further.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the traffic wardens have been consulted in this matter as to whether or not they will accept the new duties, or whether the Garda welcome this Bill.  Those are two bodies that should have been consulted before the Bill was introduced.  They may have been consulted, but from what I hear from individuals they do not agree with it.</P>
      <P>We have reached the stage now of a somewhat Orwellian era when extra police powers are being given to people who have not been fully trained for them.  The Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, stated that for a funeral 100 gardaí may be needed, or for a protest march perhaps many more. These are signs of the times we are living in.  We do not deny that these problems exist, that the gardaí are having a tougher time now than ever they had, but I think we are wrong in what we are trying to do to help them out.  Subsection (5) (b) of section 2 says:</P>
      <P>A person who contravenes this subsection shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can think of some youngster just tearing the ticket off and, in accordance <Col N="585" /> with the Bill, he could be fined £20.  In regard to this Bill we are dividing ourselves into &ldquo;them&rdquo; versus &ldquo;us&rdquo;, whereby if you drive a car or even ride a bicycle the Government or the State are watching you like big brother and will punish you severely for the least violation of the law. Therefore, we are increasing the number of people who have got police powers, and I think the Opposition in any parliament in a democracy would oppose this, I do not want to be taken as opposing the Bill because this Government brought it in.  We realise the problem is complex, but it requires a different approach.</P>
    <P>If a person drives while drunk or drives a defective vehicle he is guilty of an offence, but there should be a more flexible attitude towards violations of parking regulations.  An ambulance going into a hospital may well be obstructed by a person who has parked his car there.  Of course this is wrong, but the person who parks his car at the hospital may also be bringing a patient in there.  We must consider the lack of parking space and try to adjudicate on the lines that every man who parks his car in the wrong place is not a criminal.  Instead of giving the traffic warden police powers, what is needed is a goodwill campaign on the part of the Government which will encourage the motorist to be a good driver and encourage the cyclist or motor cyclist to be good road users.  Such legislation as this can only create an atmosphere in which road users will view any new punitive measures as ones to be avoided, at best, or to be broken and held in contempt, at worst.</P>
    <P>The Minister may amend the Bill&mdash; I do not know whether he will or not &mdash;so that the powers of the traffic warden will be maintained at their present level.  I should like to see the traffic warden doing his duty, certainly. Many of them do use discretion, but we would destroy any hope of creating goodwill if a situation develops in which a traffic warden is there as a policeman.  The Minister must realise that if we are not succeeding in curbing abuses on the road, if we are not reducing the numbers <Col N="586" /> being killed or injured, at least in the city, there is another answer to it rather than simply bringing in new regulations and extending the powers towards penalising anyone who, even in a small way, breaks the law.  We start off on a false premises if we think those people do not want to break the law, and we all agree that if a person breaks the law he must be punished.  However, if the law is unjust one has qualms about punishing a person.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give us much of an assurance that death and injury will be driven from our roads.  This morning the Minister said this Bill came from the last Government.  This Government have been in office for two years and traffic trends have changed considerably in that time. Therefore, we should have a very much improved Bill.  I do not know if traffic laws are more severe or less severe in other countries but in them they have greater traffic density because of greater population.</P>
    <P>Our main priority is to make our roads safer for the people using them. Instead of handing traffic duties over completely to wardens we should be thinking on the lines of setting up a special traffic section of the Garda Síochána manned by specially trained officers with knowledge of the needs of road users and with expert training in traffic control.  While the main Garda force would be dealing with crime prevention, the special corps I have in mind would deal exclusively with traffic matters.  I would even go so far as to suggest that there would be officers with special engineering training so that they could advise on road construction.</P>
    <P>We can think of the terrible slaughter in Northern Ireland in the last few years and compare that with the hundreds of people killed on our roads in the same period.  I think we would find that a lot more people were killed on the roads.  There is, therefore, a prior duty on the Government to try every means possible to reduce deaths and injuries from traffic accidents.  We all know that it is impossible to prevent all <Col N="587" /> accidents, but with better legislation and a special corps of the Garda Síochána to deal with traffic control much death and injury could be prevented.</P>
    <P>This will not entail a cutting down of the police force.  Rather should there be a general upgrading.  Until we tackle traffic problems in that way we will not have a proper road pattern and death and injuries will continue on our roads.  Since we entered Europe another problem has been added to our traffic control and road safety.  We now see roll-on-roll-off containers leaving ferries at the docks, travelling to the four corners of the country and then returning to the ferries to go on to the continent. That is another reason why we must provide a new traffic police force.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister that the Bill is aiming in the right direction.  Instead of giving the Garda more power, we are taking some of their powers away from them by giving police powers to traffic wardens.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach pointed out the training required by health inspectors. His point was all wrong.  It is agreed that they do long periods of training.  So do weights inspectors, but those people do their work in private and the number of people affected by their activities is very small.  On the other hand, traffic wardens deal with hundreds of people and thousands of cars per day.  The Minister should look at the traffic warden service.  In this city while one might get a meter and park the car, when one returns one cannot get out because somebody has double parked.  The number of traffic wardens should be increased so that they could do the job for which they were recruited.</P>
    <P>The Minister with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, might get together and bring forward a new road charter in which the traffic warden would have his place and the Garda would have prime place.  With the co-operation of these two bodies and the goodwill of the road users, we could <Col N="588" /> have a more civilised situation than we have at the moment.  Hundreds of people are killed and thousands are maimed each year on our roads because some people break the law.  Of course, in some cases these accidents may have occurred because of bad roads.  There could be a hundred reasons why accidents happen.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for a very competent Department.  This Bill is going the wrong way about bringing in an improvement in the traffic situation. Perhaps on the next Stage we will approach this Bill in a spirit of goodwill with the Minister amending it, especially section 3 which worries, not only the Opposition but the Garda and even, to a greater extent, the traffic wardens.  Will the Minister tell us the attitude of the Garda and the traffic wardens to this Bill?  We do not know.  The Minister has the power to discuss these matters with those concerned.  One may discuss it with an individual but that is not the same as the Department sounding out the attitudes of the various sections of the community which will be affected.  If the Minister takes the trouble to find out what people think of section 3, he will discover that the majority oppose it.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly the motorist believes that he has been victimised on many occasions.  Motorists took the last petrol increase very badly. They suspect any new move which will further penalise them.  I do not suggest that if a motorist breaks the law he should get away with it. Nobody could stand for that.  We will have to decide how effectively to punish the lawbreaker.  What system will ensure a proper road traffic corps which is not out all the time to punish road users?  It is in this spirit that this legislation should be introduced.</P>
    <P>Something must be done about traffic in the city.  The local authorities are doing a certain amount but in a piecemeal way.  In my opinion all our road traffic legislation is piecemeal. When the Minister announced that he was bringing in the Road Traffic Bill I expected a comprehensive Bill which would remedy the defects in our present system.  What <Col N="589" /> are the weaknesses in our road traffic legislation?  What should we do to perfect them?  What must we do to make our roads safer?  What must we do to show that we are not out to punish motorists?  How can we prevent abuses of the present Bill?  As the Minister can see, there is a lot still to be done by the Government and the motorist to make our roads safer.  This should be our ambition: to reduce the injury and death tolls on our roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say this is a simple Bill and not intended to cause a revolution.  If so, why did he introduce it?  There is a crying need for comprehensive legislation dealing with road usage.  This Bill is not doing it. Perhaps when the Minister has another look at this Bill and has heard contributions from both sides of this House he might give us better legislation.</P>
    <P>Heavy traffic passing through residential areas can be the cause of ill-health. This is a new feature of suburbia.  People's nerves are shattered because of the heavy volume of traffic.  I do not blame the Minister for the local scene.  The local authorities must do their job, but the Minister has the power to override the local authority.  He must set the headline for the new pattern in not alone road construction but in the policing of these roads.</P>
    <P>Is it the duty of every Member of this House not merely to pay lip service to the cause of road service but to examine this legislation and say that we are not prepared to penalise motorists for parking in the wrong place or for any other minor infringement of the law.  The number of people being brought to court for minor offences is increasing.  Instead of increasing the number in the police force, we are going to water it down by saying that we do not consider these offences serious enough for gardaí to deal with them so we will let the traffic warden deal with them, even though he has not the same standing in the community as gardaí and will not have the confidence of the public.</P>
    <P>I re-emphasise my earlier point. <Col N="590" /> The Minister with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, should bring in a traffic corps within the Garda.  The Garda and the traffic authority in any city should have greater powers than the local authority.  The local authority may be second fiddle to the Garda in traffic matters.  We are not quibbling at this.  This being true the Minister, far from taking power from the Garda and handing it to another body, should be trying to find out how we could give the Garda better facilities and better resources to deal with the problems of road usage in general.  If it were a small matter like breaking the law by parking in the wrong place, that could be dealt with very easily indeed. Behind this is the whole problem of what we can do to bring about some improvement in road conduct and road behaviour on the part of motorists.  I do not suggest for a moment that all these people are blameless or that some people do not break the law deliberately. Some do.  We should be studying why this happens and why so many people are killed on our roads today.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha are doing a very good job in this type of study. They can give the Department the benefit of their wisdom and knowledge in these matters.  Having such knowledge at his disposal the Minister should get together with the Department of Justice to examine the problem which faces us.  It is a dire problem.  He should then come to the House and say: &ldquo;Here is a new charter for the roads.&rdquo;  In that charter should be enshrined the principle that the Garda are our only police force, that we are rather jealous of that and that we will not take away any powers from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that in this city we have the harbour police.  They act only within the dock area.  They have been in existence for many years and they have special duties.  They have not got the powers of the Garda in many matters, and we have never sought them for them.  These men who operate in the dock area have a very tough job, and it is not getting any easier.  We did not give them the <Col N="591" /> powers of the Garda.  They have a more difficult task to perform than the traffic wardens and nobody has ever said they should be given greater powers.  If it were suggested that the harbour police should be given greater powers, we would have to look at those proposals and see what powers they have and what extension, if any, should be considered for them.</P>
    <P>We would examine any such proposals in the same way as we are examining this Bill, not because we want to oppose the Minister but because we think that, with the collective wisdom of the House and the resources outside, we should be able to draft legislation which will be for the betterment and the improvement of society in general in so far as it is affected by the pattern of road traffic or the pattern of road usage.  There is no easy way out.  There is no use in shutting our eyes and hoping the problem will go away because when we open them again it will still be there.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister should have a new look at the powers of the Garda and, if their members are too low to enable them to perform their duties to the fullest extent, more men and women should be recruited instead of trying to syphon off some of their duties to a lesser force who are not ready to take on the task.  When the Minister is replying I should like him to tell us what is the attitude of the traffic wardens and what is the attitude of the Garda to this Bill.  Will he spell out for us whether there will be any imposition on the local rates to finance this extension of the powers of the traffic wardens?  They have done a good job in so far as the job they were given to do is being done well.  I do not want to see any extension of this power.  If they have not got the full powers which the Minister wishes them to have, instead of giving them police powers he should create a traffic corps within the Garda.  This corps could very well be made a distinctive arm of the Garda.  The attitude should be that the traffic corps are there to help the people and not merely to punish them.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be repaid by receiving the fullest co-operation of the people once they knew he was <Col N="592" /> trying hard not to put through some punitive measures but to put through a measure which would help all road users.  This cannot be done by taking some powers from the Garda and giving them to people who, while they may be the best in the world as traffic wardens, are not trained for police duties.  I do not think they should be trained for police duties.  We depend very much on our police force today.  In a society which is not becoming more simple but which is becoming more complicated every day, we should ensure that the Garda are looked upon as the guardians of the people and the preventers of crime and not a punitive body.</P>
    <P>We should accord our police force the full respect which they deserve. We should tell them we have a job for them to do in the proper policing of our roads and in advising on what we should do to make them safer.  We should give them all the resources they need for this most important job.  I accept that the Garda are overworked at the moment but we should not take powers from them and give them to the traffic wardens.  I do not think that would work.  The Minister should have another look at the Bill and, instead of trying to syphon off some of the duties of the Garda, he should set up a traffic corps which would be a very effective body within the Garda.  In this way we would achieve a greater degree of safety on the roads and reduce the frightful toll of dead and injured.  There is still time to bring in this new charter. This Bill is a very poor substitute for it.</P>

      <P>I think that the arguments put forward by this side of the House against the introduction of the Bill are indeed very convincing.  I am sure that the Minister will take into account many of the things said here this morning.  I would like to compliment Deputy Andrews on his contribution and the research that he has done into the implications of this measure that is being introduced here today.  I am sure that the House will benefit from the arguments that he has put forward, which I consider to be very reasoned arguments indeed.  On my part, I am convinced <Col N="593" /> that there is no need at all for this kind of Bill, which is an attempt by the Government to provide a cheap police force here.  Perhaps the Minister is trying to ensure that when he leaves the Department of Local Government his name will live on because this force, if it is introduced under this Bill, can be named the &ldquo;Tully Bridgade&rdquo; because this is something that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Minister will be remembered by.  I am sure that many people who will, as a result of this measure, get tickets placed on their cars, will think of the Minister and the time he spent, or wasted, in the Department of Local Government introducing measures of this kind.</P>
      <P>The powers now being proposed for traffic wardens should be given to the gardaí to allow them to operate on-the-spot fines for offences under the Road Traffic Acts.  At least this system could be tested for a trial period.  I have no doubt that it would be far more effective than the measures introduced in this Bill.  It is pointless trying to create an army of traffic wardens until such time as local authorities have adequate parking facilities.  This is the first thing the Minister should concern himself with&mdash;to ensure that in every town, every large town in particular and every city, adequate parking facilities should be made available.  He should ensure that our motoring public have places to park their cars.  This is the big problem now.  In every city motorists are harassed.  They want to do their shopping in a particular area; they have to drive round and round trying to find a suitable parking place. As soon as they find what they think is a suitable parking place, they have to move away again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Minister's first duty to provide those parking places.  The amenity grants which were introduced some time ago would go some of the way towards helping in this problem. Small communities with the help of these amenity grants were providing parking places, but, unfortunately, now that money is not available we <Col N="594" /> find that local communities can no longer do this kind of work.  This is unfortunate because they were doing very good work and providing a service for the general public.  I can well imagine the situation, say, in the city of Galway, or in Salthill, at this time of the year, where we have an influx of tourists.  Those tourists will be harassed by traffic wardens and driven from one part of the city to the other.  It will have a very adverse effect on our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the first thing that should be done is to provide the parking space.  Then, if the motoring public are not co-operating, by all means some system of ensuring that they do keep within the parking limits could be devised or otherwise they would have to pay the penalty.  I see nothing wrong with the Garda Síochána enforcing the regulations.  If they were allowed to enforce the on-the-spot fines they would go a long way towards eliminating any problem as regards parking.</P>
    <P>The duties as outlined for a traffic warden in this Bill are checking parking, and these could be extended to tax discs.  If this is so&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is being specific in extending to tax discs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if it includes tax discs as well as parking then the trouble here, as I see it, is that there is nothing to stop the Minister or any future Minister from extending this to cover other offences under the Road Traffic Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offences under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to <Col N="595" /> 1973 and the offence under regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by those regulations a licence in respect of the vehicle issued under that Act.</P>
    <P>My argument is that there is nothing to stop the Minister from extending the powers of the traffic wardens to take in other offences, such as offences for bald tyres or defective lighting or something like that.  The Minister has the power to do this, and this is what I would object to, because it is taking away from the duties of the Garda Síochána who are trained to carry out this work.  I realise that the traffic wardens will be trained but their period of training is very short.  They are not subject to supervision in the same way as the Garda Síochána are. The gardaí have to report to their sergeants or their superintendent or whoever might be in charge every morning and they are given their duties for the day.  They are told how to carry out those duties.  But for the traffic warden it would be different. They are allocated a stretch of road: they go out, and some of them seem to be &ldquo;ticket happy&rdquo;: they seem to take a certain joy out of placing their tickets on the unfortunate motorists' cars.  Often the motorist has to park the car there because he has no other parking facilities available to him.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill I understand the local authorities will have the power to collect the fines.  Here, again, I would see this as an attempt to reimburse local authority funds.  If the county manager sees that he is running short of money there is nothing to prevent him calling in his wardens and telling them: &ldquo;Come on lads; get on with the job; I need more money; we will have to get it in some way.&rdquo;  This would mean that the traffic wardens would be far more vigilant than they were intended to be.  It will, of course, create problems for the local authorities as regards prosecution for non-payment of penalties.  As far as I can see, at present the lawyers employed by the local authorities <Col N="596" /> are up to their eyes in work and it is pretty hard at times to have carried out certain work which comes within their ambit.  This will create more problems and more expense although I realise that they can recoup any expenses from the Department of Local Government.  Nevertheless it will create many problems for our county solicitors.  It is completely unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The definition of local authorities in the Bill includes a county council, the corporation of a county or other borough, the council of an urban district or the commissioners of a town.  I wonder whether town commissioners are entitled to employ traffic wardens or is it intended that the county council, which would be over all authority in the county, would be responsible for the town commission and the urban district council, also.</P>

      <P>The town commission could collect the fines and put them into their funds but the objection I would see to that is that the town commission, some that I know anyway, have a considerable amount of money at their disposal which they have invested and they are not responsible for building houses.

      <P>If they gave it to the county council we would find use for it.  These are just a few arguments I have against the Bill.  I shall not detain the House any longer because Deputy Andrews and Deputy Faulkner went into the Bill in great detail.  My main argument is that adequate parking facilities should be provided in our cities and towns.  If that were done it would be a step in the right direction rather than introducing a Bill that will harass our motorists further.  They have enough harassment already with the price of petrol and everything else increasing every day.  They have enough trouble besides inflicting this on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interesting point arising out of the remark of the Minister, with reference to town commissioners.  Deputy Hussey referred to a town commission which has some funds invested. Suppose you had town commissioners who had no funds and who appoint a warden and, as the Minister stated, will have to collect these fines to pay him.  One can visualise a situation coming to the end of the financial year where a town commission who want to indulge in the luxury of a warden&mdash; and they are quite entitled to do this; every other local authority are doing it&mdash;have not the money to pay his salary.  There are a couple of choices open to them.  They can send a deputation to the Minister to look for funds to pay the warden.  The stock reply from Ministers at the moment to requests for deputations is: &ldquo;No, we will not meet a deputation.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is on the list of five.  Suppose the town commissioners or the urban council find themselves in the position that they are not able to pay the official salary they will get a &ldquo;no&rdquo; from Local Government.  At subsequent meetings their attitude would be that, if the warden had not raised a fair amount towards the payment of his salary, he should be told to redouble his efforts.  This is one of the many weaknesses in the Bill.  It will lead to this sort of thing and this would be in a town where you have an excellent force of gardaí, where it is possible to do this work by means of gardaí, paid by the State and not by the local authority.  This is what I am objecting to.  This is following a rapidly increasing pattern where payment of services which up to this <Col N="599" /> were paid by way of central funds now there is a dramatic endeavour to transfer payment for this to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham apparently has not looked at it the other way round.  He is somewhat confused.  We are paying a lot which was previously paid by the local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that. There is need for this in any case but what I am alleging is that the other thing that is happening to a greater extent is that the buck is being passed to local authorities for payment and this is evident in another Bill before us, on the question of home assistance officers and all this sort of thing.  However, the real reason I want to speak on this is that I object violently to the present wording and contents of section 3 (1). There is so much doubt about the position that in regard to offences under the Road Traffic Acts, the wording of the section is such that, from my interpretation of it and from what the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kelly, said today, I think they might have to be referred to the court for decisions.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a legal man and I understand it is likely the decision of the court would come down on the interpretation of the Minister, but he was not quite sure about that. Any serious widening of the existing powers of traffic wardens should be opposed.</P>
      <P>I agree that the only offence certified by the Minister is in connection with motor taxation.  There are other offences which could be categorised in the same way, such as illegal parking, not displaying tax discs and not having cars taxed.  To allay the alarm section 3 (1) is causing I would advise the Minister to state definitely what the other specific offences are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Parking offences.  That is the one point all the Opposition Deputies are missing out on.  I agree Deputy Cunningham has a point in what he said earlier but, if he looks at <Col N="600" /> it again, he will see that it is definitely a parking offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Section 3 (1) as it appears here, and as it appears to legal people, is not specific enough to deal with what the Minister says the duties of wardens will be.  He does spell out one duty, that dealing with motor taxation offences.  If that is the only one why include the various Traffic Acts?  Why does he not specify if there are no others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that point but, as far as I can see, it is intended in only one way.  It is quite possible that people may take another interpretation, but I think the legal interpretation is the one I have given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the legal people with whom I have spoken do not agree that the Minister's repetition of his legal advice is the correct legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the existing traffic warden legislation and Deputy Cunningham is aware of that.  This is in the existing law.  Why did they not find it was wrong then?  Why did the legal people not find it wrong then or why have the traffic wardens not been doing other than what they are doing?</P>

      <P>It has to be that way. If I were writing legislation myself, like Deputy Cunningham, I would write it down in layman's language that we could understand but the legislation might not stand up in court.

      <P>Thank you.  I do not understand why, having enumerated a wide range of Acts from 1961 to 1973, and then the 1920 Act, there is all this verbiage in order to cover motor taxation only.  This is one of the things what has caused this lengthy debate. The other is the question of payments. Deputy Hussey raised a very interesting point, that is, the question of facilities for parking in the various towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the non-reference to school traffic wardens as an omission from the Bill.  I do not know if this is the responsibility of the Minister or not. This is something which he could consider.  It would be desirable to have all traffic wardens included in future <Col N="603" /> legislation; traffic wardens have to deal with pedestrians as well as motor car offenders.  They should not only have to look after car offenders. Everybody is against the motorist&mdash; in many cases rightly so&mdash;but pedestrians, as well as others, can also offend against the Traffic Acts.  It may not be possible for the Minister to do it here, but school wardens should be included either in this or future legislation which would tidy up the whole matter and put the responsibility on one authority.</P>
    <P>It is strange, in present circumstances when the Dáil is approaching the recess period and a very heavy recession period also, that we should be taking up the time of this House dealing with a Bill urgently brought in by the Minister.  What is the urgency of this Bill?  Even when there are traffic wardens to deal with parking offences, the Government do not have the money to provide the parking facilities to which the motoring public are entitled if they are to observe the regulations of this Bill.  In this period of recession, we are taking up the time of the House discussing a Bill, which I suppose is necessary, but is certainly not urgent, dealing with regulations which cannot be enforced in many areas because of the lack of facilities.</P>
    <P>The Planning Bill has been before the House for a very long time.  The Minister, when in Opposition, called for this Bill over the last ten years. When the then Opposition made accusations against people in charge of planning&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion that it is an untruth, having found the Minister telling one earlier, during my short contribution. I am not terribly interested in the minor points.  I know they will be aggravatory.  Local authorities may not be the best people to appoint wardens.  I do not know whether the appointment of wardens will be made by the Local Appointments Commission.  It would be desirable if this could be done.  I do not know whether it will be the manager in the local authority who will decide where the wardens are required.  It is an important point. Will it be optional for local authorities not to appoint wardens if they feel that the payment of these wardens will cost more money?  If the fines, and so on, do not measure up to the total salary and other expenses of the service, and if any debit balance in that respect is passed on to the rates, then I would say the elected members of local authorities would like to have a say in the appointments, that is, whether there should or should not be one, two, three or four traffic wardens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of such points are not covered in the Bill and I would like to hear more about them.  I have two main quarrels with the Bill.  One is the danger there is that a Minister for Local Government may, in future, by regulation, pass on more onerous duties to them.  I do not <Col N="607" /> mean onerous in the ordinary sense; I mean duties which are the responsibility of the Garda authorities and should never be the responsibility of anybody else in the field of traffic law.  The other is the imposition there may be on local authorities and, of course, the status and equality of the wardens appointed.  If it is to be done, and it is to be done if this Bill goes through the Houses.  I would like to see appointments made by local appointments commissioners who will have fairly stringent criteria which they will take into consideration in the making of the appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution will be short on this matter.  I want to underline one fact.  When the Minister addressed the House in introducing this Bill, he stated that the previous Government approved proposals for legislation generally in line with the Bill now before the House.  I would have expected to hear something about that from the spokesmen from across the floor.  As far as I can see, in any speeches made on this matter, or in the larger part of their content, there has been a negative approach to what is being attempted by this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a simple Bill for the purpose of enabling the Minister for Local Government to make regulations. Those regulations must be made after consultation with the Minister for Justice.  We all know that the Garda authorities are under the supervision of the Minister for Justice and, anything that deals with policing and control, is a matter for that Department in the first instance who are primarily responsible for law and order in the civil sphere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals basically with motorists and traffic and any antipathy to this would possibly be stemming from those people who have suffered by virtue of the fact of having had to pay parking fines.  I do not know why there should be opposition to this Bill. Many motorists welcome the fact that if they commit the minor offence of parking in the wrong place, at the <Col N="608" /> wrong time, or in the wrong manner, they can absolve themselves by paying the fine instead of having to go through the trauma of going to court and possibly retaining a lawyer to act for them.  Having contributed to parking fines in my time, my own personal experience is that the courts have taken a reasonable view and, where the anti-social crime of taking one's parking ticket and transferring it to another car has occurred, and one does not pay the fine not knowing that a parking ticket has been put on one's vehicle, the court has taken a reasonable view in the circumstances and dealt with one accordingly. Basically, most people who have received a parking fine have, with some reluctance, but with a certain amount of gladness, paid the fine rather than go to court.  That is what this Bill is directed at and primarily directed at&mdash;relieving the burden of supervising traffic control in relation to the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am sure there are Deputies like myself who are aware of complaints having been made by the public that, where offences have been committed, the Garda authorities have been unable to investigate them due to their load of work.  I am aware that this has occurred in the Dún Laoghaire area.  Some years ago people came to me about the problem.  I was not a Member of the House at the time and I conveyed my information to other people to deal with it.</P>
    <P>It would be a bad state of affairs if a person had reported breakings-in and there were not sufficient Garda available to investigate and to give due time to the investigation of such crimes.  This is no reflection on the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>It so happens that there is an overload of work and that the Garda are being asked to do work which I think is not properly within their jurisdiction. They are trained men in the investigation of crime and in the prevention of crime.  It is ridiculous that they should have to spend time on minor breaches of traffic regulations and minor breaches of the Road Traffic Act.  This Bill has been painted in the light that regulations might be made whereby <Col N="609" /> traffic wardens would have power to deal with major offences.  This is really scaremongering.  I certainly would not go along with the idea of giving traffic wardens power to deal with, say, offences concerning alcohol or drugs in the management of motor vehicles. I do not see that that is contemplated in this Bill.  Certainly, if it were left to people like that, there would be a tremendous number of acquittals. Appointing traffic wardens for that type of offence would not get us anywhere. It would not effect proper justice and would not get convictions where convictions were called for.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that it was apparent some time ago that the matter of parking supervision was absorbing a disproportionate amount of the time and resources of the Garda.  I wonder if there are any Deputies who can recollect the amount of time taken up by Garda just walking along the pavements in Dublin supervising the parking of vehicles?  If one were to translate that type of work into the present cost of maintaining the Garda force, there would probably be a very big outcry from the public about the amount of money that would require.</P>
    <P>My own view is that it would be a demeaning type of work for a member of the garda.  It would not be worthwhile work.  Remarks were made about work that was done by those who were not members of the garda force such as making certain census inquiries.  I do not think that is contemplated in the Bill.  If these censuses are taken by certain members of the gardaí there was also another reason: It was the way of a guard to take out his bicycle on an afternoon to go into a rural area and possibly, by the way pick up necessary information for the investigation of crime.  This is a well-known fact. They were ostensibly going out to take a census.  This was how the police work was done in the past.  The police force are more mobile now and they are more centralised and police investigation is done in a different manner.</P>
    <P>I respect the views expressed by Deputy Andrews, particularly his concern that traffic wardens would not possibly be sufficiently skilled or experienced to deal with crimes or even <Col N="610" /> to inquire deeply into them.  But petty offences relating to traffic control are not the type of work that the Garda Síochána should be engaged on.</P>
    <P>Certain fears may be expressed that this type of work may have the effect of limiting the availability of jobs in the Garda Síochána.  I do not think it will.  My experience is that the gardaí at present have more than enough work to do.  This is a simple easing of a pressure area which can be done by people who are not members of the Garda force.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is possible to give this authority to people who are not members of the Garda force does not necessarily mean that a person has to admit that the ticket is correct.  We can always deny the charge.  That is well provided for.  The onus will remain on the prosecuting person or body to prove their case.  I am somewhat surprised that no reference has been made to the tremendous powers that are vested in fishery board conservators. We had a recent instance where a man is alleged to have committed an offence.  Some days later, on a completely different occasion, in the full presence of his family, his car was removed ostensibly under the authority of the fact that the man is alleged to have committed a criminal offence contrary to the fishery code. There has been a very pregnant silence about the powers certain people have.  There has been a lot of talk in the House about the possible dangers under this Bill which deals with petty, minor traffic offences, but not a word was mentioned about this matter.  Many of these decisions are made in other spheres by people who have absolutely no police qualifications whatever, whose authority is not related to any Government Department but is given to other bodies, administered basically by laymen. Yet, these powers are being fully and heavily exercised with little sign of leniency or understanding of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the tenor of this debate over this small and minor matter.  The only major aspect of it is the amount of unnecessary words and time being spent on the Second Reading of this Bill.</P>
    <Col N="611" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this very important Bill.  In recent times the Government have stressed the importance of getting high priority legislation through the House and the necessity to bring some of the high priority legislation to the Upper House.  We now have an example of what high priority legislation is.  This Bill must be regarded as more important than some of the other measures that have not yet come before the House.  It is a measure that has caused some concern here.  In relation to road traffic there is a necessity to update the situation.  The movement from the horse to the mechanically propelled vehicle was a movement from a mare to a nightmare in so far as parking and travelling is concerned in this city.  There is a need to update legislation in relation to road traffic and in relation to all aspects of road traffic.</P>
      <P>A variety of criticisms has been made by various speakers.  I would like to refer to section 3 of this Bill. Section 3 states:</P>
      <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973 and the offence under regulations made under the Roads Act, 1920, of not attaching to and carrying on a vehicle in the manner prescribed by those regulations a licence in respect of the vehicle issued under that Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It refers to any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973 and to an offence under the regulations made. The powers sought by the Minister are extremely wide and can be interpreted as applying to each and every section of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973. The Minister for Justice, I understand was not aware of this situation until the Bill came before the House.  This defective line of communication between Ministers in relation to the presentation of legislation shows that a Minister was discourteous to one of his <Col N="612" /> colleagues.  The proposal to consult him afterwards in relation to such offences is one that we distrust on this side of the House.  All or any of the offences in this high priority legislation before us could mean each and every one of the offences there if regulations are made.  We do not trust the Minister for Local Government or indeed the Minister for Justice.  We have heard so many conflicting statements in recent times by the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Justice that one could not reasonably be expected to trust them or their statements or their assessment of situations.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some other speakers indicated that this was legislation left behind from the previous Government.  This point has been made by the Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully, for what reason I do not know, and by Deputy Desmond.  The fact is that the Minister for Local Government has introduced a Bill which will give him and his colleagues the widest possible powers.</P>
    <P>I have here the Road Traffic Act of 1961 and the Road Traffic Act of 1968.  I have just gone through them and seen the variety of offences the Minister can by regulation make if this Bill is passed in its present form. He deals with on-the-spot fines.  When we take the garda as against the traffic wardens, the situation where an on-the-spot fine is imposed is one of coercion.  With the garda system one is told to move on, or not to do it again or one gets a caution of one kind or another.  The ticket-happy persons we see from time to time, without any caution, apply tickets to cars.  The on-the-spot fine to my mind is not all that healthy but it does relieve pressure.  There is another side to the story.  There is no provision here for the safeguarding of the motorists' property.  Power will be given to apply tickets for the two offences I mentioned.  When it comes to the licence disc, section 3 provides:</P>
    <P>A prosecution in respect of an alleged offence shall not be instituted during the period specified in the notice and if the payment specified in the notice is made during <Col N="613" /> that period no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence shall be instituted.</P>
    <P>Is that what the Minister means in relation to a ticket being affixed, that a prosecution in respect of an alleged offence shall not be instituted during the period specified in the notice?  If the payment specified in the notice is made during that period no prosecution in respect of the alleged offence shall be instituted.  Does that in fact mean that a man need not tax his car but merely pay the fine?  Does it mean that as long as he pays the fine specified on the ticket the offence of non-taxation of the car will not be pursued? Is that what the Minister means?  Is that what is meant by paragraph (c) of subsection (4) of section 3?  Can the Parliamentary Secretary indicate if that is in fact what is meant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a situation now where a person not displaying a disc will be prosecuted by the police on the basis that the ticket was affixed by the traffic warden.  Is that the situation? First, there will be the payment of the fine to the local authority and then prosecution by the police in respect of the particular offence, is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Nowhere in this Bill is there an indication that there will be this sort of dual control, this dual prosecution which there would have to <Col N="614" /> be in relation to the non-display of a tax disc.  So we will have in fact two sets of prosecutions in respect of the non-display of a tax disc, one by the Garda authority and one by the local authority.  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have the position reasonably clear, that the powers of the traffic warden will ensure that there will be communication with the police.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary tell me on what basis will the police prosecution take place? Will it be on the basis of a submission from the local authority?  Will it be on the basis of the production of documents from the traffic warden to the police?  Will the traffic warden have to communicate both with the police and the local authority or how will this communication take place?</P>
      <P>Will there be a dual set of tickets, one set for the police, where an alleged offence of the non-display of a disc will be further checked by the police and prosecuted if such is the case, or will the local authority check it out and then refer it back to the police?  What will be the procedure before the prosecutions about the tax disc will be effected?  Will it be through the local authority or through the traffic warden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important aspect because we want to know what powers are being given to the traffic wardens under this Bill.

Will they be the prosecuting authority in relation to non-taxation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what the Parliamentary Secretary says, it will not satisfy the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important, and before there can be further discussion on the Bill this point must be clarified by the Minister. The Parliamentary Secretary must agree that it is very involved &mdash;the question of delegation of authority and the question of absolute authority in relation to procedures. We would like to know if the traffic wardens or the Garda Síochána or the local authority will all have responsibilities.  Will there be three sections of responsibility, two sections or just one section?  If the gardaí have to check out on the issue of a tax disc immediately after the ticket is affixed then they might as well, in the first instance, check out and prosecute properly because much less would be involved.  We have here the suggestion from the Parliamentary Secretary that if the local authority prosecute for the non-display of the disc and the car is not taxed, the Garda may prosecute so that there would be a double prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers, as we see, are much more wide and much more involved than has been suggested by the Minister earlier and indeed by Deputy Esmonde.  This Bill has been presented to this House as having no complications, as being a refined piece of legislation that is easily understood by the ordinary man.  We find now that there are complications.  There are complications in relation to section (c) of subsection (4) of section 3, complications <Col N="616" /> that are very important.  Subsection (5) of section 3 reads that:</P>
    <P>A notice affixed to a vehicle under subsection (3) shall not be removed or interfered with except by a person to whom the notice applies.</P>
    <P>In the case of a company car or truck would it be the owner of the car, or the driver, or the secretary of the company, who could remove the notice so affixed?  Again, this is a matter we would like to have clarified.  It cannot be interfered with except by the person to whom the notice applies.  Normally speaking, the traffic warden notice applies to the owner because he merely takes the number of the car and ascertains the registered owner's name from the tax office.  So one could go around with a windscreen full of tickets if the driver cannot remove them.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us who is the person who can remove the ticket?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be answered later.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Moore) Acting Chairman (Mr. Moore)">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important.  I could lend my car to any member of this House and a ticket would be affixed and if the person to whom I lent it removed the ticket he would be liable to a £20 fine in accordance with (b) of subsection (5).  If a child removed the ticket he would be liable to a fine not exceeding £20.  Maybe we can be told in the course of the debate the person to whom the notice applies. Tickets have been affixed to my car on numerous occasions, both when I was driving it, and when other people were driving it, but the notice came back to me as owner of the car.</P>
      <P>We have the widening of powers of the traffic wardens.  Indeed these traffic wardens give a fairly good service but if their powers and their responsibilities are to be widened, will their status be upgraded?  A matter which has been mentioned before is the question of their training. This Bill indicates that very wide powers can be given to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> Irrespective of what interpretation the Minister for Local Government likes to put on it, when subsection (1) of section 3 is interpreted there is the question of the Minister for Justice and indeed the Minister for Local Government, after consultation between both, declaring by regulation any offence under the Road Traffic Acts of 1961 to 1973. One can be assured that the legislation of this nature being as broadly based as it is here must be of concern to us.  Deputy Esmonde spoke about the powers of water bailiffs and other people.  Great as these powers may be they could not possibly be as wide as the powers that the Minister can give to traffic wardens under section 3 of the Bill. We would like to know if there will be additional training or additional upgrading of the traffic warden force as a result of additional duties being imposed on them.  Were the police force consulted prior to this legislation coming before the House?  This is important because there is the question of the duties that were previously executed by the Garda under the Road Traffic Acts of 1961, very broad duties that may be whittled away by this device. Is it the Government's intention to have a cut-price police force, with extension after extension, after consultations between two Ministers? One could well understand anything evolving after discussion between two of the present Ministers, particularly the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>There have been so many statements from both Ministers from time to time that one would have to distrust any statement that would come from them. Generally speaking Ministers do not take very broad powers onto themselves such as are spelled out in this Bill but in this case, the powers are extraordinarily broadly based and can be open to abuse.  This Bill is suspect, notwithstanding the desire of every member of this House to ensure that traffic can park and flow freely and that every effort must be made to ensure both the protection of the vehicle and that there is no obstruction.  I <Col N="618" /> would like to know also if the powers are transferred to the local authority who will prosecute?  Will it be the local authority law officer?  Is it he who will prosecute if a prosecution takes place?  Will it be the local authority law agent who will prosecute once a ticket is affixed?  Maybe the Parliamentary Secretary could help us on this difficult path.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately the Minister is not here at the moment and we want information on this particular score.  It is an important point.  When the powers are transferred to the local authority, will it be the law agent of the local authority who will prosecute?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we know that it is the local authority law agent who will prosecute and at the moment&mdash; nobody should know this better than the Minister&mdash;the local authority law agents are so overworked and overburdened that they are unable to cope with the normal work of the local authority.  They will now be entrusted with the additional job of prosecuting possibly thousands of offences in a city this size and with this population.  There will possibly be thousands of prosecutions in the course of the next year.  The Minister knows full well that the legal departments of local authorities are the most difficult to staff and overburdened as they are, unable to deal with the existing problems&mdash;even after siphoning off much of their work to outside legal people they are still way behind in the local authority work&mdash;it is proposed to impose this extra burden on them.  We have an unreal situation developing. Will there be a pile-up of prosecutions? Will it be a lawyers' paradise? What is behind this thinking?  On the other hand, we read here that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make grants towards the expenses of a local authority under this Act.  The Minister may, I understood that the Minister had indicated that this should stand on its own.  The cost could fall on the rates, if the fines <Col N="619" /> are not collected, to meet the administration necessary.  One can visualise the very heavy legal costs evolving from this particular Bill.  We know what legal fees are.  We have all experienced them in relation to loans for people purchasing houses.  We know the hold-ups that occur as a result of inadequate services by the legal departments of the various local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings me to my second point.  When managers of local authorities feel there may be a call on the rates to meet the administration of this particular Bill, they may be tempted to pressurise traffic wardens into fixing tickets without discretion, without caution, or without warning.  Discretion is vitally important in this situation.  On the last occasion on which I got a parking ticket I did not pay the fine.  I got a summons and I explained to the court by letter, that I got out of my car, went into a shop to get change and, when I came back, there was a ticket affixed to the windscreen.  The Justice was more reasonable than the traffic warden.  We could have a situation in which traffic wardens would be pressurised into affixing tickets without discretion.  They might hide around the corner until they saw someone disappear for change and promptly affix a ticket. At the moment they use some discretion; they walk up and down the road and, if the meter has expired, they wait for a reasonable time to see if the owner will return and, if he does, no ticket is affixed.  But, if there is pressure from the manager to ensure the rates will not be affected in any way, and taking into consideration that there may be large-scale legal costs, a situation could develop which might not be in the best interests of either the local authority, the Minister, or indeed the motorists.  We know that, while the Garda are doing the job, there is a certain protection for the motorists who park their cars illegally; the necessary action is taken by the Garda and one accepts fully that particular situation. Motorists are also aware that there <Col N="620" /> is this element of protection so necessary and desirable in these days.</P>
    <P>I would like to know if the Garda were consulted prior to the production of this Bill.  I would not like to see the Garda in any way downgraded by the diversion of some of their duties to some other section unless the other sections are properly trained and equipped and paid to deal with the problems involved.  Traffic control is most important, but one has to consider the lack of facilities for car parking without payment.  Meters appear at every corner.  One has to consider the high price of petrol and the lack of protection for motorists. We would hope that at some stage some consideration would be given to the people who give so much by way of road tax, petrol tax, fines and parking meters.  I would not like to think the additional powers given to local authorities would in any way stimulate managers to lecture the traffic wardens on the necessity to affix as many tickets as possible.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points which have to be answered in the course of this debate, some of them have already been mentioned.  Some of them have been clarified.  The question of the double prosecution has been clarified. We wait now for the Minister to tell us the sequence in which the prosecutions will take place for the non-display of the tax disc and the fixing of a ticket on a car where a tax disc is not displayed.</P>
    <P>I hope he will enlighten the House on these matters so that a more comprehensive examination can be given to this Bill.  I can assure him and the Parliamentary Secretary that this Bill will get very serious consideration because section 3 has given the broadest powers possible to Ministers to apply each and every section of the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973.  This is far too wide a power to give to any two Ministers.  I hope the Minister will have second thoughts about the entire situation when he re-examines section 3 (1). I believe he does not understand that section and I would earnestly ask him to have another look at it, and to get <Col N="621" /> advice on it if he does not understand it, which apparently he does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10 of the Act reads :</P>
      <P>This Act may be cited as the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act, 1975.</P>
      <P>In my view, another title could be given, a declaration of war by the inter-party government of 1975, against the unfortunate motorists of Ireland in the year 1975.  I do not consider that too strong a statement to make when one reads section 3 (1), which states :</P>
      <P>This section applies to such of the following offences as may be declared by the Minister by regulations made after consultation with the Minister for Justice, to be offences to which this section applies, namely, any offence under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973.</P>
      <P>It goes on to talk about the nonregistration of cars under the 1920 Act, but the first part of this subsection specifically refers to all offences under the 1961-1973 Acts.  We all know the wide powers under those Acts, such as the drunken driving charges and many others.</P>
      <P>There is no more maligned section of the community in 1975, in my view than the motorist.  He is burdened with massive car taxation, appalling insurance premiums&mdash;assuming he can get motor insurance in the first place&mdash;and the unprecedented petrol charges.  One must recollect the manner in which the petrol charges were brought in&mdash; by a sleight of hand operation last December, when an extra 15p was put on to each gallon of petrol without even a vote of this House until this Party demanded it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a chaotic traffic situation in this city because of the lack of parking facilities provided by either the local authorities or the Government. The road network&mdash;and to use the word &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; would be probably charitable&mdash;within the city results in nothing but chaos, and in the country it is not much better than the old dirt tracks of the horse and cart era.  On top of all that the motoring public is burdened with <Col N="622" /> high maintenance costs to keep their cars on the road.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as introduced by the Minister for Local Government on behalf of the Inter-Party Government, suggests that a motorist is somebody who uses his car merely for pleasure.</P>
    <P>Before coming into this House I remember reading on many occasions the excellent case made by the present Minister for Local Government for the workers of the Meath area coming to Dublin.  He wanted to give them tax free allowances against their expenses on their cars, which they had to use to get to their jobs.  Most people use their cars for business purposes, be it getting to or from their job&mdash;commercial travellers, doctors, vets or any other section of the community. Most cars are used directly or indirectly with business.  The sooner this gets across to the inter-party regime the better.  I know the Minister, when he was on this side of the House, appreciated this, but since he went to the far side of the House, he seems to have lost sight of the situation.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of Bills before this House since this present Dáil started&mdash;not a very startling record of legislation introduced by the Government.  As a matter of fact, the most appalling record of legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Any legislation we have had has been of a purgative nature.  Here we have the Local Authority (Traffic Warden) Bill 1975.  The Government are trying to set up an auxiliary police force on the cheap, with the one aim of further penalising the already over-burdened motoring public.  If the Government are serious about the need for this work to be carried out, surely it would be better to increase the number of the gardaí, set up proper traffic sections within the Garda and designate to them the job of looking after the motoring public, rather than trying to get a second <Col N="623" /> police force on the cheap, an ill-trained police force, because I do not think the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is mentioned in the ten sections of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In his Second Reading speech the Minister said that this Bill was only directed at car taxation.  I question this in the reading of section 3 (1) if it is only brought in for car taxation, surely it would be better for our police force even one day a month or one day every two months to carry out a nation wide campaign against users of motor vehicles that are not properly taxed.  This would be more effective than giving powers to an ill-trained and under-trained traffic warden corps. Of course, if we are to read and interpret section 3 as it stands at the moment, we are in a very different situation and one to which I as one member of this House objects to.  This is a situation where we are handing over to a body other than the respected police force of the State powers to charge people for serious crimes under the Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973. The Minister has said this is not the intention of the Bill.  Whether or not that is the intention, that is how the Bill reads.  The Minister is shaking his head but that does not appear in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach saying there was another interpretation of the Bill, that put forward by the Opposition.  The Bill as it reads, whether it is the intention or not&mdash;and it is open to legal interpretation&mdash;suggests that the traffic wardens could be given the power, either by the Minister for Local Government or the Minister for Justice, to charge people with very serious crimes and offences under the Road Traffic Acts, 1961 to 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be a function of Parliament to introduce legislation which is clear and which is not open to misunderstanding. The point has been raised <Col N="624" /> and I hope the Minister will put down a clarifying amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is read without an amendment from the Minister, then the meaning is that the Minister is extending to the traffic wardens the power to charge motorists and road users with very serious crimes, such as drunken driving or dangerous driving.  I am not in any way trying to cast a reflection on the men and women who comprise the traffic warden units.</P>
      <P>It has not yet been proved that traffic wardens are widely acceptable to the motoring public and the general public.  The first requirement for any police force is that they must be acceptable to the public at all times. Since their inception, the Garda have been widely acceptable as a fair and reasonable police force.  We should not try to diminish their acceptability by imposing on them the task of working in co-operation with a force who have not been widely acceptable to the motoring public and the general public. The traffic wardens, as a whole, have not been properly trained for the tasks they were given.  There is no suggestion in this Bill that they will be given further training for the extended duties the Minister intends to give them or has the power to give them.</P>
      <P>Surely the best way of guarding against car tax evasion&mdash;nobody is trying to protect people who do not pay car tax&mdash;is by extending the existing membership of the Garda and setting up proper units within that force for traffic duties only, rather than setting up auxiliary police forces as is provided for here.  The word &ldquo;auxiliary&rdquo; has many connotations in the context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other aspect of this Bill is the question of the burden on the rates. This is being set up within the local authorities.  The Minister in his Second Reading speech made it quite clear that the Government have no intention of subsidising this force except in very extraordinary circumstances.  It is a fair interpretation of the Minister's speech to say it is not the Government's intention to subsidise this force in any local authority area. <Col N="625" /> If this is the case, the wardens will be a burden on the rates.  On the other hand, a situation could arise in which the eager beaver traffic wardens who justified their existence within a local authority area could become a source of income for the authority, by pestering every motorist and road user with charges for not producing their tax disc, and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling asked the Parliamentary Secretary a number of questions. The Parliamentary Secretary clarified a number of points.  He said the traffic warden under the terms of this Bill will merely be able to charge the motorist for not displaying his tax disc.  After that, in my understanding, it is up to the Garda to charge him for not taxing his car.  There is a double situation.  There is a charge by the traffic warden for not displaying the tax disc and a charge by the Garda for not having paid the tax.</P>
    <P>I understood that the aim of this Bill was to cut down the burden of work on the Garda.  Surely this will create further bureaucracy at a time when we have trouble paying the existing bureaucracy.  The Minister will understand what I am talking about. The Government have to find the money to pay the salaries of the existing civil servants without creating another civil service corps.  These extra burdens are being placed on the shoulders of the already overburdened motoring public who are paying car tax, extra petrol charges, insurance premiums and maintenance charges. What do the motoring public get for all these charges?</P>
    <P>We have a road surface which it is probably fair to say is the worst in Europe.  Having driven around quite a bit of Europe on various holidays I can say we have the most appalling road structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It still is.  There are no parking facilities in the city. All we have are traffic wardens going round handing out parking tickets, even as Deputy Dowling said, to a man who went into a shop to get <Col N="626" /> change for the parking meter.  All the burdens are placed on the motorist with nothing on the plus side.  The road network is bad.  There are no parking facilities in the cities or towns.  There is traffic chaos in cities and towns.  On top of all this, the Minister wants to hand over power to an auxiliary police force who have not got the respect which our existing police force command. That does not imply any insult to the existing members of the traffic warden force.  They have not been properly trained for this work and are not geared to it.  This is a declaration of war by the inter-party Government against the already overburdened motorist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in this legislation.  I have received a few tickets for breaking the law.  Whoever breaks the law deserves them.  I have got them myself the same as anybody else.  I do not mind that, but what I do mind is that, because of this Bill the traffic warden is taking on more, taking on the tax.  There are a few questions on this Bill which I would like to ask the Minister.  Firstly, the gardaí will probably leave the inspection of tax discs to the wardens. Who is going to look after the tax discs when the wardens finish work in the evening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may still have the responsibility but the fact is that they will not be as vigilant on the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should they not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter is being handed over in this Bill to the traffic wardens.  I do not know what hours the traffic wardens work because there are not many of them except in Dublin.  I do not know anything about them : they do their duty and do it very carefully.  I believe that the gardaí are probably trained to know when to use discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> I do not know whether traffic wardens are trained or not in regard to discretion in the matter of a person who just pulls up and has an urgent message for a business premises and runs in and out again and is given a parking ticket.  This, to my mind, is a thing that a garda would not always do : they usually say that it should not be done and advise you to drive away quickly or they will issue a parking ticket. Would a traffic warden get some kind of special training?</P>
    <P>There is a danger in section 3 of the Bill.  There is no use in the Minister giving any promise : he is there now but we do not know who will be there in three years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He might not be as reasonable as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying whether you are reasonable or not. Ministers change.  If you make a law, you can interpret it and say you will only use it in a certain way but I have no doubt that the Minister under section 3 can give whatever authority he likes to the traffic wardens.  Have the Garda authorities been consulted on this Bill?  Do they approve of it?  I have got summonses from the gardaí too, speed limit summonses, and all kinds of summonses, in relation to breaking the law in small ways but I am very worried about this question of traffic wardens.  I understand that traffic wardens will be appointed under local authorities and in a country town they will be local people.  The gardaí are appointed as a result of an examination and they operate on a national level.  I understand it is very seldom that a garda is stationed in his own home town.  These wardens will be local people and human nature does not change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how people can say that such a thing could not happen, but everybody knows human nature. The local authorities appoint the traffic wardens.  They are appointed and paid for by their local councillors.  We all <Col N="628" /> know that if the county councillor parks in the wrong place say, in Galway, the local traffic warden will know him and will say : &ldquo;I am working for him.&rdquo;  The traffic wardens may not know the TDs or people of the Government.  They might know the Ministers but that is about all.  Is there a danger that the human element will come into this Bill, that there might be discrimination?  I do not think that question would apply at all to the gardaí.  I would be very worried about local people being appointed as traffic wardens to carry out traffic regulations and issue on-the-spot fines or summonses for untaxed cars at local level because they are likely to know the people involved.  This is my view, and I express it because of practical experience. I am also particularly worried about the cost to the local authorities and about the comments made by Deputy Dowling.  If it was the case that these men wanted to justify themselves and that they heard that this matter was raised at a council meeting, that the traffic wardens were costing so much to the council, and that some of them would have to be disposed of, then a man, for his own sake, would have to hold on to his job, and would say to himself : &ldquo;The more money I get, the better chance I have of holding on to my job.&rdquo;  They could become tax collectors for their local authority.</P>
    <P>Everybody tries to keep the law as far as possible, but I would be caught every day in Galway, there is a double line outside the health board office in Eyre Square and we drive up on the footpath if we want to go in for a message.  Nobody stays there very long and there is plenty of room left. Nobody, at the present moment, as far as I know, is fined but if you are there for a long time a garda will come along and summons you.  I do not think they do that if a person goes in for a message and comes out again.  I foresee that if you have a traffic warden there, you will not go in or if you do, I do not know where you will park your car.</P>
    <P>This is the problem that I see. Motorists at the present are well followed-up for all kinds of offences.  I would be very wary about giving authority <Col N="629" /> the gardaí have to traffic wardens. I also fear that it would interfere with tourism.  Take Galway city for instance.  If you were to enforce the traffic regulations everywhere there is a double line at the moment, people could not park at all.  One is allowed to pull in on a single line for a moment to do business.</P>

      <P>I try to keep the law as much as I can but I can assure you that a motorist, no matter where he goes, is annoyed enough at the present moment.  I am not objecting to the appointment of traffic wardens but I object to giving them so much power.  I also object to section 3 of this Bill under which I think any Minister can extend the powers of the traffic warden beyond what I think would be reasonable.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of the dual summons.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to clarify this. Deputy Dowling raised this matter.  If a man is caught for a parking offence he is fined on the spot and that is that. If a man is caught for tax he is fined by the local authority but if you want to make him pay his tax you must bring him to court.  Is it the local authority who take him to court, or is it the Garda?  Will he have to pay the fine and then will the traffic warden have to notify the Garda and will the Garda then summons the motorist for having an untaxed car?  These are very important points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have misinterpreted the Parliamentary Secretary but I took it that it was the local authority that would issue the summons.  Are we to load the already overburdened local authorities with work of this kind? Perhaps the Minister would clarify that.  There is a difference between an <Col N="630" /> on-the-spot parking fine and having an untaxed car.  The payment of the £2 fine does not alter the fact that the car is untaxed.  Somebody has to issue a summons for it.  Who issues the summons?  Is it the local authority or the Garda?  Will there be a £2 fine plus a court case and a second fine? The unfortunate motorist wants to know how many times he will be fined.  It is important for the local authority to know whether they have to take legal proceedings.  How will the two be dovetailed?  Will the traffic warden notify the local gardaí that a specific car was parked in such a place?  Will that be the procedure?</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us if he would be prepared to change section 3 so that it would deal only with car tax?  Is it at the discretion of any Minister to give as much authority as he sees fit at any particular time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person in question is not qualified as a teacher under the rules for national schools and her services were accepted in Cadamstown national school purely on a temporary basis because the manager was unable to secure the services of a qualified teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that a sufficient number of qualified teachers will be available in the next school year to fill all posts in national schools. Accordingly, all unqualified teachers, including the person referred to in the question, have been notified that their <Col N="640" /> services will not be required after 30th June, 1975.  According to my Department's records, the person in question took up employment as a temporary teacher in Cadamstown national school on 8th March, 1971 and has been there since then with the exception of the period from 10th February to 6th April, 1975, both dates inclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether the person whose name is supplied in the question will have any hope of re-employment the year after next?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I gather then, seeing that the Minister said in the House already that in cases where <Col N="642" /> qualified teachers would not be entitled to take up teaching positions that he will look at the matter, has the Minister evidence from school managers that there are cases in which there will be difficulty in helping qualified teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, I have no personal knowledge that there are such cases.  In any event the Department would have to await the outcome of the publication of these advertisements to see what the situation may be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister if there will be any exception to this hard and fast rule which he seems to be insisting on with regard to teachers generally.  Would he agree that an untrained teacher who filled the gap for 35 years in a school for which no other trained teacher could be found, who got good reports all the time and proved to be an efficient teacher, must go along with the others?  Will there be an exception in such case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As I told Deputies in reply to previous questions, since there will be sufficient numbers of qualified teachers, we hope they will fill all the posts available in national schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising further, would the Minister agree that the purpose of training the large number of teachers who are coming out this year was to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that question on 29th April as reported in Volume 280, No. 4 of the Dáil Debates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would answer it again and repeat the reply given at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the general position was <Col N="643" /> that we were trying to get as many trained teachers as possible into the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a reply to the question I asked.  The question I asked was whether the training of this exceptionally large number of teachers was not for the purpose of reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and improving the situation in schools where there are classes of more than 60 pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the number of (a) male and (b) female primary teachers aged 65 years or over who hitherto would have been granted extended teaching service and who now must retire at the end of this academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="644" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to state the number of teachers who might have been granted such extension of service beyond 65 years of age because (a) it has not been the practice for all teachers due to retire to apply for such extensions; (b) not all those who applied in previous years fulfilled the conditions on which extensions were allowed and (c) not all those to whom extensions were granted availed themselves of the extension for the full three years.</P>
      <P>I may add, however, that the number on extended service in the present school year 1974-75 is 420.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a variable percentage, but I suppose one could say that approximately 80 per cent who reach retiring age would avail themselves of an extension if it were available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that to remove 360 teachers on average each year is a very retrograde step in view of the fact that we have made no significant steps towards reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and that there is a dire shortage of remedial teachers?  If these teachers were left in the service for three years it would help to provide remedial teachers and to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will permit primary teachers who served in the Emergency Forces during the 1939-1945 period an extension of their post-65 years' teaching service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It would not be appropriate to single out any one group <Col N="645" /> of teachers for special treatment in relation to their being continued in the teaching service beyond the normal age for retirement.  Provision is already made in the national teachers' superannuation scheme for the recognition for pension purposes of periods of military service given by national teachers during the period 2nd September, 1939 to 11th May, 1945.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Deputy realises that there are two categories, those who retire on 30th June, 1975, whose pension will be paid as and from that date and, in regard to secondary teachers, pension will be payable from the 1st August, 1975.  The first pension payment is due on those dates in respect of those two categories. National teachers and secondary teachers who retired before those dates have their pensions adjusted upwards to keep relativity on a particular date and this demands a slight delay while the process goes through.  After that there is no further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is in communication with the parish priest regarding a site for a new national school in the parish of Sutton.  I understand that there is considerable difficulty in obtaining a suitable site in the area.</P>
      <P>The second-level educational needs of the Sutton area are at present catered for by three schools in the area as well as by a number of schools in nearby areas.

My information is that there is not in fact, any Catholic national school in the parish of Sutton.  Would the Minister confirm it?  There is a Protestant national school which has been taking Catholic children but it is now becoming overcrowded and is obliged to restrict entry to Protestants. Would the Minister confirm that that is true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, could I ask the Minister if he has given consideration to the question of providing either the total amount or a very substantial proportion of the cost of sites in areas such as Sutton?  There are other areas where the cost is absolutely prohibitive, as compared with other parts of the county where sites are available free or for virtually nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

There are places for extra boys in that school.  There is also the Kilbarrack Community School which will be opening in 1975 for 800 boys and girls.

      <P>As I have already announced approximately 70 per cent of the capitation grants due to schools in respect of the school year 1974-75 will be paid in November, 1975.  The balance of the grants will be paid in March, 1976.</P>
      <P>The first instalment of the grants in lieu of tuition fees in respect of the school year 1975-76 will be paid in October, 1975, and the balance in April, 1976.  All payments will be made at the increased rates announced by me last month.</P>

I have the names of the 24 pupils in front of me now, with the exception of two.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Cavan</i>) <b>(For the Minister for Justice):</b> The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The impending closure of the District Court office in Navan arises from the amalgamation of the District Court clerkships at Trim and Navan to form one clerkship which will have its headquarters in Trim and will serve the District Court areas currently served from Trim and Navan. The amalgamation is an integral part of a reorganisation of the provincial District Court service into a smaller number of larger offices, which is an essential element of a productivity scheme agreed with the provincial District Court Clerks as the basis for the grant to them of pay parity with their Dublin colleagues.</P>
      <P>I have chosen Trim as the headquarters of the clerkship because the Circuit Court office is located there and the existing accommodation in Navan is inadequate to house a larger office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems rather strange that only one District Court office should be in County Meath and considering that Navan would have the biggest population&mdash;it has a projected population of 14,000 by 1990&mdash;could the Minister see his way to withdraw the proposal to transfer the court offices from the town?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As I have told the Deputy in my reply, the reduction is necessary in order to implement an arrangement entered into between the District Court Clerks' Association and the Department.  The number of clerkships has actually been reduced from 59 to 40.  I understand that location-wise there is practically no difference between Trim and Navan in so far as serving the area concerned goes.  One element in deciding in favour <Col N="665" /> of Trim was the fact that the Circuit Court Office had been sited there for many years.  I also understand that the building in Trim is quite suitable for the larger staff, whereas the building in Navan is not.  The only real complaint that one town might have for losing it would be loss of staff.  I think the Deputy will agree with me that Navan has very little to fear as regards the loss of staff either from a county approach or from the national viewpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I had been alluding to the effect the section would have.  I also alluded to the efforts of the Government to borrow money.  I made a better prediction than ever made in Old Moore's Almanac.  I predicted last week that the Government and the Minister would go around the world seeking money.  Now, it has leaked out that when the sheiks have no more, they have decided to borrow from the European Fund or anywhere they can.  Can that be denied?  Some Labour Deputies who were in the House the last night tried to confuse me because I was hitting rather hard. They are not here today.  I stated then that it was not Fine Gael policy to go through with this but Labour have pushed, dragged, shoved and nudged them to the point of no return.  We see the effect this Bill will have on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="675" /> County councils have not got the money to proceed with sewerage and water contracts.  They are all held up. Within the last two weeks the subcontractors' tax-free certificates and numbers have been withdrawn.  This is a new method of slowing down. Without the numbers, they cannot proceed. If he does proceed, the builder will find that 35 per cent of the money will be deducted irrespective of whom he employs.</P>
    <P>This is far-reaching legislation.  The ordinary man does not realise the effect it will have on him.  He will realise it when his job is gone.  I would warn him now of the consequences of this Bill, the effect it will have on industrial expansion.  The policy is to tax to the hilt.  The Government are so preoccupied with taxation legislation that they have ignored the real issues facing the economy.  They will set out to tackle the economic issues on next Thursday week.  This is something they should have done at least two years ago. Everyone knows that we have reached the point of no return.  There is nothing in the till.  I do not know where it is leading.  If the Government continue on the road they are on, there will be total collapse.  The worst thing you can have in a country is no security and, above all, no confidence.  We read every day of some factory or some other company or financial concern, going into liquidation and if it does not go through it is only a matter of putting off for the rainy day; trying to save our skin to fight another day.  That is the situation.  I shall conclude by saying that this taxation is cruel and is being imposed at the most inopportune time.</P>
    <P>Some members of the Government had no other option open to them.  We may not have a favourable Press behind us but the people will realise the reason for our opposition to this measure when they are hit by it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I dealt briefly with the PAYE system of taxation when I spoke last week. I pointed out that on its introduction into the income tax code in 1959 it ensured that all wage and salary earners who came within that code paid the last penny.  They no longer had any option in the matter, their return was made for them, their tax was collected from their weekly, monthly or quarterly pay packets.</P>
      <P>I went on to point out that I was concerned because of that situation, that I considered it to be an unjust system of taxation so long as it was possible for people engaged in buying and selling or in dealing on the Stock Exchange or in the property market to earn £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000 a year and have it regarded as a capital gain which was completely free of any taxation.  I said that as an individual I was not comfortable with that sort of system of taxation, and I pointed out in reply to an interruption from Deputy Wilson that he seemed to have great concern for the people who were the owners of £1 million of taxable wealth and who would be required to pay £9,000 a year wealth tax but that his Government operated for many years this dreadful, unsavoury system which captured the last penny out of the PAYE taxpayers' package and let go free the person in receipt of capital gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am talking of the incident that Deputy Wilson refers to.  I stated then and I repeat now that the capital gains tax will go a long way to bring equity into the income tax code and that it will relieve the PAYE taxpayers to a considerable extent.  I do not know the exact amount but I will go further and say that the amount of moneys that will be raised <Col N="677" /> by the Bill will also put money into the Exchequer that would otherwise have to be raised in other ways and one of those other ways is the PAYE system.</P>
      <P>This trinity of Bills as somebody across the House described them the other day, will take tax from the person who makes money in capital gains, people who were completely free before.  It will take money from the very wealthy who can afford it and it will take it from them in small amounts.  For example, the man in receipt or in possession of half a million pounds of taxable wealth after all allowances have been given to him and after it has been valued in the way prescribed by the Bill will be asked to pay £4,000 per annum.  The man in possession of £1 million of taxable wealth after he has received all his allowances, including the exemption of his residence, no matter how gracious or how princely, and its normal contents, and if he is a landowner or if he is a farmer, will have 20 per cent of his land exempt.  If he is a landowner he will have his growing trees, his forests, completely exempt and after all that if he is in possession of £1 million worth of taxable wealth he is being asked to pay £9,000 a year. The same person, if he is owner in possession of the same type of wealth to the extent of £2 million, will be asked to pay £19,000.  I cannot give the exact figures, but it is elementary that it will relieve to some extent the demands on the typist or the clerical workers in Dublin living in a flat and going home for the weekend.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> They were beginning to be worried about it in Cavan.  If he is lucky enough to be in Deputy Crinion's constituency and he has £100,000 of an estate he would be relieved of £41,000. Again, if he is in Deputy Crinion's constituency and he has over £200,000 of an estate, he would be relieved of 55 per cent.  It is a fair package.  It is a package that does not, as I said last week, hurt anybody.  It is not meant to hurt anybody or to crush anybody. We have the extravagant statement made by Deputy Connolly about chasing everybody out of the country; of course he does not believe that. The people are here to stay.  This tax will not hurt anybody.  It will not punish anybody.  But it will give the relief I have been talking about and it will introduce a bit of justice into taxation in general.  I make no apology about this tax; I am proud to be asked to deputise for the Minister for Finance in the introduction of this tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather reassuring to hear the Minister say nobody would be hurt by this wealth tax but I would like to examine it in more detail.  People have become very much afraid of it.  Since the introduction of the Bill and of the White Paper an amount of money has flown out of the country, money badly needed for its development.  It has gone.  It is one of the many problems in our financial and economic situation.  What is even worse is the lack of confidence in expansion and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of our firms are family owned; they have been built up over the years. Not alone are they paying the normal 50 per cent tax, which all companies are paying, but now they will have this wealth tax on top of that.  The <Col N="679" /> injustice of it is that a person living abroad who has set up a factory here, an offshoot of an existing factory in some other country, will only have to pay wealth tax on the factory here.  On the other hand, a person who has money invested abroad or even, as some firms have, businesses abroad, will have to pay wealth tax here on that property abroad.  This is very unfair. The foreigner is getting off but the person living here, trying to expand an industry or business, who has a company abroad will have to pay wealth tax on it here.  The value of the property abroad is included in the assets here.  This seems rather unfair. The Minister says only a few people will be involved but with inflation running at the rate of 25 per cent per annum, it will be only a few years before every business and every farm will be involved in wealth tax.  A farm of 80 acres or 100 acres will be affected. The Minister has said nothing about tying in inflation with this.  All he said was that it would be reviewed every three years.  He seemed to think it very generous to review it every three years.  He might well increase the rate every three years instead of giving concessions to allow for inflation.  It is unfair not to have a set pattern to offset inflation.  This shows how worried the Minister is that the Revenue Commissioners will not be able to collect the proper information regarding wealth.  The Minister has provided in the Bill for a fine of up to £1,000 on any individual, solicitor, accountant or bank manager.</P>

      <P>I know that.  This whole Bill hinges on section 2.  Many of our economic troubles are due to <Col N="680" /> this.  It has driven the initiative to develop out of people.  They are afraid that, if they develop any further they will only tax themselves more, not knowing if they will be able to meet those tax liabilities.</P>
      <P>About ten years ago the Minister for Finance from this side raised the corporation profits tax from 50 to 56 per cent.  The companies were very concerned about it.  As far as I can remember he withdrew it after a year because it was stifling development. We could see that it would have repercussions.  Here we have the 50 per cent.  You may say it is only 1 per cent, but it is 1 per cent on the assets of the company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>What most people feel about this section and this Bill is that 1 per cent of the fixed taxable assets, which can be quite substantial and would be much more than 6 per cent, is a charge for time immemorial. It was originally intended to have it at 1½ per cent, from £100,000 upwards, and 1 per cent, from £50,000. There was such an uproar that the Minister had to try before his own Ard Fheis opened, to calm the people. So he said we would have it at 1 per cent flat rate, £100,000 for a married person, upwards, and concessions for farmland and hotel rooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not an advantage.  Last year was one of the worst the farmers ever had.  It was a very bad year to bring in a tax on wealth and capital gains. The Minister may say that very few will be involved.  When one sees what the Valuation Office are doing on the remaining death duty cases at present, one would find it hard to believe how many farms will be brought into the net.  I know of a case where a small <Col N="681" /> farm of 19 statute acres which was up a laneway and for old age pension purposes, was valued at £15,000 by the Valuation Office.</P>

When one compares the value put on the land by the Valuation Office and the actual valuation last December, it makes one think.  In the case I mentioned a poor widow was looking for a pension.

But it happened because of the different ways the value was calculated.  This is something comparatively new&mdash;where a holding that is away from the main holding must be charged with capital valuation.</P>
      <P>A number of farmers will get a very rude awakening when this Bill is passed when the Valuation Office assess all the lands for the Revenue Commissioners, particularly if the Government are financially embarrassed. The Valuation Office will try to put the highest possible valuation on the land.  The appeals will be made.  They will not even take the £500 an acre allowed in county health by the Department of Agriculture for farm modernisation.  They will be going for a much higher figure.  Many more people will be caught in the net than was originally anticipated.  The people have not been fooled.  I know people who were thinking of buying a farm for a son, and have withdrawn from doing so, because they felt that they would be caught in the net.  They intended waiting until the son reached 21 before they invested in a farm for him, even though it was going to cost more.  It was better to hold back their money than to give it to the Government and the Minister for Finance.</P>

The Minister must not have any backing whatsoever.  The only people I saw coming in were Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Belton, and they voted against the Bill, one more <Col N="683" /> than the other.  They have the courage of their convictions.  There is nobody sitting beside them.  The Labour Party had in their policy document for the last two elections a wealth tax.  We would expect to see them coming in and giving support to the Minister who was pushing a Bill through which they supported.  Members of the Labour Party have been saying down the country that the measure is too small, that they are getting the foot in the door, when the Bill is passed they will be able to have it increased every three years when it comes up for review.  The House should realise that this three-year review is not for the benefit of the taxpayer but for the benefit of the Government so that they can get more money.  They can leave the thresholds at the same level, increase or decrease the tax percentage.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that with inflation at its present rate, to a person having £100,000&mdash;on deposit in the bank or elsewhere&mdash;in five years' time it would be worth nothing.  That is why so many people have been trying to invest their money in land, to the detriment of farmers who did not want this extra competition of people putting money into something that would rise in value.  This fact has been mentioned in the property pages of the newspapers recently.  Government securities which looked good in 1974, in particular land bonds which were issued at 12½ per cent are down, in 16 months, to £82 or £83.  We should think of the poor farmers who have to take those land bonds while at the same time the land has increased in value.  The piece of paper the farmer got for the land has gone down in value by 20 per cent.  That is the way inflation works.  Money loses value to the same extent that inflation rises.  The older land bonds are down to £30 or £40.  This is bad for the Government as well as everyone else.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that somebody in my constituency who left £100,000 would be paying 4 per cent death duties.</P>

      <P>Sorry.  If the Minister looks back at the number of farms on which death duties were paid, it was only 4 per cent in the past ten years.  I accept that it was very worrying for farmers having the threat of death duties hanging over them, particularly for young married couples who had inherited a farm but in most cases they were able to make adequate arrangements.  A simple arrangement was to give half of the estate to the wife.  That helped considerably or reduced liability considerably. If the farmer owned a holding some distance away he could give it to a son.  The Minister saw that flaw and introduced the Wealth Tax Bill. Property owned by a family, including minors under 21, is taken as one unit.  In that way the Minister is closing off any loopholes.</P>
      <P>People are very worried as a result; they have no way of getting out of paying the tax each year irrespective of what profit is made in that year.  If they have a loss in the particular year they get a slight concession.  That will not be much use to the farmer.  Even though only a few people will be liable to this tax at present, in a matter of ten years everybody with over 80 or 100 acres of land will be liable.  At present the house and buildings are exempt, but these were also included in the original Bill.  What was originally intended always has a nasty habit of becoming law in a period of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most serious objections to this type of legislation is its timing. It can be brought in when an economy is going well, when everything is moving, but to bring it in at a time when there is an economic crisis, when firms are going on short time or closing down, is sheer lunacy.  It is a disgrace for the Government to introduce legislation which would suppress confidence in industry, in family business and farms.  A country cannot stand still; it must move on and expand.  It was shortsighted of the Government to introduce this legislation at this time.  One of the reasons for the budget on next Thursday week is the way the Government have managed the economy.  Capital taxation has undermined the confidence of business <Col N="685" /> people.  In the main, commerce in this country has been built on family businesses which have their roots in Ireland and are the mainstay of the country.</P>
    <P>The thinking behind the Bill is that it is literally a mortal sin to own property.  Consideration is not given to the question of the income derived from property.  The professional classes will not be caught by capital taxation.  Solicitors, doctors, barristers earning five or ten times as much as the normal businessman or farmer, unless they are very, very big, are living really well as compared with the normal businessman or farmers.</P>
    <P>Those people are living in the lap of luxury in palatial houses on the perimeter of the city.  They will not pay any wealth tax.  They will have an income far in excess of the income that can be derived from property.  It is those people who have been designing this type of tax, the type of tax that would not affect them.  Those people are getting away scotfree.  In most cases they are in a better position to evade the income tax net. Only a certain portion of income will be declared.  The businessman is caught.  He has to employ auditors and all his business transactions are recorded.  There is nothing he can put in his pocket.  The same applies to the farmer.</P>
    <P>This Bill is directed against one class of people, the class of people that the Labour Party want to get rid of in this country.  What surprises me is that the people in the Government who have property could be completely outvoted in regard to the introduction of this legislation.  Those people in the Cabinet who have a fair amount of property know the effect this type of legislation will have on the economy. If people do not invest in business, employment will not be created.  We want to encourage investment particularly having regard to the fact that in the past two years unemployment has increased from 63,000 to 103,000. Investors should be encouraged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker rightly pointed out that the Bill, particularly this section, like all the other <Col N="686" /> taxation Bills introduced by this Government, will suppress initiative in farming and business.  A person who is doing something for himself, indeed, something for his country, is being suppressed by this type of legislation. The Government have levelled all sorts of panic accusations at Fianna Fáil since we went into opposition. We were told that we did not gamble enough with the economy.  On the other hand, we were told that we gambled too much with it.  One favourite accusation by one section of the Government, the Fine Gael Party, when they were in Opposition, before they were lumbered with the Labour Party in Government, was that Fianna Fáil in Government were too hard on the wealthy sector of the population.  How times have changed. Today the Fine Gael Party are forced by the Labour Party to turn against their own electors and to bring in this crippling type of taxation.  At a time when the economy needs growth the Government tell us that because we oppose this wealth tax we are on the side of the rich.  Of course, common sense indicates that this could not be further from the truth.  We realise, and this is our opposition to the Bill, that at the present time it is support and incentives that are needed among our people and particularly among our business people.  For some monetary gain we are supposed to forget our electorate and to speak only for the wealthy.  This is strange coming from the people who made this accusation in the past.  Our approach to this section, in opposition, is no different from our approach to this type of taxation if we were in Government. Our policy is to construct a solid future for our people and for our economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have balanced views regarding the growth of our economy. As a party, we represent all the people in all shades of economic circumstances. We have never believed in theoretical socialism which is the thinking behind this Bill and which says that everybody in the country must have an equal income.  This is a nice theory but human nature being what it is, it <Col N="687" /> is a theory that can never work out in practice.</P>
    <P>This thinking denounces any type of incentive.  Therefore, if a man builds up an industry from scratch he and his employees can expect only to be paid for the ability and for the skill they acquire in the operation of that industry.  The same type of thinking prevails in farming where a young farmer is prepared to avail of the modern trends in agriculture today but who will be crippled by this tax. These people are the bed-rock of the economy&mdash;our industrialists, our farmers, our businessmen&mdash;but they will be crippled by the measures contained in this Bill and in the other taxation Bills introduced by the Government.</P>
    <P>In the past, thanks to Fianna Fáil, our policy was to extend every possible help to those from all walks of life who wished to acquire skills.  This did not amount to any type of wealth tax or of favouring any type of wealthy people.</P>
    <P>The attitude that should be taken with regard to this Bill is that a working man is entitled to a fair income. He is entitled to be in a position that if he makes a profit from his business he should be able to put his profits back into the business, if he so wishes. This is good business.  But as a result of this Bill any profits that will accrue, any incentives from initiatives, will be taken by the Government for short term monetary gain.  We are not against being taxed but tax in proportion to the person's income is what we advocate.  Fianna Fáil have never taken the churlish attitude that we must jump on somebody when he reaches a certain income level.  This is what is being done in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government should realise in human terms the net effect of this will be to discourage people with managerial ability and skills and those who are prepared to start their own businesses. This Government should not believe in favouritism for any sector.  If we encourage people in the lower paid jobs, we must also encourage management. Growth cannot take place without good management.  Growth cannot take place <Col N="688" /> without the profits being ploughed into the business thereby ensuring that the business flourishes for the employees and for the economy of the country. The Labour members of the Government and some officials associated with them preach this theoretical socialism. Some of these are people who have got to the top quickly, who have highly-paid jobs in their own organisations. They are entitled to these jobs if they have the managerial ability to run their unions but we must avoid at all costs any hypocrisy in this field. In a sense hypocrisy alone would be easy to bear but its effects on management and on the owners of businesses are dangerous and could be the means of putting many businesses completely out of production.</P>
    <P>We must at all times encourage all sectors of industry.  At present this is needed above all else.  Encouragement is now necessary more than at any other time in our history.  What we are getting from the Government is the direct opposite.</P>
    <P>During Fianna Fáil's terms in Government a policy of encouraging industry from abroad was begun.  Many potential industrialists started to build up their businesses.  Their businesses were thriving under the legislation which existed up to the present time when a threat of wealth tax, a threat of capital gains tax and all the other crippling taxes which the Government introduced has not alone sent money out of the country but also sent businesses out of the country.</P>
    <P>We see today the piecemeal knocking of this type of Fianna Fáil thinking when we were in Government through this wealth tax.  It might be no harm now to go back and refer to the other section of this Government, the Fine Gael Party, who, when they were in Opposition, held views not dissimilar to our views in so far as this kind of tax was concerned. The Fine Gael Party must now, in their bid to retain power, bend to and beg from the Labour Party, and what the Labour Party demand in return is money for the lads without reference to the consequential damage to the country I have just outlined.  It is a frightening <Col N="689" /> example of how a Government such as this one, comprised of the far Right and the far Left, can affect the economy and the future prospects of our country.  There is a Labour element in this Government and, while it may be small, their insistence on this wealth tax may lead in this time of crisis to a most damaging effect which may never be repaired.  It is high time, instead of leaning on any one sector to the exclusion of another, that the Government took a balanced view of what is needed for future growth and, with this balanced view, they should, before it is too late, retract on this nuisance tax, this wealth tax which will not benefit anybody but which, as I have pointed out, will destroy the economy of the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Deputy Crinion and Deputy Noonan devoted a considerable amount of their speeches to agriculture and seemed to suggest that the agricultural industry would be crippled under this tax.  It is my duty to put the records as straight as I possibly can in that respect.  First of all, I want to say that for the vast majority of families death duties have been abolished.  Up to the end of March last, family farms or family businesses worth £1,100 bore over £400 in death duties; a small farm or business of £11,000, or thereabouts, had to pay £400 approximately in death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the farm or business of £20,000 bore estate duty at the rate of 12 per cent and the farm, as I said this morning, or a business of nett value&mdash;including television set, motor car, the lot, money in the bank, is worth £50,000 the amount payable in estate duty was about £13,500.  When it went up to £100,000, as we know, everything&mdash;the clothes the deceased had worn in life, the business or farm, the dwellinghouse, the contents of the dwellinghouse, moveable goods such as a motor car, tractor, machinery, stock, investments, everything that could conceivably be known as an asset amounting to £50,000, his estate duty amounted to £67,500, and if it amounted to £100,000 the estate duty amounted to £41,000.  All that has <Col N="690" /> been abolished and it has brought immense relief and immense peace of mind to people all over the country, people who were worried and concerned that on their deaths their families would be subject to this multiple taxation, known as death duty; all that has been done away with.  It is necessary to replace it with some other reasonable form of taxation and I am putting to the House and to the country that the system of taxation we are introducing here is a reasonable form of taxation.  It is minimal. It is only the very wealthy who will be taxed but it will not blister the very wealthy and neither will it be a hardship or a burden on the very wealthy, and I propose shortly to read that into the records of this House.</P>
    <P>I am valuing land at £600 an acre. Some Opposition Deputies have valued it at £500 an acre and some have valued it at £700 an acre and, therefore, I think £600 an acre is a reasonable valuation.  Now a farmer who owns 80 acres valued at £50,000, with machinery valued at £5,000, investments valued at £5,000, livestock valued at £16,000 and his dwellinghouse valued at £5,500, will own a total of £81,500 and will not be liable for any wealth tax.  A farmer with a farm of 160 acres, the land valued at £100,000, machinery valued at £10,000, investments valued at £10,000, livestock valued at £32,000, dwellinghouse valued at £11,000, will have wealth to the tune of £163,000.</P>

A farm consisting of 240 acres valued <Col N="691" /> £150,000, with machinery valued £15,000, investments £15,000, livestock £48,000, dwellinghouse £16,500, total £244,500 is free of wealth tax.

A farm containing 640 acres valued at £400,000, machinery £40,000, investments £40,000, livestock £128,000, dwellinghouse £44,000, total £652,000, will pay £2,720 or .41 per cent wealth tax.  A farm containing 800 acres, valued £600 an acre, total £500,000, with machinery £50,000, investments £50,000, livestock £160,000, dwellinghouse £55,000, will have a total wealth of £815,000, and will be asked to pay £3,900 or .48 per cent in wealth tax.</P>
      <P>Let us now come to the farm of 1,200 acres, valued at £750,000, with machinery worth £75,000, investments £75,000, livestock £240,000, dwellinghouse £82,500, a total wealth of £1,222,500 and he is taxed at the rate of one-half per cent.  The final figure I want to give the House is a farm of 1,600 acres, worth £1 million, with machinery worth £100,000, investments £100,000, livestock £320,000, dwellinghouse £110,000, total £1,630,000, and the rate is .52 per cent.</P>

    <P>According to any stretch of the imagination that is a light tax, that should not frighten anybody away, that will not scare anybody out of the country, that will not make it difficult for people to reside here.

Irish trading companies are not subject to wealth tax.  Irish trading companies, owned by foreign trading companies are not subject to wealth tax.  Therefore, there is no discouragement to large foreign corporations, whether they be America owned, German owned, Dutch or British owned, establishing companies here, investing their money, bringing in their expertise and their knowhow and carrying on as they did in Europe.

I do not accuse Fianna Fáil of not being patriotic but I appeal to them not to allow their politics to blind their patriotism.  It is true that shares in trading companies in the hands of people who are domiciled and ordinarily resident here are subject to wealth tax at the rate of one per cent, provided the thresholds are exceeded. But the thresholds are generous. A married man would want to have shares valued at £100,000 in the company.  That is a fair share.  In so far as the family company is concerned, most of them are owned by father and adult son, son-in-law, daughter-in-law. The combined threshold should be far above that.</P>

I dealt specifically with the arguments made in regard to the agricultural sector, in regard to the alleged discouragement to foreign trading companies establishing subsidiaries here and, indeed, with the Irish shareholder through the general thresholds.  I pointed out that this is a complicated and complex Bill, very properly to be dealt with in Committee.  Because the Opposition are availing of the taxing section too, to make general contributions which, but for section 2 would be relevant only to a Second Stage debate, they are wasting the time of the House and wasting their own time. They are preventing the House and their own experts from getting down to the nitty gritty of committee work.</P>

The people will see, and particularly the people on whose behalf they are alleged to be speaking, that they are not serving them.  They are not doing anything to meet the demands and representations put forward. Indeed, the Minister has introduced about 30 amendments in relief of taxpayers under this Bill.  The Minister has introduced about 30 amendments as a result of representations made to him by responsible people, and, after consultation and debate with them, he decided to introduce these amendments but the Opposition Party are preventing any discussion on Committee Stage.  They are preventing the House from debating this Bill in committee.  The intelligent people who are interested in clarification of many sections of this Bill, people such as the IFA advisers, perhaps, accountants throughout the country, lawyers throughout the country, who are interested in getting an intelligient Committee Stage debate and clarification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> To clarify the position when we are discussing the Wealth Tax Bill, first, we must not discuss it in isolation.  Anyone coming into this House will see that we are discussing a Wealth Tax Bill and nothing else. But the Minister over the past ten minutes has been describing and giving examples as to how people would be exempt throughout the country as regards farms where death duties are concerned.  I have mentioned on several occasions that I welcome the fact that death duties are abolished.  I think everybody on this side of the House and on the far side of the House has mentioned this on several occasions.  But we must be perfectly clear that when we abolish death duties they are being replaced by three capital taxation Bills, not one. We discussed the Capital Gains Tax Bill on its own merits; we are now discussing the Wealth Tax Bill and, <Col N="698" /> to follow later on, will be the Capital Acquisitions Bill.  It takes three Bills to replace death duties, not one.  When the Minister comes into the House and says that this is what people will pay in death duties, with the examples which he has quoted over the past ten minutes, we must ensure that we take the entire package into consideration when we are discussing the abolition of death duties.  Then one will see how it will affect one generally.</P>
      <P>I believe myself that the return of revenue from wealth tax will be very small.  The examples which the Minister has given as regards the exemptions are fairly accurate.  This is the basis on which I am against wealth tax because it is going to be directed at a very small minority of people but a very important section.  That is the important thing.  We are directing it at a section of people who have invested in and built up the industrial arm of this country.  We must be very careful to ensure that we do not undermine confidence in that section. There are other Deputies in the House who would be able to make the case for the agricultural sector.  The Minister has made these cases as to how it could be exempt.  I am concerned about the industrial sector, job creation.  This is what is of vital importance today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are trying to create an economic climate whereby we have an inflow of capital, whereby we will be able to curb inflation&mdash;at least let us curb it and then get a downward trend&mdash;we must bring in appropriate measures.  I believe that very shortly the Minister for Finance will be coming before the House, next Thursday week I am informed, with measures intended to bring a downward trend in the inflationary spiral which we are experiencing today.  But if one looks at this whole concept, do you not think that this in its own right is inflationary?  I believe it is.  The Minister has stated, of course, that private companies are exempt, trading companies are exempt; we know all that, but what about shareholders in companies? That is the important factor. There are many productive and expanding companies here.  Perhaps 51 <Col N="699" /> per cent or perhaps 70 per cent of the shares are held by a managing director or in fact by the man who started the company.  Indeed, some of the most progressive companies here, quite a substantial number of them, are organised in this way.  It is at these people you will be directing this tax.</P>
    <P>If I thought for one moment&mdash;and I have mentioned this on the Second Reading&mdash;that this would bring a substantial inflow of capital into the Exchequer, if I thought it would bring in £50 or £60 million, I could certainly say that we had a reason for introducing it because we could channel this money back into industry, recycle it, and recycle it into a more productive field.  Some of the logic supposed to be behind this is that it will penalise non-productive assets, more so than productive assets.  That is some of the philosophy and thinking behind it.  But the amount of money that will be directed, will not be very large: I think it will be infinitesimal in comparison to the current budget which went through this House in January.</P>
    <P>Last January a budget of £1,200 million went through this House.  The very maximum that can be got out of this legislation is £6 or £7 million.  Any expert forecast that I have seen as to the very maximum that may be got from wealth tax, estimates £6 or £7 million.  When we add that figure to a current budget of £1,200 million which it was last January&mdash;probably next Thursday it will be considerably more&mdash;we will find that it will not represent 1 per cent of the current budget.  That is what we are talking about here with all this capital taxation.  We must realise what it is worth&mdash;that is the important factor&mdash;from the economic point of view.  Will it enrich the country?  Will the amount of money which will come back into the Exchequer be deployed in building up industry, helping the weaker section of the community by being channelled into health or education? Of course not: it will be of no significance.  But when you look at the other side of the coin and see the damage that this tax has done, then <Col N="700" /> you will realise that it is detrimental and represents a bad decision.  For the sake of the £5 or £6 million we have certainly undermined confidence, and confidence is the most important thing to be built up in any country. You might be able to increase taxation in current budgets by increasing taxes; you might be able to borrow for a capital budget to expand hospitals and provide roads, but there is one thing you cannot buy, and that is confidence. You can travel all the Arab countries or European countries but you will have to build up confidence within the country itself.  It is something that cannot be bought.  The people must have confidence in themselves, confidence in the future that industry is going to expand.  Young people must have confidence when they are leaving schools that they have an opportunity in life afterwards.  The people in international money markets must have confidence that you are able to absorb the loans which are given to you and to repay them.</P>
    <P>This is the thing which we should be aiming at when confidence is undoubtedly at a low ebb.  During this week when the Minister for Finance, whether through the European banks or through the Arab countries, is involved in negotiating a loan of any description they may suggest certain remedial action here but I bet my bottom dollar, that not one of them will suggest a wealth tax when they are lending money to this country. They may point out to the Government the actions they think should be taken to bring inflation under control; they may point out how the Government can reduce their unit costs or ways and means of reducing unemployment, but I would be amazed if the Minister for Finance when he comes back could tell me that any of those countries would say, that in a rundown economy you should introduce a wealth tax or a capital taxation package such as we are introducing at present.  I do not believe that there are any financiers in Europe who would recommend capital taxation in a weak and struggling economy.</P>
    <P>We know that countries such as America and Japan have not a wealth <Col N="701" /> tax, and these are countries which we are hoping will give this country a substantial financial injection over the next few years.  Coming nearer home, some of the most advanced European countries such as Belgium have no wealth tax.  Belgium is a small country, probably half the size of Ireland, with twice the population.  It is the headquarters of the European Community and we can imagine the amount of finance which has gone into their construction industry.  There is real wealth there which has accumulated within the past ten years, since the establishment of the Community. We know it was always a wealthy little nation but they have not opted for a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>France is another country which does not have a wealth tax.  America has huge technological and electronics investments in France.  They have not a wealth tax and we know they have a large tourist industry.  The same situation exists in Italy where there is no wealth tax.  These are major countries within the EEC which have developed their industrial arm many years before us.  We know the wealth of some of these European countries. We may have the same wealth in ten years' time and then we will be in a position to speak about a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour, they have been talking about a wealth tax but that is as far as they have gone.  In legislation before the House of Commons at present there is no question of a wealth tax.  There was a White Paper circulated with regard to intentions but there was many a White Paper circulated before which was never implemented.  The decision to go before the United Kingdom into a wealth tax was unwise.  We could find ourselves in the position that England may change her mind about such a tax.  The British economy is under very heavy pressure at present, and so is this country's.  I doubt very much if England has any intention of introducing a wealth tax in the depressed state of the British economy. I do not think Mr. Wilson would be so foolish as to try to push such legislation through the House when he is <Col N="702" /> trying to build up confidence, build up exports and curb inflation.</P>
    <P>These are the fundamental aspects of the Bill.  It is the philosophy behind the Bill which we are objecting to. We do not object to taxing the rich. If one reads the debate on the Second Reading of the Capital Gains Tax Bill, it will be seen that Fianna Fáil criticised the Bill because there was no limitation to the thresholds and so on.  That is the kind of provision we criticised on the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  The Committee Stage served a useful purpose because there were many anomalies in the Bill and the Minister saw one point of view and many amendments were made.</P>
    <P>We favour a taxation on short-term speculation.  It will be seen from the speeches of members of this side of the House on the Capital Acquisitions Bill that they welcomed sections of it. When the Committee Stage of that Bill comes before the House, I shall have no hesitation in welcoming certain sections of the Bill.  Some of them I should like to see changed, and we can discuss them.  That is what we should have done when we abolished death duties.  If we had any common sense, we should have discussed the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill first and it would have been through the House long ago.  If we wanted to put through the Capital Gains Tax Bill, there is a certain merit in it, and it should have come next.  Neither of those Bills is a direct taxation on investments.</P>
    <P>I believe the Government should have put those two Bills through the House early in January, when they made their decision.  There is plenty of time for the Wealth Tax Bill. When we build up our economy we can go after the wealth.  There is no good in trying to bring in a Wealth Tax Bill until the wealth is first created.  That is not here at this particular time.  We know that the whole of Europe is in economic difficulties at present but we are more vulnerable than Europe.  A small country such as ours must have some encouragement in order to attract investors.</P>
    <P>If we are to have our taxation level the same as obtains in sophisticated <Col N="703" /> European countries, there is no great attraction to foreign investors to come here.  First of all, we must look at our geographical situation in Western Europe.  Ninety-five per cent of our manufactured goods must be exported, the major part to the United Kingdom and the European Community.  Any manufacturer must take transport costs into account.  We must import a large part of our raw material.  This is expensive as regards transportation.  Then, when it is manufactured, we must export it again, either to the United Kingdom or the Community.  This can be an expensive process; and unless we decide to keep our unit cost under that of the United Kingdom and the other European countries, we will have no hope of competing in the export market.</P>
    <P>Up to now, I agree, our exports have been going well.  We know that over the years we always had that advantage in the unit cost in regard to our exports.  We kept that unit cost up to two years ago, but it has been diminishing since and now it is on a par with that of any of the European countries and the United Kingdom. If we reach that level, it will be very difficult to attract capital investment because manufacturers will go instead to the heart of the activities, to the Ruhr or the Golden Triangle and set up their factories where the raw material is available, where the distribution of the manufactured articles will be at a very low cost.</P>
    <P>It is only on these two fiscal policies, two budgetary proposals, that we can hope to keep this country attractive for investors.  We are evidently bent on the highly sophisticated taxation system of some of the European countries and we are not developed for it.  Whether we like it or not this is the reality of the situation and it will be brought home to us very forcibly in a few years, if we continue with this policy, the particular type of person who can create jobs by expanding industry.  We know too well from reading the forecasts put forward by economists that we will have to create 25,000 new jobs per year up <Col N="704" /> to 1980 and, unless there is a dramatic change, there is no hope of achieving this figure; if anything, we will have a contraction in industry over the next year.  We will certainly have no expansion if this policy is pursued.  We could not hope to have an expansion in industry in the present financial climate.  The Government should be directing their attention to trying to curb inflation.  That is the greatest problem today.  We have wasted more time in this House since Christmas discussing capital taxation, which will not create one job and which will certainly not contribute to reducing inflation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is difficult to avoid mentioning the three capital taxation packages in the context of the Bill before the House but I will certainly do my best to confine myself to section 2.  When discussing the fact that death duties were abolished the Minister gave examples as to how people would be exempt and I was just reminding the Minister that he would have to consider the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill as replacing death duties. I certainly do not want to go back on capital taxation again.  We have spent a great deal of time on that, but the fact is that these measures are members of the one family, as it were, and the three were introduced to replace death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister gave indications last week as regards thresholds in other countries.  The Minister did not, of course, go into the whole taxation package from the point of view of taxation in countries like Germany and Belgium.  In discussing a Bill like this there might be an advantage with regard to thresholds in other countries; but, if the whole taxation package were looked at in countries like Germany, France and Belgium, then a substantial difference would be seen.  Some of the most advanced socialist countries have the highest and best standards of social welfare and some of their taxation <Col N="705" /> systems are most impressive at the higher levels.</P>
    <P>Viewing this wealth tax in isolation would be unfair because we have to consider the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Capital Acquisitions Bill also. The Minister's examples some short time ago leave me with the impression that nobody will be subject to wealth tax.  That is the Minister's point of view. Industry today is struggling on on a very tight margin.  Most industries are operating on a 3 per cent or 4 per cent return on capital investment.  Some highly specialised companies get a higher return.</P>

      <P>I move.</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's expressed intention of using the EEC Regional Fund to recoup past expenditure to the Exchequer and demands that the Fund be used to finance a special regional development programme in the less developed parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To consider this Motion in its proper perspective, I would suggest one has to go back a few years to the campaign that was waged in preparation for the referendum on entry into the EEC. It cannot be denied that in that campaign we, in Fianna Fáil, and the Fine Gael Party also, campaigned on the basis that one of the advantages which would accrue to this country by entry into the EEC was that there would be a regional fund which would assist, and we hoped substantially, the development of the less-developed areas of this country and, in particular, the western part of the country.  I do not think anybody can deny that was the basis on which both the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Parties campaigned.  The <Col N="706" /> Labour Party, of course, campaigned against entry into the EEC and some of their speakers indicated their lack of faith in the prospect of a regional fund being set up or, if it were set up, of its being any way effective. Had it been known at that time that when the fund was set up the Government of the day would propose to snaffle the money to reimburse the Exchequer, nobody could have campaigned in favour of the EEC on the basis of a regional fund and, indeed, the Labour Party would have been right.  I do not know what has been happening now since one was set up&mdash; whether it is a consequence of the Labour Party's attitude, which I have perhaps proved was right in regard to the regional fund, or whether the Fine Gael Party have forgotten what it promised to the people during that referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>In the last few years both sides in this House have complained at the delay in the setting up of the regional fund and, when it was eventually set up, at the smallness of the fund.  I do not think any of us could have made any case at all for the setting up of this fund had we known at that time what was proposed to be done with the fund, had we known that our share, when it came, would go into the Exchequer to reimburse and recoup the Exchequer for expenditure already committed, apparently for the purpose of easing the Government's budgetary problems.  <i>The Irish Independent</i> on 14th April, 1975, quoted an extract from a letter written by the Minister for Finance to a county council in which he said that actual payments from the fund in respect of approved projects will be on the basis of part recoupment on the scale of expenditure already undertaken by the member State.  Whatever arguments there may be about the letter of the EEC Directive in regard to the regional fund there cannot be any argument in regard to the spirit of it.  Regulation No. 724/75 of the 18th March, 1975, states that whereas the fund's assistance should not lead member States to reduce their own regional development efforts, it <Col N="707" /> should complement these efforts.  To reinforce that I should like to refer to something which was stated in the European Parliament on 29th April, 1975, by the Commissioner in charge of Regional Policy, Mr. George Thomson.  He said that there is the quite separate question and a very important one as to whether contributions from the Community's Regional Development Fund should be additional to the total resources made available for regional policy by member States.</P>
    <P>In the preamble of the regulation it is made clear that the member States commit themselves to the general proposition that the totality of resources should be additional; that this has always been the Commission's view.  Mr. Thomson continued that as he had stated many times there is no case for a Community Regional Development Fund unless in the end it means that additional resources are made available to help with the regional problems.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the regulation and the clear-cut and reiterated view of the commissioner for regional policy made it quite clear what the spirit of this directive is, that is, that the money available to each country under the regional fund should be additional to and not in substitution for State expenditure.</P>
    <P>In a letter also to <i>The Irish Independent,</i> written by the Minister for Finance, and appearing in that paper on 15th April, 1975, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>... In fact it is understood that a majority of member States will opt to use fund assistance in part repayment to their exchequers of expenditure on State aids rather than apply it to increase the level of aid granted to some individual projects.</P>
    <P>I have been making some inquiries about this matter and the information I have been able to get from Brussels does not correspond with that statement by the Minister.  The information available to me suggests that France is proposing to add a percentage <Col N="708" /> to the existing level of grants in its regions, that Italy proposes to develop and identify entirely new projects and to devote all of the fund to these which are largely infrastructural. Germany, in respect of the small part of the fund which it will receive, is likely to devote it to touristic and infrastructural projects which are so far unplanned but which they propose to put into effect with the regional fund money.</P>
    <P>If the proposal of the Minister for Finance as indicated in the letter to the county council to which I referred is to be put into effect, is there any way in which it can be established that the regional fund is being used additionally to State aids and not in substitution for them?  There are certain provisions built into the regulations which are designed to prevent this, provisions such as obliging the State concerned to inform the recipient of the amount of the money coming from the regional fund, and the publication, at six-monthly intervals, of projects assisted by the fund. Nevertheless it would be very easy for any Government if they chose to do so, to conceal what they are really doing and present projects which were getting aid from the regional fund as if additional moneys were being made available when in fact the money was simply being used to ease budgetary problems.  For instance, in what way can it be established that the level of State aid would not have been lower or higher or at the same level in the absence of the regional fund?  I suggest there is no way in which this can be done, that this is open to a complete sleight-of-hand operation.  The indications given by the Minister for Finance so far are that that is precisely what he intends to do, that he intends to engage in this sleight-of-hand operation.</P>
    <P>We, on this side of the House, made commitments to the people in the referendum on the EEC.  So did the Fine Gael members of the Government. For our part we shall do anything we can to ensure that those commitments are honoured.  I would suggest that the clearest and most unambiguous way of honouring those <Col N="709" /> commitments is by the setting up of a separate regional fund for development here and making quite clear which money is coming from the EEC and which money is coming from the State into that fund.  It should be kept separate from existing funds which have existed and will continue to exist in the future whether or not there is an EEC Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>A number of officials in the Commission in Brussels are particularly anxious that projects should be identified and brought forward immediately to the Commission.  They make no secret of the fact that assistance, over and above State assistance, is the key to the spirit of the fund.</P>
    <P>An example of one possible approach to this matter is if a firm were to get an industrial grant of £100,000.  In theory the Government could recoup £50,000 of that money from Brussels.  In that case they are obliged to inform the recipient of the grant that he is getting £50,000 from the regional fund.  I think it is clear that the fact that the beneficiary is getting half the grant from Brussels will not make the money any more exciting or useful so far as he is concerned.  Nor are the people in the region concerned likely to feel any particular gratitude to the EEC as a result.  It was always intended from the EEC point of view that it would be quite clear to the regions that they were benefiting from membership of the Community and, in particular, from the funds.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that our share of the fund at the moment is quite small.  We are in a three-year trial period.  That is very important and the Government ought not lose sight of it.  If, at the end of that three-year trial period, what will emerge is that the country which had the greatest need for the regional fund and which, because of that, <i>per capita,</i> got by far the highest allocation, simply used the fund to reimburse the money to the Exchequer, then I suggest that the Governments of Germany and the Netherlands, who were the main contributors to this, will inevitably say: &ldquo;Well, that is not what the fund was for, and we do not see why money <Col N="710" /> ought to be paid by us merely to ease the budgeting problems of the Government in Ireland.&rdquo;  There is a grave danger if this matter is not handled properly, that that will be the result at the end of the three-year period.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance recently indicated that he expected about £4 million would be transferred in this year.  I must confess I find it difficult to share his optimism in that regard, having regard firstly to the fact that projects would need to be forwarded to Brussels within a matter of weeks in order that any grants could be made from the fund this year, and also our experience from the FEOGA guidance money, which was allocated to us in 1973, and has not been received yet, is not too encouraging.  The important thing I suggest is this: however small the fund may be at the moment, and however much delay there may be in receiving the money and getting the scheme going, it is vitally important that we get off on the right foot now and establish the methods and precedents which will enable a real case to be made, and push for the establishment of a much bigger and more effective regional fund to follow the three-year trial period in which we are now.</P>
    <P>I suggest that when the Parliamentary Secretary, who is standing in for the Minister on this, speaks in this debate he should state clearly what type of schemes will be submitted by the Minister for financing from the regional fund in Brussels, having regard to the fact especially that existing projects are already the subject of commitments by the Government and are covered by the Government's published estimates.</P>
    <P>One other matter I want to mention in passing is to refer to a comment that the Minister for Finance made when he stated that the Council of Ministers recently indicated in reply to a question in the European Parliament that the intentions of the Irish Government are contrary neither to the legality nor the spirit of the regional fund.  I know some observers in Europe, and, indeed, quite a number in this country, who know what <Col N="711" /> the score is are cynically amused at the Minister's statement, knowing that that statement, which he attributed to the Council of Ministers, was, of course, a statement made in response to a question in the European Parliament by none other than the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald.  As presented by the Minister for Finance, it was given a good deal more weight on a European level, or he would have us believe that it had such, than it was entitled to.</P>
    <P>I have given the reason for the indications that the Government intend to use the regional fund moneys only as a reimbursement to itself of expenditure already incurred or committed. As I said, this indicates an intention simply to use the fund to ease the Government's budgetary difficulties.  It has always been the intention of the EEC that the funds should be used to supplement national aid for the regions.  I know that, in the case of this country, the Commission have been impressed by what has already been done in the way of regional development, but it has also been persuaded that the resources available to us are not sufficient to see industry and industry-associated infrastructure projects develop at a faster rate.  It was with a view to creating additional jobs at a quicker pace that all of the State was considered eligible for regional fund aids.  As I said earlier, the allocation to this country was, on a <i>per capita</i> by far the highest in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority in its end of the year statement issued on the 1st January, 1975, indicated that £10 million would be paid by the Authority to Irish industrialists expanding or modernising their industries during the year 1975.  Assuming that the 1975 regional development fund allocation to Ireland were to be spent equally between infrastructure and industry projects, there would then be the possibility of increasing approximately by half the IDA grant to these native Irish industries undertaking expansion programmes.</P>
    <P>Indeed, previous experience with <Col N="712" /> other EEC funds has been along these lines.  In the case of food processing industries, who will have already received aid from the national authorities, usually the IDA, grants have also been payable by the guidance section of the EAGGF in Brussels.  By the end of the summer, grants totalling approximately £8½ million should have been approved to Irish farms from this source.  In the case of training activities, grants totalling approximately £18 million have already been approved to Ireland.  In the case of projects submitted by the private sector grants have been payable both by the national authorities here and the Social Fund itself.</P>
    <P>In regard to Irish industry and the possibility of getting it to invest and expand, we all know that rising costs and smaller markets are making survival for industry extremely difficult at the moment.  The possibility of channelling regional fund moneys to companies with development plans must be considered.  At a time of financial stringency, larger grants may well be necessary to ensure that these investments are undertaken.  Indeed, the Government have acknowledged that the cash flow position of a number of Irish companies is a major problem and is likely to remain so during this year, if not next year.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank report has emphasised, particularly in certain sectors in industry, that there are very serious liquidity problems.  The same report went further in stressing that in the case of some firms, because their difficulties were due to the combined effects on their cash flow of stagnant demand for products, falling profits, and the adverse effects of taxation, their basic problems were not capable of being solved by an increase in bank credit. There is a clear-cut shortfall in internal cash flow in industry which the Confederation of Irish Industries some time ago estimated to be approximately £60 million in this year.</P>
    <P>In the light of all these circumstances, and the fact that many firms are in such a position that even with credit available they cannot take it up, there may very well be a strong case for considering increased grants to <Col N="713" /> induce Irish industries to expand in the less-developed parts of this country.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the allocation from the regional fund, coupled with the measures which the Government might take in ease of industry, would go a long way towards easing this problem.  If, however, as the Minister for Finance has argued, the percentage grants available are already high enough and should not be increased, if that argument is true, and I will not go into detail on it at the moment because I do not think it would be relevant, clearly there are many urgently needed infrastructural projects to which the whole of our part of the regional fund could be devoted, in conjunction, of course, with expenditure by the Government.</P>
    <P>Speaking recently to the Economic and Social Committee of the EEC, the Deputy Director General of the Department responsible for regional policy in Brussels stated that the council were aware that considerable grants were necessary to attract business to the least-favoured regions, that being particularly true, as I indicated, in present economic circumstances. It was for this reason, he said, that the council have decided to increase the maximum rate of grant payable from Brussels from 15 to 20 per cent.  Of course, to justify such a grant, the amount of the grant from the Government would have to increase from 30 to 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>In the light of all this, it is all the more surprising that the Department of Finance, on behalf of the Government, should have indicated in their statements that the Government are to consider the resources from the regional fund as a reimbursement to the Government of expenditure already incurred or committed.  In the light of that, one is entitled to ask whether the basic objective of the fund is being changed, and whether the fund is now to become a tool of budgetary policy or monetary policy. There was in the past and, indeed, to some extent it still remains, tremendous enthusiasm in under-developed areas of the Community and in particular in under-developed parts of this country for what the regional <Col N="714" /> fund might offer.  It seems clear that, unless there is a change in policy as indicated by the Minister for Finance, the only direct beneficiary from the arrival of the regional fund will be the coffers of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>One local authority which inquired from the Department of Finance about how the regional fund was to be used got, as I indicated earlier, a detailed reply, which ended by suggesting that projects which were to be the subject of applications for regional fund aid should be submitted through the appropriate Government Department. In the light of the Government's proposal, as indicated by the Minister for Finance, to snaffle this money, what is the point in a local authority making any application under the regional fund, because the whole thing is, apparently, going back to the Government and we are as we were, with systems operating as before and any money coming in simply going to ease the budgetary pressure on the Government for the financing of things like industrial development or infrastructual development?</P>
    <P>Of course, one thing that has been highlighted very much by all of this is the fact that the Government have no regional policy whatever.  The previous Government did a great deal of work in developing a regional policy and implemented it in a number of areas as, indeed, is illustrated very clearly by the fact that when one hears downtalk about saving the west, largely one hears it in relation to a quite restricted area, whereas at one time it meant virtually anywhere west of the Shannon.  That is a fair indication of what was done in practical terms.</P>
    <P>I do not say the previous Government had a final blueprint for a regional policy.  We had gone a long way towards producing it.  Various studies were under way.  One of the factors involved in finalising it was the benefit which could accrue and the extent of it from the EEC Regional Fund.  We do not hear anything from the Government, and have not heard anything from them, about the development of a regional policy, about what they intend to do in relation to <Col N="715" /> those, perhaps by many people, longforgotten recommendations of the Buchanan Report and indeed subsequent developments.</P>
    <P>I suppose that a Government who have not got a regional policy at all and apparently have not thought about the subject, might be tempted to take the easy way out and, when the EEC Regional Fund becomes available, simply to say: &ldquo;Right, we will put that into the Exchequer and that will help us to pay for the various items we have to pay for&mdash;the IDA and road works and sewerage, and so on.&rdquo;  It is not good enough in the light of the undertakings given.  It is not good enough in the light of the requirements of the fund, and the spirit in which the fund was set up. It is not good enough in the light of the case we made to Brussels and to the EEC for the setting up of a large regional fund.  It is not good enough, I would suggest, in the light of the requirements of the people of this country and, in particular, it is not good enough in the light of the enormous damage it may do to the possible development of the fund in future, having regard, as I said, to the fact that we are now in a three-year trial period as far as the EEC and the regional fund are concerned, unless we show clearly and unequivocally in that period that we can and do make use of that fund to do worthwhile regional development, supplementing the efforts of the Government, there is the gravest danger that there will be no regional fund in a few years' time in the EEC.  If that happens, then a policy such as was indicated by the Minister for Finance will have contributed very substantially to the disappearance of the EEC Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>I would like to know and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate whether any projects have yet been submitted by the Government for payments from the EEC Regional Fund and, if not, when will projects be submitted for that purpose?  Also since such projects are presumably already committed as far as the Government are concerned, and since the <Col N="716" /> amount of money from the Government to aid them is committed, I should like to know what is proposed to be done in regard to the payments from the fund in relation to such projects?</P>
    <P>Is it proposed to use the money from the fund in relation to such projects to add to the aid being given and already committed by the Government, and thereby to increase the amount of aid available?  Alternatively is what is proposed mere recoupment to the Exchequer? I call on the Parliamentary Secretary to give a firm unambiguous commitment to the setting-up of a clearly separate regional fund to aid the less-developed parts of this country especially in the west.  Anything other than that is, I would strongly urge on the Parliamentary Secretary, merely reneging on the clear understanding which was given to the people&mdash;I would go further and say the clear promises that were given to the people &mdash;by both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the EEC referendum.  Not alone is a failure to set up such a fund a reneging on those promises but it is also, and cannot be described as anything else but, a fraud on the people, particularly those in the poorer parts of the country who deserve better than to be subjected to these promises and then have the promises reneged on because the Government find themselves in financial difficulty.</P>
    <P>If the people are to benefit from the EEC Regional Fund, even to the limited extent that is available now, and if we are to do our part to ensure that the permanent, long-term EEC Regional Fund is set up and set up on an adequate basis, then we must demonstrate now and the Government must demonstrate now, their good faith and their determination to ensure that there is here a regional fund aided directly and clearly from the EEC Regional Fund, a fund which will be used either to supplement industrial grants or Irish firms in the less-developed part of this country and/or the financing of urgently needed infrastructural development if the less-developed areas are to have a hope of getting on their feet.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary knows as well as I do that there are major <Col N="717" /> infrastructural works needed if certain parts of this country are to have a chance to develop properly.  We must, I believe, use the EEC Regional Fund to demonstrate that this is the kind of thing which gives us a de-cently-sized fund for which we are getting really big sums to develop the poorer regions and enable this country to take its place fully in the EEC and to subscribe fully to an integrated monetary policy in the future, a thing we cannot do until we develop this country.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will be able, on behalf of the Government, to make such a firm and unambiguous commitment and that he will be able to put on the record of the House that the Government have now decided that they are not going to use the money from the EEC fund to reduce budgetary difficulties at the expense of the poorest people in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak as a Labour Party member who, as Deputy Colley will recall, favoured, on balance, the entry of this country into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I had forgotten that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, and one does suffer for one's beliefs.  At that time I was not under the slightest illusion about some of the euphoric propaganda that emanated from many political quarters in relation to the EEC Regional Fund and the prospects that were held out for this country at that time.  I also speak in this debate as a member of the Joint Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas on EEC Secondary Legislation and, as such, I have received a good deal of documentation in relation to the regional fund.  It certainly baffles my imagination that Deputy Colley should suggest that the regional fund in this country is going to mean, if I may quote his words, &ldquo;a worthwhile regional development in Ireland&rdquo;.  The fact of the matter is, and I think it has to be placed and kept always in the forefront of our economic perspective of the £4 million that it is a mere, if I may use <Col N="718" /> the term .87 per cent, much less than 1 per cent of the country's capital programme.  Deputy Colley knows that our current capital programme is in the region of £460 million.</P>
      <P>It is not for me to speculate to what extent that capital programme will increase this year but on the assumption that it may well increase, one can say that all the implications are that in terms of a contribution to the public capital programme this year, the EEC Regional Fund, the glorious fund which was to solve all Ireland's regional problems according to Fianna Fáil if we were to enter the EEC at the time&mdash;I think much of the talk was grossly exaggerated&mdash;will have paid less than one-half of 1 per cent of a contribution to the nation's public capital programme by the end of 1975. That is what we are debating in this motion tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the first point.  Deputy Colley talks about the Government's expressed intention of using the regional fund to recoup past expenditure.  We are talking about one aspect of public expenditure, namely, the public capital programme.  Let us be clear about that.  We are talking about individual aid to individual projects which I would certainly hope to come to later on.  I would suggest, with respect to Deputy Colley, that because there has been a little unsophisticated hysteria in the case of a few journalists about what the Minister intends to do about the regional fund or the uses to which he intends to put it&mdash;largely from EEC journalists who must have little else to do if they can think up a few scare stories about the use of the £4 million&mdash; Deputy Colley has been quite cynically mischievous in trying to interpret the Government's intention in this regard.  He is rather ill-informed, and I think he is a bit propagandistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our approach is entirely above board.  As one who has a deep personal interest in the EEC affairs in this country I have examined some of the relevant documents.  I have examined the regulation of 18th March, <Col N="719" /> 1975, regulation 724 of 1975, establishing the regional development fund. First of all I think one must examine that regulation.  Secondly, I have studied carefully the original reply, of the Minister for Finance to the Dáil Adjournment Debate of 23rd April which was somewhat analogous to this debate.  I have particularly examined statements made to this country by a spokesman for the Commission of the European Communities on 30th May, 1975 and that has been on public record.  Then I think one should also examine in relation to the future the very recent statements made by Commissioner George Thomson, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, to the European Parliament Committee of Regional Policy and Transport made only six or seven days ago, on 10th June.  Any examination of these documents will show that the Government's approach is entirely above board, is not in any way a surreptitious attempt to grab £4 million because the Government may have severe budgetary revenue problems.</P>
    <P>May I suggest to Deputy Colley that if the Government had to depend on the £4 million from the EEC Regional Fund to ease our budgetary problems we would indeed be a Government not suffering undue perturbation.  Indeed I would suggest to Deputy Colley that if the £4 million were all that we were facing in regard to the budgetary problem, the problem would be soluble quite rapidly.  I would suggest to Deputy Colley that here there is a clear implication first of all on the qualifying investment which would be undertaken in our country eligible for investment, and one must refer to article 4 of the Regulation.</P>
    <P>We do know that assistance may be available for investment which exceeds £20,000 odd and £21,000 and which is as follows: (a) industrial handicraft or service activities which either create ten new jobs or maintain existing employment&mdash;there are very clear-cut criteria there&mdash;(b) investible infrastructure directly linked with (a) or which is an essential pre-condition of such activity&mdash;again it is pretty coherent; (c) investible infrastructure covered by the <Col N="720" /> Council Directive on mountain or hill farming and farming in less-favoured regions, that is, access to farm electricity and drinking water, sewerage and so on.  These are the particular qualifying investments and assistance may be given to these projects.</P>
    <P>We also know full contribution to industrial handicraft or service conditions will be 20 per cent of the investment cost or 50 per cent of national aid to the project by public authorities, whichever is the lesser.  In the case of the infrastructure cost investment, the fund will contribute up to a maximum of 30 per cent of expenditure incurred by public authorities.  It is a pre-condition of assistance that the State must participate in the financing of projects. Again we are aware of that situation. For every pound they receive from the fund, the State must put up at least another pound for investment in industry, handicraft and services and £2.33 for investment in infrastructure. I do not think that in the approach of the Government there has been any clear-cut assessment such as Deputy Colley assumed.  There has been no clear-cut statement by the Government whatsoever that the Exchequer will retain the assistance received from the fund for general expense purposes. No shred of evidence is available in public or in private to my knowledge, or to the Commissioner, Mr. George Thomson, that this in fact is going to be the exclusive policy of the Government, that we should retain exclusively assistance from the fund for general tax purposes.  In fact, the opposite is the case, and I suggest to Deputy Colley and to some of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen that they are being very selective, very mischievous, in suggesting this because it is creating doubts in the minds of some Commission staff &mdash;it certainly creates public confusion &mdash;that this might be the case.</P>
    <P>In fact the assistance received from the fund will be used to finance additional industrial and infrastructural investment in the areas of greatest need which, as the Minister indicated in his reply on the Adjournment Debate in the Dáil of 23rd April last, consisted mainly of the designated areas.  This is a clear indication of <Col N="721" /> policy on the part of the Government. How much longer do we have to say in public, how more frequently do we save to say to Fianna Fáil, that the counties which would mainly benefit from the regional fund are Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Mayo, Clare, Kerry, parts of Limerick and parts of Cork?  It is a mischievous suggestion on the part of Deputy Colley to suggest that we are going simply to put this in the pocket of some mandarin within the Department of Lands who will carefully launder the fund, to use the Watergate expression.  It will be carefully laundered into the general budget strategy of the Department of Finance and will never have an impact on the designated areas of this country. That is patently false.</P>
    <P>With respect to Deputy Colley as a former Minister for Finance, I would say to him that to make the charge is doing damage to this country in Brussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The Deputy was not quoting the Minister.  I can say clearly to the former Minister that when these charges were made and when the Government sought and got emphatic reassurance from Brussels, we had a statement by the spokesman of the EEC Commission, and I will read it into the record here.  It states:</P>
      <P>Reports in certain Irish newspapers today regarding a meeting between representatives of the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and officials of the Commission may give the erroneous impression that the Commission is not satisfied with the system which the Irish Government proposes to adopt in applying the assistance of the Regional Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has particular relevance to Deputy O'Kennedy.  He knows some of the people whom I am talking about who came back to this country and made charges which were false and damaging and ill-informed and, furthermore, mischievous, in my <Col N="722" /> opinion.  For example, if I may quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would underline that to Deputy Colley&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>which is to increase the volume of public expenditure in the regions by the amount represented by the fund.</P>
      <P>I use the words &ldquo;in the regions&rdquo;. Therefore, I think the picture will become clear, and it will become very clear in the near future.  It will become very clear when there unfolds, as undoubtedly there will unfold, the fact that at the moment the Government &mdash;and Deputy Colley, I think, asked the Parliamentary Secretary about this&mdash;have suitable projects to meet the criteria which I outlined.  These projects are at present being selected by the Government. The Government are in charge of regional development policy.

      <P>I am not in any way suggesting that this Government have resolved the regional conflicts. In so far as the Government have had an opportunity, suitable projects to meet the criteria of the regional fund are at present being selected in consultation with the other Government Departments and, I would stress, with the other agencies involved.  These projects will be submitted and will receive the minimal effect of the expenditure of the fund.  If these projects were to depend exclusively on the regional fund, not many of them would get off the ground or be supplemented to that extent.  These projects will become known in due course.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out&mdash;there is a dangerous situation here&mdash;that if the special pleading of the Fianna Fáil Party escalates further to create the impression that this country, as a whole, is no longer an undeveloped, relatively speaking, region in Europe, then some people in Brussels may ask questions which Fianna Fáil might not wish to answer.  I would point out to Fianna Fáil&mdash;here there is a serious difficulty facing the Government that a relatively high percentage share of the fund's resources for the years 1975, 1976 and 1977, relatively high in terms of other countries, although still very low in total amount, is based on the general premise that the whole of the Republic is a less-developed region of the Community; that the population and the needs of the whole of the Republic should be taken into account in determining our share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> Therefore, is Deputy Colley putting forward the view, because I would be extremely interested in resolving this conflict with him, that the totality of the fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The conflict suggested by Deputy Colley's approach that, in effect, the totality of the expenditure should be on a purely regional basis, internally in this country, given, perhaps to very selected regions.  Perhaps Deputy Colley, in his well-known preoccupation with the infrastructural problems of the west would suggest that the totality of allocations should go exclusively to that area.  How does he reconcile that Fianna Fáil approach with the national approach, which I now understand is agreed between all three political parties, that the whole of Ireland shall be treated as a less-developed region, that, therefore, as I am sure Deputy Colley would appreciate, it would be necessary that some projects in the eastern region may have to be included and may have to get consideration in the allocation of this fund if we are to maintain the principle that the nation as a whole is a less-developed region.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, Fianna Fáil would want to be very careful in some of the more special pleadings they have made because they could very seriously affect the national interest from 1977 onwards when the conditions governing the granting of further assistance will be decided.</P>
      <P>I would conclude that the selection of a particular project for assistance will not, therefore, increase the level of aid already being paid to that project.  Rather will it be the means of obtaining assistance from the fund to increase our total industrial and infrastructural investment effort, particularly in the less-developed regions. This is the criteria which should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking in terms of allocation strategy, talking, perhaps, in a <Col N="725" /> rather academic and theoretical sense, because this Dáil motion is a piece of theoretical, political, polemical rhetoric on the part of Fianna Fáil. Strictly speaking, the motion could be about anything one would want to read into it.  If one takes the sensible approach of Deputies Flanagan, Callanan or Leonard one knows how far in terms of Mayo £250,000 would go in the impact of the infrastructural needs of that particular county or in terms of cross-Border industrial projects how far £250,000 would go in Monaghan.  That is leaving out all the other counties I have mentioned and the Deputy now expects 25 per cent of the fund for just two counties.</P>
    <P>In the near future, when the projects have been selected, we shall see a real measure of the Government's clear commitment to regional development within Ireland as a whole as a less-developed region.  I have the greatest confidence in a Minister such as Deputy Ryan who is under no delusions about the impact of the fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <P>I would suggest that the Opposition should read the latest progress report of Commissioner Thomson on 10th June to the European Parliament Committee.  He has laid down a number of preliminaries which are important.  In reply to his own question as to what exactly had been done since 29th April when the budget was adopted he said:</P>
      <P>They had gone ahead with four essential preliminaries.  First of all, in consultation with all the national Administrations we have prepared draft forms of application for regional development fund grants for the member states to fill in so that we can obtain the necessary information in a convenient standard lay-out in administrative detail but for the first time, I think, a new community financial instrument has had this element of systemisation right from the start.  We were drawing up details for the proposed procedure for the handling and examining of applications within the Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley may be interested to note that is a reply in a sense to the query as to what the Government were doing.  That was very much in hand.  The Commission since 29th April have been doing their work. Commissioner Thomson said he felt strongly that the paramount consideration should be speed and efficiency so that none could reproach the Commission with bureaucratic delays. Secondly, the Commission, he said, will examine allocations conscientiously. If I may quote the provisions of the regulations:...</P>

      <P>If I may repeat the terms of the Motion, they are:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the Government's expressed intention of using the EEC Regional Fund to recoup past expenditure to the Exchequer and demands that the Fund be used to finance a special regional development programme in the less-developed parts of the country.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy George Colley has done the House, and all of us who are interested in regional development, a great service by bringing forward this Motion.  I congratulate him on his opening speech in which he gave expression to the fears felt by all of us, who have an interest in regions in general and some regions in particular, as a result of certain statements made by the Minister for Finance.  I am, like Deputy Barry Desmond, a member of the joint committee of both Houses and I have no doubt about Deputy Desmond's sincerity in everything that he says but I do want to put it to you, sir, that we, in the West of Ireland, have no reason, in the middle of 1975, to trust a Dublin oriented Government and, in particular, we have no reason to trust the present Minister for Finance.  The people down the country would not be calling Deputy Richie Ryan a Machiavellian Minister, they would be calling him things in much blunter and less-sophisticated language.  It is very necessary, indeed, that assurances on this matter of the use of EEC funds should be given by those responsible; in this connection I look forward to the intervention of Deputy Henry Kenny, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, later on in this debate.</P>

      <P>We believe that he would not make an irresponsible statement on this matter, which is very dear to his heart, as it is to mine, and to that of all who represent the under-developed areas.  We know that, if he says this money will be used for the purpose for which it is intended, he will be sincere about it and that is more than we can say about the Minister.  That is why I say it is most important that Deputy Colley should have so ably put forward this Motion. His speech was very disquieting indeed, disquieting to those of us who have been for so long looking forward to the assistance of Europe in the development of the industrial, economic, agricultural, social and general structure of the west of Ireland in particular.</P>
      <P>He asked for a clear and unambiguous undertaking from the Minister&mdash;it is the least to which we, in this House, are entitled&mdash;and I also ask for a clear and unequivocal undertaking from the Minister for Finance that whatever meagre funds are available in the trial period will be used, and will be seen to be used, for the purposes for which they were intended. Most of us are grievously disappointed by the small level of the fund during this trial period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of us should have taken the opportunity of saying to the people we addressed during the course of the EEC referendum campaign that at the time we were speaking honestly when we said that the creation of a regional fund, which would obviously benefit Ireland very greatly and the less well-off parts of the country in particular, was one of the most important reasons for advocating that they should vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  I am quite sure that a lot of people who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; as a result of what we said, have since been disappointed (a) by the fact that it has taken so long for <Col N="730" /> any fund to be created, (b) because the fund is being set up initially for a trial period only and (c) that the fund itself is minuscule.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to those people: &ldquo;We were sincere at that time.  We are also disappointed that it has taken so long.  We are equally disappointed that the fund is so small.&rdquo;  The fund, nevertheless, has been created.  Provided the Government use that fund properly, and is seen to be using it properly, then in due course a very much larger fund will we hope be created.  It is vital to the people we represent that the Minister for Finance should be in a position to give the unequivocal undertakings which Deputy Colley and those of us who support him asked for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also asked for particulars of projects being considered. While Deputy Desmond says&mdash;and I accept that he means this&mdash;that the Government are considering projects at the present time, we would like the public to know where these projects are and their general nature. Obviously, we cannot be given information of a confidential nature. Obviously, it would be naïve to ask for particulars of individual firms, if they are involved.  Surely we are entitled to know within which category the projects being considered by the Government lie, and in respect of which parts of the country these projects have been put forward. In that way we would be able to test the sincerity of the Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's sincerity in this matter is not in question.  We do not doubt that he means what he says, but we do not know the source of his information.  We do not know if he is speaking for the Minister for Finance, or simply believes that the things he says are happening are in fact taking place.  We have to know that from the person responsible, as do the people who voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and put such store by the prospect of help from Europe, to those parts of Europe about to join the Community which needed it most.  That was one of the most persuasive arguments for joining the EEC, as will be obvious when one considers that approximately 90 per cent of the people of County <Col N="731" /> Mayo voted in favour of our joining the EEC.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to the Buchanan Report.  He implied rather than said, that our Government did not do enough in implementing a regional policy.  It is only fair to say that the publication of the Buchanan Report did nothing to advance the development of a regional policy, certainly not one that would be of any advantage to the west of Ireland. There was bitter division about its proposals.  There was bitter opposition to it.  I was one of the people who opposed the Buchanan recommendations. The opposition to it was not confined to one political party.  It was opposed in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  It spread throughout informed opinion.  It is not unfair to say that in so far as Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, was responsible for the development of an advanced regional policy, the Buchanan Report ultimately became a hindrance rather than a help.</P>
    <P>Obviously a report of such major importance had to be the subject of serious public debate.  The fact that there was bitter and reasoned opposition to most of the main propositions in that report must not be used as a reflection either on those who put forward this opposition or on Deputy Colley who had to listen to both sides before he could make up his mind what was the best policy to adopt.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond assured the House that there was no question of the use of EEC regional funds to recoup Exchequer expenditure being the &ldquo;exclusive policy of the Government&rdquo;. That is not what Deputy Colley asks. That is not what I am asking.  I do not want it to be the exclusive policy of the Government nor to be any tiny part of the Government's policy.  I shudder at the very idea that it might be even the minutest part of Government policy to divert funds in this fashion, funds that are so urgently needed for the purposes for which regional development was intended.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond wound up by <Col N="732" /> saying there had been great strides forward so far as regional development is concerned since the present Government were formed.  I would put forward the absolute opposite proposition.  I deny that this is so.  I do not doubt Deputy Desmond's sincerity. As a Corkman he must know something about the country but he is a long time living in Dublin.  I would respectfully suggest to him that the west of Ireland has not been developed but has been despoiled by the Government.  Deputy Desmond might benefit if he visited Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo or Donegal for his holidays and asked the people what they think has or has not been done by the Dublin Government since March, 1973.  He would then know whether the west of Ireland has been developed or despoiled.</P>
    <P>This is not merely through lack of a coherent regional policy so far as the western areas are concerned.  It goes deeper.  The attitude is that of Dublin people who would much prefer to see the people of the west of Ireland on the dole and not working at all, and thus being mentally as well as physically despoiled.  That is what this crowd of wretches are doing.  They are destroying the desire and will of the people to be manly and to work. They are not providing the work for them.  By the distribution of doles they are turning them into mental as well as physical cripples.</P>
    <P>Let Deputy Desmond visit any part of the west of Ireland and listen to the people and he will soon find out whether or not the people of that area regard this Government as having been a source of development or help to them.  The longer this Government last, the more the people of my area begin to realise that perhaps it is not their fault but that, as Dublin people, they simply do not understand either the mind or the outlook of the people of the west of Ireland or their needs.</P>
    <P>Over the past 18 months we have been talking about capital gains tax and wealth tax and anything and everything which should be almost totally irrelevant to the actual situation in which the people living on the western <Col N="733" /> seaboard find themselves.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may talk any nonsense he likes about a second television channel but the people of the west of Ireland do not give a damn about either one channel or the other except for very limited purposes.  They would be very glad if somebody said to them: &ldquo;Do you remember that time we were looking for votes during the EEC referendum?  We promised that a regional fund would be set up and, as a result of that, you would have more industries created and more roads and sewers and water supplies created and we would be helped by Europe.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people are prepared to put up with delays.  They understand the reasons for the delay.  They know why some of the major contributing countries began to get annoyed at the amount of money they were asking their own people to contribute.  People are not unreasonable in their attitude to the delay and to the smallness of the fund.  They are bitterly disappointed with this Government and in particular with the Minister for Finance who has totally diverted the minds and thoughts of the people to something which is basically irrelevant to them, discussions about wealth tax and capital gains tax.  A farmer who is patiently waiting for his cheque from the creamery to pay his rates certainly is not particularly interested in wealth tax or capital gains tax.  We do not accept that the Government have used the past two years to advance regional policy at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Before we adjourned this debate I was discussing the merits of this wealth tax and its effects on business. I was endeavouring to find out the purpose behind this Bill: whether it is designed to embrace a large section of the community and what the <Col N="734" /> return to the Exchequer will be.  When we look at the valuation of agricultural land, we come to the one firm conclusion that this is designed to catch people who are in business on a large scale.  It is designed specifically for that type of person.  In terms of employment, there is no point in looking at a small farm of 40 acres or a small shopkeeper.  Where will we absorb the 103,000 people unemployed? Will it be in the industrial areas or the construction industry? We must concentrate on this section of the community when we are considering this wealth tax.</P>
      <P>According to a report previously published in this country there will be a reduction in the number of persons employed in agriculture.  This is a tendency in every country in Europe, in America and in any other country you wish to mention.  The general pattern of people employed in agriculture in the EEC countries is around 16 per cent of the working population. The number of people employed in this country averaged, in the last statistics taken, at 25 per cent.  I am informed that this trend will develop in this country also; there will be a diversion from the direct engagement on the land probably to manufacturing of the by-products of agriculture.  These workers must be absorbed in factories, in construction work and in the services, unless we are to have 200,000 people unemployed.  I believe that this package is not taking into consideration the profitability of a company at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper and the Bill do take into consideration that all businesses do not give the same results. They have conceded that in the Bill by valuing agricultural land at 60 per cent.  I believe the thinking behind it was that the return on capital investment in agriculture would not give the same return as in industry and in business.  Of course the same principle applies in business: every business varies in its profitability.  Some businesses, probably with high automation and the techniques they employ, have a very low labour content and very high profits.  That is not the type of an industry we would want here. We would want industries with a high <Col N="735" /> labour content and quite often manufacturing industry with a high labour content has not the same return in capital.  We have only to see the various companies in the weaker sector of our industrial arm that have closed down recently.  That was due to low profitability.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill to vary the one per cent in relation to the different types of profits : it is right across the board irrespective of whether you have a high return on capital or not.  I believe basically that this is wrong, that some steps should be taken to look at the profitability of the company and see that there is a variation as regards the rate of wealth tax.</P>
    <P>We know that in countries like Germany they allow the wealth tax against income tax, but there is no such provision here.  They allow a portion of it.  It is quite obvious that we are aiming here&mdash;perhaps from an administrative point of view it is more acceptable&mdash;at uniformity but certainly from a business point of view anyone seeing the returns of companies in the <i>Independent, Times</i> or any national paper any morning can see the drastic downturn in the profitability of companies. This downturn in profits is bound to have an effect on the companies. We all know that when a company are doing well everyone within that company, the employees and everyone involved in it, also do well. By and large you will find that in any business or any company once the profits are right the directors of that company will plough back profit into the company: they will give better conditions to their employees; they will up-grade the type of factory they have and this gives confidence.  This is what confidence is all about.</P>
    <P>If you have 40 or 50 employees in a factory or in any type of business and they see that the company is ploughing money back, they know perfectly well that their jobs are secure.  They know that the directors or the board have every intention of staying in business and expanding the business.  This can only happen when there are sufficient profits in the company.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if you see a <Col N="736" /> company being run down gradually and profits are bad you will find that the workers themselves are losing confidence. They are worried about their jobs.  Even the trade unions, in my opinion, have quite often overlooked one of the most important factors in employment: I do not think that shorter working hours or wages are the vitally important factors where employees are concerned.  The first and most important factor for any employee is security of job life&mdash;will it continue, will he have pension rights?  That is the first basic requirement of any employee&mdash;continuity of employment and pension rights.  After that, he can talk about shorter working hours and increases in salary.  But, there is no good in continuing as we are at the moment with employees getting 25 per cent and inflation running at a corresponding figure and the factory being undermined.  It does not make any difference what you give an employee if this position continues because he will find that he has no guarantee that his job is going to continue. We should be aiming at building up confidence in the industrial sector, building up confidence in the trade unions and the employees.  You will not do it by going to Brussels or to the Arab countries for a loan and bringing back £80,000,000.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> You may bring it back but I can tell you here and now you will probably be channelling it into local authorities and hospitals and schools and housing.  That will get people off the dole, I agree, but you will not channel it into industry.  I know at the moment there is no shortage of money in the Associated Banks in this country, but there is a shortage of suitable clients to lend money to. There are people who are not credit-worthy, but I know from some banking circles that if credit-worthy projects in the industrial sector were put up to the Associated Banks, they would have money to give them.  But, people are not approaching the banks. I am sure the Minister for Finance <Col N="737" /> knows this perfectly well&mdash;that this money is there but it is not possible to get suitable clients to whom to give this money to invest in the industrial sector.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not want to go over the whole field of our economy, but unfortunately this wealth tax will affect everyone and this is one thing we must make perfectly clear.  The people it will not affect are the people that this Bill is directed at; I do not think it will affect them at all.  It certainly will have a detrimental effect on the work force as regards the transfusion of money and the building up of confidence.  This is what you must aim for at this time.  You can bring the money back, put the solutions to the House as regards taxation, if you wish to get money, but that will do nothing: you will never build up confidence quickly; it is a slow process and once it is down it is very, very difficult to build it up.</P>
      <P>I have seen businesses go down in this country through the years.  I have seen them go down through bad management; I have seen them go down by bad policies on the part of the management, of the owners; but as everyone in this House knows, it is impossible to build it up again.  It takes years to build up confidence. This is something that you do not try overnight&mdash;get an injection of capital and everything will be all right.  Of course this is not true, and this is not going to happen now.</P>
      <P>I think that as a gesture to restoring that confidence this is one Bill that should be put into cold storage until such time as our industrial arm starts to generate and expand again.  This can be done if the proper remedies are applied at this time, but if we go through with this type of taxation, I believe it will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Crinion was speaking when the Minister replied to him earlier as regards the taxation of trading companies.  I know that trading companies <Col N="738" /> are not taxed as such; we all know that the shareholders are taxed. We also know that if you are domiciled, a resident, in this country your wealth abroad is taxed, but certainly I did not know until a few days ago that an American company owning shares in this country is not taxed on its business here.  I do not have to stretch my imagination too far in relation to any given factories throughout this country, one fully owned by Irish shareholders, another owned by an American company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> When the White Paper was issued, its purpose was the distribution of wealth.  I believe this was the whole purpose of the White Paper, the distribution of wealth, that the wealth of the country was concentrated in a small number of people.  This Bill, the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax, would distribute the wealth of the country.  This is complete nonsense; it will not distribute any wealth.  It could not distribute wealth because it is only to replace death duties.</P>
      <P>The last figures we have for death duties are exactly £13 million.  If one is to distribute the wealth of the country, the figures available for 1972-73 are £13 million.  This is not true.  There is to be no distribution of wealth in this.  It certainly will affect industry and the expansion and the creation of wealth which is far more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of taxing wealth, in my opinion we should give incentives to people to work well, a different approach.  To tax wealth, to get the movement of wealth into a productive company, that is the thinking behind it.  If the Minister took a more positive approach, gave concessions and encouragement to get wealth moving and into production, it would be a better approach.  I am convinced that <Col N="740" /> taxation is not the solution to expansion. Ask any wage-earner today.  See the return you will get if you give them overtime or give them a bonus of so much a week.  You will find a difference immediately in output in that factory.</P>
    <P>We should adopt a different approach to try to get it operating and get greater production from it. Wealth within the State is the means by which we will generate employment. A negative approach such as this, will make no contribution at all to encouraging these people.  Wealth should be taxed in three ways, I think. It should be taxed when you acquire it, capital acquisition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Wealth should be taxed when you work it, by income tax, corporation profits tax and surtax. Wealth should be taxed when you sell it, by capital gains tax.  Those are the three ways wealth should be taxed.  Those are the three constructive ways of taxing the wealth of the nation, when you acquire it by capital acquisition, when you work it, as it is worked by normal business people &mdash;you get income tax and corporation profits tax&mdash;and when you sell it is a capital gain.  That is the most positive way, I believe, to tax wealth. Taxing wealth in this way, wealth which is generating employment, must be a negative approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progressive countries of Europe have no wealth tax.  As I have mentioned France, Italy, Belgium and the United Kingdom have no wealth tax. Those are countries that have wealth invested in them over the past 100 years.  Money has poured into the United Kingdom for the past 200 years from the colonies.  A number of European countries have mineral wealth developed for 50 or 100 years and they have not opted for a wealth tax.  There is no wealth tax in Australia, Japan or America.  These are countries that would be looking to this country to invest their capital especially America and Japan, who would be looking to <Col N="741" /> Ireland as a jumping off ground to export into the Common Market. They have not opted for a wealth tax. Why should we opt for this sophisticated type of taxation at this early stage, especially when I believe this country still has a future in the Common Market in our industrial sector?  We have done well over the past two or three years in our exports. We should do nothing that would interfere in any way with the lifeblood of this country which is our export trade.  If we interfere with that in any way our country will be much poorer in the long run.</P>
    <P>Like all the other capital taxation Bills there is no provision to deal with inflation written into the Bill at all. There will be a review every three years but there is no guideline laid down with regard to how this is going to be adjusted.  We do not know whether it will be adjusted by 25 per cent, 20 per cent or what it will be adjusted by.  With the present rate of inflation, if there is no adjustment in a short period, one can see the effect that will have on any property worth £80,000 or £100,000 today.  The same principle, of course, was applied in capital gains and indeed in this Bill also.  It is important and the majority of business people are concerned about it.</P>
    <P>Anyone I have spoken to recently was very concerned about the fact that there is no provision at all in regard to inflation.  If inflation continues as we have it today if you are in the £40,000 area that would nearly bring you into the wealth tax area if adjustment is not made in a very short time.  It was unfortunate, indeed, that the Government should have embarked on this road but they have had plenty of time to draw back, especially in regard to this wealth tax. They could see the way the economy was going and that last year's inflation was practically 18 per cent.  All the economists predicted that this year inflation would run at 25 per cent. Whatever means the Government resort to next Thursday to try to combat inflation it must be the sole purpose of the exercise.  If you do not tackle inflation you certainly cannot <Col N="742" /> tackle the unemployment problem because it will eat up the whole economy of the country.  It is doing that today. We all know what inflation is doing. The average wage earner has no sooner got increases than they are eroded with inflation.  It is the same in business and every sector of our community.  Business people today could not keep an adjustment in regard to labour costs because there is an adjustment now every three months.  This has to be with inflation. You could not run a business today trying to adjust unit costs every three months.  But we would go along with that if we thought the Bill had any great significance from a financial point of view.  But it has none.  The Minister and various spokesmen have pointed out that their estimates are £4 million or £5 million.  But consider the cost of administrating this wealth tax.  In 1972-73 there was £13,227,000 collected from death duties and that cost £286,000 to collect.  Under this tax valuations will have to be submitted to the Revenue Commissioners and how they can possibly cope with them or get qualified staff to deal with the valuations I do not know.  Remember the first payment is due in a few months' time.</P>
    <P>I do not know anyone here who could carry out a valuation on his own property the way inflation is going.  What about a man who owns his property for the past 40 years.  He will find it very difficult to get a valuation. Is he to call in a valuer and pay him?  Will the Revenue Commissioners pay for all valuations that start?  If the person brings in an auctioneer or a valuer let the State pay.  I know a lot of business people but I do not think they would be competent to value market value today. I certainly would not be, especially in regard to a property that has been held for the past 40 to 50 years.  These are all complications that will arise when this Bill goes through.</P>
    <P>I have seen predictions that the cost of administering this Bill will be £1½ million or £2 million.  There are going to be terrible problems in regard to valuation.  Who is going to carry them out I do not know.  What guideline <Col N="743" /> will be laid down?  How many years purchase?  At the moment they say it is only going to bring in the same amount of revenue as death duties and death duties were £13 million and cost £286,000 to collect.  If anyone in this House were to tell me that the operation of the capital gains tax and the capital acquisitions tax, which are only supposed to bring in £13 million, can be operated for £286,000, I would not believe him.  Nobody knows.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Revenue Commissioners could at this time give any indication of what additional staff they will need to operate these Bills.  I always had a basic principle in business&mdash;when you are opening a business have your staff there first and then create the business.  At least have an idea of what you require.  We are throwing these three Bills to the Revenue Commissioners who are completely overworked at the moment. We know they are overworked.  Look at the volume of business they have to operate in comparison with five or six years ago.  Go back to ten years ago to consider the position.</P>
    <P>If you start with PAYE and all the other type of taxations, including VAT, and the different complicated type of taxations we have since, you will find that the Revenue Commissioners are overworked.  Now we are sending them three of the most complicated Bills that have ever gone through this House.  There is not any doubt about that.  Anyone who sat in on the discussions on capital gains will know how complicated it is.  Certainly this wealth tax, as regards valuation, is going to create terrible problems.  If a man undervalues his property will the Revenue Commissioners look for accounts to assess valuations?  I believe that profitability is not one of the features of it, but nobody knows exactly what this valuation will be.  Do a lot of people realise they are paying wealth tax at the moment?  Some people think it is going through the Dáil at this time but wealth tax has been in operation for the past few months; it has been payable over the last few months. Many companies that have certain costings, <Col N="744" /> costings as regards fuel, light, heat, wages, rates and various other things, will have to cost all those.  I know the Minister will say companies are not taxed but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The number of inquiries to the IDA has never been at such a low ebb.  If there is not continuous development&mdash;a factory does not start overnight; it takes two years from the time inquiries are made for it to commence production&mdash;the effect on the economy will be disastrous and the country will pay for that in about three years' time.  We will see the effects of this wealth tax on employment in two or three years' time. America, Japan or the United Kingdom will send their research experts to see what labour relations are like, what the political set-up is and what fiscal arrangements can be made and these research experts will find that the fiscal arrangements have changed drastically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has already told the House these investors will not be taxed; they will receive special concessions. Even so, taxation can have a deterimental effect.  The country has attracted investors over the past 20 or 30 years because our industrial development was expanding.  We should continue now to encourage investment and taxing wealth is not the way in which to get full production from the wealth of the country.  There is a certain amount of dormant wealth in the country.  Perhaps it would be better if a different approach were taken and people were encouraged <Col N="745" /> to use the wealth in a productive manner.</P>
    <P>Our sentiments are the same as those expressed by other speakers.  If we thought this measure would create new jobs or reduce inflation in any way we would not oppose it.  We know, however, that it has undermined confidence and stopped the inflow of capital. It has been a major factor in the lack of industrial expansion.  These factors, combined with others, have helped to create the chaos in which we now find ourselves, with 103,000 unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened here this evening to the Minister giving the House a lecture on why he thought we should not speak against this proposal. He implied that we were being forced. I want to say to the Minister that nobody is forced to speak on any Bill. Anybody who reckons he has an adequate amount of common sense left is making an effort here to point out to the Minister and the Government the lack of leadership the country is experiencing on the economic front.</P>
      <P>The Wealth Tax Bill was introduced for one reason only: it first saw the light of day as part of an overall taxation package designed allegedly to do great things for the country.  I would describe that particular document as the milestone in the downturn of the economy.  The consequences of the introduction of that package have been catastrophic for the people. I know the Minister has no part in this legislation; he knows he is being pushed into a situation by a group of people who consider this measure popular.  It will sound good on the media; it is a tax on wealth.  It is a tax to redistribute wealth.  The Minister knows as well as I do the effect this Bill is having is not to redistribute wealth but to create poverty; it is throwing out of employment people who were working securely a little over two years ago.  This is why Fianna Fáil are opposed to this Bill.  I am not opposed to it because it will have any personal effect on me&mdash;far from it. I am opposed to it because of the disastrous consequences emanating from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="746" /> I compliment Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick&mdash;that is the sensible Deputy Fitzpatrick of course&mdash;on his excellent contribution to the debate, one worth listening to and, despite what the Minister said this afternoon, if more attention were paid by those in Government to contributions such as Deputy Fitzpatrick's our economy might not be in its present condition. It might not need the package it is being promised for Thursday week, the package which should have been delivered many months ago.  With the package, of course, there will be a budget.</P>
    <P>This particular legislation sounds popular.  It could be regarded as some kind of socialistic ideology.  I do not know what that means; neither am I greatly concerned nor are the people concerned.  What the people are concerned about is how much money they will be able to take home, how much they will have at the end of the week, how secure are their jobs.  They are concerned to know how many jobs will be created for their sons and daughters.  The lack of leadership and the mismanagement have caused the confidence of the people to sink to depths unknown since the middle 'Fifties.  It is not because something is popular that it should be adopted by a Government.  A Government should only introduce a measure if they believe it is for the good of the community.  A Government has another responsibility.  Not only do we not have a combined and united Government but we have a Government completely lacking in unity.  A Government is also charged with the responsibility that when introducing a measure, they time its introduction so that it would give greatest benefit to the Exchequer and also to the economy.</P>
    <P>If we look at the Exchequer side, we are given an estimate of what it might realise.  At this stage I am not sure to what the estimate we have been given refers.  Does it refer to the modified Bill that was introduced or to the modified Bill with all the amendments?  I do not think any Minister or even the Minister for Finance knows.  Nobody knows.  That <Col N="747" /> is why I say it is all bluff, propaganda, and is of no economic benefit to our people.</P>
    <P>We have 102,500 people unemployed at the present time.  In this month, we have 35,000 school-leavers who will be coming on the employment market.  That will bring our unemployment figure at the end of June somewhere in the region of 140,000 people.  What should the Government be doing, instead of playing around with this legislation which does no good for anybody? They should be looking at the priority problems facing them.  Because of the disastrous management of the present regime, the oil and gas off our shores are looked on by these people as the life-buoy to save our economy.  If the present Ministers are not prepared to face up to their responsibilities, let them resign before they bring the economy to disaster.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been critical of this side of the House, just as his colleagues have been for almost two-and-a-half years now.  It will be interesting to note how many of the suggestions proposed by us, by our leader and by Deputy Colley, will be included in next week's package. These suggestions were not made yesterday but at a time when they could have been implemented with far greater benefit for our people and our country.  This is a miserable performance by a Government.  It compares with what happened in the past. Fine Gael leadership in the past laughed and scoffed at there being any hope of industrial development within our community.  When I talk about industrial development I am not concerned about creating wealth for the industrialists.  I am concerned about providing jobs and making sure that our people get good employment, plenty of employment and plenty of opportunity within our own community.  The lack of confidence at the moment has to be seen to be believed.  It is going through every constituency in the country.</P>
    <P>There are a few people preaching about the popular measures to redistribute wealth.  I would love to see <Col N="748" /> wealth redistributed, I am in favour of it, if there is such a thing as idle wealth.  I believe that there is.  The type of wealth I do not want to see redistributed is the type being used for the good of our people in this economy.  If this wealth tax legislation is the cause of losing jobs, then this Government are making a bad mistake. They are setting us back decades. Not years but decades.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that he has heard all this before but it cannot be repeated often enough.  I am a socialist. I believe in the right of everybody to equal opportunity.  If one of our people suceeds better than another person, then more luck to him.  If by succeeding he is able in return to employ those of us who have not done quite so well, or who will be able to give employment to our children, then we should look at his situation and see is he, as a shareholder in a company, in a position to pay assets without consequential disastrous results on the company giving the employment? If he is, by all means impose taxation, but if he is not let us, as a State, assist him.</P>
    <P>Industrially, we could be regarded as a very young nation.  This country owes much to the foresight of people like Eamon de Valera, Seán Lemass and our present leader Jack Lynch, men who realised the importance of creating opportunity, providing industry, getting people to invest their money and their wealth for the benefit of the people. Most of our industries are very young. We are probably from a nation's point of view, less developed industrially than most other European countries.  This is understandable because of our history.  Only a few of our industries date back any considerable time.  The textile industry, in particular, is in ruins because of inaction by the present Government. This industry gave high employment in many rural areas.  It had a peculiar structure because most of our textile mills were built around little towns and villages.  They became the life blood of those areas.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, nobody in the Government has made an adequate case to impose the necessary restrictions to <Col N="749" /> stop the cheap cost imports that have, together with all these measures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I anticipated that I would be told that.  I believe this to be relevant, despite what Members on the other side of the House may think, that the industrial development of our country is affected by section 2 of this Bill, and I defy anybody to say otherwise.  I was referring to the textile industry which is affected in a number of ways.  Here are people, many of them with family involvements, whose confidence will be undermined by the introduction of this legislation as part of a package.  Textiles, in particular, have dropped in employment content considerably.  The number of redundancies in the textile industry in recent times is very significant.  For example, in my own constituency two textile firms are closing down next month.  It is disastrous that in places like Douglas and Blarney, whose economic life is dependent on the textile industry, mills which have been established for the past couple of hundred years are closing down.  I refer to the textile industry because it is one of the few old ones we have left.  Generally our industry is much newer than that and dates back only ten, 20, 30 or 40 years. That is a very short life.</P>
      <P>We can look at our building and construction industry which developed so much in the late 1950s and from then on right up to 1973.  It has hit a pretty bad spell.  There is no confidence there.  It is also in decline at present. Suppliers and providers are feeling the pinch.  This must be of grave concern to the people involved.  I am mainly concerned with the number of people in good employment, employment that generated better earning capacity and earning power than any other industry for a decade or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid this legislation will cause greater job losses.  We have an estimated 140,000 unemployed.  If we add the school-leavers, what can we anticipate that figure will be in October or November of this year? I do not want to be gloomy.  I would <Col N="750" /> love to be more optimistic but I cannot. Through lack of decision this government have allowed this situation to develop.  They have allowed it to develop because they even began to believe themselves that it arose because of outside influences and that some miracle would happen and they would be liberated and they would be back to the good days when Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    <P>Now at last they have begun to realise that things will not improve unless effective measures are taken. Because of inflationary trends, because of inflationary measures taken, despite the cautions and warnings given by the Opposition, the situation was allowed to deteriorate.  We have been promised this package next week.  I hope the approach of the Government will be a realistic one.  I hope they will endeavour to regenerate some confidence in our economy so that jobs will be created.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  I hope it will stimulate employment.  I am not convinced that the income from this taxation will be big enough to justify its introduction and do no harm to the economy.  There might be a time when this could be done.  I do not think this is the time when such a measure should be introduced.</P>
      <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce talk about a mixed economy.  At least he is one convert to our beliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mixed economy he speaks about now is something we have always believed in.  Only yesterday he pointed out to us the necessity for using capital from other sources to achieve the best we could hope for as a nation, in other words, to utilise that capital to the maximum national benefit.  This is the way I would look on the utilisation of capital in industry.  Whether we play on words about the assets of shareholders and the assets of a company, this charge is payable whether or not profit is being made.  We already have the staggering figure of about 127 <Col N="751" /> companies gone into liquidation in the first part of this year.</P>
    <P>I want to re-emphasise that my primary interest here is not in those companies but in the people who are employed in them and who are now on social welfare payments.  If these measures undermine the confidence of the people who help to keep the wheels of industry rolling then it is bad management by the Government and bad timing in its introduction.  I call for Government assistance for some of the ailing industries.  The textile industry badly needs help.  I am concerned about the plight of the people who are seeking employment and particularly at the lack of opportunities being created for our young people.  This is and always will be my prime concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to repeat what I stated on the first occasion. A fair and equitable tax system is something that every Member of the House would support.  Confusion has been created by the statements of various Ministers who do not seem to be at one on what this Bill really means.  The Minister for Lands has one interpretation, the Minister for Finance another and the Minister for Defence still another interpretation.  I have stated these various interpretations.  I think the Minister for Defence was the first to say it was civil service jargon and that people need not be disturbed and need not be afraid.  It is very important that when a Bill is presented to the House we understand exactly what it means and that there should be a collective view within the Government on the issue before the House. The Minister can well understand the great difficulties there are when a Bill is not presented to the House by a united Government, by Ministers who are at one in their interpretation of the legislation before the House, and <Col N="752" /> when, as I have stated, various Ministers have given a variety of interpretations.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;wealth tax&rdquo; may well appeal to a certain section but this is just a tag on the Bill.  As the song says: &ldquo;It is not the label on the pot of jam that counts; it is the tasty little bit inside.&rdquo;  So we have to examine the Bill on a much broader basis, if the tag is meant to convince people that a genuine effort is being made when in fact there is nothing in it.  When one reads the debate that took place last Thursday, one must see the difference in the interpretation of what this Bill really means.  We have heard about the package that will be presented in the future.  Is that package as a result of this Bill.  Will it be assisted by the Bill?  One wonders now who is the father of this package, because it is a package that had a two-year pregnancy and taking that period into account we must expect to have a bouncing little baby here next Thursday week.  But we would like to know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We have been discussing this measure now, this particular section for 17 hours The principle of the tax has already been established on the Second Stage of this Bill.  We are now in Committee Stage but we have done absolutely no committee work for 17 hours.  I consider that the time of the House is being grossly wasted and I propose that the question be now put.  I am proposing that the question: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill&rdquo; be now put.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 is the charge of wealth tax and this percolates right through to each and every industry and one can well realise the difficulties under which speakers labour when arguments are vaguely presented. The Minister presented arguments here last week in a vague sort of way and I suppose I will be permitted to comment upon the references made in the course of the last week by the Minister. I was dealing with those vague statements when I reported progress on a previous occasion.  Vague statements, just as this one about 15 or 17 hours have been made.  Since when is legislation measured in minutes? Surely the airing of the problems and the views of the Members of this House are too important to allow any particular section or any piece of legislation to be limited by a time factor. Far too often this House has been forced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to terminate discussion and to agree to legislation not adequately discussed by the House. More shame on the Government who permit this type of development.  Possibly in the course of the next week or so we will see legislation that will not be discussed here being passed without comment because of the present situation. Notwithstanding the fact that many people would like to discuss in <Col N="754" /> great depth and detail some of the very important problems&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to measure a section in terms of hours and minutes then I am afraid the legislation that will be put through this House in the future will not get the time it deserves if the Government consider that the Opposition are making a good case.  The people will decide at a later stage whether the case made by the Government or by the Opposition is valid.  Taking everything into consideration that we have heard from the Minister, and other Members who have backed him up&mdash;few as they are&mdash;we are utterly confused by the entire Bill, notwithstanding that section 2 is possibly the most important section in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's reference now to the 17 hours really has no bearing on section 2.  The Minister on the last occasion gave us a geography lesson when he named a variety of countries that had a wealth tax, for what reason I was unable to ascertain.  I did read the statement made by the Minister; unfortunately, it is not yet in booklet form; it is well worth purchasing as an example of a meaningless statement just like some of the statistics that have been presented here today and on previous occasions.  I do not know what the Minister meant to imply when he referred to the nations that had a wealth tax, whether he meant to imply that they are superior in some way, that the wealth tax was the end of all their problems or whether the wealth tax was a solution to the grave crisis that confronts us at the moment and to our unemployment situation, I pointed out previously that the first country mentioned, Denmark, had a very substantial increase in unemployment and, in fact, had the worst record in Europe in relation to unemployment. They had wealth tax from about 1910 and the percentage increase in unemployment between 1974 and 1975 was 236 per cent, the highest in Europe, if not the highest in the world.  Another nation had 88 per <Col N="755" /> cent of an increase between 1974 and 1975, Germany, one of the countries quoted by the Minister.  Indeed there were other quotations given.  One wonders how valid the arguments are that have been put forward by the Minister and by the other speakers here.</P>
    <P>Again I would like to ask the Minister if, when he states that a country has wealth tax legislation, is it identical to ours?  There is no response from the Minister but it is only on the basis of like for like that we can examine the situation in relation to wealth tax.  Apart from the wealth tax, there is a variety of other taxes in operation in this country.  One wonders if the Minister took into consideration the number and types of taxes that are applied here as against the number and types of taxes applied in other countries before presenting statistics which were meaningless, as meaningless as the presentation here today of some of the other statistics.</P>
    <P>What we really want is the creation of confidence in this country, an air of confidence so that we can put the people back to work.  If we get the people back to work, there will be much more revenue for the Exchequer, if that is what they require, because people will have a greater spending capacity.  We hear so much about the secret plan and the pregnant packages that are to be presented.  One wonders what is in the packages.</P>

Many of these industries have been abused; industrialists have been abused.  This is nothing new to the Government or the Coalition Government that went before them.  They left behind a trail of disaster, a trail of national and industrial sabotage just as they are leaving on <Col N="758" /> this occasion.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2 (c):</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), line 29, after &ldquo;date&rdquo; to add &ldquo;excluding property consisting of shares or stock in a company to which the Industrial Development Authority has, prior to the 5th day of April, 1975, paid, or agreed in writing to pay, all or part of a new industry grant&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that wealth tax will not be applied to property consisting of shares or stock in a company to which the Industrial Development Authority have, prior to the 5th of April of this year paid, or agreed in writing to pay, all or part of a new industry grant.  The reason for this amendment is, I am sure clear on its face.  This country has, over a long number of years, succeeded in providing a great deal of employment for our people here at home, as a result of the policy which has been <Col N="764" /> pursued in relation to the Industrial Development Authority and the inducements they were able to offer to foreign investors to invest in this country.</P>
    <P>One of the very potent weapons in the armoury of the IDA in carrying out this vital national work has been the ability to sell, with credibility, the idea that investors from abroad who invested in this country could rest assured that no move would be made by whatever Government were in office to apply additional taxes after we had got them into the country.  Indeed, specific assurances were given to foreign investors in industry in this country to the effect that their profits derived from exports would be free of tax and that no hindrance of any kind would be placed in the way of the repatriation of their profits or, indeed, of their investments.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that many people, including in particular members of the Government, do not understand&mdash;or else do not care; but probably they do not understand&mdash;just how vitally important it has been in dealing with potential foreign investors, not alone to be able to give this assurance, but to be able to point to the record of the Irish Government over the years, a record which shows unequivocally that, if a deal was made with an Irish Government, that deal was sacrosanct, and there was no question of going back on it.  This was very important because there are many other countries with which we are competing for investment where the same could not be said with truth.  There are a number of other countries where people were induced to invest from abroad, and the investment having been got in, the Governments of those countries then either, in extreme cases, confiscated the investment or, in less extreme cases, started to apply taxation to those investments in such a way that, if that taxation had been in existence originally, the investment would not have taken place at all.</P>
    <P>I know from my personal experience, from contacts I have had with owners of investment in industry in this country, owners from abroad, the reaction there had been to what this Government <Col N="765" /> propose to do in relation to capital taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Members were not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Members being present,</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vitally important that the reputation which this country has built up in the field of the attraction of investment from abroad in industrial development here should be maintained.  I know from my personal experience of involvement in this work, and also from the contacts I have had in recent times with some people from abroad who have investments in this country in the industrial field, that there is very considerable apprehension and concern at the effects of the Government's capital taxation proposals.  This covers aspects other than what is contained in this Bill, but specifically there is concern at the effect of the proposals in this Bill and in this section</P>
      <P>Grants, in some cases, very substantial grants, have been given to industries which were set up in this country.  It does not make a great deal of sense to be giving grants on one hand and then applying wealth tax to the assets so produced on the other. This amendment is specifically designed to ensure that whatever may happen in regard to IDA activity after 5th April this year at least in relation to grants given by the IDA prior to 5th April or promised in writing prior to 5th April&mdash;and promised in writing effectively means approved with an agreement between the IDA and the promoters of the project&mdash;wealth tax will not be levied on such assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that something can be salvaged if this amendment or another &mdash;if the Minister does not like the drafting of this&mdash;prepared by the parliamentary draftsman achieving the same thing is accepted.  I am not particularly fussy about the wording but I am very concerned about the sense.  I believe that something can be salvaged if an amendment to this effect is written into the Bill.  If that is done the IDA will when dealing with potential investors abroad be able to point clearly to the fact that this House took care to ensure that <Col N="766" /> there was no semblance of a suggestion that the Irish Government had gone back on undertakings given. Whatever may be the position after 5th April this year&mdash;and that is a matter which one could with advantage perhaps to the country and the provision of jobs in the country discuss but it might not be relevant on this amendment&mdash;at least in relation to people who got grants under certain assurances or who have completed negotiations with the IDA on the basis of certain assurances, in those cases if the IDA representatives can point out that care was taken to ensure that no such person had the assurance which was given to him withdrawn or gone back on in any way, I think something can be salvaged from the damage being done by this and other capital taxation proposals of the Government.  I have been very concerned in relation to a similar point brought up on another Bill at the attitude of the Minister for Finance.  He seemed to me to be either not knowing or not caring about the vital importance of this matter.  A reputation such as was built up over the years by Irish Governments and by the IDA acting on behalf of Irish Governments is not something that one comes by easily. It is achieved only by years of hard work and by demonstrating that a deal made with an Irish Government is a deal kept.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that</i> 20 <i>Members were not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Members being present,</i></P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that the kind of reputation that was built up over the years by the Irish Government and by the IDA, acting on behalf of the Irish Government, is a reputation which, by definition can only be built up over a long number of years.  It is a reputation of being reliable people to do business with, a reputation of being people who stick to a deal made and such a reputation, which is invaluable to us, can be lost overnight. I would suggest that no theoretical gain which the Minister or his colleagues might think was involved in not accepting the principle of this amendment could possibly compare in <Col N="767" /> importance from the point of view of the long-term national interest with the maintenance of that reputation.</P>
      <P>I believe that acceptance of this amendment or the sense of this amendment will do something to salvage that reputation, whereas non-acceptance of it will overnight cost this country the loss of that reputation.  I would like the Minister to ponder that seriously and to realise that if what I am saying is correct&mdash;and I believe it to be correct; I have evidence to show that it is correct&mdash;the effect does not apply merely to those people who have already invested in Ireland but it will apply to many potential investors in Ireland.  It should be known to the Minister that potential investors in this country, having been contacted by the IDA and been given all the details, having come along and viewed sites here and gone a long way to making a final decision, almost invariably as the next step and before making a final decision, consult with people who have invested here, who have factories here, to find out what it is like on the ground, what it is like dealing with Irish people when they are working for you and in particular what it is like when you are actually operating here and dealing with the Government of the day, and do the IDA perform as they claim to do what may be called after sales service.</P>
      <P>They do in fact, but the only way that you will get potential investors to accept this is by having them talk to people who are operating here and who have experienced it and know exactly what is happening and who independently and without prompting or any reason why they should say so if it were not true, will volunteer the information as to what happens when you do invest in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I strongly urge the Minister to consider very carefully, if he proposes not to accept this amendment, the consequences, because as surely as I am standing here, one of the consequences of that will be that people who have invested in this country, will, when consulted, as they invariably are by potential investors, <Col N="768" /> will say&mdash;whether it is true or not, they believe it, if the Minister wants to argue it&mdash;&ldquo;We got a promise when we came in here and the Government introduced a Bill which was in breach of that promise and when it was pointed out to them they refused to mend their hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that will not be the position. When I say that the Minister might be refusing the sense of the amendment, I hope I am wrong in that, but I want him to know that if that is his intention, that is going to be one of the very serious consequences of his doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Subsection 2 of section 3 provides that a person who is not domiciled and ordinarily resident here shall only be liable for wealth tax in respect of his property situate here.  The sense of Deputy Colley's amendment is to exclude from that property shares in certain companies which were grantaided by the IDA up to 5th April of this year.</P>
      <P>In passing, as an aside, let me point out that the Deputy's party spokesmen on this Bill appeared to be blowing hot and cold at the same time, because earlier we had many complaints that some sort of preferential treatment was to be accorded to foreigners as against Irish people.  That arose out of my pointing out in the early stages of this debate that foreign trading companies were exempt.  The Opposition, on realising that, and I think only realising it when on their feet, switched their case and started to argue that thus foreign trading companies were getting fairer treatment <i>vis-á-vis</i> Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now they are back in as soon as we have got off section 2 to claim that sort of treatment for foreigners.  Again, I am happy to be in the position to say to the House and to the country, notwithstanding the fact that this amendment is not acceptable and I do not propose to accept it, that the position of foreign investors as a result of this section and this Bill has not been worsened but, instead, has been improved, and I hope to show that in the <Col N="769" /> remarks that I want to make on this amendment.</P>
    <P>I want to say, and I think Deputy Colley knows this perfectly well from his experience as Minister for Finance and otherwise, that the vast bulk of the business done by the IDA with residents of other countries is not done with individuals but is with trading corporations all over the world and I think that at last I have convinced Deputy Colley and the other speakers that foreign trading companies are not taxed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I think if Deputy Colley was not surprised, some of his colleagues were surprised.  At any rate, as I have said, the IDA does the vast bulk of its business, not with foreign individuals or non-resident individuals, but with foreign trading companies who establish subsidaries here and own shares in those trading companies here and they are not liable.  Therefore, in so far as the vast bulk of foreign investors here are concerned, they are no problem.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with the individuals who, I must confess, might be affected, if they invest money as individuals in Irish companies, the ones mentioned by Deputy Colley.  I must tell the House that thresholds are available for these foreign individual investors and that the tax does not become payable until the taxable income of the investor, be he foreign or Irish, amounts to £70,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Yes, taxable assets of the taxpayer, whether he is foreign or a native.  The taxable assets must amount to £70,000 if he is single, or to £100,000, if he is married.  That is a privilege that does not apply in other countries, as far as I can ascertain, where wealth tax operates.  There are no thresholds for non-residents, people who are not domiciled and who are not resident. We are writing into this code a substantial privilege for foreign investors in so far as that for purposes of the thresholds we are treating the foreign <Col N="770" /> investors just the same as the native investors.</P>
      <P>Tax does not come into operation here for the married man unless his taxable assets amount to £100,000.  Up to the end of March last, that individual would be subject to death duties here if he died, at the rate of 41 per cent.  Therefore, if a person here with the minimum amount of capital necessary to attract wealth tax dies, he would be relieved by this Government and by the State of £41,000.  We are imposing an annual tax on that man of something less than 1 per cent, about .8 per cent, about £800 in a £100,000. I should like to put it to the House and to the country that that man's position has improved considerably.  I repeat that the vast majority of investors here will not be concerned with this because they will be shareholders in German companies, American corporations, Dutch or United Kingdom trading companies who will own companies here.  I hope it is clear now that the position has improved. Furthermore, we have gone further and we have given the shares the benefit of the 20 per cent productive asset relief given to the shareholders of the funds just as it is given to the Irishman.</P>
      <P>It could be argued that, if this favourable treatment were to be given to foreign individual investors, it should also be given in respect of companies established here by them which had not received the benefit of grants from the Industrial Development Authority. They would seem to have a better claim to it than others.  I hope I have convinced the House that there is no fear in this for foreign investors, none at all, in so far as that foreign investor is a foreign trading corporation.  In so far as the individual investor from abroad is concerned, his position is improved because, up to March last we relieved him of £41,000 at the minimum of his liability and, in lieu of that, we are now imposing a wealth tax of about 0.8 per cent.  It will take something well over 41 years for him to suffer as much as if a death occurred. This is the substitution of one capital tax for another.</P>

They are doing what they say the Bill will do; they are damaging the chances of this country in attracting foreign investment by misrepresenting the position.  The Opposition at the present time is composed of some Deputies who held ministerial office for many years.  Because of that they wield considerable influence abroad through contacts they have made and there is a heavier obligation on them not to misrepresent this measure abroad, either directly or indirectly, vocally or tacitly.  I do not want to come back to Deputy Colley's letters but in the letter Deputy Colley put on the record of the House it was clear that the writer was talking about foreign corporations.</P>

We know that the company in question changed its mind for other reasons.  We know that the company in question before it changed its mind, <Col N="772" /> went to the trouble, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, of checking on the position in regard to this Bill and was assured that it was not affected.</P>

      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister enjoys, perhaps, having a certain amount of fun with the Opposition.  My recollection of the debate last week was that, on the morning following the discussion about the meaning of subsection (2), I said the Minister was quoted in the press as saying that companies and investors abroad would not be taxed, and that I did not think this was correct. The Minister has just said there will be no thresholds for foreign investment.</P>

      <P>In that case the Opposition are not going to misunderstand that point because it is perfectly obvious on any reading of subsection (2) that the assets of any person living abroad situated in this State would be taxable if they came above the threshold.  I do not think the Minister's criticism of Deputy Colley is quite fair.  The letter Deputy Colley read was the reaction of an individual living in the United States to the package deal of tax laws being introduced here.  That is my recollection of the impression being created on a foreign resident.</P>
      <P>The Minister, of course, can easily argue that the level of wealth tax would hardly be likely to influence any potential foreign investor.  The question of the impression created on people is a fairly important one if one takes the general impression on reading the White Paper and the three new tax Bills going through the Oireachtas here together.  It has generated a feeling amongst people, and the letter Deputy Colley read confirms this, that if you invest in Ireland you will get stung.  I agree with the Minister's remarks in relation to the removal of death duties. This removes a burden from people&mdash; not its replacement by this Bill, but its replacement by the inheritance tax Bill which is a more significant one.  I concede it does give an advantage to the owner of property with quite a high threshold.</P>

      <P>I am struck by the Minister's continuous reiteration that no company will be taxed.  It could give the impression that there are no taxes on companies.  However, we all know that this particular Bill applies to tax on individuals and not on corporations or companies here or overseas. The amendment being put forward by Deputy Colley is a reasonable amendment.  It is quite a narrow one; it applies only to a particular category of companies, of the share-holding in companies, which had an agreement prior to the 5th of April to secure a grant from the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the basic argument in favour of this amendment is that it is not really realistic to apply capital tax to shareholders in any company in need of a grant of this nature in order to get it on the road.  It seems to me that it highlights the illogicality of taxing a company, on the one hand, and spending pretty substantial amounts of taxpayers' money, on the other, looking for investment.  The Industrial Development Authority is a pretty substantial corporation costing a great deal of money.  It would look as if the Minister for Finance here is moving in one direction, taxing a company which is getting a grant from the Industrial Development Authority, while the Minister for Industry and Commerce is moving in another direction supporting such a company through the Industrial Development Authority, to get it going.  The whole aim and purpose of the policy of all Irish Governments until recently had been to encourage enterprise.  We have said before that the effect of taxes like this tends to discourage.  In the case of companies which Deputy Colley's amendment intends to include, many of the people who have invested in companies of this kind have been encouraged to do so, to support <Col N="775" /> development and progress here and also in their own interest.  They have also been encouraged&mdash;and I take it that the date Deputy Colley selected, the 5th of April, 1975, is the date on which one could reasonably be expected to know that a tax like this was going to be introduced&mdash;to invest in development and enterprise of this kind in the belief that they would not be taxed.  I am speaking now of companies which have been given certain tax incentives.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the purpose of the amendment is to relieve investments in companies of this kind up to April, 1975.  I believe that the correct policy at the present level in our economy is to encourage investment as much as possible.</P>

      <P>Let us suppose that Deputy Esmonde is right.  This State has given tax free concessions on exports to many companies for limited periods.  There is a special protocol with the EEC to enable that to be continued, up to 1980 or thereabouts. If the Industrial Development Authority has encouraged people to invest to support development and provide jobs, I do not see any breach.  But this type of investment would not be taxable in the same way as other investments. I do not see it going on forever in the way Deputy Esmonde suggests, because this type of tax relates not to the company but to the investment.  In that sense, I do not see it going on indefinitely because it would cease if the investor disposed of his interest. <Col N="776" /> That is how I would read it anyway. In that sense, it is a reasonable amendment to give some relief to investors of this category.  For that reason, I support it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I should like to support this amendment also.  When we look at the contents and the substance of this amendment, we find that it is taking into consideration contracts entered into&mdash;and this is the important thing&mdash; by men in industry who came to this country and looked at the package available from the IDA.  Whether we like it or not, the point is that previous Governments gave this undertaking. Nobody in this House, in my opinion, can criticise the workings of the IDA since it was established.  We must give credit and thanks for the economic expansion of this country to the efforts of the IDA, in America and in European countries.  We undertook to exempt their profits from income tax for a certain number of years.  That obtains today.  We undertook to give their profits free movement in and out of the country.  That too still obtains today.  Having researched the whole tax formula, they knew exactly where they stood.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> What I am concerned about is losing confidence.  Companies who entered into an agreement with the IDA and the previous Government took the financial structure and fiscal policies into consideration and undertook to establish industries here. Deputy Colley in this amendment is asking that contracts entered into up to the 5th April should be exempt from wealth tax, no more and no less. We, on this side of the House believe that once you make a contract you should keep it.</P>
      <P>We are imposing a wealth tax on people who might not have come here if this Bill had been on the Statute Book.  If they, after the 5th April, having read the capital taxation come to the IDA and are prepared from now on to enter into contracts and establish industries here I would say &ldquo;So be it.  You will see the tax before you.  That is what you will have to pay&mdash;capital gains, wealth tax, capital acquisition.  You know the income tax code.  You know how it stands today.&rdquo; They can go back and research their Bills.  They can take their investment into consideration and if they decide to come there and then that is all right.  They cannot say we misled them.  We showed them exactly what our taxation system was.</P>
      <P>But the people we are talking about in this amendment were not aware of this legislation when they committed themselves to establish industries here.  We gave them an undertaking about income tax.  We gave them an undertaking about movement of their capital in and out of the country should they be disposed to do so.  That part of the bargain still holds.  I sincerely hope we do not go back on that.  We object to the fact that this Bill is brought in now and these shareholders can justifiably say that the contract they entered into, be it five years ago or 15 years ago, has been breached by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> What Deputy Colley is looking for here is not of very great significance. It will not make a lot of difference to the Bill.  If we go by the Minister, three-quarters of them will be exempt already.  The Minister gave a list this evening and practically exempted 95 per cent of the people here, if not more.  If that is the case, why are we having this Bill?</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central)</i> It is so detailed that we will get the Minister an unrevised script of the day's proceedings.  I am not questioning the Minister's integrity in regard to that aspect.  Even if the Minister is correct, and I am not sure that all of what the Minister said is accurate, it proves what I said earlier in the day, that we are directing this wealth tax at a small group of people.  It is directed at people in the productive end of industry, people who are generating employment.</P>
      <P>The Minister said they will be exempt, that it is only the shareholders who will be caught.  We know perfectly well that in many companies, the managing director might own 51 per cent of the shares.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  What is bad about the Bill is the philosophy behind it, the fact of having to pay tax yearly.  People have spoken about death duties.  They will speak about the capital acquisitions tax.  This is an annual charge on the business.  Anybody who is running a business today, if he is employing one man or 100 men, if he is over the threshold of £250,000 to £300,000, must take this into his costings.  He must include it as part of his costings.</P>

      <P>The Deputy, like all good Deputies, tries to be relevant to the subject matter before him, despite the minor little distractions he is receiving from the floor.  This is one of the few countries with an attraction for profits earned from exports introduced by the late Deputy Sweetman.  This is now acknowledged by everybody.  This was the measure that got Irish industry on its feet and we are now all reaping the benefit of that.  This debate is now getting to the stage where Deputies on the other side of the House are objecting to taking the little hundreds and thousands off the Christmas cake.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when a decision will be made regarding unemployment benefit for a person in County Meath (name supplied) who has 84 social welfare contributions over the past three years and who applied for benefit in January, 1975; and the reason for the delay in dealing with this matter.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware from a previous reply the person concerned received a decision disallowing his claim in February last on the ground that he then had less than 78 contributions paid in respect of him in a relevant three-year period.  He subsequently reported to the local officer that he had other employment with two employers in 1974 for which contributions had not been paid and as a result of action by the local officer contributions were received from both employers on 5th March, 1975. However, the arrears stamping presented certain features which necessitated inquiries to establish whether these contributions were paid in respect of employment which was insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  On the basis of the information obtained to date eight of the contributions <Col N="672" /> have been accepted as properly paid on 5th March, 1975, and the claim to unemployment benefit has been admitted from that date.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for payment of all benefit due in the course of the present week.  Inquiries regarding the validity of the remaining contributions are still continuing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>As was indicated in a previous reply, the entitlement to benefit of the person concerned on his claim for unemployment benefit of 23rd January, 1975, depended, among other things, on the question whether certain contributions paid in respect of him during the 1973 insurance year were paid in respect of employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Inquiries have been completed and a deciding officer has decided that those contributions have been so paid.  The claimant is, therefore, entitled to unemployment benefit on his claim and all benefit due will be paid during the current week.</P>

His entitlement to pay-related benefit then ceased as following the general increases in the rates of benefit the weekly rate of his flat rate benefit exceeded his reckonable weekly earnings.</P>
