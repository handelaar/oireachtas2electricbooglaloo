      <P>Before we proceed with the Bill, I want to make a protest <Col N="170" /> not in relation to the Minister for Labour but in relation to the Minister for Education.  I sought some information this morning from civil servants in the Department of Education relative to the discussion which will take place on this Bill and I was told by the civil servants that all information must go through the Minister's office.  All I wanted was simple statistical information.  Now I have no intention of crawling to this supercilious crawthumping snob for simple statistical information.  I have as much right as anybody else to ask for information and, when such information is required, I think I should get it freely from the Department.  I must say in relation to the Minister for Labour that he did indicate to me that I could get any information I required from him or from any officer of his Department authorised to give such information, without reference to the Minister.  In the case of the Department of Education I could not get the simple statistical information I required for the purpose of the discussion here this morning.  Apparently one has to crawl to the Minister's office to get such information. This is an intolerable situation and one that needs to be remedied.</P>

      <P>The information we were looking for is information we require in dealing with this measure and, since we have not been able to obtain the simple statistical information we require from the Department of Education, we may not be absolutely accurate in dealing with the Bill.

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 1 now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with section 1.  There are quite a number of factors involved and there is one particular matter I want to bring to the attention of the House.  The ministerial amendments appeared on Monday. We got them on Monday.  In examining legislation like this it is essential that we should be in a position to examine it in depth and in detail because ministerial amendments can make fundamental changes.  In a Bill of this nature we should have the amendments at least seven days before the Bill is debated here to enable us to examine any fundamental changes as a result of ministerial amendments. We are in the unfortunate position that the Minister has the power to pilot this measure through with the majority on those benches irrespective of what amendments we table. Amendments should come to us in a reasonable time to give us a reasonable opportunity of assessing them in depth in order to perfect the legislation. Because of the present situation we will now have to go through the Bill line by line so that we will be able to table amendments for the report stage.  This is a most unsatisfactory procedure because a Member may speak only once on the Report Stage.  There can be no prolonged argument and we are therefore at a disadvantage.  It may be that this was the procedure in the past with other Governments but, if it was, it was an unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that in order to examine in depth Bills of this nature it is necessary that we should have the amendments for a reasonable period so that we may examine them to ensure there are no fundamental changes being made.  If there are changes any amendments <Col N="173" /> we might have submitted would be of no value, and in some cases they could look silly.</P>
    <P>I should like the Chair to give me some guidance on the following point. If we want to raise a question on Report Stage must we discuss the matter now line by line or is it sufficient to say we may have further amendments to section 1 on Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that applies to all sections of the Bill?  We do not want to discuss it line by line because we do not think it is necessary.  However, in the event of amendments being put down on Report Stage, we are anxious to ensure that they will not be ruled out of order on the grounds that they were not discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should tell the Deputy that amendments for Report Stage must have arisen out of Committee Stage.  The Deputy must have adverted to the matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, the only way we can deal with this matter is to discuss the Bill line by line.  That is unsatisfactory and it will take a considerable time to discuss the clauses relating to &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;, &ldquo;child&rdquo;, &ldquo;collective agreement&rdquo; and the other matters.  It is necessary to give Deputy Fitzgerald an opportunity to analyse the situation and we would be glad to have an assurance if we raise a matter in a general way that the Chair will be lenient when it comes to Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy understands, the Chair is governed by precedent on this matter. Amendments on Report Stage must arise out of Committee proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that if the Deputy opposite raises in a general way sentiments relating to a particular section that would be the basis on which to come back to the matter on Report Stage?  Is that too wide a reading?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has said, &ldquo;if the Deputy indicates on each section what he wishes to have done&rdquo;. If that is carried to its logical conclusion, I take it the Chair is saying, &ldquo;if the Deputy gives an amendment or a loosely worded amendment&rdquo;? Surely it should be enough to say that we question a certain point and then come in with an amendment on Report Stage?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be very welcome.  We were wondering what had happened to all the legislation that was promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the inspector, we may have an amendment on this matter on section 1 during Report Stage.  Section 1 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;representatives of employees&rdquo; means such trade unions as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of the employees in relation to whom the expression is used, or where there is no such trade union, such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider parents and guardians should have some rights in relation to children and young people but this Bill does not contain any such rights. Their rights should be specified in this section and I would ask the Minister <Col N="175" /> to make this provision.  The Minister has put down some amendments on other sections to this effect and I would ask him to accept my amendment which endeavours to recognise the rights of parents and guardians in the case of child labour.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise we are on Committee Stage but I should like to express my good wishes to Deputy Dowling on his appointment as Opposition spokesman for Defence. As the convention goes, I wish him long, successful years in that position. Likewise I welcome Deputy Fitzgerald in his role as spokesman for Labour. I welcome him to join me on this bed of nails, as Ray Gunther, the British Minister, described the Department of Labour.  It is not quite as bad a bed of nails for a member of the Opposition who is spokesman in this area as it is for the Minister concerned, who must lie on the bed of nails.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;a parent or guardian of such an employee ...&rdquo; but I consider the definition we have in the Bill is wide enough for the purpose we have in mind.  In other sections of the Bill I am required to consult representatives before taking action either as to changing conditions or raising the age.  For example, under section 6 I am permitted to raise the minimum age for employment in special cases where there might be danger to the health or safety of young persons but before doing so I am required to hold consultations with representatives of employers and employees interested in that class of work.  Under section 16 I have a similar obligation imposed on me before I give any exemptions or exceptions by means of regulation or licence issued in accordance with that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling's amendment would place us in the rather cumbersome situation where we would have to seek guardian or parental approval for all persons under 18 years, that is roughly 65,000 persons.  It would be a cumbersome procedure and what we have here is a more convenient and better <Col N="176" /> frame of reference.  The terms &ldquo;trade unions&rdquo; or &ldquo;representatives of employees&rdquo; are sufficiently wide and they do what Deputy Dowling hopes to achieve in his amendment.  In the circumstances I do not think there is any need for this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The section says, &ldquo;... such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees&rdquo;.  It has to be in the opinion of the Minister but surely a parent or a guardian is a representative of the child?  The phrase &ldquo;in the opinion of the Minister&rdquo; is too wide.  Ministers may vary and their opinions may vary.  I feel that it is absolutely necessary that the rights of the parents and guardians should be written into this Bill.  The Minister has already indicated that he will be writing these rights in in some section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section and it deals with the representative of the employees but surely a parent or guardian is a representative of an employee.  The Minister should reconsider this on the basis that his opinion may not always be the best opinion.  Is the opinion of the Minister to supersede the right of the parent or guardian?  The Minister should be reasonable and give recognition to the rights of the parent or guardian.  In this regard I am not merely referring to the present Minister for Labour. Other Ministers may have different opinions to the present holder of the office.  It is desirable that something on the lines of my amendment be written into this interpretation section.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not rely merely on a ministerial opinion.  We had a ministerial opinion this morning to the effect that certain people were not to get information.  Ministerial opinions change daily.  Ministers have one opinion in private and another opinion in public with the result that there can be a variety of opinions.  In my view the rights of a parent or guardian cannot be superseded by the whims of a Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="177" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in saying that at later stages in the Bill parents are involved.  What is questioned here is the practicability of the Deputy's suggestion.  I believe that the section as drafted is sufficient guarantee that there is consultation with interests representing the employee and, of course, it would not simply be the unfounded opinion of a Minister to decide exactly who the representatives are.  Representatives here would have the sense as understood in industrial relations and laid down in previous legislation, trade union or association acting on behalf of the employee.</P>
      <P>Therefore, there would not be this clashing of claims on who exactly is the representative in that sense.  As the Deputy has his amendment drafted, there would be an obligation to consult with every parent of young people of this age, that is, with parents of some 65,000 young people.  I submit that this would be impracticable.  At a later stage when parental or guardian approval is required in specific instances we have built in these guarantees at the points where it matters and where it would be of importance. The position of the employee is adequately safeguarded by the framing of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has now made the position very clear, that it is trade unions or associations who would be representing the employee. The Minister should consider the point that a child of 14 may not be a member of a trade union or of an association.  In the case of a child of 14, does the Minister indicate that such a child must be a member of a trade union or an association?  They are the only bodies the Minister has indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Minister to go to 65,000 parents but I want the rights of parents or guardians written into this Bill.  The Minister has made it clear that in his opinion trade unions or associations would be the bodies to represent the employees.  I hold that it is not reasonable <Col N="178" /> of the Minister to indicate that a child must be a member of an association or a trade union.  If a child is not a member of an association or a trade union, who then is the representative of the child?  In view of the statement the Minister has made he must accept my amendment.  The Minister's statement is a fairly harsh one in relation to a child of 14 who is in employment because he feels that that child's representative must be a trade union or association.</P>
      <P>In my view a child of that age need not be a member of a trade union or association.  The bulk of children at that age are neither members of a trade union nor of an association and for this reason we must protect their rights in this section.  There is a valid reason for including the rights of parents or guardians in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I must assume that the Minister had consultations with the Congress of trade Unions before introducing this Bill.  I should like to know if a child of 14 can be a member of a trade union?  Are trade unions catering for children under school leaving age?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that since the school leaving age changed there would not be children under 14 years of age in trade unions at present.  The section is so drafted that we do not assume that young people of this age are in trade unions.  The section as drafted covers all of the possible variations in the situation of representation. The section states: &ldquo;representatives of the employees in relation to whom the expression is used, or where there is no such trade union, such persons as are in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees&rdquo;.  In my view that mirrors the actual situation, it meets the needs of it.  At a later stage in the legislation where we feel there is a compulsory need for notification and consultation with the parents that provision is included.  At this point, considering the practical difficulties of the situation, I do not see that need because the section as drafted adequately covers the idea of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> The section does not lay down that the representations must be brought forward by a trade union or association because, as the Deputy rightly remarked, the trade unions cannot in all instances here claim to represent people of this age and, perhaps, in the majority of cases they do not. In my view the section as drafted is adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there could be some division between the representative of the child and the representative of the young person?  The child is more vulnerable than the young person and for this reason it is necessary that there should be some protection for the child as distinct from the young person.  Would the Minister consider including at some stage the rights of parents or guardians in relation to a child?  It is broadly covered here on the basis of employees but the child must be fully protected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <P>At the outset I should like to convey my thanks to the Minister for his comments.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is introducing legislation because we were beginning to wonder if the Minister had forgotten some of his promises.  We look forward to the Minister bringing more legislation before the House.  On the amendment of Deputy Dowling, the fact that the Minister has introduced the parent or guardian at a later stage of the Bill indicates that the Minister feels that in the definition section after the trade union the first person that <Col N="180" /> should be specifically mentioned is the parent or guardian.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will note that Deputy Dowling has deliberately put into the amendment &ldquo;a parent or guardian&rdquo;.  To cover any contingency which might arise, it is in the singular. The Minister has a duty to give preference to the parent or guardian in the definition.  The Bill covers a wide spectrum of the young in our society.  I fully appreciate the Minister's difficulties in introducing it.  We are disappointed with many aspects of the Bill.  We would not have brought in this Bill ourselves.  Being the first such Bill legislating for young people, there are these difficulties. As a parent myself, I certainly feel that the parent is entitled to be specifically mentioned in the definition section.  I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment because I think he believes, as I do, that this preference should be given.</P>

      <P>There is no reference in the Bill to paid holidays, or insurance, or social welfare.  The school leaving age has been changed from 14 years to 15 years.  Very often young persons who are working are dismissed at the age of 16 years because the employer has to contribute to the social welfare system.  We feel that young people should be covered somewhere along the line by some form of social insurance.  Now that the school leaving age has been raised to 15 years, we would hope that there would be some such provision somewhere.  It is not written into the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> The Minister may say this is a question for the Department of Social Welfare and that it covers quite a considerable field.  We want to ensure that these young people have full and adequate protection in this new legislation. The question of paid holidays, social welfare and insurance should be covered.  We will consider submitting amendments to broaden the scope of the Bill to ensure that there will be complete and adequate cover for young persons.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister can indicate whether there is any move to give some type of limited insurance cover. In the past we have heard of far too many unfortunate accidents occurring where children were at the mercy of baby farmers who employed quite a number of children to do one type of work or another and no compensation was available.  Many of these children were injured to a degree which affected them in later life.  We want to ensure that this Bill is comprehensive. Holidays are another factor.  The Minister may say the Bill is not concerned with holidays, but we would like to hear his views on the question of insurance, holidays and social welfare to protect the child adequately.</P>

      <P>This is a small but very technical point.  This legislation can be confusing.  It covers a child and a young person.  What is involved is clear to us here in the House.  The Bill provides that the school leaving age means the age at which the School Attendance Act, 1926, ceases to apply.  We know what the school leaving age is but, if the age of 15 years had been included in the Bill, it would have been brought home forcibly to employers that this was the age referred to.  In this type of legislation we should be very specific.  The Minister spoke about open government.  I want to make sure that the message gets through to very many people because, human nature being what it is, when people see something about the School Attendance Act, 1926, they skip over it, whereas if the age of 15 years is specified it may register with an employer or with a young person.</P>

      <P>I have always been puzzled by certain things in legislation: Perhaps it is my lack of legal training or, perhaps, there is not sufficient emphasis on detail, but when something is written in I like to be sure why it is there and to question it for that reason.  For example, in subsection (1) (b) the Minister mentions work carried out in mines.  It is readily understandable that such work should be classed as industrial work. But why then would the Minister not include, particularly at this time&mdash;and this is of particular importance to the development of our economy&mdash;work carried out in mines or in offshore exploration?  Why is work carried out in mines specified?  The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 is already mentioned in (a) as being disciplined industrial work; (c) refers to the transport of persons and goods and (d) is the provision which gives the Minister discretion to declare any other industrial work, work.  You first have what is described as industrial work under the 1936 Act; later, it is provided that the Minister can make the order and you have the transport of persons and goods, but why are mines specified while offshore development is not mentioned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We took over the definition from the 1936 Act.  It is a common feature of legislation of this kind that you take over previous definitions. One could add other items that would, perhaps, be more contemporary than what is in the 1936 Act. But I emphasise that we have power to decide, for purposes of exclusion and so on, in a later section what is light non-industrial work.  What the Deputy is worried about, whether certain items are mentioned or not, is not really material.  We have the power of exemption and exception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I accept that but why do you specify one particular aspect of industry?  It is right that it should be mentioned specifically and I presume there is some reason for it.  I have mentioned offshore exploration but there are many activities if one went through the 1936 Act that are not mentioned. Why, in introducing a Bill like this in <Col N="185" /> describing industrial work, do you specifically mention mining?</P>

      <P>No.  For the purposes of the legislation before us the Deputy will appreciate that I have powers of exemption and otherwise from the definitions we have taken over from previous legislation.  One often comes up against the use of archaic terms when changing legislation. If only for the reason that each piece of legislation must carry on the pattern of what was there before this is understandable.  It has often struck me that one could add fresh things to previous legislation.  For the practical problems before us, the powers of exemption, exceptions and exclusion are mine under the legislation.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to interrupt but here is a note which says that among other things the 1936 Act covers work of construction, laying or removing foundations laying out or clearing sites for any such construction.  One could spend the day arguing whether it covers this or that operation.  The 1936 Act was <Col N="186" /> brought into this legislation because it is the nearest thing we have to an attempt at having a comprehensive formulation of what is industrial work.  One could claim that any particular operation was not covered adequately under it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point the Minister made about the use of archaic terms in new Bills.  But this is a new concept of legislation, legislation for young people being introduced by a young, progressive Minister and one would think he would bring in a new section, get away from the old concepts and have something new and define what was meant by industrial work as it affects young people in the Protection Of Young Persons (Employment) Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This will be difficult legislation to enforce and this is something the Minister must realise. That is one reason why I have already said it should be the most simple legislation ever passed in the House with technical detail explained in layman's language as far as possible.  I can see the position in which the Departmental inspector would have to adjudicate on what is industrial work and what is not industrial work. For that reason I think it should be specifically considered by the Minister's Department at this stage.  I should like the Minister to have included a section defining for the purposes of this Bill what is industrial work and what is not.  That would relieve the workload on the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is difficult legislation.  I think it would require the wisdom of Solomon to set down in statute form all the variations of what should be described as industrial work.  The previous formulation is incorporated in this legislation because that is the usual practice in changing legislation&mdash;one refers to previous definitions.  I remind the <Col N="187" /> Deputy that under section 2 (2) I shall have power to declare any form of work to be industrial work for the purposes of this Act.  If that is not considered enough, under section 4 (5) I have a double-barrelled power of describing exactly what is light non-industrial work.</P>
      <P>That, I agree, leaves a heavy burden of further work on myself and the Department to chart out in modern conditions what constitutes industrial and light non-industrial work, but it would have been an impossible and probably a vain task to try to set out in statute form all the variations required if one sought a completely comprehensive definition. Therefore, flexibility and a possibility of meeting conditions in a modern setting are given us under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to subsection (1) (c) of section 3&mdash;&ldquo;an out-worker&rdquo;&mdash;does the Minister not feel there is a loophole here for people who wish to apply child labour outside the scope of the Bill?  &ldquo;An outworker&rdquo; is very vague.  People could be classified as outworkers in order to get round the balance in the Bill.  I should like to know why the Minister has specified a fisherman, a lighthouse or lightship keeper and a seafarer but with particular emphasis on &ldquo;an outworker&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) of section 3 reads:</P>
      <P>This Act, other than sections 4, 5, 13 and 14, shall not apply to work in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does that mean that if a boy joins a band, the Army School of Music or one of the apprenticeship schools he can be employed without restriction in relation to hours of work or to the hours a young child can work at night?  Would the boy in the apprenticeship school not need to be protected because such a boy may be performing other duties at night?  If the Minister is excluding certain <Col N="188" /> sections of the Bill from young people surely they should apply to people who are vulnerable in this respect?</P>

We shall be coming to section 4, laying down the minimum age for employment and what hours are permissible.  Therefore, all of these excluded categories in section 4 do apply to them.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in relation to the Defence Forces.  In the present emergency situation there are exceptional demands for guard duty and Border duty on a minority of persons under the age of 18, a small but sufficient number to whom we could not with consistency see these provisions applied.  That is the reason for the exception in the case of the Defence Forces mentioned here.</P>

Let us take the example of a boy going out as a galley boy on a fishing vessel on which he could have a most dangerous existence.  It could be on part of national territory.  He would need a lot more protection than a boy working in, say, a supermarket or a store.  The same would apply in the case of a seafarer.  This Bill, being for the protection of young people, I feel the Minister should explain his hesitancy in applying section 3 to the categories mentioned here.  It amazes <Col N="189" /> me that they are not included.  I know the Minister has power to do so.  Therefore, he makes the suggestion that he may well do it.  Why not do it now?  We should ensure that any boy going to sea as a galley boy, or, shall we say, as a seafarer is protected.  I think it would be fairly easily done because the owners of those ships operating in national territory could be made amenable to the law.</P>

      <P>I would say to all the Deputies concerned about exclusions that they are there at this stage but, as we examine the way this legislation progresses, we have the power to include particular categories at present excluded.

      <P>I am disappointed to hear the Minister say that one of the reasons for the exclusions here is obvious difficulties involved in implementation.  That would not appeal to me as being a good reason. I am disappointed that this legislation for young people has not taken a clearer form.  Before I entered politics I remember well that to read and interpret a Bill even one relevant to something in which I was interested was hard labour.  I would recommend <Col N="190" /> that any legislation for young people be drafted in the simplest possible form.  I can assure the Minister that in any future legislation he will be introducing here for young people I will be pressing him to change the approach to such.  What I should like to see is a Bill easily read and understood by young people and not one referring them to this or that other Act.  I would avoid that as much as possible or be specific and give explanations where necessary.</P>
      <P>The term &ldquo;an outworker&rdquo; there affords wide scope.  Deputy Moore made a very good point about the fishermen.  The fact that it is seasonal work may make it possible for a young lad to engage in it and earn a few shillings.  If he can do that it is doubtful if legislation is good because he is prevented from doing it on foot of the obvious difficulties that would be encountered if this legislation allowed him to work.  For that reason, we will be considering an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that during school holidays many children, particularly in Dublin, engage in such temporary employments as fruit picking, delivering milk and newspapers. If our amendment is accepted, the Minister may by order fix an age under which children may not be so employed. At the moment many children under the age of 14 can earn pocket money during school holidays as fruit pickers.  Is it the Minister's intention that such children will in future not be able to engage in such temporary employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree that the employment of young people should be strictly controlled, but is the Minister sure that this age in this instance will be enforceable, or rather that the law will be enforceable in this respect?  Does <Col N="191" /> this section mean that in future no person under the age of 14 may be employed as a fruit picker?</P>

      <P>In regard to other sections the Deputy asked me to be specific.  A legitimate approach is that the legislation is vague&mdash;that intentions should be more clearly expressed. However, the Deputy here asks me to be deliberately vague.  He has changed his footwork and said that I should drop the specific age and that I should by regulation remove from the ambit of Oireachtas decision the question of age.  This is a matter for the Dáil to express its views on, it is not an area in which we should shirk from expressing our opinions.  It is not an appropriate matter for a Minister or his officials to decide.  It is natural material for decision by the elected representatives, subject to all the practical problems that arise in fixing a particular age.  We are faced with the predicament that there has not been any legislation in this area for nearly 30 years and it is obvious that a particular attitude, a particular social behaviour, has grown up and that we have, perhaps to an extent not fully appreciated, become accustomed to the employment of young people in all kinds of occupations.</P>
      <P>The age I have set down here is in my opinion the correct starting point, though I should like to point out that in section 16 I have the authority to vary the age.  However, at this stage I do not think we can escape from our obligation to set down a minimum age.  That is a matter for Members of the Oireachtas.  We could then review the situation consequent on that.</P>

If we accept the age as it is in the Bill we might find after three months that it was impractical or inoperable and that his inspectors were having tremendous difficulties.  He has already admitted the difficulties of enforcement that will arise.  The Minister's successors from this side of the House will, in the not too distant future, have the opportunity of making up the leeway.</P>

Seriously, I would appeal to the Minister to leave himself leeway in relation to the reports that will come back from the inspectorate.  I suspect there will be reports back from the inspectors that they are finding it impossible to get compliance with this section.  There must be flexibility.  If the Minister makes an order under the Bill and finds in three months <Col N="193" /> that it is inoperable he can change it. Would the Minister consider this?</P>

      <P>In social legislation it is desirable that Deputies of all parties should indicate what they think the main features of that legislation should be.  They do not have to wait for the distant day when their party return to these benches here. I think Deputy Dowling will vouch for the fact that I have been happy to accept amendments from him, which, I may say, were very helpful additions to legislation in my area. On this matter I would be happy to hear the opinions of Opposition spokesmen on what should be the minimum age below which we would not permit child labour.  This, Deputies will agree, is one of the crucial features of this legislation.  It is the point at which the Oireachtas puts its stamp on this legislation.  My suggestion is 14.  I am aware of the difficulties involved in ensuring that that legislation becomes a reality.  We are working against the background of almost 30 years' absence of legislation in this important area.  Customs and practices are now in being which possibly would not be so strong if the Oireachtas had spoken before now on the matter.</P>
      <P>Now that we are introducing legislation I would be happy to hear the opinions of Deputies opposite of what the age should be.  The Opposition spokesmen suggest that no age limit be mentioned, that the matter be left totally to my discretion.  That is to downgrade the position of the Oireachtas in terms of legislation of this kind.  I would like Deputy Moore, Deputy Dowling, Deputy Fitzgerald and others who have spoken frequently on social legislation, to make known their minds on what the age should be.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to have a look at section 4 prior to the Report Stage.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>An employer may, subject to the conditions specified in subsection (3) of this section employ a child who is over the age of 14 years to do ...&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A child who is 14 years and one day is over 14.  Anybody who has done school attendance committee work will find that, in this city particularly, youngsters who are under 15 are taking jobs.  Then they are brought before the committee and the committee say: &ldquo;You must go back to school.&rdquo;  You realise, of course, that probably they need the money at home, and the case is made: &ldquo;Young Jimmy or Mary has only six months to do.  Do not force them back into school, because they will lose this job.&rdquo;  People will say that this legislation enables them to do work at 14, but the school attendance legislation does not.  Therefore this Bill is contrary to the School Attendance Act. We are touching on a grave social problem here in regard to the youngster who does not want to go to school or the family who need his earnings.  I cannot suggest a solution to the Minister at the moment beyond asking that he would look at this whole section with Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment and Deputy Dowling's remarks here in order to frame a better section 4.  It is ambiguous, and it is anti-School Attendance Act, and we shall have to do a lot more thinking on it before we get a proper solution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to be anti-School Attendance Act, but we do permit children between 14 and 15 years to work for two hours outside school hours and 35 hours in each week during summer holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there is this problem of young people who desire to work outside school hours, in many cases for too long hours under the age of 14. The representatives of the National Youth Council have been with me and indicated their unease at the actuality of the situation throughout the country where large numbers of secondary <Col N="195" /> or other forms of school-going pupils do work outside school hours.  The difficulty I have been placed in is that we must start somewhere.  I am not putting forward this legislation in ignorance of certain problems that may arise consequent on its passage.  I have power under section 16 to make exemptions in relation to sectors and particular services.</P>
    <P>When this legislation is enacted we propose to review the situation and see how any problems that may arise can be met in the spirit of the legislation. As I said on the Second Stage, we have very little official statistical information in the whole area of youth employment, and one of the purposes of this legislation is to reverse that situation of official ignorance, and there will be a great deal of work arising from this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the point I made about succeeding Ministers, but I introduced that in a light vein.  I shall endeavour to co-operate with him in every way to ensure that this legislation is the best for our country.  My reason for rising again is to say that the Minister himself made the best case for this alteration when he said a while ago that this is new legislation, that we are catering for something on which there is no statistical evidence available to us.  The Minister is drawing his lines very fine at this stage, and he will see that as the various officials try to implement this legislation he will come across different problems.  Rather than specifying an age in respect of holiday work, the matter should be left open and to the Minister's discretion.  For social reasons there are many families who are glad to have their incomes augmented by the earnings of young persons during the summer holiday period and, perhaps, during the school year as well.  However, it is only in the light of experience that we will be able to determine what should be the statutory age at which these children might work.  A lot would depend, too, on the type of work involved.  For some work a person of 14 may be too young while he may be too old at that age for other <Col N="196" /> types of work.  I appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Dowling's amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In subsection (3) (a), page 5, line 14, after &ldquo;each day&rdquo; to add &ldquo;subject to a maximum of ten hours in each week&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) allows for a situation in which a schoolboy might be working seven two-hour days per week. These 14 hours would be in addition to his school hours of approximately 30 hours, giving a total of a 44-hour working week plus time spent on homework.  This is something that should not be allowed and, consequently, our amendment is to ensure that young persons would not be allowed work for 14 hours during school terms and we suggest that the maximum be ten hours so that what would be involved would be two hours on each of five days.  I trust the Minister will accept the thinking behind this.</P>
      <P>In paragraph (a) of subsection (3) a child is being permitted to work 14 hours per week during the school term.  Throughout the country there may be many young people who can work a few hours per week but this work may be available only on Saturdays and Sundays.  They may get four hours on both Saturdays and Sundays.  They would be prohibited from doing these eight hours' work according to this subsection but my amendment is designed to allow these people to work those hours at week-ends, subject to a ten-hour maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (3) of section 4 we are talking about children who are over 14 but under 15 who are permitted to do light non-industrial work, subject to certain conditions.  One of these conditions is that their hours of work during the school term must be outside school hours and must not exceed two hours each day.  There is a different arrangement for school holiday periods where we permit 35 hours work per week.  This formula of two hours outside school hours seemed to me to be one that would be appropriate for a variety of part-time light jobs which might be undertaken by young people.  There is a wide variety of <Col N="198" /> jobs that one could put forward in respect of different localities but we are considering the national situation. The formula here is the one which seemed most appropriate to meet the criteria of not over-straining the young person and of not interfering with his school work.</P>
      <P>The amendment put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald would be more restrictive and would result in too long hours being worked at weekends. Weekends, too, are a feature of the school week in so far as study is engaged in by the student at weekends. To permit the two four-hour periods suggested by Deputy Fitzgerald would be to allow unduly long hours to be worked in a concentrated way during the weekend.  Governing everything we are doing in this legislation there may be a greater ignorance than we would wish to admit of where the areas of greatest trouble may be but one that comes up constantly is the use, by supermarkets and certain retail liqour outlets, of child labour. The areas of greatest business activity for child labour is at weekends and the longer hours permitted at week-ends would give the basis for a continuation of a practice that we wish to see ended.  For these reasons I ask Deputy Fitzgerald to reconsider his amendment.  I do not think it meets the objective which he would desire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the last point made by the Minister of the danger of long hours of work at week-ends. I consider my amendment to be suited ideally to cover the situation in, say, supermarkets, but how can the Minister justify a situation in which a child who attends school from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. is allowed work for two hours on school-going days while at week-ends when he is free from school he is not allowed work for four hours?  I cannot go along with the Minister's reasoning and say that this is an overconcentration of work.  As I have said already, he is at school from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and before or after that he does two hours work.  I take the Minister's point about the danger of exploitation of young people at week-ends and I would oppose it.  I want to provide, and <Col N="199" /> the Minister has a duty to provide for the young person who needs a few hours work on Saturday to bring home much needed money for his family.  He is precluded under this legislation from doing this while another child is at liberty to work two hours a day, seven days a week&mdash;five of them school days.</P>

      <P>We must be very careful with this Bill if we are not to deprive a child of part-time after school employment.  We could also worry employers in this respect.  In my view, the implementation of this Bill will be at the Minister's discretion.  I find it particularly difficult to understand how this section will be implemented.  For instance, some children will go to an employer after school to do two hours work.  They might then go to another employer and perhaps do a little cleaning. At night they might go to the lounge bars to collect and wash glasses. How is an employer to know the number of hours a child has worked after school.  How is the parent to know?  Who will keep a check on the number of hours?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>One could consider variations on this theme over a long period.  One argument could be produced to counter another.  Deputy G. Fitzgerald is looking for a maximum of ten hours' work.  He says that in terms of this legislation anything outside ten hours would be illegal.  He wants to crowd most of the working hours into four and four at weekends. Under this legislation we would permit a more even development of work, that is, 14 hours a week for two hours outside school hours every day, but excluding any hours worked over two hours in any one day at light non-industrial work.  The possibility of permitting longer hours to be worked at week-ends, as suggested by Deputy G. Fitzgerald, would seem to favour those interests who apparently up to now have most exploited youth labour, that is, supermarkets and lounge bars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse referred to double employment.  Section 15 refers to this <Col N="200" /> and we will be discussing the problems associated with that later.  I readily concede that there are problems.  In fact, there is not a section in this legislation where one cannot foresee difficulties of implementation in practical terms.  On the other hand, much of this legislation which is new and attempts to put forward in a progressive way and change modes of behaviour, can be described at the start as impractical.  It will take time, both of public education and implementation, before we can say it is an actual reality in terms of social behaviour.  We are confident that our inspectorate and the provisions of this legislation will render this legislation obeyable.  One of the reasons why we ruled out certain areas was because we did not feel confident we could monitor them.  We will be discussing double employment on sections 5 and 15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The employer is not involved in this Bill.  We are concerned about the protection of young persons and justice to allow them equal opportunities as far as possible.  I cannot see the line of the Minister's argument.  He says he is allowing these young people 14 hours a week in addition to the 30 hours school, and their study and homework hours, spread over a period.  This means that from Monday to Friday a young person may work ten hours plus homework and study hours and four hours at weekends.  My suggestion is far easier on the child.  Many children are unable to get part-time employment during the week in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Another section deals with the time limits which will control the hours they may work.  In my view, my amendment is valid: I am asking that the 14 hours be reduced to ten hours and allow young people the opportunity of working two four-hour days on non-school days rather than working five two-hours days on school-going days.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes to allow a child to work an uninterrupted period of seven days without a break so that he has his school hours and the two hours work per day.  Deputy Fitzgerald in his amendment has suggested a maximum of 10 hours which would allow leisure time on at least two days a week.  His amendment also seeks to permit four hours work on Saturdays and Sundays. The Minister has rightly pointed out the problem of supermarkets which, in some cases, exploit child labour but there are clerical jobs that <Col N="202" /> children can do to further their education and prepare them for greater things in life.  Such jobs exist in the accountancy field and so on. Children may be unable to avail themselves of the opportunity of doing this work on week days.</P>
      <P>I know the maximum hours will be difficult to enforce.  If an employer is unscrupulous enough he will keep the child back for two and a half or three hours instead of two hours per day but we must try to get the balance which is best for the child. We should ensure that a young person, if he wishes, has the opportunity to advance himself by taking a clerical job at the weekend.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any real disagreement between the Minister and ourselves in this area.  The Minister must recognise that there can be a situation in which a child cannot work during the week and wishes to do so on Saturdays and Sundays. Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment is a reasonable one.  We can all point to some section that will possibly exploit child labour.  Perhaps supermarkets will not exploit them to the degree some people believe.  They may pay reasonable wages and have them working reasonable hours.  However, there are people who will avail themselves of any opportunity to exploit young people.  I do not think it would be a good thing if a child who was studying for an examination could work every day of the week.  If he could work at the weekend it might even advance his prospects in the examination.  Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment gives the child an option: the Minister's proposal gives him no option.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at this and if it would not interfere with the child's education he should consider giving him the option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald's suggestion would, perhaps, further abridge the options available to the child because it would make completely illegal work on most days of the week in any part time capacity. Deputy Dowling is right in saying we could discuss the relative advantages <Col N="203" /> and disadvantages of either approach in this area.  One could say that in one particular business it would be better for the child and the business that he would be available for certain hours at a particular time of the week and somebody else could equally cogently say that it would be a better educational experence and of more benefit to employer and employee at another time of the week and at different hours.  One of the things I want to see as great a sharing as possible, a large number of young people having the possibility of part-time work and to guard against any excesses either of effort or the kind of work engaged in. We confined it to two hours each day over the whole week so that in a small town where there would be limited opportunities of part-time work there would be as great a spread of that work as possible.  There is the danger in the amendment of a monopoly, of one group managing to get the limited amount of work available.</P>
      <P>There is also the other consideration that I do not wish to see labour of this kind displacing adult labour and there is the possibility in weekend work of such extended hours that we are not too far from displacing an adult in employment over that period. So as to provide maximum opportunities for the largest number of young people and for educational reasons I think the section meets the case.  However, I will continue to review the situation before Report Stage and if we can have a meeting of minds on this matter I will be prepared to look at it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(6) The Minister may by order declare any form of work specified in the order to be work which is light non-industrial work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Second Stage Debate Deputies made points about the definition of industrial work in section 2. This section, as we have discussed already, sets out the reservation that people had in definitions relating to the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936. During the Second Stage debate <Col N="205" /> Deputies referred particularly to difficulties which might arise in the case of certain employment which, though traditionally regarded as non-industrial, might possibly come within the definition of industrial work for the purpose of this Bill.  This amendment will give me flexibility to decide if particular types of work should be deemed to be light non-industrial, which could be undertaken by children of 14 and 15 years for limited periods, subject to the conditions specified in subsections (2) and (3) of section 4.  I think this meets difficulties Deputies mentioned on the Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (a), page 5, line 38, after &ldquo;person or child, and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;obtain the written permission of the parent or guardian of the young person or child, and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This refers to the duties of young persons or children.  The section states that any employer who employs a young person or child shall before employing that young person or child obtain a copy of the birth certificate of the young person or child or obtain other satisfactory evidence of the age of the young person or child.  We want to have inserted here &ldquo;obtain the written permission of the parent or guardian of the young person or child&rdquo;.  My amendment covers the young person or child.  I am not that anxious to have &ldquo;young person&rdquo; inserted. The employer is under an obligation to obtain a copy of the birth certificate of the young person so the child should also be fully protected by the permission of the parent or guardian being obtained to allow him to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that many children are working and sometimes the parents are not consulted.  They would not like their children to be employed because they are often paying for special studies for them.  The child's schooling could be affected by having him employed. <Col N="206" /> It is the parents or guardian of children who can decide if being employed will affect the plan of schooling they have for them.  Children are the most vulnerable section of employees.  They do not know what their rights are or even how to obtain them.</P>
    <P>The question of the permission of the parent or guardian in relation to the employment of children is very important and it should be written into the Bill.  I am sure the Minister will agree that if a child, rather than a parent, can make the decision as to whether he can be employed then a serious situation may develop because the child may put himself in a disadvantaged position in relation to his education at a later stage.  It is on the basis of education, the child's future as planned by the parents or guardian, sometimes at considerable cost, that they should be consulted in relation to child labour as distinct from the employment of young persons.  I ask the Minister to give some consideration to this amendment because the point I have raised is a very valid one.  The ages of 14 and 15 are very impressionable years in the life of a child.  I am sure parents would like to know the type of employment their children were engaged in and the type of company they were working with and also other factors in relation to employment.</P>
    <P>Many children may avail of the opportunity of leaving school and may be enticed to go into employment at a very early age.  The parents should be consulted in this matter.  We are endeavouring to protect the future of children under this Bill.  The Minister should give consideration to this amendment or a similar type of amendment which he could introduce. It has been suggested by some of the organisations which deal with youth problems that many of the parents of children aged 14 and 15 who are in employment when they should be at school, are not aware of this.  If the employer was under an obligation, when employing children, to consult with their parents we might have a much happier situation.  This is a weakness in the section.  I think there <Col N="207" /> is a necessity to give the type of consideration I have indicated.</P>

      <P>I would point out to Deputy Dowling that the amendment as it stands would impose an obligation in respect of about 65,000 young persons in the 15 to 18 age group although I gather from what he said that his real concern is children between 14 and 15, those permitted to do the non-industrial work as set out in the Bill.  I have had consultations with the National Youth Council on this matter and I have been considering it myself.  I am in broad sympathy with the idea they put to me that there must be a place for the parent or guardian for that category, not for all those up to 18 who would be covered by the amendment.  The group between 14 and 15 are the most vulnerable group in the terms of this Bill but, since that is the most vulnerable group if Deputy Dowling agrees to withdraw his amendment I will have an alternative amendment drafted for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Before subsection (2) to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) The Minister may make regulations providing that an employer within the meaning of subsection (1) of this section shall, at such intervals as may be specified in the regulations, furnish to the Minister a copy of the register or other record maintained under the said subsection (1).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If only the employer is required to maintain the register the Minister will have no one with access to the register and there will be no duplicate records. In that case it would be quite easy for an employer to write up the register to suit himself.  It is both necessary and desirable in the protection of young people that there should be information lodged either with the inspector or the Minister which could be consulted. People might be inclined to take advantage <Col N="208" /> of young people over a period and it would be a simple matter to lose the records, have them destroyed by fire or rewrite them to suit the employer. If that habit developed employers could do this over again. Duplicate records might not be prepared on every occasion and on the visit of the inspector there would be no record other than the employer's record and that might not show the information I think so vital.</P>
    <P>Those who employ child labour should be compelled to lodge some type of record with the inspectorate or with the Minister so that there could be constant supervision.  These records should be kept for a considerable period.  Strict control is vitally necessary.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the record I suggest is necessary.  The employer would have the advantage of the many options open to him.  It has been known in the past that records have been destroyed.  There are people who will resort to such tactics.  The protection of young persons is a complicated area.  There might be a great deal of work involved but for reference purposes there should be some record available other than that in the custody of the employer.</P>

      <P>A great deal of work would be involved because some 65,000 young persons will be covered by this legislation.  If we were to do what the Deputy suggests the Department would be flooded with this kind of information and that would throw an additional heavy burden on the shoulders of the inspectorate.  The inspectorate will be busy enough ensuring the provisions of the Bill are complied with.  As well as that, the particulars specified in section 5 will be subject to variation over a year or over the period of employment.  I doubt if the amendment would be helpful.  I agree there is need to assess the information contained in the register kept by the employer.  That register must be kept under pain of penalties.  It will be subject to inspection. I do not think we need go further than that.  If there is a dearth of statistical information we will have to extract what we can under the <Col N="209" /> obligation now placed on employers to keep records.  I could not contemplate having the returns about which the Deputy speaks filed in the Department and neither could I place the obligation of collection on the shoulders of the inspectorate.  The inspectors will have plenty of work as it is under the Bill.  I accept the Deputy's argument that the information should be collated.  That will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), page 6, line 30, to delete &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;forty&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section deals with the maximum hours of work for young persons over the age of 16 years and my amendment seeks to delete &ldquo;fifty&rdquo; and to <Col N="211" /> substitute &ldquo;forty&rdquo; as the maximum number of hours.  As Deputy Moore has pointed out, frequently the maximum number of hours becomes the norm.</P>
    <P>At the moment many workers are on a shorter working week and the general tendency is to reduce the 40-hour week.  The documents we receive from the EEC deal in detail with hours of work and the desirability of establishing a 40-hour week for adults but in this legislation we are setting out a 50-hour week for young persons.  We consider this much too long, that young people should be able to avail of the shorter working week.  For many years people have been viewing with alarm the introduction of machinery and mechanisation and probably in a short time the normal week will be 35 hours.  In fact, trade unions have indicated this is their goal.  Consequently, we consider there should be a reduction of the 50 hours specified in this legislation in order to keep in line with the common tendency to reduce the working week.</P>
    <P>If we are mechanised and have large-scale unemployment, the shorter working week will give a larger number of people the opportunity to obtain employment.  This is a fairly complex question but a start must be made at some stage.  It is regrettable that in a Bill dealing with the protection of young persons we are legislating for a 50-hour working week for them, especially at a time when there are demands for shorter hours.</P>
    <P>By this provision we are giving an opportunity to employers to employ less people and this is an important consideration in the specifying of a maximum number of hours.  Probably employers will avail of this opportunity to keep as few people as possible working the longest number of hours to facilitate book-keeping and the records they must keep with relation to social welfare, redundancy and other matters.  If we are in earnest about meeting the demands of the EEC and the social policy, we should reduce the number of hours specified in the Bill.  The Minister has <Col N="212" /> an opportunity of bringing a new dimension into the whole question of the number of hours of work for young persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendment put down by Deputy Dowling.  However, although this Bill relates to the protection of young people it can be a menace to the older worker.  If a man is employed in a job and is restricted in his hours of work by trade union regulations to 43 hours or 45 hours, it would pay an employer to sack that man and to employ a boy over 16 who could work for 50 hours per week for less money.</P>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister is trying to do but we may find out afterwards that although we set out to protect the young we have done so at the expense of the older workers.  I hope the Minister recognises the point I am making about the employer sacking the older man and employing the young boy to work longer hours at lower wages and that he will accept Deputy Dowling's amendment.  Unless the section is amended in some way it is open to abuse.  I cannot see anything to stop an employer taking on a young boy who can work up to 50 hours per week and getting rid of a man whose trade union would not allow him to work more than 43 or 44 hours per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a bit of confusion here.  One may work longer than the hours set down in collective agreements and it is not a matter of illegality but the position here is that working longer than the hours set down here is a question of illegality.  Collective agreements in general or those drawn up between employers and unions are not in the same category as when we state in statute law that beyond a certain hour it is illegal for a person to work.  Obviously, the hours are the maximum.  When we come to laying down the maximum with the type of penalties we have attached for infringement the hours bear little relationship to the hours worked out in collective agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even since they are laid down in the area of maximum hours it does represent <Col N="213" /> a real improvement from the position laid down in the acts relating to conditions of employment from 1938 to 1942.  Those Acts dealt mainly with shops, hotels, restaurants and retail outlets which are the main concern of us in this legislation.  In those conditions the maximum hours laid down were far longer and the maximum hours in this Bill are a real improvement on that situation.  I stress again that beyond these hours it is illegal to work so that they cannot be compared to those hours devised between employers and unions in normal collective agreements.  To contrast the maximum with what would appear to be the going hourly rate in industry is therefore to compare two different things and the argument cannot be advanced on that basis.</P>
    <P>Even at the area of the maximum hours, even understanding that this is what we are about, I have power under section 7 (4) to vary downwards the maximum hours to be worked. Here I have discretion.  I want Deputies to understand that we are not talking about the normal hours in industry when we talk about maximum hours set down in statute the infringement of which means that the person infringing would be committing an offence.  Even on the maximum Deputies can see that over the four week period we provide under this section that only 190 hours at maximum may be worked. That works out at an average of 47½ hours at maximum beyond which it would be illegal to work.  Over the entire year it is 2,160 hours which would give a maximum average of a 45 hour week.  While it sets it down in the form of one week maximum at 50 hours taking all the provisions of this section into account on average around the year the maximum hourly week worked for this age category would be 45 hours.  Infringement of that kind of working week over the year would be an illegal act.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that over the year one could work 45 hours per week but the EEC recommendations to member states is that the principle of the normal working week before overtime rates become applicable should not exceed 40 hours.  This is to be applied in all sectors throughout the Community by 31st December, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This applies to adult workers and there must be a difference between an adult worker and a young person as defined in the Act. Here we specify 50 hours but I believe there should be some reduction in this period.  I do not think that the normal working week which could be 45 hours per week should be anything more than 40 hours per week with the provision that the employee can work the maximum if the employer permits him to do so.  I do not believe we should exceed the 40 hours with these young persons.  There must be a difference between the number of hours a child can work, the number of hours a young person and an adult can work.</P>
      <P>I am sure that in relation to adult employment very few of them would be working the 50 hours.  The tendency is that the whole structure would be recoiled to some degree, that there would be this retraction and that we will have the shorter working week.  Then the maximum working week will be considerably shorter. The Minister should be reasonable on this occasion.  He should show clearly that he has this concern for the protection of young people and that he will give a chance to those of 16 years of age so that there will be no avenue open where they can be exploited.  Deputy Moore's point was a good one.  In my view the Minister must consider it unreasonable that over a period of a year these people can be forced to work 45 hours per week.  At the same time where the maximum becomes the norm older people can be injured in the process.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the amendment was eliminating overtime from the child between 16 and 18 but this is not correct.  What the amendment proposes is to limit the number of hours to 40.  I do not understand what criteria was used in reckoning the number of hours.  The maximum at first is 50 hours per week, then it is reduced to 47½ and over a year it becomes a 45 hour week.  What basis did the Minister work out for the scaling down of those hours?  It does not seem sensible to me.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the maximum of 40 hours.  For a 16 year old the 40 hours per week seems a reasonable number of hours for that young boy or girl to work and it seems an adequate maximum.  It does not seem right that with the present unemployment position an 18 year old could be interfering with the employment of an adult or the father of a family.  I see nothing wrong with the Minister accepting Deputy Dowling's amendment as it is.</P>

I want to emphasise that it is a legal maximum.  We have a tendency to confuse this with normal hours.  It cannot be compared with the hours worked in industry under collective bargaining. Employers will be forced to comply with the legal provisions of this legislation.  The other is a voluntary agreement.

      <P>We provide for the normal hours of work.  Deputies have an undertaking that this will be looked at on the basis that it is the maximum.  They must understand that it relates to breaking the law.  Maximum hours cannot be compared with normal hours work.  That is a different matter.  For normal hours worked we have a lower figure of 40 hours.  The maximum is pitched at 45 on average around the year.  In certain instances we allow for longer periods over a shorter period, over a period of a week.  Over a four-weekly period it is down to 47½ hours.  It is the old problem we meet in bringing in legislation after a long absence of work in this area.  You will find current practices have gone away beyond what the legislation dealt with in its previous intervention in this area.  One must begin from a certain figure.  As we began with a certain figure for the minimum age, 14 years, we must start from a figure which allows for the actual situation before us and yet is a solid improvement and gives us the power to amend it in the light of experience.</P>

The trend is to establish a 40 hour week within the EEC, while the trend here is towards a much reduced working week and, indeed, in Britain and elsewhere.  If the maximum is 50 and the norm is somewhat less, it must be less than 40 for people of 16 to 18 years if the norm is to be 40 for an adult worker. There must be a difference.</P>

      <P>We now have a real improvement in the maximum hours: normal hours, 40, and over 45 on average over the year, a legal infringement. I see the attraction for the Deputy for cosmetic purposes in suggesting that he is cutting down the radical figure of hours worked.  The Deputy is riding on what he knows is not the real situation.  We are talking about maximum hours.  I understand that those who might not know the position might consider that we were talking about normal hours when we are not.</P>
      <P>I see the attraction for the Deputy in Opposition in his last hurrah as spokesman before he hands over to Deputy Fitzgerald in making this point in such high profile.  He was not quite so forthcoming on the kernel of this legislation in saying whether we should begin at 14 years of age.  He left that to my discretion. I asked him to tell me what age they suggested and I was confronted with silence.  The argument he accepted in coming to the central decision on the age at which it should commence is still valid.  He produced an amendment giving me total discretion.  Under section 7 (4) I have power to vary downwards those maximum hours considering the trends and in the light of our experience.  They are not the normal hours.  They are the maximum hours.  In view of the Deputy's undoubted knowledge of the difference between normal hours and maximum hours, I am surprised that he should adopt this rather strange attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In a few years' time when this Bill is being re-examined, people will say that the man who introduced this Bill in 1974 was not very practical when he specified 50 <Col N="219" /> hours as the maximum.  At that stage it will be in the lower 30s.  The Minister has an obligation to young persons between 16 and 18 years.  Does he think it reasonable that a child of 16 years could be forced by an employer to work 50 hours a week?  The Minister knows that if a person refuses to work overtime it can well be the beginning of the trot to the Labour Exchange.  Does he think it reasonable that a young person could be confronted with that situation at a time when there is a contraction of hours worked throughout industry in general?</P>
      <P>I do not know how many hours are worked in the Civil Service, or in the services here, or in some of the more enlightened places where they work much less than the 40 hours which are normal.  It is intended to establish this in the EEC by the end of this year.  We have established it for some time.  The Minister should be progressive and he should reduce the maximum for young persons of 16 years and upwards.</P>
      <P>The Minister admits that they are a very vulnerable section of society and can be exploited.  If they could not be exploited there would be no need for this Bill.  Deputy Moore has pointed out the problem in regard to adult workers&mdash;that this can have a serious effect where adult workers can be displaced by people who can work up to 50 hours per week.  This certainly would be an attraction to unscrupulous employers.  The maximum should be lowered and the normal working week should be somewhat less than the maximum suggested here.  We have amendments in rgeard to the normal working week also.  If one were taken in conjunction with another one could see the significance of what we are saying because we have endeavoured to change not only the normal working week but also the maximum hours a person may work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to say we are taking it in isolation.  We have already put down amendments covering the aspect to which the Minister referred, the reduction in normal working hours for young persons.  I see no <Col N="220" /> reason why we should divert from our original intention to have this House specify a period of 40 hours as the maximum and when we come to the other section we shall ask for a reduction from the 40-hour week laid down here to bring it in line with more progressive thinking on a shorter working week for this section of young people. Our case is comprehensive and takes into consideration the factors the Minister has suggested we are not concerned about.  We are concerned; we must be progressive and we have the opportunity now.  I ask the Minister to take the opportunity on this occasion to be more progressive.  It shows a very conservative approach when, in dealing with the normal working week, he specifies a 40-hour week.  Quite a substantial amount of industry has a working week considerably less than 40 hours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what we want to do at this stage.  This Bill is entitled Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, legislation which we welcome to cover and control certain aspects of exploitation of children and young people but, for the Minister not to bring in or not to accept Deputy Dowling's amendment of 40 hours per week or 160 hours per four weeks and 2,000 hours per year, approximately, is adopting a conservative old-fashioned approach that goes back to the introduction of the previous Act where, I understand, 60 hours approximately was the figure mentioned very many years ago.  Surely, in addition to the protection of young persons' employment there is also the fact that we are talking about a 16-year old boy or girl and in a country now in the EEC and supposed to be adopting its social concepts we are not prepared to legislate for the protection of these young people and of the adult workers also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support Deputy Dowling's amendment and appeal to the Minister to accept it because he said that he would be coming to the House in a short time with legislation to reduce the number of hours.  I say to the <Col N="221" /> Minister: &ldquo;Take courage; forget what your colleagues say; be your own party man; be the man you promised you would be when you were in Opposition. We are giving the opportunity.&rdquo; The young people of Ireland will remember the Minister for this. He should agree with Deputy Dowling in this case.  He deserves support and the Minister believes he is right in what he seeks.  Possibly the Minister is restrained by the influence of his colleagues.  The Minister should accept the amendment because by doing so he will be doing a good day's work for the young people and for the industrial situation and employment in general.</P>

      <P>If it was a principle of the Bill that no young worker would work more than the normal working week for adults, we would be out of all our troubles.  In this case the Minister is not protecting the young worker but making him a menace to the adult worker and making him very unpopular.  If the Bill said that no young worker should work more than the normal working week for adults the Minister would save a good deal of trouble and also help the young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald will continue the tradition because it is in the interest of good legislation here.  I accept that it is incumbent on the Opposition from time to time to contrast their higher social objectives with the performance of the Government of the day.  We have brought in this legislation and Deputies opposite may come to their own conclusion.  They had many years to ponder the necessity for legislation in this area and in my <Col N="222" /> years in Opposition I never heard them produce any proposals in that area.  Young people may judge who was serious in this area and who was merely rhetorical.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling, Deputy Fitzgerald and other Deputies, I suspect, know that there is a difference between maximum hours and normal hours and therefore to compare the maximum hours stipulation, infringements of which lead to offences punishable under this legislation, with normal hours is to compare two different things and an argument on that basis cannot be taken too seriously.</P>

      <P>The maximum hours set down here will be reviewed by me as I have authority to do under the section and I have no doubt that at the appropriate Stage I shall be back looking for changes even in the maximum hours.  For the young people under 18 I have power in a later section to control rest periods and ban certain night work.  These provisions should also ensure that the kind of work engaged in by such young persons will be qualitatively different from that engaged in by their adult counterparts.  In the circumstances, although I accept the role the Opposition must adopt at times, I appeal to them to accept the section as drafted.  I readily understand the opportunity for being merely rhetorical in suggesting unreal comparisons is very attractive.  I think, now and again, they must take that particular path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's smokescreen is all very well.  We recognise the difference between maximum working hours and normal working hours.  Section 9 deals with normal working hours.  We have amendments down to section 9 to deal with the question or normal working hours as distinct from the question of the maximum hours of work.  If the Minister considers section 7 with section 9 he will see that we have examined the situation comprehensively in relation to the maximum and to the norm. <Col N="223" /> When we get to the normal working hours, the position is even worse than it is in section 7 because we have a lot more to say in relation to the question of the normal working week of the young person.  I shall not comment now on section 9 because we shall have a substantial debate on it, just as we had on section 7.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the Minister saying we are taking it in isolation; we are not taking it in isolation.  We fully comprehend the problem in relation to the maximum hours of work and to the normal hours.  We have tabled amendments to deal with both cases and to say any more at present would be unnecessary repetition.  We feel this is desirable.  The Minister has it within his power on this occasion to produce a progressive document.  This is one aspect in relation to which he can be progressive.  I do not think he should tie a young person of 16 or so to the 50 hour per week tag.  A variety of reasons have been given as to why he should not do so.  Deputy Moore made the excellent suggestion that the maximum hours should be the norm of the adult worker and, as he said, this would create a situation which would bring the matter into focus in a distinct way.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to accept our amendment.  I shall not say any more on it but we shall press it if the Minister does not concede acceptance.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling says he understands the difference between the normal and the maximum, and he understands fully also that on the maximum front it cannot be compared to what happens in normal collective bargaining.  In any protective legislation there is set down the figure, the hour, or the condition which must be met and, failing its being met, there follows an infringement and penalties ensue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us here who watch legislation in any area appreciate that that kind of legislation may not be compared with the ongoing situation that we know around us because, in one case, we are saying that if such a condition is not complied with the law is <Col N="224" /> broken.  Obviously, conditions of that kind must be pitched a little less accurately, a little off target, in terms of the conditions we know around us than if there were no penalties attached to the infringement.  That has been the difficulty that faced us here.  In other sections of this legislation we have discussed Deputies have noted the difference between the reality and what we have set out to do.  That was noteworthy in earlier sections this morning.  Deputies had nothing to say on what the central part of the legislation should be, at what age we should commence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we come to a point where we talk about the setting of maximum hours beyond which an employer permitting employment would be breaking the law, penalties would follow, and we find Deputies opposite saying that the maximum hours should be lower in comparison with the hours they know operating in industry.  Deputies acquainted with the subject know that the hours worked in industry are the freely wrought bargain of employer and union, that it is a matter which may in fact be changed within the next few weeks if there is any central bargain between employers and unions. It is a tardy progress always after the actual changes made in hours, wages or anything else.  The maximum are always way behind these conditions.  In this case, over the year, we have on average kept reasonably within prospect of the actual bargain negotiated in the labour market&mdash;the average of 45 around the year is a not unreasonable target with which to have commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> Depending on developments and consultation with groups interested it will be possible to review those maximum hours.  In fact, I have every confidence that it will be possible in the very near future to do so.  I am merely making the point that I consider it a little unreasonable, certainly unrealistic, of Deputies who do appreciate the true situation to adopt the attitude they have been adopting in this discussion because the argument would not appear to bear out that approach.  Therefore, one is left in the position of asking exactly why this approach should be adopted when one considers the facts of the case.  Deputy Dowling put forward <Col N="226" /> some argument about a threat to adult employment.  I do not know what he means by that actual situation.</P>

This amendment achieves that purpose and will operate as an additional constraint on possible instances of excessive working.  That gives an average working week of 45 hours.</P>

      <P>We cannot allow the Minister to bring in legislation which will permit exploitation.  We have underlined that in regard to the section on which we have just divided.  Here again there is the same argument about 45 hours over the yearly period and 47½ hours over the monthly period. This is far too long.  The 1936 Act needs to be updated.  That is 40 years ago.  We have come a long way in 40 years.  When we come to section 9 we shall be having a full discussion on this whole question.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at this in relation to present circumstances, in relation to modern trends in industry and in relation to what is likely to take place in the weeks to come when the <Col N="229" /> new agreement will be drawn up.  We are falling behind.  Why should our young people be victims of our legislation? Substantial improvements have taken place in working conditions over 40 years, and we are not moving with the times.  This figure of 2,160 hours will have to be reduced considerably before we are satisfied.  We divided on the last provision and we must be consistent in our actions.  Under this amendment it is possible for a child of 16 to be working for a year at 45 hours per week.  We are surprised the Minister did not take a more radical step in this regard.  Could the Minister give us an assurance that he will have a look at this with a view to making some modification in it?  Would he agree to withdraw his amendment and give the matter further consideration?</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of section 7 provides that:</P>
      <P>The hours of work specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of this section may be varied by an agreement or by regulations made by the Minister: provided that, under any such agreement, or by such regulations the maximum number of hours to be worked by the young person in any period of four consecutive weeks does not exceed one hundred and ninety hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement referred to is a collective agreement or a registered employment agreement.  That is all right but I am concerned regarding <Col N="231" /> an agreement involving young people because of the possibility of there not being a trade union working on their behalf.  It is important that there be no loopholes in this Bill but there is the real danger that the Bill may inhibit the employment of young people.  That is something we must guard against and that is why I see a danger in this subsection.  I accept the definition of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; but I am concerned with the possibility of an agreement being reached between an employer and a group of young people.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider the subsection.  I want to guard against an agreement being reached without there being reference to the definition of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b), page 6, line 52, to delete &ldquo;forty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty-six&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister can be really serious about this section.  It refers to the maximum number of hours for people between 15 and 16. We considered that 50 was too great and that 40 should be the figure for 16- to 18-year-olds.  It is completely out of the question to have a person of 15 working a 40-hour week and a nine-hour day.  We should be more progressive at this stage in relation to child labour.  This is a most vulnerable group of people.  We propose to substitute 36 for 40 and even the 36 hours would be regarded as excessive by some people.  I hope the Minister will indicate to the House that he would not expect a child of 15 to work nine hours a day and 40 hours a week.  Surely that would tax a young person beyond his capacity.  We would expect the Minister to introduce more enlightened legislation and we are amazed at the hours proposed here for a child of 15.  The House will have to decide whether it agrees with this piece of legislation which places young people at risk and does not move with the times.  We will be dealing with this again on the Report Stage and we will table a number of amendments. I hope the Minister will see the wisdom of this amendment and that he will keep in line with the <Col N="234" /> thinking of progressive employers.  I believe there are very few employers who would ask a child of 15 to work those hours.  I do not want to go over the ground we covered on amendment No. 8 but this is a still weaker section than the 16- to 18-year-olds.  Surely there should be some difference between the working week of a 15-year-old and that of an adult worker and most adult workers at present have a 40-hour week and many have a shorter working week.  The tendency is to reduce the hours further.  The hours specified in former Acts are of no concern here.  We want a progressive piece of legislation so that people in years to come can say we did a good job.  This is very far from what is required and we will not allow any Government or any Minister to open the way for the exploitation of young people.  This could do just that.  This is new legislation and even enlightened people may reflect and say: &ldquo;If that is what the Government's view is why should we consider the workers who are seeking a shorter working week if the maximum for young children of 15 is set at this high figure?&rdquo;  We hope the Minister will see his way to reducing this to 36.  Even at 36 I am doubtful if the reduction is sufficient, but it will be an advance.  At the moment certain people are looking for a 35-hour week.  Some are working a 35-hour week.  To avoid any more smokescreens, may I point out that in another section we are also dealing with the age group 15 to 16 years and also the age group from 16 to 18 years of age.  I ask the Minister to be reasonable.  He probably feels a 40-hour week and a nine-hour day are excessive.</P>
    <P>We will be dealing with hours per week on the Report Stage and we shall have a great deal to say on the subject then.  I thought the Minister would be more liberal on the question of the maximum and this was put in as a basis for argument and the necessary amendments would follow.  We cannot support the idea of a child of 15 working a nine-hour day and a 40-hour week.  The Minister should be realistic and move with the times. He should not allow himself to be pushed back into the 1930s.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy's information, legislation governing the conditions of employment of young people lay untouched for years by the Deputy's party.  For almost 16 years they did absolutely nothing.  They did not make any attempt to amend legislation passed much earlier in the century. So committed were they to the conditions in existence that not one backbencher over that period of years raised any question about the desirability of amending the legislation.  In the same period the actual situation changed.  Unions and employers bargained for improvements.  I do not know if the party then in power had youth conferences but they ignored this whole area of legislation governing youth employment.  When we, late in the day, introduce legislation we are naturally suffering from the neglect in the past and right at the start there is difficulty in deciding the points of departure.  One can argue as to what should be the maximum hours in any particular week.  Existing legislation is based on the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, and the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1938 to 1942.  The earlier Acts from 1936 to 1944 deal mainly with industrial workers.  Later legislation deals with shops, hotels, restaurants and retail outlets.  A whole section was not covered by any legislation at all, almost one-third of the total at work, with maximum or normal hours of any sort.  There was no protection in legislation.  Under the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936 to 1944, for the under 16s it was an 11-hour day and a 40-hour week; in the case of shops and hotels it was a 50-hour week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation is quite an improvement on those conditions in areas of maximum hours.  To suggest that anyone on the Opposition benches can now argue that our credentials are wrong is really standing logic on its head.  This is reforming legislation, even if the maximum figures do not accord in every respect with what we know to be the actual situation on the ground.  I have explained more than once that the maximum figures are not the going figures.  The going figures are a different matter entirely. <Col N="236" /> When we come to the appropriate section I shall explain normal hours. I cannot see how in conscience Deputies opposite can argue that what they are suggesting comes from a record of concern and achievement in this area.  I rather think&mdash;I am sorry to so categorise their attitude&mdash;that this is bandwaggoning on a very weak basis of argument indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened attentively to the Minister, it is quite true that some sections in legislation were not changed over the years.  However, if the Minister casts his mind back to the early 1930s and the progressive development of industry, he will know there was need to bring in legislation to eliminate sweated labour.  Great advances were made from the point of view of legislation and down the years legislation was up-dated to ensure better conditions of employment.  The various Acts stand out.  There was the Conditions of Employment Act, the Holidays With Pay Act and the Redundancy Acts and various other Acts passed over the years.  It is wrong to say no attention was paid to the general area of worker concern.  What we are trying to do now is to keep abreast of modern trends.  Blame is no solution to the problem.  The further back we go the greater the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much legislation that needs to be up-dated.  It is wrong to say that members of the Opposition when they were on the Government back benches did not press for this.  I know Deputy Moore and many other trade unionists have been pressing constantly and some of the legislation that has emerged is a result of the pressure applied.  One has only to examine the legislation regarding conditions of employment, redundancy and various other matters to realise that we were concerned about the workers.  What we are doing now is up-dating legislation. We can point to good legislation passed in former years and we can point to legislation that went through this House in the last year and that is in need of up-dating at the moment. We can also point to legislation from the Department of Labour that, to our mind, is disastrous but that is another matter.  In years to come people may <Col N="237" /> say that the legislation regarding equal pay and other matters is bad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many of the workers will say it when the time comes for implementation.  We must keep abreast of the situation and in some instances we must move ahead.  Why should our workers and young people lag behind in relation to the conditions laid down in the Bill?  The conditions specified are inferior and we cannot allow the Government to enact that legislation. I am not blaming the Minister because I realise there are pressures and influences that prompt him to compromise. I think he is more progressive than the Bill indicates but, nevertheless, his attitude is a very conservative one, that we should not move with the times and that our people are not entitled to the best.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that our workers and young people are able to avail of the opportunities that present themselves&mdash;in this connection I am referring to educational opportunities also. Why should a person of 15 years be tied to a 40-hour week or a nine-hour day?  This is completely out-dated and I would ask the Minister to accept our amendment or to divide the House. We will not withdraw our amendment; we consider we have just and valid reasons to present it and we have given them to the Minister.  We are not going to allow young people to be discriminated against in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister claim credit for the introduction of legislation to cover the situation that arises now. I have also heard him criticise the previous Administration for not introducing legislation of this nature.  I came to working age during the period of the last Coalition Government and I can remind him of the situation that existed then.  At that time there were no opportunities for young people and unemployment was at a very high level.  Let us hope we are not returning to that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large section of this Bill is <Col N="238" /> devoted to governing young people working during school terms and holidays. Because of the progressive state of the country, achieved by the previous Government, young people have employment opportunities.  I remember when I was at school there were no such opportunities for young people.  We welcome the introduction of this legislation but it is the result of improvement of opportunities for young people, created by those who have gone before.</P>
    <P>We are legislating for young people of 15 years.  The Minister did not approve of my earlier amendment.  He thought the school-goer was being asked to do too much by working two four-hour days at weekends but now he is stating in this section that the 15-year-old person can work nine hours in any one day or 40 hours in a week.  Deputy Dowling's amendment appears reasonable.  In common with the Deputy I am not confused between the maximum and the normal hours of working.  I have always considered that there should be a close relationship between them, particularly with regard to people of 15 or 16 years.</P>
    <P>Our party has always worked for better conditions for our people and we regard 40 hours as an excessive period for a boy of 15 or 16 years, the equivalent of five eight-hour days. I would appeal to the Minister to accept Deputy Dowling's amendment. As I have stated, we know he is a progressive, young Minister.  We realise he has milestones tied to him and chains dragging him from the benches beside him but we ask him to accept the amendment and to prove himself to be working for the interests of the young people.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Minister's remarks regarding Deputy Dowling's amendment.  He has taunted this side of the House with not having introduced legislation on this subject but I think he has introduced legislation purely for the sake of change. That is wrong.  The Minister may think he is fulfilling a want but this Bill does not achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 (1) (b) is a dangerous section. <Col N="239" /> Perhaps the Minister would consider putting forward an amendment on Report Stage on the following lines: &ldquo;notwithstanding anything in this Bill no young person shall be permitted to work more than is permitted by the regulation governing adult workers&rdquo;.  This would get him out of trouble and it would save Deputy Dowling and others from submitting amendments on this matter.  The amendments put forward by Deputies Dowling, Fitzgerald and myself are for the purpose of protecting the young worker but we realise that the older worker should not regard them as a danger.</P>
    <P>If a young worker is allowed to work 50 hours a week the unscrupulous employer will regard him as cheap labour.  We want to protect this young person but we cannot do so at the expense of the adult worker.  The amendments put forward by Deputies Fitzgerald and Dowling would improve this legislation and I appeal to the Minister to tell us on Report Stage that he accepts the principle of the amendments proposed.</P>

      <P>I am not going to repeat the arguments.  I am not blaming Deputy Fitzgerald because he is a new Deputy, but whatever about the mid-fifties my point was that the record of the party in government in the sixties was dismal with regard to social legislation.  In my own case the situation is that I am far from finding restraint within this Government in the area of advance in social legislation. I am pressed forward by our objective of reforming in every area.  That is what I am seeking in this legislation.</P>
      <P>I do not make a point of simply arguing pro and con but against that dismal record of the Opposition Deputies in their period in Government in this area, an area untouched by them in legislation, I cannot accept the points made here in good faith. Personally, the Deputies opposite may not have been involved in that rather pitiable record of their party in the 1960s but they cannot, on the basis of that record, suggest an amendment today in the area of maximum hours under this section.</P>

      <P>The concern now is very real and if the Minister is trying to base his rejection of this amendment on the basis that legislation was not brought in in the past it is a poor argument.  Blame-placing is no solution <Col N="241" /> to the present problem.  We must face the situation as it is or as it will be in the future.  Legislation must be far reaching and not the type of legislation that would go out of date next week.  This Bill will do a grave injustice to the young people and we are not going to allow the Government to exploit young people as this Bill tends to do.  It is a poor argument for the Minister to indicate that because <Col N="242" /> something was not done in the past he does not accept the sincerity of the Members in opposition.  Does this mean that if he accepted the sincerity of the Members on this side he would accept the amendment?  We are going to stand by this amendment and if the Minister does not change his mind we will divide on the issue.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (a) (ii), page 7, line 10, to delete &ldquo;forty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty-seven and one-half&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We are now dealing with normal working hours.  The section provides:</P>
      <P>(1) In this section and in sections 5 and 10 of this Act, &ldquo;normal working hours&rdquo; in relation to an employee means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) if the employee is a young person over the age of sixteen years&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  eight hours in any day, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  forty hours in any week;</P>
      <P>We are beginning to wonder why the Minister hates young people so much. We have seen this in other sections when he insisted that he would not reduce the maximum from 50 hours to 40 hours in the case of 16- to 18-year-olds and he would not reduce the maximum working week for 15-to 16-year-olds either.  The Minister said earlier that there was some confusion in our minds about the maximum working hours and the normal working hours.  There is no confusion at all.  We are concerned that young persons be fully and adequately protected under this Bill.  As we indicated earlier, we had hoped that the Minister would introduce enlightened legislation for young people.  Now we find that we are back in the Dark Ages and the normal working hours for a child of 16 are eight hours in any day and 40 hours in any week.</P>
      <P>As was pointed out, the EEC directive indicates that the normal working week for adult workers should not exceed 40 hours and that it should apply to all sections of the community before 31st December, 1975.  But the Minister and the Government feel that young persons at the tender age of 16 should work 40 hours a week on the basis of an eight-hour day.  We are expected to support a measure for the protection of young people that victimises young people, a measure that does not move with the times and which is, in fact, a step backwards.  Is the Minister serious in suggesting that a young person aged 16 should work a normal week of 40 hours and work an eight-hour day?  We think far more of the young people than that.  The Victimisation of Young People Act, 1974, would be a more appropriate title if the hours specified here as the normal working hours are carried by the House.  The Government will have to stand up and be counted on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a difference between a person of 16 and an adult worker. Most, if not all, adult workers are at present working a 40-hour week while some have a 36- or a 35½-hour week. Many people with progressive employers are working less than 40 hours but the Government indicate in this Bill that the normal working week for a child of 16 should be 40 hours.  There is no use in the Minister referring to the 1936 Act which is 40 years out of date. We have come a long way since then. We are now in a very enlightened age and if there was a reduction in hours <Col N="245" /> on a weekly and on a daily basis many young people could divert their activities into educational fields where opportunities exist which they would wish to avail of.</P>
    <P>We hope the Minister will change his mind on this section.  He is fully aware that the normal working week for the adult is 40 hours and there is no confusion in our minds between the maximum and the normal working week.  We are dealing with persons aged 16 to 18 here and we hope the Government will be realistic and look to the future and realise that progress will be made.  This Bill does not take that into consideration.  What will the young people say when they read through this measure when&mdash;if ever&mdash; it becomes an Act and see what it provides? It can only become an Act by the force of numbers in this House because no reasonable person would accept the situation it envisages.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Government hate young people.  Apparently, this Bill is to victimise young people.  We will not stand for it.  The Minister has the opportunity of reducing the hours on the reasonable basis suggested in my amendment or asking the House to divide.  He can then use the forces at his disposal to bring about acceptance of his 40-hour week.</P>
    <P>Deep down, the Minister probably feels as I do but he should be his own man and say: &ldquo;I agree that we have progressive elements in the country moving towards a shorter working week for adults and that even if 40 hours is the norm at the moment it will not be long so, that there will be a reduction.&rdquo;  We have given the reasons why there will be a reduction &mdash;mechanisation, industrialisation, people seeking more leisure hours. Reducing the normal working week to 35 hours would allow more people to participate more fully in employment. This trend of thought is found among many responsible employers and trade unionists at present.  There are responsible employers who have already reduced the normal working week to less than 40 hours.  This Bill indicates no difference between the adult and the child of 16.  That is victimisation of the young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> My amendment may not go far enough&mdash;37½ hours.  It is purely an expression of disapproval of the Minister's 40 hours per week proposal and while it would be a step in the right direction it may not go far enough. The Minister must decide now whether he wants to force through his proposal for a 40-hour week as the norm, as laid down in the Bill. On Report Stage of the Bill we shall deal with the eight hour day which the Bill also specifies.  The Minister is aware of all the arguments and there is no need for me to say more except to ask him to be practical and realistic in relation to the young persons he proposes to protect and is, in fact, victimising in this section of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling has made what I think is an unanswerable case for his amendment.  No section of this Bill is more conservative and out of date than this section.  It is inconceivable that a Minister in a Government in 1975 in this country should think that a normal working week of 40 hours is the type of normal working week to introduce by legislation for a 16-year-old boy or girl. A working week of 37½ or 35 hours is commonplace in many fields. Surely when introducing legislation we cannot relate the 16-year-old boy or girl to the adult worker who has been on a 40-hour week for some considerable time and whose aim is to be on a shorter week. Many of them are already on a shorter week and many more will be.  It certainly is an outdated section.  I would appeal also to the Minister not to divide the House on it but to say that for once he will step out of line, he will not be drawn back by the elements within the Government that he fully agrees and accepts are preventing him from introducing legislation I know he would like to bring in if he were his own master.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two hundred and forty-nine members of the Garda Síochána have been appointed to the traffic corps since it <Col N="249" /> was extended to areas outside Dublin early in 1973.  The corps is now operational in all Garda divisions.  Since the corps was extended applications for transfers to other duties were made by 16 of its members and these were granted.  A further five members were promoted to positions outside the corps.  Twelve of the members who left the corps have already been replaced.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to expand the Dublin unit of the corps, which has been in existence since 1952 and which at present consists of 58 members, in the near future by 50 gardaí and to allocate six additional cars to it.  The expansion of the Dublin unit will be finalised in a few months' time as soon as suitable accommodation, at present being prepared, is ready for occupation.</P>
    <P>I should say also that the operations of the traffic corps are under continuous review and if an expansion appears to be warranted in any area an effort will be made to provide for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, could the Minister state if he is aware of a report in the <i>Garda Review</i> in connection with this?  Is there a lack of opportunity afforded to members of the traffic corps to earn overtime of the type a normal guard might earn because they are in a specialised corps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there was a newspaper report which stated that the traffic corps was being wound up which, of course, is completely wrong.  This is not happening.  There is no intention of allowing it happen and, as far as I am aware, there is no difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the <i>Garda Review.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that these people have the same opportunity of earning the maximum fee as have the others?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed.  I am quite happy that members of the Garda <Col N="250" /> traffic corps are treated in exactly the same way as other members of the force.  The suggestion that there were large-scale resignations is completely wrong.  As I have said, since the corps was extended, applications for transfers were made by 16 members and five members were promoted, a total of 21.  Of that total, 12 have already been replaced.  This is an on-going thing.  There is no dissatisfaction or reduction of morale in that corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the high incidence of tragedies in the Dublin city area, the Minister has indicated that steps will be taken to deal with this matter in a matter of months.  But there is an urgency about this.  Can the Minister indicate whether or not arrangements could be made to deal with the supervision of people who cross the roads today?  Also, could he indicate whether there is a problem arising out of traffic instructors being downgraded in regard to benefits?  Can he give the House any information in particular in regard to the training school in Clontarf?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe has a question later on the Order Paper dealing with the last point raised by Deputy Timmons.  With regard to the first point made by Deputy Timmons I am well aware of the need for expansion of the traffic corps in Dublin. As I have indicated in reply to the question, provision has been made for an extra 50 gardaí to be allocated to the corps, together with six additional cars.  Headquarters for this corps are almost ready for occupation and, as soon as it is completed, it will be occupied and the full corps will be in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that so many Members of the House have read this report in regard to the lack of earning capacity of members of the traffic corps in comparison with ordinary members of the Garda Síochána, would the Minister look into this and make sure there is no unfairness to them or lack of opportunities afforded them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I am informed by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána that there has been no marked increase in complaints to the Garda about the incidence of vandalism in the Greenhills/Walkinstown area and that no reports have been made to the Garda of attacks on young children in the area during the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>As in other areas of Dublin, a certain amount of vandalism is caused mainly by youngsters of between 12 and 15 years of age.  I should like to repeat that I believe this is a problem that is best dealt with by parents, teachers and local community leaders. Action by them can be much more effective in instilling a sense of civic responsibility in the young people of their areas than any Garda activity.</P>
      <P>The Garda intend to continue to give attention to the area by way of beat duty and mobile patrols.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Portlaoise Prison Conditions.</Title>
    <P>17.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will restore conditions in Portlaoise Prison to those which prevailed before December, 1974, in respect of visits, food parcels, letters and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply to a parliamentary question on 16th January, I indicated that already by then there had been a restoration of the position as regards letters and that it was expected that general visits would be restored probably in about a week. In fact visits have been restored in accordance with that forecast, namely since Friday, 24th January.  A public statement to that effect was issued at the time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to misunderstand the position about food parcels, as food parcels were not being permitted before December.  They were prohibited&mdash;except for a few special occasions, that is to say Christmas, Easter and Hallowe'en&mdash;in the aftermath of the August break-out in the course of which explosives were used. It is not proposed to restore them.  In this connection, I would like, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, and for the information of Deputies, to circulate with this reply a copy of a Government statement of Friday 24th January, relating to this and other matters regarding Portlaoise Prison.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">PORTLAOISE PRISON.</P>
      <P>1.  A group of prisoners in Portlaoise Prison are now on hunger strike, some for just over three weeks and others for over a week. One of the prisoners is reported by the Medical Officer to be weak and another very weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  According to the information supplied by the prisoners to the Prison Authorities, this hunger strike is designed to secure the restoration <Col N="260" /> of food parcels, the exclusion from the Prison of certain prisoners, an alteration in search procedures in a way that would make searches practically useless, and a number of other objectives including some which would adversely affect prison security.</P>
    <P>3.  The Government are concerned at the possibility that this hunger strike may be further prolonged in the hope that such concessions will be granted.  Consequently, in the interests of the prisoners themselves, the Government wish now to reiterate, publicly and unequivocally, their policy in this matter.  No concessions can or will be made either in relation to food parcels or in relation to the fundamental question of the right of the Executive to decide what prisoners are to be housed in particular prisons.  Neither can any concession be made on any other issue that involves security in the Prison.  The Government wish to recall that as recently as August last, there was a mass break-out from the Prison involving the use of explosives that had been smuggled into the Prison and in fact it was that break-out that directly led to the abolition of food parcels.  Against that background, there can be no question of any diminution of security measures.</P>
    <P>4.  In so far as the hunger strike may be claimed to include in its objectives matters such as educational facilities, craft-work, etc., there is no issue of principle as far as the Government are concerned, though materials supplied for craft-work, etc., were used in the making of imitation prison uniforms and facilitated the August break-out.  Provided the prisoners are willing to co-operate in their use, it is the intention to provide better educational facilities and to provide such craft materials as can reasonably be provided without endangering security.</P>
    <P>5.  It is not the Government's intention to issue any further statements as to their determination to maintain the position as now stated This statement is issued so as to remove any possible doubt as to the <Col N="261" /> Government's position and in this way to reduce the risk of a loss of life occurring owing to a miscalculation or misunderstanding either by the prisoners themselves or by persons outside who may be able to influence them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question three weeks ago but because of the procedure of the House it is not being taken until today.  At the time I put down the question prisoners were sleeping three on the floor of each cell and they had had no change of clothing since before Christmas.  In view of what the Minister has said and having regard to the statements that have come from the prison, I am not denying there is doubt as to the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy raises a number of points.  If I might mention this matter of the member of the Council of State, the particular member visited the prison about a fortnight ago on a visit to a prisoner.  With regard to the general question he raises that there is a doubt, there is a doubt in the minds of those who are not prepared to accept the word of a Government Minister over the word of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister <Col N="262" /> whether all the restrictions mentioned in the question were imposed for the purpose of security and, if so, and I presume that is so, how is it and is there an explanation for the recent alleged find of explosives in the prison in Portlaoise since the parcels which seemed to have been the offenders in the past were no longer being received or allowed to be received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent finds&mdash;and they were not alleged as the Deputy implies, they were actual&mdash;highlight the need for a continuing and even higher degree of security in this particular prison.  The restrictions other than those relating to parcels, the temporary restriction on visits and mail, were a consequence of the disorder in the prison following the riot on 29th December when for some weeks following that riot, prison staff were fully engaged in restoring conditions in the prison.  For that reason visits and mail were restricted.</P>

      <P>The provision of emergency accident facilities for North County Dublin is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. St. Ita's Hospital is a psychiatric hospital and would not have staff or facilities of the type needed to provide an emergency accident service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a statement on a letter (copy supplied) from the Irish Pharmaceutical Union regarding members of that union who have decided to withdraw from the general medical services scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together. I propose, with the indulgence of the House, to set out in some detail the present position about the difficulties which have arisen in relation to the continuing provision of their services by doctors and pharmacists in the general medical service.</P>
      <P>So far as doctors are concerned, they are paid fees per items of service. This has been in operation since the scheme commenced.  A fee of 80p is paid for a visit by a patient to the doctor's surgery in normal hours.  A higher range of fees applies to consultations in the patient's house and higher fees are specified for work outside normal hours and for work at night.  The amount of the fee for domiliciary consultation depends on the time at which it is made and the distance the patient lives from the doctor's residence.  The maximum fee payable at present is £5.25 for a call made between midnight and 8 a.m. to a person living more than ten miles from the doctor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June last, the medical organisations sought an increase in the basic fee from 80p to £2, an increase of 150 per cent, with <i>pro rata</i> increases in other fees.  If this claim were conceded, the highest fee would have been £13.13 instead of £5.25.  After I had considered the claim, I informed the medical organisations that I was not willing to concede it and by agreement it was referred to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement made with my predecessor. The arbitrator, having considered the claim, issued his award on 22nd November, recommending a basic surgery fee of 90p and increases in the other fees.  He recommended that the fee for a domiciliary consultation during normal hours in an urban area should be raised to £1.35 and that the maximum fee should be raised from £5.25 <Col N="274" /> to £7.  These higher fees would operate retrospectively to 1st October, 1973.  The medical organisations informed me on 10th January that they had rejected the arbitrator's award which I would, in accordance with the normal practice of this Government, have been willing to accept.</P>
    <P>I met the representatives of the medical organisations on 16th January and explained to them that, in relation to the period covered by the arbitrator's award, that is, from 1st October, 1973, to November, 1974, I could not justify going beyond his recommendations.  I did, however, make it clear that I was willing to review the fees in relation to increases which had taken place after the date of the arbitrator's award in wages and salaries under the national wage agreement.  This, I might mention, is a fundamental change in earlier practices whereby fees, when fixed, operated for a long time without revision.</P>
    <P>I set out the effect of these changes in a detailed letter which I issued to both medical organisations and a copy of which I have placed in the Library. The net effect of the changes which I proposed to make in the fees would have been that, from 1st March the basic surgery fee would be increased by 34 per cent to £1.07 and the maximum fee would rise from £5.25 to £8.18, an increase of 56 per cent.</P>
    <P>It may help Deputies to put the matter in perspective to know that, from the existing ranges of fees, the average gross income of a doctor, in the year ending 30th June, 1974, was £5,280, in respect of an average of 950 patients.  A full-time practice would contain about two-and-a-half times that number of patients.  That amount would, under the arbitrator's award, increase to £6,055 and my later proposals would mean that a doctor could earn £7,323 in gross income in the year after 1st March next.</P>
    <P>This average sum of £7,323 would be gross remuneration from the general medical services.  A deduction has to be made from it for practice expenses but I would emphasise that it is part-time remuneration, covering services for about one-third of the population. In addition to it, general practitioners <Col N="275" /> receive private fees in respect of the remaining two-thirds.  They may also receive payments in respect of items not covered under the general medical services, such as payments under the maternity and infant care scheme, employment on a part-time basis in hospitals and fees for social welfare certificates.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the practice in the past has been to review fees at a yearly or longer intervals.  In agreeing to make upward revisions in fees in accordance with changes taking place in salaries under the National Wage Agreement, I was taking a new step and one which I had hoped would be accepted by the medical profession as an honest attempt to meet, in a reasonable manner, the claim which they made, without departing from the principle of accepting arbitrators' awards where they are made.  It is a matter of regret to me that the councils of the medical organisations should have rejected this approach and advised their members to submit resignations from the service.  However, my letter setting out my position has been sent to participating doctors and I hope they will consider it carefully before taking final action.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I think it is important that contact be maintained with the organisations.  Accordingly, my Department have invited the secretaries of the organisations to an early meeting mainly with a view to being quite clear on the decisions taken.</P>
    <P>To turn to the pharmacists, they are paid on the basis of a fee for each item dispensed, plus a refund of the cost of drugs and an amount in respect of containers and other costs. These fees were negotiated by my predecessor at the time the scheme commenced.  The current inclusive fee is 20p per item dispensed, 17p being in relation to the provision of the service and 3p being an amount calculated to cover the cost of containers, obsolescence and capital involvement. In June last they made a submission that the fee thus negotiated was entirely inadequate and asked for a new fee of 78p, of which 60p would be for <Col N="276" /> professional services and 18p to cover container costs, and so on.  The net effect of this claim would have been to increase the total expenditure on fees for pharmacists from £1.75 million annually to £6.78 million.</P>
    <P>A number of meetings took place on this claim but the pharmacists did not satisfy me that it was reasonable. To meet circumstances just such as this, my predecessor had written into the arrangements for the scheme that, where the two sides could not agree on an adjustment of the fees, the matter would be referred to an agreed arbitration board.  On 4th October last, I put it to the pharmacists that this was then the best course to follow. It is a matter of regret and surprise to me that they decided not to go ahead with the obligation thus accepted with my predecessor, and decided instead to recommend to their members that they should resign from the scheme.  The Pharmaceutical Union have collected resignations from members and submitted them to health boards on 21st January.</P>
    <P>It appears that approximately 79 per cent of the pharmacists in the scheme have submitted their resignations, the percentage of those who have resigned varying as between health board areas.</P>
    <P>I would make it clear to the House that I would not be opposed to some adjustment in the pharmacists' fees. As in the case of the doctors, I accept that they have fallen out of line with increases to others given in accordance with the national pay agreements.  However, it did not seem appropriate to open discussions on this matter with the pharmacists, having regard to the magnitude of their claim and the acceptance in the agreement that disagreements should go to arbitration.  I thought then, and I still think, that, both from their point of view and mine, the speediest resolution of the outstanding issues can be achieved through an agreed arbitration.  It is, I would mention, quite common practice for the official side to ask that a claim should go to arbitration without an offer being made.  I could cite many recent examples of this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> In notifying me of their decision, the Pharmaceutical Union have said that they are available to meet me at any time.  I propose to ask them to meet me soon to discuss the situation generally.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have received a letter dated 28th January, 1975, sent by the secretary general of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union to members of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I do not propose to discuss all the points made in this letter.  Many of them are, indeed, points which have been made in the discussions with the Department and could appropriately be made to an arbitrator.  I would say, however, that a guarantee was never given that no more than 900,000 persons would be eligible for the scheme.  What was agreed jointly was that the conditions accepted would relate only to a situation where there would be &ldquo;no significant change in the percentage of population now eligible for the service&rdquo;. The percentage has increased somewhat but whether in the context of the agreement the increase is significant is arguable.  It must also be remembered that the population has increased in the meantime, so that some increase in the number covered could have been expected even if the percentage had remained absolutely static.</P>
    <P>Again, I am afraid I have not been very much impressed with the argument which was also put forward in the negotiations, that the Department had insisted that the scheme was a simple one and that this had turned out not to be the case, thereby justifying a very big increase in fees.  The negotiators from the pharmacists should have known very well what was involved in the scheme, because it was discussed in detail over very many meetings.  Many pharmacists had experience in the dispensary service and this experience should also have helped them in understanding what was involved.  I would mention too that in the practical arrangements for the scheme, my Department did everything possible to make paper-work and administrative commitments as simple as possible and that, during the operation of the scheme, there has been ready willingness to discuss these <Col N="278" /> with the pharmacists and to adapt them where this is possible.</P>
    <P>The union's letter states why they decided not to &ldquo;proceed with the process of arbitration&rdquo;.  I think it is as well to put on record for the House the actual provision in the original agreement made by my predecessor for review.  This was:</P>
    <P>The fees proposed in the foregoing paragraphs will operate for at least one year after the full implementation of the scheme and will be reviewed not later than two years after the initial introduction of the scheme. The review will be carried out by the Department of Health in conjunction with the joint negotiating committee and, if agreement is not possible at that level, the matter will be referred to an agreed arbitration board.  The board will have authority to take into account all relevant factors including charges in general price and income levels.  The arbitration board will also have power to make a retrospective adjustment in the fees if the experience in the operation of the scheme satisfied it that this is appropriate.</P>
    <P>With provision for an arbitration board with such a wide remit as this, it is not easy to accept the union's reasons for not going to arbitration.</P>
    <P>I would now turn to a fundamental issue relating to the pharmacists' participation in the scheme.  The 1966 White Paper on the Health Services and their Further Development left open two possibilities for supplying drugs and medicines to those in the lower income group&mdash;issue through public depots or issue through private pharmacies.  The latter was ultimately accepted on the understanding that it would be an economical way of distributing these drugs and medicines.  The extra cost of meeting the claim now made by the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, whatever the merits of that claim, would be such that I would have to look again at the choice between the two possible alternatives for issuing drugs and medicines which was made by my predecessor. The Pharmaceutical Union, in writing to me, have stated &ldquo;in the exercise of their professional responsibility, they believe that arrangements should be <Col N="279" /> made by agreement to ensure that medical card holders will not be deprived of essential drugs and medicines in the ensuing period&rdquo;, that is the period after 21st April, 1975.  I shall be glad to discuss this matter with them.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the House to join me in urging these two professions to look at their situation in the context of the general economic position with which we are now faced.  Doctors and pharmacists are not unreasonably remunerated and have secure incomes. They are, like any other section of the community, entitled to act to protect their financial position and to maintain relativities which they have enjoyed.  But the current economic situation has required, and is continuing to require, moderation from all sections of the community.  It is not unreasonable for us to ask, from those sectors of it which enjoy higher levels of remuneration than average, a recognition of the fact that further improvement in their position can only be achieved at the expense of other sections of the community.  The extra annual Exchequer expenditure involved in meeting these claims would be about £13 million.</P>

      <P>I think we would all be very grateful to the Minister for that long review which he has given us of the present difficult situation.  However, it raises so many issues that it is difficult for me to pursue individual aspects of these two disputes with the Minister.  Perhaps I might at this stage give notice that I should like to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

Would the Minister agree that is so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If he agrees that is so, would he furthermore agree that since the changeover to administering these drugs and medicines service to the pharmacists has taken place, pretty universal satisfaction has been expressed by the general public as to the changeover of the services now rendered by the pharmacists' profession? Would the Minister agree with that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that there is no such evidence available to me.  I do not know whether that sort of evidence is available to the Deputy. Their ability is not in question. Frankly, what is in question is what the fees should be.  The Deputy has asked me to agree with him on certain things.  Would he agree that in accordance with the original agreement made by the late Deputy Childers where the two sides could not come to an agreement the matter should go&mdash;the actual words are &ldquo;shall go&rdquo;&mdash;to arbitration?  The pharmacists are not prepared to do that.  As I indicated in my reply, I am <Col N="281" /> quite willing to talk to them and to talk to the doctors' associations.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister also agree that he overstated the case when he referred to doctors having one-third of their patients on the medical services?  In fact I have 55 per cent and this must be the figure which obtains for the western seaboard. I think it is overstating the case against the doctors to say that they have just one-third.  Some doctors may, in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think I could be accused of overstating the case in favour of one or the other.  I tried to make the reply as objective as I could.  It is a fact that the 80-90p is the crunch figure but I think it is incorrect for the Deputy to say that one-third of the population only are catered for under the GMS scheme. <Col N="284" /> One-third is correct as far as the national average is concerned but when one goes over to the western counties the percentage is a bit higher. I should also say that in respect of some of the rural doctors who live in remote areas and cater for a certain population, there is an annual allowance for them also.</P>

    <Title>Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974: Committee Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 14:</P>
    <P>In subsection (1) (a) (ii), page 7, line 10, to delete &ldquo;forty&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty-seven and one-half&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Dowling.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the possible recommendation at EEC level. That recommendation has to become a directive and that may take some time.  I would point out that the normal hours referred to in the section as drafted refer to the problem that the majority of these young people work in areas and services where it would not be accurate to suggest that the going normal week in all cases is, in fact, at the 40 hour mark.  In many of the industries and services where they work, the 40 hour week would not be what operates there at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, we think that the figure we have put down here is an advance over the old position.  It marks a decided improvement.  I have the power at a later stage to amend it again. This is a power to which I referred before in other sections and it applies on this section also.  There is no bar on ordinary negotiations producing a lower normal hour in this area.  We are again in the familiar situation, as we are in many other sections of this <Col N="286" /> legislation, in which the minimum, the norm, the medium can be compared with the actual better situation in a particular section of industry.  The point may be made why, therefore, not make these exactly identical in all respects with a better figure in a particular pocket of industry or even over a sector of industry.  The answer to that question is that when one is dealing with desirable change in social legislation, the legislation should lift the horizons and objectives we have.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied this Bill does that in the terms it sets out to achieve and in the improvements it sets out to gain.  I know the Deputies opposite query its usefulness in terms of whether the objectives will be achieveable. In that sense they accept that it sets out to make a real improvement and marks a decided change for the better from the existing legislation which is very much out-of-date.</P>
    <P>Again, I would emphasise that the normal is simply what we set down as an average, a mean, which we think is a realistic and good one.  It marks a decided improvement and at the same time it is no bar against the ordinary bargaining situation.  It does not impede employers, unions or those who organise people in this category from getting better conditions.  As we look at the changing scene&mdash;and it is one which is fast changing&mdash;I have the power to alter even in this area. Therefore, I could not accept the Deputy's amendment.  He may have a division if he wishes.</P>
    <P>The Government stand here as the people who introduced this legislation. We had some argument earlier when we were contrasting previous records and I do not reject this amendment because of the previous record of the Deputy's party when they were in office.  That would be a very childish reason for rejecting any amendment. I reject it simply on the basis of the case which the Deputy has presented. I have a pretty good record, as the Deputy knows, for accepting amendments which are reasonable and improve legislation.  I have no particular hang-up that every section of a Bill which I bring into the House must be enacted into law precisely as I have <Col N="287" /> introduced it.  That would be to devalue the whole point of contribution in the Oireachtas from Deputies elected by the votes of the people. However, I must say that I do not see much merit in the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <P>With respect to him it is at times unavoidable for Opposition Deputies not to be forced to trail their coats, as the Deputy opposite is forced to trail his coat on this amendment.  I quite understand the circumstances which force him to do that.  I know that the Deputy is aware that it is simply a question of trailing his coat. Therefore, I reject his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made our attitude clear in relation to this amendment.  The Minister has suggested that the normal working week is 40 hours in all cases.  That may be so but if one is to take the average of the personnel employed at the moment I am quite sure it would be below 40 hours per week.  The majority of responsible employers operate a 40-hour week.  Many employers operate a 35 and a 38-hour week.  The Minister is well aware of this.  Why does he confuse the situation now by speaking about a mean average?  We dealt with two sections of the Bill.  One dealt with the normal working hours so we must deal with this.  As I pointed out, the eight-hour day and the 40-hour week have been achieved for adult workers.  We are specifying this as the norm for children of 16. This is unthinkable.  It is quite true the Minister is not dogmatic in his approach to this Bill.  He has accepted our amendments from time to time.  I wonder why he is so dogmatic about the retention of this subsection.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister feels this is really necessary. Our amendment is much more suitable than the subsection in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is for the protection of young people.  The legislation must be forward in its outlook.  One would expect to have these hours in a Bill introduced ten years ago.  I cannot understand, in view of the changing attitudes of employers and trade <Col N="288" /> unions, the social policies of the EEC and the general movement for a 40-hour week why the Minister would insert into the Bill a section authorising an eight-hour day and a 40-hour week for a child of 16.</P>
    <P>We have passed that stage, and whatever the Government in the past may have done, or may not have done, they are not legislating for the future.  We are, it is our problem now.  It is not the problem of the previous Government; it is the problem of this House today and we must measure up to our responsibilities. We must show the young people that we are concerned about their future. We are concerned about their leisure; we are concerned about the amount of time they may have to devote to the educational opportunities which are available to many young people and are taken up by many young people after working hours.  Adult education courses have been pursued by many young people and if this legislation is regarded as progressive by the Minister, then he is taking a backward step every day.  We must protect young people to the maximum possible extent.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to confuse this House when he speaks about the mean average, about the facts, about the norm.  We know exactly what the situation is.  There is a normal working week and there is a maximum number of hours that one may work. These are the two factors.  Depending on the maximum number of hours, the maximum was too great in the case of children from 15 to 16 years and again from 16 to 18 years. We asked Members of the House to reject the subsection in the Bill that the Minister has inserted, and the House refused our request.  Now we come to the normal working day. Again we asked the Minister to be fair and reasonable to the young people, to have a forward looking approach to this problem.  Do not have people saying in two years' time that this Bill was introduced two years ago, that that particular section was even then out-of-date, because it will be out-of-date before it gets through the two Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> I thought the Minister would be a little more realistic.  There may be pressures on him.  I do not deny that there is a variety of pressures, but his concern now should be to make the best of this Bill.  We will give him every assistance possible to ensure that this Bill does justice to the cause that he is hoping to help.  It is our desire to do this.  We cannot at this stage agree with the situation where young people of 16 would be tied to a normal working week of 40 hours.  The Minister must agree that there must be some difference accepted between young people of 16 to 18 years and adult workers.  There must be a difference in pressures, a difference in values and we must take it into consideration in the assessment of the working week and the daily hours of work.</P>
    <P>I have already given all the reasons prior to Question Time.  I ask the Minister to give these points sincere consideration.  I felt the Minister was not sincere in the comments he made, because I believe that deep down the Minister would be more in favour of my amendment than he is with that particular section of the Bill.  I genuinely believe that he may be defending the situation.  I do not blame him for this.  There are people who force him to defend it and who will come into the House and vote.</P>
    <P>The young people will see that the Government are not progressive in their outlook, that they are not concerned with the future, that they are not concerned about their leisure time.  We want to ensure that this Bill when it leaves the House will be a forward step and will be one that really can protect young persons.  I ask the Minister, once again, to think about the situation and to give a clear indication that he is in favour of establishing in a Bill that the normal working week of a young person of 16 years would be 40 hours in 1975.  This Bill will not come into force for many months and the discussions are still going on between the employers and the trade unions.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that by the time these discussions are terminated we may have a very different outlook in relation to the general situation and <Col N="290" /> to the normal working week of the average adult worker.  Here we have the opportunity of producing something beneficial to the young people and something beneficial to Dáil Éireann and we are failing to avail of the opportunity.  I know the Minister thinks my amendment is an effective one and one which he would like to support but because of pressures on him, he is supporting something he does not believe in.</P>
    <P>I hope that he is not going to victimise young people in the future by the insertion of this.  Irrespective of what power he has in the Act, once it specifies something that is what the employers will seek to enforce.  We spoke about the many employers who may be unscrupulous towards the young, who get the last possible ounce of work out of them within an Act.  Irrespective of what powers the Minister may think he has, if he feels that the Act is defective in some way, it may take some time to amend it.  During that period there can be victimisation of the young people.  I hope the Minister clearly understands this.  It is with sincerity we say this, not on the basis that we are in Opposition, not on the basis that we have to make a case.  We genuinely believe that when legislation of this nature comes before the House, we should endeavour to perfect it so far as possible and to ensure that it will be progressive legislation, not a step backwards.  This legislation is a step backwards into the Dark Ages when conditions such as these were imposed upon adults.  These are the conditions the Minister is now imposing on children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One would think from the Minister's lectures and admonitions here that he and he alone claimed credit for having a social conscience.  I say to him that the social conscience of the party and of the Members on this side of the House is far ahead of the social conscience of any people involved in this Government and has been for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know how he arrived at this average mean figure.  First of all, we are talking about a 16-year-old <Col N="291" /> basically.  He already said today that statistics are hindered by the fact that adequate facilities are not available to him.  How then does he arrive at a mean average figure for 16-year-olds? Surely he is talking about an imaginary figure for the normal working hour in the country at present, taking the average population into consideration and no amount of explanation can change what he is in fact doing, that for the 16-year-old he is setting, as Deputy Dowling said, a 40-hour normal working week as a basis, something that is outdated already and will certainly be archaic by the time this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are other points.  The Minister is now confusing the House.  This morning he was inclined to tell us that his only guideline for these figures was the fact that it was an improvement, and a substantial one on a Bill produced in the 1930s.  This was the basis this morning.  He now tells us &mdash;no.  His thinking has changed now. It is not because it is an improvement on the 1936 Act.  It is a mean average he has achieved.  What was the mean average?  On what basis was it achieved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We were talking about a different matter this morning when we were talking about maximum hours.  I have been stressing throughout that there is a difference between the maximum and the norm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>On the average hours worked in industry of course. In case the Deputy is forgetting I would point out that in other sections the employment here under this age group cannot be compared with that of adult employees because there are provisions in later sections relating to night work and rest periods which do not apply <Col N="292" /> in their case.  Again, I would repeat that I regard this as the normal working week, not the maximum which we were talking about this morning.  From this point on, overtime would be paid and at this normal rate.  I pointed out that much of the sector of industry in which this would be invoked would be a sector of industry where 40 hours would not be the normal working week even on the going free bargain between employers and unions.  Based on actual hours worked, I regard it as a fair bargain and it seems to me to be a fair move forward.  It is a fair minimum floor.  It takes into account current trends and I can take care of any changes in the future because I have the power under later sections by affirmative resolution to lower that norm.  On two grounds it cannot be comparable in employment content to that of other adult employees because there were different conditions attached which are spelled out in later sections. Again, I would appeal to Deputies not to confuse the maximum, which is an argument we had earlier, beyond which if there is infringement, legal penalties apply to the employer.  The norm simply sets the point that we regard as fair minimum hours of work per week to be worked by this category of young person.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot pretend to protect young people at the expense of adult workers.  This, again, could be <Col N="293" /> used against an adult worker.  We have heard about the big industrial concerns where the men have less than a 40-hour working week, but a young person could be employed there for more hours than those worked by the adult workers.  In section 2, subsection (3) the Minister may by order vary the hours of work specified which shows that he does not trust these figures here.  What we are asking the Minister to do is to make normal working hours the maximum for young people.  What the Minister is doing is increasing the hours.  If we have full employment this might correct itself by the law of supply and demand but as we all know there is far from a shortage of labour today. Therefore, young people who are looking for work will accept what is laid down by the Minister.  Unless the Minister amends this and accepts Deputy Dowling's amendment he will do more harm than good to young people.  I see the Minister looking at Deputy Dowling very hard as if he were Oliver Twist or someone in a Dickensian setting, looking for more. This Bill is bad in that respect.</P>
      <P>We suggested earlier to the Minister to say that, notwithstanding anything in this Bill, no young person shall work a longer working week than is normal for an adult as laid down in the various trade union agreements. We would be a lot happier voting for this Bill if Deputy Dowling's amendments were accepted.  The Minister makes the point that it has been 30 or 40 years since we had previous legislation on this.  It is like saying that we do not hang people for stealing sheep any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>But as I was pointing out to the Deputy, I cannot understand his argument about the problem of the adult versus the worker under 18 because in the situation described by him where the working week is, say 37 hours, of course the person involved would be working a 37-hour week.  What we are concerned about is the areas where there are no such bargains and where there are no trade unions.  In that case we prescribe 40 hours as the normal working week.  There is no problem <Col N="294" /> for a young person regarding the bargain of the 20-hour week if such were in existence.  The Deputy must understand that there is no difficulty for the young person who will benefit in this legislation being represented in the normal week described as 40 hours.  If he happens to be fortunate enough to be in an industry or service where the working week is 35 hours, naturally he will work the 35 hours in common with all others who benefit from the agreements of the unions in their industry.  But in a case where there is no union or where such a bargain does not exist to give them the benefit of this legislation, 40 hours a week would be the norm instead of what happens at present in such cases where unions do not operate and where they may be working any number of hours.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government they did nothing to protect young persons in that situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made a point I should like to take up. Assuming that the next wage agreement is worked out on the basis of a 37½-hour week or maybe less, he said that this would apply more to services than to industry as a whole. Does this mean, in effect, that the young person who is employed in a service would be working longer hours than the persons who are affected by a national wage agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised the Deputy should ask this question. He should know that if it had not been for the bargains brought about by the trade union movement in negotiations in recent years, hours of work and a lot of other matters would have lagged far behind because our legislation is not a substitute for the role of the free bargainers in our mixed economy.  That would mean the unions and the employers.  Obviously, <Col N="295" /> we have the situation at present that where a national agreement ordains a certain pay or certain hours of work, if the employer does not wish to comply with these in a non-union situation, we have no statutory means of ensuring that he will operate in accord with the national agreement. If the national agreement advances to a new front&mdash;to areas not represented by the unions&mdash;as I have been at pains to point out, I have power in a later section to amend both the law, the maximum and all the other areas which may be varied, with the permission of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We are facing a situation now where the average workers in general throughout this country will be working a 37½-hour week or maybe less while at the same time a child of 16 will be working a 40-hour week.  What we want the Minister to do is to accept either Deputy Moore's suggestion or accept my amendment, that is, that the normal working hours shall not exceed the norm of the adult worker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

But we do not prevent an improvement of the situation where unions get a better bargain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that where people are outside the scope of a union agreement the State must make sure they are protected. But the State is a tyrant in this case if this is what they call protection. This is no protection for the young child.  This is a worsening of conditions if anything.  It is not keeping abreast of the normal conditions the average worker has achieved.  The Minister must agree there is a difference between an average worker and a child of 16, just as there is a difference between a child of 15 and a child of 16.  This is admitted in the Bill by the variation in hours.  The Minister must take into consideration our endeavour to ensure protection of the sections who are unable to protect themselves.  They have not got the necessary facilities.  They would not be covered by the Act and probably would not be members of trade unions or associations.  The State is going to cradle these people and bring them along to superior conditions.  These conditions are not very superior.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a backward step and the Minister and indeed the Government, must accept this.  I hope the Minister will now say to the House that he is prepared to accept something that is reasonable for the young people of this country.  The young people deserve more than the Minister has proposed in this Bill.  The Minister has the Opportunity now and the young people will make up their minds and make their decisions based on the attitude of the Government and the Minister to their future.  I hope the Minister will change his mind.  I do not want to force the House into a division on this issue.  I hope the Minister <Col N="297" /> will be realistic and that he will say a mistake was made and that he accepts our amendment.  He will get more credit for that than he would for digging in on a section which would be a backward step and would not assist in the formation of constructive future thought.  It would be a step back into the Dark Ages to condemn children of 16 to a 40-hour week that has been passed by the great majority of our adult workers.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's compassionate feelings for the House, his concern that it should not be forced into a division but I regret that those sentiments were not in evidence before 1 o'clock, or 2 o'clock, when he called the House to two rapid divisions in that many minutes.  I do not know whether his Deputies have gone to take fresh air or not but as far as we are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I sympathise with him in that he must hang their record in this area on a flimsy amendment of this sort because it is a flimsy amendment and the Deputy knows it.  We have here the legislation which brings in the improvements and we have the hours per week worked on a normal and fair basis which do not hold up or impede improvements that may be gained elsewhere.  I do have the power to amend these provisions at a later stage when it would be appropriate but at present I regret I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy knows from experience that I have not been and do not like to be thought to be intransigent on any minor point or any point on which I could meet the Deputy but on this matter I am afraid I simply see the Deputy adopting a familiar Opposition ploy within a few days of his Ard-Fheis. I do not, therefore, intend to accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister continues to admonish us for introducing this amendment but if the Minister thinks back on his own argument he will realise that he is using the best argument we could possibly use for the amendment.  I know the Minister is embarrassed about the 40-hour situation and that he would dearly love, if he had the freedom from other members of his Government, to stand up here and say: &ldquo;I agree wholeheartedly with you.  We will not divide on it and I will accept your amendment,&rdquo; but his hands are tied.  The Minister said that 40 hours is there to provide for the people who are not organised.  The Minister said and has accepted that the working week is being reduced and we are still talking about the adult situation rather than the tender 16-year-olds. The Minister also said that the trade unions are quite entitled to negotiate for 35, 36, 37, 37½ hours or whatever it might be but that he is legislating for those who are not so organised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (b) (ii), page 7, line 14, to delete &ldquo;thirty-seven and one-half&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirty-two&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We pointed out to the Minister on the previous subsections that we will be bringing in further amendments on Report Stage in relation to the hours per day.  We feel that the eight working hours per day is far too long for people of this tender age.  It is far too long a number of hours for the Minister to specify in what will be an Act.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 37½-hour week, the Minister agrees that there is a difference in the working hours between the young person under the age of 16 and the person over the age of 16 to the extent of two-and-a-half hours.  The Minister did not agree that there was a difference between the person of 16 and the adult worker who maintains the 40-hour week.  We repeat that 37½ hours in any one week for a child of 15 years is completely unreasonable when most adult workers at the moment have a working week of 37½ hours and some have 40 hours.</P>
      <P>We are told the Government are the protectors of this very vulnerable section of society, the people under the age of 16 years.  The Government are supposed to protect these young people but yet they want them to work 37½ hours, the same normal work hours as are being enforced at the moment for responsible employers throughout the country.  The Minister did concede earlier on that point in the discussions that are now taking place between the employers and the unions and now there may well be an advance on the question of a reduction in the working week.  There is a tendency to reduce the working week and it will be reduced in time but the protectors of the young children&mdash;the Government&mdash;have decided that they are going to work the same hours as the adult workers.  There is no protection whatsoever for them. The same argument applies on these subsections as applied on the other subsections and possibly more so in this area in relation to a child of 15 years who wants as much leisure time as possible to take advantage of the educational, sporting and other facilities that may be available and in which he wants to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely unreasonable to have specified in the Bill that the normal working hours of a child of 15 years shall be 37½.  Possibly the Minister is being pushed because this is not his attitude.  It is a sorry state of affairs that at this stage when dealing with the most vulnerable section of society covered by the Bill the Minister would not stand up, be his own man and say: &ldquo;I agree with the amendment.  I agree that 37½ hours is too long to be the normal working hours of a child of 15 years.&rdquo;  I hope that at least in this subsection the Minister will be sensible but if it is necessary the House will have to divide.  We will see then who are the protectors of the young people.  There is absolutely no protection against the exploitation of these young people. Valid points have been made by <Col N="303" /> Deputy Moore in relation to the reasons why it is necessary that there would be a substantial difference between the adult worker and the child of 15 years.</P>
    <P>We are not living back in the Dark Ages.  This legislation is supposed to be progressive, dealing with the most vulnerable sections of society, people who are not covered by associations, by trade unions.  The Minister will agree that under this section the bulk of these workers are not covered by any association, or organisation, or trade union.  They have to rely on their protectors, the Government.  Here the Government clearly indicate that their normal work-hours will be 37½.</P>
    <P>The trend in Europe and at home with responsible employers is that the normal work-hours are 37½, and even less.  Is it reasonable that we should specify in a Bill that the normal work hours for these young children would be such as these?  I sincerely ask the Minister to accept our amendment, which suggests 32 hours.  This would be much better than 37½ hours.  It provides an hour a day at least in which people could use the facilities available. We hear so much about the furthering of education, of technical training, and of other facilities.  We can have all the educational facilities in the world for additional training and adult education but, if people have not the time, they cannot avail of them. I would ask the Minister to be realistic about this subsection.  We will deal with the eight hour day at a later stage, but we certainly cannot agree with the 37½-hour week, and we will not agree with it.</P>
    <P>We must hear the views of the Minister and the Government on the pressures he is subject to, the shackles binding him.  He should throw them off and show these people that their interests are being well looked after. Even if he reduced the hours to 32, some people might feel that that reduction was inadequate.  The Minister is as well aware as I am that many responsible employers operate a 37½-hour week for adult workers.</P>
    <P>I condemn the attitude of the Government <Col N="304" /> and the parties supporting them, to 16- to 18-year-olds.  They now have an opportunity to make amends to the people in the 15 to 16 age group.  I hope they will have a change of heart and a change of attitude and that the Bill can be rightly called the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill and not the Persecution of Young Persons Bill. as this could well turn out to be.</P>
    <P>There is no confusion whatsoever on the maximum hours of work of young persons and the normal work hours.  We are quite clear on this. No amount of white-washing will divert us.  We are sincere in our approach to this problem.  We want to ensure that this legislation will be improved by our efforts and by the collective efforts of this House.  We hoped we would get more co-operation on these amendments. I visualise that when we reach Report Stage the Minister may well introduce amendments to reduce the hours, based on the arguments we put forward on other sections.  Common sense dictates that to dig in on this aspect will not meet with the approval of the people who sent us here.  We want to hear from the protectors of these young people whether they are prepared to accept our amendment and to show some concern for this very young section of the community.</P>

      <P>I wonder could the Minister tell us how many hours in excess of the normal schoolday are proposed in the subsection here?  If we could align working hours to school hours, we could not very well kick against them.  I am not sure about schools hours, but I am sure they are about 37½ hours a week, and that might be a good guideline for the Minister.</P>

I would always prefer that situation to one in which I simply put down amendments with which Deputy Dowling has been associated and which he knows in all honesty are there for purposes of opposition cosmetics.  We understand that the Opposition must exercise themselves in this area.  That is part of the parliamentary process, and Deputy Dowling is perfectly entitled to it.  However, I have enough respect for Deputy Dowling's real knowledge of this field to know what he knows and what he understands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We have introduced many provisions in other sections of this Bill relating to the kind of work and so on.  All these things are established in this legislation and, of course, the overall aim of the legislation is to stop the exploitation of child labour.  It brings that about.  I do not mind Deputies opposite feasting on some of the crumbs.  I applaud their efforts to hide the nakedness of their party's achievements in this area by hanging their record on an amendment.  Knowing the true situation&mdash;as I know Deputy Dowling does&mdash;I cannot except that amendment. The levels that we have chosen in the section arise out of the real situation before us, arise out of consultation with interests involved.  I consider the proposal for normal working hours, that is 37½ in any week for young persons under 16, represents an acceptable compromise in the area at the moment.  That does not prevent &mdash;as I repeated on other sections&mdash;a better situation obtaining where the hours worked in a particular industry are negotiated between unions and employers.  It does not prevent those hours being the normal hours worked in that situation.</P>
      <P>There can, obviously, be differing views between any two individuals about what level the normal hours per week should be at any age.  That is evident in the differing approaches of Deputy Dowling and Deputy Fitzgerald before they reached accord here this afternoon on what amendment should stand for both their differing viewpoints.  It just proves the case very effectively that even Opposition Deputies belonging to the same party, naturally and legitimately, as any two individuals anywhere, might differ about what should be the best thing to do in a particular situation.</P>

      <P>We are both aiming in the same direction.  I am only citing the case of their disagreement to <Col N="307" /> show just how many disagreements there can be in this area.  Obviously, I had to make a decision about what should be both fair compromise and a real improvement.  That is why I have chosen the hours as 37½.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would repeat that I have the power in subsection (3) to reduce normal hours by means of an affirmative resolution of the Oireachtas. I would, of course, in the future hope to avail of this means of amending by affirmative resolution this section and other sections in this legislation.  I could not, therefore, in these circumstances accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree as he did earlier that the people affected here would probably be people who are working in services that would not normally be affected by general wage agreements and that they are entitled to the special protection he is going to afford them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Minister and in regard to what he has said, I offer him my sincere sympathy.  I am fully aware of his dilemma.  I know that he believes in his heart that his provisions in these sections&mdash;I realise his embarrassment about them&mdash;are completely and utterly inadequate to meet the present-day situation.  He bases his argument constantly on going back to a situation that he alleges arose.  I say to him that the performance of the Government that preceded him is the reason for the introduction of this legislation. Thank God we have reached or, to put it more accurately, we had reached up to a short time ago an almost full employment situation.  If it has had a set-back recently it is no fault of ours. The reason, basically, for the introduction of this legislation is that more opportunities are there for our young people now.  We welcome that and we want it to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also realise our responsibilities as the party who have by their progressiveness, by their foresight, by their united effort over many years of Government, given to this country a stability and a rate of progress unequalled <Col N="308" /> in any nation in western Europe.  If we get down to the specific province of this section again, the differences between Deputy Dowling's amendment and my original one, which has not been moved, were slight. Both were in the same direction as the Minister's.  In not moving amendment No. 16 in favour of Deputy Dowling's amendment it was obvious that his was, in fact, the more accurate assessment of the hours of work that should be considered normal for a 15-year old boy.  According to the Minister a boy who is one day short of his sixteenth birthday will be working a normal 37½ hour week.  On the day after his sixteenth birthday, according to the decision a while ago, he will be working a 40-hour week. That is one of the anomalies of the situation.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to agree that 37½ hours a week for a boy or girl of 15 years at present is absolutely out-dated.</P>
    <P>We are introducing legislation here that will be frowned on next year as having been out-of-date before it had passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, I sympathise with the Minister.  I know he almost told us, when he spoke to us a while ago, that his hands are tied to that extent and he has done the best he can, that he has pushed the Government to the limit possible and that he hopes to come back again when he can twist their arm a bit further and introduce more legislation.  I would say to him: &ldquo;Face up to your responsibilities in Labour.  The young people will remember you for it.&rdquo;  They may thank us for pushing him that bit harder to get him to do something for them. At the same time he will have done his duty for the young people; he will have been fair to them and will have given them what appears to be a sensible 32½-hour working week for a boy or girl of 16 years, who are merely children.  We are not anxious to divide the House on this issue. We realise how embarrassing each of these divisions is to the Minister.  For that reason we would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

In a few months time I will come to you with more legislation&rdquo;.  Surely now is the time to do so.  While we are disappointed with the results of the other amendments we have put down, the Minister should realise that with 15-year-olds a 37½ hour week is absolutely outdated.  That is what will be the normal working week for adult workers in a short time.  It is not a realistic, normal working week for a 15-year-old.</P>

      <P>I object to the Minister alleging frivolity on the part of any of the speakers on this side of the House.  The fact that there was a difference in the two amendments was certainly well-intentioned.  I would remind the Minister that they both asked for a concession from a Minister <Col N="312" /> who, obviously, has entrenched himself in the position that he is determined that the normal working week for a 15-year-old will only be in line with what it is for very many adult people in offices today, for people of both sexes.  I am sure you are well aware that that is the case in very many offices, particularly in other industries where the normal working week is 37½ hours.  You, as Minister for Labour, are dragging your heels to the extent that these young people will have to work the same number of hours.  The Minister's predicament is a real one.  His concern is real but he is being tied from making the move he had looked forward to making. Our concern is for the young people of this country.  We also detest exploitation of young people.  We, too, welcome any measure to protect the young people concerned.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an inconsistent one.  It is an impractical one in many spheres. For goodness sake let it be realistic in the maxima and the minima it imposes. For normal working hours we are setting a figure that the Minister knows, as well as we know, is absolutely unrealistic for the 15-year-old in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>To add to the section a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A young person shall be entitled to eight hours in a week, during normal working hours, to attend vocational training or other educational courses without prejudicially affecting the contract of service under which the young person is employed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 10 deals with vocational training in normal working hours.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Any time spent with the consent of his employer by a young person in vocational training during normal working hours shall be deemed to be hours worked by him for the purposes of section 7 and 8 of this Act.</P>
      <P>The reason for this amendment is that in section 10 it states:</P>
      <P>Any time spent with the consent of his employer</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and this can mean a half-hour or hour as the case may be.  The normal situation is for a day's release to attend vocational training or other educational courses.  It is desirable that if a person wanted to obtain a day's release to attend vocational training during normal working hours this should be provided for in the Bill. As it stands, section 10 states that the employer may consent to a person attending vocational training for an <Col N="315" /> hour or two hours as he specifies.  We feel the provision should be in line with present-day thinking on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that time spent, with the consent of the employer, by the young person in vocational training during normal working hours, shall be deemed to be hours worked by him for the purpose of sections 7 and 8 of the Bill.  These are the sections dealing with the hours of work.  My main approach to Deputy Dowling's amendment would be that it raises issues which are outside the scope of the legislation here.  There are before the International Labour Organisation certain instruments which have been adopted by the annual conference of that body in June, 1974, Convention 140 and Recommendation 148.  Convention 140 is on paid educational leave and Recommendation 148 is on paid educational leave.  The purpose of these two instruments is that educational leave is defined as &ldquo;leave granted to a worker for educational purposes for a specified period during working hours with adequate financial settlements.&rdquo;  The member States in adopting these particular instruments will be required to formulate policies in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existence of these instruments of the International Labour Organisation would call for the co-ordination of measures taken under them with general policies relating to employment, education, training and hours of work.  A great deal of discussion will be necessary involving areas other than the area covered by this Bill consequent on our adoption or otherwise of these particular International Labour Organisation instruments.  My point is that the Bill as drafted with section 10 permitting a young person to take part in vocational educational training, his participation in such courses approved and considered part of his working hours, thereby forbids the requirement that they would not be regarded as outside working hours but as part of the hours mentioned in section 7 and 8.  Until we have adopted or made known our approach <Col N="316" /> to these international instruments, which will call for a wide degree of consultation between different State Departments with repercussions on legislation elsewhere&mdash;in our educational policy and so on&mdash;I would not accept Deputy Dowling's amendment in its present form even though I agree with its sentiment.  It would require a great deal further preparation which is outside the scope of this legislation.  It would, in the first instance, be a matter for the Department of Education.  It is in the area of educational employment and that requires a much more detailed preparation before we could even formulate our approach and the policies to be adopted.  At present our best course of action is to accept that we have in section 10 what would be considered an improvement in the situation and it would guard against the vocational training of a young person being regarded as outside sections 7 and 8.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the situation at present is that certain sections of this Bill are referred to the Minister for Education.  We should not lag behind other nations in ratifying international agreements.  This Bill should include progressive trends.  We should, where possible in our formulation of a Bill designed to protect young people, be ahead of some of those continental countries which may have ratified the agreements referred to by the Minister.  We should not draft legislation solely on the basis of ratifying agreements but to suit our own particular needs and ensure, in consultation with the Minister for Education, that we embody in the Bill safeguards for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister appeared sympathetic to the amendment but the section as it stands gives discretion to the employer as to the length of time allowed for vocational training.  The employer might consider one hour sufficient when in fact the employee might require eight hours' technical training. In other sections of the Bill the Minister had no hesitation in setting down the normal working day as eight hours but when it comes to granting a concession to a young person in respect <Col N="317" /> of furthering his education the Minister appears negligent.  It is quite usual nowadays for 16- to 18-year-olds to attend vocational schools.  The Minister has acknowledged that a day's release is granted at present to a large section of people by responsible employers. However, in regard to people who do not have responsible employers and who must rely on the provisions of this Bill, a certain weakness is apparent in this section.  This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are happy to know that the matter is being considered but we should not have to wait until such time as we are forced by international agreements to accept certain provisions. We must be more progressive than that.  We must embody in this Bill some kind of protection for these young people.  There is a definite weakness in section 10.  Would the Minister consider redrafting the section, taking into consideration the views that have been expressed, views we believe of great importance.  The Minister should consult with educationalists and try to formulate something more suitable to our situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. The Minister might have a look at this between now and Report Stage because the section is weak in the provisions for day and night release for young workers.  With the consent of his employer a young person may go to school.  May not the employer then look for a boy or girl who has not had vocational training and thus get a better return for his money?  I doubt if this provision would help very much in the case of the girl or boy who wants vocational training.  The Minister might also consider giving the employer some inducement to encourage the boy or girl to attend the vocational school.  Many firms who allow day release complain that they get no tax reliefs.  Again, the boy or girl may subsequently opt to go to work for another firm, having been allowed time off for training by the original firm.  The Minister would do well to look at section 10 and, in particular, at Deputy Dowling's amendment.  We might then have an <Col N="318" /> improved section 10; as it stands at the moment it is not very helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will have a look at it again, but I think it is only fair to advise that this is one of the international instruments we must consider.  I was referring to the need for domestic preparations if we are to prepare for the kind of changes that will be required to lead up to something along the lines of Deputy Dowling's amendment.  That is what I meant by necessary preparation before anything like that can be embarked upon.  Under the section as drafted we have the situation where, with the consent of the employer, we can permit hours being included as hours of work.  Deputy Dowling would unilaterally impose on the employer extra costs.  That is a small part of it; the real difficulty is the need for preparation in this area were we to adopt the amendment.  I am not against the amendment in principle and I will certainly have a look at it before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It is normal in any industrial or commercial concern for a person to work for four hours without a break. This is a simple amendment designed to ensure that a young person, who may not be over-robust, will not have to work for five hours without a break. This would be too much.  We should adjust the subsection to bring it into line with common practice in shops and workshops.  This amendment was put forward as a result of a suggestion made to me by a well-known women's welfare organisation in Dublin.  The period should be cut from five hours to four hours.  Five hours is too long.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Moore on this.  I am sure the Minister will accept this amendment without question.  Five hours without a break is far too long a period for a young person.  He or she should have a rest period and the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting the period of four hours. Five hours seems to me to come from some obsolete legislation.  Possibly this is something copied from the 1936 Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="321" /> In page 8, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section shall not apply to an employee who is employed by an employer to do industrial work within the meaning of section 3 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 (as amended by section 2 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1944).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have included section 12 in the Bill as an essential constraint on six- or seven-day working patterns involving an appreciable amount of Sunday working.  The section provides that an employee who is required to work on more than five days a week and is also required to do more than three hours' work on Sunday must be given 24 consecutive hours' rest in every seven-day period.  Previously, again in minimum legislation, the young person engaged in industrial work had been covered by the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, but its conditions were much more restrictive. Industrial work on Sundays by young persons is not permitted except in certain cases such as newspaper printing and publishing.  I consider that the position under the 1936 Act should be preserved and the amendment is designed to do this.  Our acceptance of this amendment will mean that section 49 of the 1936 Act will still apply to young persons doing industrial work while subsection (1) of this section will cover other young people.</P>

      <P>I wish to quote from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of Wednesday, February 12th, 1975:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Mr. Burke said the Government had decided to build the Cork Dental Hospital and he invited Deputy Faulkner, the previous Minister for Education, to tell the Dáil why the Fianna Fáil Government had decided to discontinue building it, thus opposing a recommendation of the Higher Education Authority.</P>
    <P>The Higher Education Authority's advice was to have one dental hospital and that in Dublin only.  I am amazed that the Minister should have made that statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the quotation accurate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the newspaper.  I want to point out that I refused to accept that recommendation of the HEA.  It was always my intention to build a dental hospital in Cork and, in fact, due to my participation the plans are at a very advanced stage and practically ready to go to tender.  This has been the position for the past two years.  I would like to know what the Minister has done in the meantime.  Far from deciding to discontinue the building of the hospital it was simply postponed.</P>
      <P>When I moved the adjournment of the debate yesterday I was pointing out that at no time during all the discussions and deliberations on the structure of third level education was it suggested that University College, Cork, and University College, Galway, should be other than separate and independent universities.  This was agreed by the Fianna Fáil Government. It was agreed in the NUI/TCD agreement and in the final report of the HEA.  I find it very difficult to understand why the Government should have made this fundamental change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the immense changes which have taken place in our educational system in the past ten years &mdash;the introduction of free education and free transport at post-primary level, the grants for higher education, the great influx of young people into third-level education, all of which transformed the whole education <Col N="323" /> scene&mdash;it is rather childish of the Minister to advance something said about leaving the NUI structure as it was, by somebody in University College, Galway, about ten years ago as an excuse for the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1967 the Commission on Higher Education recommended that the NUI should be dissolved and that its constituent colleges should be established as independent universities. The Fianna Fáil Government accepted the recommendation that the Cork and Galway colleges be given full university powers.  From then on until we left office the discussions on higher education proceeded on this basis and, of necessity, developments within UCC and UCG proceeded along the lines that they would become universities in their own right.</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to know the reason behind the Government decision. It cannot be on the basis that the numbers of students attending these universities were not sufficiently high&mdash;Cork has 4,500 students which is on a par with the numbers in TCD which is retaining full university status and, in fact, the numbers are greater than they are in many of the universities in Britain.  The decision can hardly be on the grounds that degrees conferred in these universities could be classified as inferior.  The fact is that in relation to the degrees conferred presently by these universities, although theoretically they are NUI degrees, it is the courses and facilities in the Cork and Galway colleges which are assessed by bodies such as the General Medical Council, the Dental Council and various other bodies.</P>
    <P>In any event if the Government decisions were made on these grounds it would appear to me that joining together UCC and UCG, which are about 150 miles apart, would hardly improve the position and would certainly give the impression that the degrees awarded as a result of study in the Cork or Galway colleges of the new NUI would be inferior to degrees awarded elsewhere.  In the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick we had an institution of <Col N="324" /> third-level education which had an opportunity never before afforded to such an institution in Ireland to develop in its own way completely free from the restrictions which tradition and usage place on a university.  Here would be an opportunity of achieving an eminence which would place the NIHE high in the ranks of non-university third-level institutes of the world.  From what I know of the director and of the staff there is no doubt in my mind that it would achieve this eminence.  It is now suggested that the people of Limerick should barter their future to become a pale shadow of Cork and Galway, to become a recognised college of the new NUI, with the capacity at some time in the dim and distant future to evolve into a constituent college of the NUI.  If UCC, and UCG, after their long apprenticeship as constituent colleges of the present NUI are not yet, in the Coalition's eyes, sufficiently developed to become independent universities, where does this place the NIHE of Limerick?</P>
    <P>I think that the gem of the proposals is that which claims that the status of the institute in Limerick and that proposed for Ballymun in Dublin would be enhanced by requiring them to go cap in hand to the universities asking them to please award degrees on the basis of the courses given in these institutes.  In my view such thinking could emanate only from the minds of the academics in the Government who have little or no appreciation of technical or technological education. Can anybody imagine for one moment what would be the reaction of the authorities of the technical high schools in Eindhoven or Delft in Holland if they were told that their status would be raised by having their degrees awarded by some university or other.  In fact I could not imagine such a suggestion being made.  In this context the Government decision to remove the degree-giving function from the National Council of Educational Awards must be viewed very seriously indeed.  Not only will it make the institutes in Dublin and Limerick subject to the whims of universities, which would have little appreciation of the real purpose of such institutes, <Col N="325" /> but it will debase every other qualification given by the council whether under its present or its new name.</P>
    <P>The effect as I see it in Dublin will be the creation of a largely glorified Arts College in Trinity College.  To speak, for example, of making the best possible use of existing resources while continuing two university law schools in Dublin is just plain nonsense. That there should be one university law school in Dublin and that school located in Trinity College, which is adjacent to all the legal establishments, is elementary common sense.  I think that special pleading which includes referring to law as a prestige faculty is foolish.  One faculty is as prestigious as another, or it ought to be</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is here because I feel that the Labour Ministers, whether they like it or not, are a party to these proposals which run counter to any policy on education which the Labour Party expounded during the years.  They are involved not only on the basis of collective responsibility, which admittedly does not mean much in this Coalition, but also because they were members of the sub-committee which came up with the proposals.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech, the tone of which ranged from aggressiveness to flippancy, the Minister wanted to know whether we favoured the binary system.  In so far as comprehensive education is concerned, Fianna Fáil's record is particularly good.  At the post-primary level, we introduced comprehensive schools and community schools and urged other post-primary schools to adopt a similar system.  Why should there be any reason to doubt that this attitude of my party would not prevail at third level?  The point I would make, however, is that the exceptionally rapid growth in technical and technological education, through the vocational schools and RTCs, and on to the National Institutes of Higher Education, is of relatively recent origin.  It is a sturdy but youthful growth and should be allowed to reach relative maturity to save it from absorption <Col N="326" /> by much older academic establishments.</P>
    <P>The universities are changing with the times, more slowly, perhaps, than we would like, but practical considerations where, for example, vast numbers of young people are doing Art degrees and later the Higher Diploma in Education and then finding that there are no jobs for them will force a more rapid pace of change.  As the NIHE develops, while continuing to serve the purpose for which they were founded, they will also change.  I am certain that, by the the time the NIHE of Limerick would reach the stage when it would be accepted as a constituent college of the proposed new NUI, the difference between university education, as it would be then, and other third level education, would have largely disappeared for practical purposes and we would have achieved true comprehensive education and not the pseudo-type proposed by the Minister when, in the ultimate, it is whatever the universities will decide, the universities which award the degrees, which will shape the form of things to come in the future, not only at third level but on down through the whole education system and not the needs of varying localities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, let us briefly look at the whole picture.  We have proposals or decisions here, which obviously from the published document in <i>The Education Times</i>, are not in line with the Minister's own thinking.  They are positively not in <Col N="327" /> line with the Department's thinking. Most educational authorities are highly critical of them.  Some condemned them outright.  The only praise of them&mdash;and it was of a rather muted kind&mdash;came from an institution which has had little cause for complaint and from another which felt its status was being raised.  In my opinion this feeling about status was a mistaken one.  Then we had the pathetic claim of the Minister to the goodwill of the head of one RTE college&mdash;the one swallow which surely does not make a summer.</P>
      <P>These proposals or decisions are the result of the deliberations of a sub-committee of Cabinet academics, whose meetings, due to Government and EEC commitments, must have been few and of short duration.  These gentlemen decided that their few and short meetings were more important and should have a greater impact on third level education than the long years of hard and painstaking work by university personnel, by technicians and technologists, by vocational education committees, by dedicated Department of Education officials, and by several Ministers.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take note of this motion, to no longer continue to defend the indefensible, and to lay down a framework for higher education which will be a credit to the country and do justice to its students.  Setting up a conjoint board to ensure that there should be no duplication, and that the best use be made of all our resources, human and financial, is of little use if the moulds are set by the Minister who, in effect, is asking them to do what he is now in a position to do, and has the power to, but evidently has not the courage to do himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we basically need is a body with real teeth which will be in a position, after the final decisions are made in the House, to set up centres of excellence in our various third level institutions which will help ensure that our very limited resources will be fully utilised, and that the institutions will have real purpose, and that our education system will promote the <Col N="328" /> development of our people and of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>Let me say in relation to the Labour Party that it is a far cry from the time that Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, sent a telegram of congratulations to Donagh O'Malley when he read of his proposals to merge Trinity College with UCD.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating) Justin Keating">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>First let me say that, to give extended time to a colleague, I propose to limit myself to 20 minutes and I propose to deal with only two themes.  Before doing that let me, as they say, declare interest because from my own experience of all my adult life being involved in teaching of one kind or another, of being a consultant in adult education to RTE, as well as being a university teacher, I have been involved in third level matters for a quarter of a century as a veterinary graduate.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the different institutions at third level, people traditionally, not just now, but for decades and longer, have taken dug-in sandbag positions and there is no way to produce a scheme for third level reform which will meet with the approval of everybody.  Indeed, the more involved people are with their own office, their own tradition, and their own routine, the more difficult it is for them to accept necessary change.  That brings me to the point that we simply cannot leave third level unreformed.  It is not that you have something reasonably good which you want to make better.</P>
      <P>My contention, after a quarter of a century of experience is that our third level is simply not meeting the requirements of the country and is in desperate need of reform and of profound reform.  I would say, particularly having just listened to Deputy Faulkner, that it is horribly easy in this context to release bitterness, to release animosity, to release hostility. When you are dealing with many institutions and many articulate people that makes any sort of progress or concensus almost impossible.  The bitter word is easy in this context but it is non-productive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> I want to discuss the question of a unified system or a binary system and what that means, not just in Dublin, but in general and then the question of whether it is better for the institutions in Limerick and Galway and Cork to be part of a single university or to be separate universities.  I will try to stick to time on those two things. I thought Deputy Faulkner's answer, when challenged on binary or unified, was a hedging answer, that he did not want to face it, because he mentioned the respected late member of the House, Deputy Donagh O'Malley, who was a reforming Minister for Education.  It seems to me that the reforms at second level we have had make a unified system at third level absolutely obligatory.</P>
    <P>I take the reforms that have been proposed&mdash;and I am not making a political point at all&mdash;by the Government not at all to be in conflict with the second level policy of a previous Government, but to be the necessary corollary to that policy which I uphold as a good policy.  The basic thing we are facing is that, while there has been a growth in knowledge of law, a growth in knowledge of philosophy, a growth in knowledge of my own science, a growth in all university disciplines, in the area loosely called technology there has been an explosion, an explosion which has transformed the whole world.  Our institutions are not changing as fast as that knowledge.</P>
    <P>The second thing to say about technology is that it was originally done by people in overalls with oil on their hands, by artisans, by people who were not quite respectable in terms of university attitudes and of the snobberies of the past.  While the knowledge represented by the word &ldquo;technology&rdquo; has exploded, the institutions and the place in society, the status, incomes and buildings and the staff-student ratios of those persons who are responsible for technology in our society have not changed correspondingly with the validity and social importance of the knowledge that is represented by the word technology. That is a failure of our society.  It is a failure for which we in Ireland, trying to develop our <Col N="330" /> economy rapidly, paid very dearly. There are profound economic arguments, practical day-to-day pragmatic arguments for technology taking its proper place in our society.  But, they are only half the case.  The other half of the case is that there is nothing that is not respectable, that would not be a suitable son-in-law for the most aggressive mother-in-law in this concept of technology.  It has to be a central part of our world&mdash;at the very highest level of our academic institutions because it represents valid knowledge about the world that we need for our intellectual development as well as our economic development.</P>
    <P>When C. P. Snow was talking about two cultures, he was talking about this separation into the technologists and the people who esteemed themselves to be a purer breed who were entitled to slightly better rules and slightly larger pay.  But, the division into two cultures is not just bad for society and technology; it is bad for the universities too.  The thing that distresses me is that this is a profoundly radical and inspiring perspective of not putting technology into the universities but of abolishing the distinction between technology and other skills that people have.</P>
    <P>Why should what is called technology be in some way inferior to law or to medicine or to philosophy or whatever you like?  It is a central part of our society in this century and it has to have its proper place, not taken into universities on sufferance, but taking its proper, total place in the university as valid as any other discipline and making its contribution on the basis of absolute equality.</P>
    <P>When we are having discussions about unified or binary, it is not a matter of bringing in technology under anybody's wing or having the technologists and what they represent as second class people in universities or squelching them in universities or using universities to take their budgets and manipulate them.  It is offering them the perspective of their place in the third level sun which their expertise and their social role and social obligations entitle them to.  That seems to me a perspective of a very <Col N="331" /> fundamental and dramatic kind, and I find it hard to see how any person of goodwill can object to that perspective.</P>
    <P>It is not the question of changing the place of technology in a structure. It is a question of abolishing the distinction between what is called technology and all the other subjects.  You do not have that sort of distinction between medicine and law at university. Why should you have it between law and technology or between medicine and technology?  Why should the pay be lower?  Why should the staff-student ratio be worse?  Why should the research content be worse?  Why should the buildings be worse?  Morally, intellectually and economically for this society, it is imperative that that distinction be not tampered with or adjusted.  What is essential is that it be abolished.  I am depressed that people cannot see the perspective that is offered in those terms.  We need it for democracy.  We need it for equality. We need it for abolishing the disgusting sort of class distinctions that have attached to different social roles in the past.  The Labour Party has a particular concern in abolishing those distinctions but I am sure that all parties and all middle members in the House would wish to abolish them.</P>
    <P>Let us then, in that context, talk about Ballymun.  What do I wish for Ballymun?  I wish it to be a college of a university, with the same pay, same buildings, same staff-student ratios, same technicians, same budget for equipment, same playing fields, same society for students mixing with other students on a basis of equality, not any sort of second class institution.  The bits that will make it a second class institution are second class institutions now and have been for a long time carried on the backs of people who are making a contribution beyond the call of duty, either voluntarily with their free time or teaching in dreadful conditions and for pay that was not as good as academic pay.  We must stop calling for that sort of dedication and commitment without commensurate rewards.</P>
    <P>I want to see it as a college of a university, not second class&mdash;identical: <Col N="332" /> a college like any other college doing its particular things and doing them with total stature, total equality and with exactly the same facilities as anybody else.  That is the perspective that is offered if not instantly&mdash;because, as Deputy Faulkner has said this role is a new role&mdash;then as soon as possible. Let us have structures that do not hold up that evolution into its full place in the sun for our technological sectors. As to which of the present universities it should be a college of, as I have associations with TCD I would have a particular view but I would not try to determine that.</P>
    <P>It seems to me we can never complete the reforms or have our second level reforms flower at third level unless we are prepared to abolish the binary system.  It is no use abolishing it by saying: &ldquo;You are technological, you will go into the university but you will never be quite the same.&rdquo;  Abolition means abolition: it means equality.  Abolition means that the perspective of that sector with its exploding knowledge about nature, with exploding control over technological things for all our well being will have the place in society that their knowledge entitles them to.  Their knowledge is valued in our culture commensurate with its worth in our culture.  That is what it means.  It does not mean anything less.  That is both a radical and noble aspiration and I am shocked that people should reject that principle and that those who have carried this thing on their backs for so long, either the voluntary people on the committee, or the staff, do not see that perspective.  Perhaps it is more than they ever thought they would get. Perhaps they are not grasping it because they do not see the perspective as fully offered.  It is the perspective of their rightful place in society and nothing less.  Perhaps it is because it is so radical it is not being grasped.</P>
    <P>I have about five minutes of my own time and I want to talk about Cork.  Galway and Limerick.  What do I want for those three, two of them colleges and one of them an institute for higher education?  I will make a list in a moment that everybody on the opposite side of the House would <Col N="333" /> agree with and that the staff in those places would agree with.  But, what do we want?  Let us try and get that list and then let us ask the questions.  If we really have arguments about things and are not sniping at each other, then let us ask the question: &ldquo;How is that best attained?&rdquo;  I want excellence for them and I know everybody else does and that they want it themselves. I want security for them, for their future.  Security is hardly related to excellence but they are out on the western edge of Europe and the centripetal forces in the economy are working.  They have to be given security.  It is terribly important that universities should have local involvement. We use the phrase town and gown as meaning something obvious. What does it mean?</P>

      <P>I am going to take five of them.  When we say town and gown, we use that phrase to indicate a separation we all recognise.  It means something that the gown is separated from the town.  If we give people the luxury of those academic conditions they have to be plugged into their community.  They have to articulate the needs of their community and suggest solutions for their problems. They have to educate people to solve those problems by being aware of them and analysing them.</P>
      <P>In my period as Minister, I have been in Galway and Limerick, Kevin Street and Bolton Street more than I have been in UCD or Trinity, though I am on the staff of one of them, so I understand more about them.</P>

    <P>The local involvement in Galway, in particular the one I know&mdash;maybe it is good elsewhere too&mdash;and in Limerick are admirable things.  But they have to have a certainty of funds and they have to have a certainty of work.  So we all want the same things. <Col N="334" /> And then you say, is it better to have that as a college or is it better to have it as a university?  To the public that distinction is without meaning.  To the students it is no different.  To the local civic leaders, who have a certain sense of pride in their own town, it is important.  The top administrators in the universities or the colleges want to build their area of power as big as possible.  That is no criticism.  Any good man wants to push to the limits of his power.  They are the two groups who want these things to become universities.</P>
    <P>What are the real arguments?  In my field of animal science, if I might call it that, in agriculture and related things, one of the greatest places in the world is the Davis Campus in California.  It is not a university, it is a school of a university.  The best place for certain physics in the whole world is Berkeley in California; it is not a university, it is a campus of a university.  I am a graduate of University College, London which has 20 or 30 institutions spread all over and Aberystwyth in north Wales is part of the University of Wales which has colleges in the very south of the country just as far apart as Galway and Cork.  There is no principle about this.  There is no principle that says each town has to have its own autonomous structure or that you must group them all into a university under a number.  There is no principle; it is just what works best because, of course, there are the individual ones. Some of the newer ones in Britain are individual.  Wales is one pattern of the federal one, or California, or the University of London.  Plenty of others are federal ones but there are plenty of unitary ones.  There is no principle; it is what works best.  Ask the question but think your way into Galway.  Is Galway, by itself, going to be able to be a countervailing force to the great pull that Dublin has&mdash;far more money&mdash;or is it going to be a better countervailing force as part of three institutions with a lot of students?  I think the future of Galway, Limerick and Cork are better guaranteed as a countervailing force.  We have to deal with this great <Col N="335" /> weld in Ireland that Dublin is the big place and Dublin is what pulls the institutions of the country into it, and we have to structure things to counteract that.</P>
    <P>I think that those three together, in a single university, will be a better countervailing force, better able to fight for funds.  Their future will be better guaranteed because, inside a single university, the tendency for individual empire builders is to go off and duplicate, with little &ldquo;Mickey-Mouse&rdquo; departments that can never be properly funded, but they want to have a department of everything.  The centres of excellence will not work unless they are rationalised in some way through a single university.  If you do not have the centres of excellence, if you do not have rationalisation; if you do not win the fight for funds, then you put the security for the future into question because the places just are not good enough.  You guarantee their excellence, their funds and the rational use of resources and the growth of centres of excellence.  We are not going to name what ought to be in each place.</P>
    <P>But we could put that on the record if we wanted to say which place is going to be good at what.  We could do that but is not all of that better in a single university, as a countervailing force, to this city, where I am standing? Is not it better for centres of excellence?  Is not it better for rational use of funds?  Is not it better for a countervailing force to Dublin? Does it take away from their standing? The distance, the communication are not a problem.  If they examine their own interests they will see that if they are separate they will not be as strong as three co-operating.  If they are not as strong one or other of them may get into difficulties.  We will not get the rationalisation; we will not get the centres of excellence; we will not get a countervailing force to Dublin.</P>
    <P>There may be better arguments which are not based on empire building, which are based on the real issues of those institutions in favour <Col N="336" /> of them becoming separate universities. There may be such arguments but I have not heard them.  The arguments I have heard, I am afraid, are based on the interests of what seems to me a spurious local patriotism and on the desire of the top brass in those universities to extend their empire as much as possible and not on good academic reasons which correspond to the interests of those institutions. If we were to define, as I said earlier, what we want for them, we would all want the same things.  The quarrel is how we get them.  I speak from a quarter of a century of academic politics; as Deputy Thornley says: national politics are clean compared to academic politics.  But if one has a familiarity with academic politics I believe they are more likely to attain the things we all want, as three constituent colleges of a single strong university, a countervailing force to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have talked about only two themes. I have talked about the basic concept which people have not teased out enough.  &ldquo;Unitary&rdquo; does not mean ramming in technology as an unwelcome bed fellow into universities. &ldquo;Unitary&rdquo; means abolishing the distinction between these dirty fingernail, not quite respectable, technological subjects and other subjects.  &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; means recognising that technology has come of age and is worth its place at the pinnacle of our academic life.  That is what unity means.  Maybe there are good arguments against it but I have not heard them.  The only other thing I have taken up, the argument for three colleges and one university of Cork. Galway and Limerick is the argument of practicality, the argument of success, the argument of security, the argument of centres of excellence, the argument of the rational use of resources which are inevitably scarce.  If there are better arguments against it, let us hear them. But let us not argue it, let us not let the malice and the animosity out of the Pandora's box because this is a difficult subject to solve with the best will in the world, where you have people who are articulate, who have typists at their command, who can sit in their offices and fire off letters, all of <Col N="337" /> whom have an intense sense of their own territory.</P>
    <P>A solution of a messy situation is very difficult with the best will in the world.  It is not that we are dealing with something that should be left alone.  We are dealing with something that for every possible reason desperately needs reform and indeed the reform is long overdue.</P>

      <P>I am happy that the Minister for Industry and Commerce admitted to certain academic rivalry and academic bitterness.  However unfortunate that is, I think that, on his part, it was an honest admission, however regrettable.  It would make one wonder whether the amount of time, debate and money which we afford to third level education is being spent as it should.</P>
      <P>It is a condemnation of the products of this third level system that in matters before us we cannot get away from the fact that in behaviour these people who have so enjoyed third level education behave in a fashion which is not in keeping with that which we think third level education should be all about.</P>
      <P>I regret, too, that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking he did not pursue a little further the points he was making in respect of technology, that he did not pursue the whole area of third level education and accommodate within his considerations the fact that every child in the country is entitled to involvement.  If he is really concerned &mdash;and I am sure he is&mdash;for that aspect of it, he will see that in that which is proposed for Ballymun, he is removing from that hitherto neglected area the recognition and the status which is essential to the continuing growth in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> I should hope, too, that when he expressed that fact that there has been an explosion in that area&mdash;an explosion of which the universities have become aware&mdash;he will recognise that as far back as 1966 the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee had become so aware.  It was arising out of that awareness that they submitted their proposal for the Ballymun complex. I do not think that anybody here can deny that.  I am posing it now as an indication of the awareness of the City of Dublin VEC in the matter of third level education which had not manifested itself to the universities. Here I would be critical of our universities in so far as that up to now they have been labouring along in the old traditional system.  Even today we have a situation where to gain entry to the university, the poor man's child must have twice the educational qualifications, if he is hopeful to gain entry, where the product of Trinity and of UCD is no more different, having regard to their relationship to different social groups, than it was 50 years ago. The only difference that has occurred in the matter of the universities is that the public are making a much greater contribution towards their administration. However, there continues to be that exclusion of the greatest brain power we have because entrance to the university is still based, to a great extent&mdash;not entirely&mdash;on one's capacity to pay.  Evidence of that can be seen when I say that the poor man's child, in order to go to university, must qualify for a grant which means that he must have four honours while the rich man's child may enter with two honours.</P>
    <P>Regarding the vocational system in Dublin and here I intend speaking entirely and exclusively on the Ballymun project&mdash;I agree entirely with what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has said on the matter of technology and the lack of regard which was held for it in certain areas&mdash; it was because of the acceptance of the fact that technology qualified for recognition as third level education that the VEC prepared and submitted the proposals regarding Ballymun.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> We had talk about in-laws, sons-in-law, bed-fellows, marriages and divorces in this debate.  What I see has happened now in respect of Ballymun is that there is a situation which hitherto had been cared for entirely and when it was not fashionable, by the VEC.  We had reached the point where in order to continue its development, it was necessary and desirable that there would be integration, and that there would be comprehensive education in that field, having regard, (1), to the type of student who would qualify for it and (2) to the overall area in which the operations were taking place.</P>
    <P>The far-seeing dedicated members of the VEC had looked after and fondled this child until now she had become quite a vibrant lassie.  Here I am coming to the marriages.  We had happenings such as occurred in the J. B. Keane play &ldquo;Sive&rdquo; and we are now going to sell this vibrant lassie to the decrepit Seán Dóite of the universities.  That, I suggest, a Cheann Comhairle, is what has happened.  I would ask the Minister, when replying&mdash;and I am not inviting or encouraging him to be defensive or offensive&mdash;to say out what justification there is for a situation where one removes Ballymun from its initiators. There are many clinicals in the field of third level education.  The City of Dublin VEC has to date been catering very adequately for that area to which the Minister for Industry and Commerce refers and to which I refer now.  I say this as a new member of the VEC and as one who was not connected with the original class but as one who, over the years, has recognised the importance in the life of this country of that which was called vocational education.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin VEC in respect of Ballymun want to continue with their good work and be left alone. They are not envious of the status or the so-called status which people say universities attach to certain fields of operation.  They are neither envious nor critical of that status.  We would be critical of certain teachers, perhaps, and certain people connected with it, to whom the Minister for Industry and Commerce has referred, <Col N="341" /> who would see in status something which would be beneficial to themselves. That is their entitlement and I would not be all that critical of them. But my concern and the concern of everybody here should not be for the respective sensitivities of the gentlemen and the ladies who at the moment are in charge of these institutions. With all due respect to them, as far as I am concerned I personally do not believe I owe them anything nor do I believe the people of this country should feel any great indebtedness to them.  For the work they are doing and for the manner in which they discharge it they get very well paid.  My concern is that the feeling should not go abroad that third level education can succeed only in the hands of self-appointed judges and experts.</P>
    <P>I noted in the statement issued by the Minister on behalf of the Government that the National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin, shall be a recognised college of either of the Dublin universities.  If the Minister can convince me that in so aligning the institute to one of the universities he is doing what is best for the students of this country, then I shall be happy to accept it but I do not think he is.  In so aligning them he is removing from this field of technology the recognition which it had been obtaining over the years.  You will have it submerged in the academic field and it will not get the opportunity of prospering and reaching its own pinnacle.</P>
    <P>I see no reason whatsoever, and there is no case to be made, for removing Ballymun institute from the control of the members of the committee who were its creators.  Can it be shown that if the management to date of that which will be Ballymun&mdash; remember at the moment we have Ballymun dispersed in different areas of the city; it only represents the consolidation of Ballymun in the structure that will be built there&mdash;had been in the hands of the universities it would have been done in a better fashion?  There is no evidence of that. The universities to date, on the statement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;with which I agreed&mdash; were not even aware of the fact that <Col N="342" /> there was such third level education. Notwithstanding that and notwithstanding their negligence, as it were, while on the other hand not acknowledging the awareness of the VEC members, we now make this proposal, because we are still living in the memory of the archaic and antiquated importance of the old universities and we think nothing can be done in the field of third level education unless it has the stamp and the raddle of a university upon it.</P>
    <P>The final point I should like to make is connected with the Council for Technological Education.  I suppose in making statements of fact one cannot be accused of making foolish political or unhelpful political comments but it is a statement of fact that this Coalition Government said they would be an open Government, a Government of consultation, a Government that would involve and, indeed, at primary and secondary level we have evidence of their desire to involve the community in education. Bearing that in mind, how can the Minister or, indeed, the Government justify that in respect of the Council for Technological Education&mdash;a council which we are told will consist of 30 members&mdash;it is proposed that ten of the members will come from the institute in Ballymun, another ten will come from the institute in Limerick and the third ten will be appointed by the Minister?  That, on the surface seems reasonable enough but, on the other hand, when you look at the membership of the institute at Ballymun and at Limerick it must be noted that already there the Minister will have appointed a majority of the members.  There will be 25 members, of which the Minister will have appointed a majority&mdash;that will be 13.  You have then a situation that in respect of this Council for Technological Education the full 30 members can, theoretically at least, be the nominees of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is likely to happen having regard to what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has told <Col N="343" /> us about the narrow channels on which academics and third level experts operate.  Imagine a situation where a Government that has come to us indicating their concern for involving independent minds, organisations and institutions in education now come before us with a proposal which envisages a situation that in respect of a very important Council for Technological Education the Minister for Education on behalf of the Government will appoint the full 30 members out of 30.  I do not want to set the Minister for Foreign Affairs on any other course.  I understand he had a hand in the preparation of the proposals we are discussing and I would ask him to dissociate himself from the effort there.  I have recollection of the contributions he made to the Higher Education Authority deal when it was before the House, of his concern in not having the, as he described it, intruding hand of the Department and the annoying Head of the Government looking over third level education. I would ask him now to express his dissatisfaction, I hope, with that which is envisaged here.  Perhaps he could assure us, in so far as he is concerned, that he will apply himself to having the situation made more open and more in keeping with the promises this Government made to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>In looking at this problem one ought to look at it in the context of the actual problems facing a Government in trying to tackle a particular situation.  What are the problems of higher level education in Ireland?  What are the constraints imposed on us?  What are the difficulties we have to overcome?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, as Deputies on both sides agree there is agreement on the problem but not on the solution, the imbalance between the academic and the technical at every level of Irish education and notably, indeed, at the third level.  Associated with this imbalance in structure is the equivalent in damage to the technological sector at third level and, with the lack of parity of esteem in the <Col N="344" /> technological sector at third level, there is the lack of mobility between the different sectors which may inhibit students from ending up in the kind of course best suited to their talents, because they have to come up through a particular stream, which may turn out to be the wrong one for them at third level.  These are real problems and any solution to the difficulties of higher education should be concerned with achieving answers to these problems.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that they seek simple arithmetical facts to which Deputies have not sufficiently adverted. There are in existence more than twice as many units in higher education of, what I call, a university or technological college current.  I will leave for the moment out of this the training colleges. There are in the general institutes of higher education over twice as many of the maximum number of universities which this country could reasonably have if it wishes the universities to be taken seriously.  I shall come back to this point later.</P>
    <P>Then there is the lack of co-ordination in Dublin, a perennial issue and one which, even since the original announcement of the merger eight years ago, has not been resolved as it should have been between the universities. Again, there is, and this has become very striking in the debate on the Government's proposals, the great power and the very vocal character of the interests involved, with the universities and colleges each seeking independence for itself, each seeking to avoid any rationalisation with any other institution, each jealous of its position <i>vis-à-vis</i> institutions in the other sector. The universities colleges are jealous of their position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the technical colleges and the latter are naturally anxious to achieve an equal position and full treatment with the university colleges.  As well as that, there are the vocational educational committees which have a natural aspiration to be involved in the work of higher education and who, therefore, desire to hang on to institutions developing in this area, whether or not that form of control is, in fact, in the best interests of the institutions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> These then are the problems we face.  This problem of interest groups with power and vocal character is one which all Governments have had to consider and take seriously, but not succumb to, and it would be wrong if we were influenced in our decisions by a concern to avoid being attacked or criticised by particular interest groups.  How then does the solution we have come up with relate to these problems?  So far as the imbalance between the academic and technical sides are concerned, the lack of mobility between them, we propose to solve this problem once and for all by a comprehensive system so that all the different institutions will be on a par within the system.  It may take some time for that to come about.  It may take some period before we have the situation where all the institutions concerned, whether they be the training colleges or whether they be technological colleges, are all constituent colleges.  I would be optimistic that that can be achieved in a relatively short time and the aim is to achieve that so that all are of equal status, equally endowed, the same standards applied to them, the same number of hours of work for the staff, not a very much heavier workload in some institutions than in another for historical reasons discriminating against them, and a situation where, because they are all components of universities, there can be mobility between the different streams instead of the rigid line as it now exists which prevents students from shifting from one to the other according to their talents.</P>
    <P>I do not say that the system we propose will necessarily and immediately achieve all these aims.  It is, however, the only system which is open to the achievement of these aims and those who advocate keeping the technological sector separate, in practice, in Irish conditions, as 50 years of independence have shown advocate condemning this sector perpetually to be underendowed, to be discriminated against, to be left there, and it condemns the students through a lack of mobility between the two streams, so that one gets students coming into <Col N="346" /> universities who really are too practically orientated for its courses and they become drop-outs when, in fact, they could do very well in the technological sector.  On the other side, one gets students coming up to the technological sector who may, in the particular discipline they are taking on, be, perhaps really of an academic bent and better suited to university but who have to remain under the present system as square pegs in round holes because of the rigidity of the system.  Our solution seeks to avoid that by providing the only conditions in which it can be avoided and the reason we have chosen it is that of our firm belief in that and that is the message I would like to go out from this debate.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the problem of the number of institutions.  The real political difficulty in this is one that the Government have grasped but we have no illusions about the fire we come under because of this.  The real political problem is that there are seven institutions basically&mdash;the university colleges, including Maynooth, and Limerick and the economic building at Ballymun in the form of Bolton Street and Kevin Street today, treating them as one, but there are two at present&mdash;seven institutions all of which aspire to university status or its equivalent. Six of them specifically aspire to university status.  I am not quite certain if that is true of the seventh.</P>
    <P>Now, if we gave in to these pressures, if we so disregard the interests of higher education, we would have a university structure unique in Europe and the laughing-stock of Europe.  I would like Deputies to consider the actual position in comparison with these other countries.  We find that in a couple of the richer countries there is a ratio of something under one million population for university in Switzerland and France; in Austria just fractionally under one million; in Norway and Denmark, one million; in The Netherlands 1.2 million; UK, 1.25 million; Italy, 1.22 million; Sweden, one of the richest countries in Europe, 1.62 million and Spain, 1.77 million.</P>
    <P>Now a country which endowed itself with universities so numerous that they <Col N="347" /> have a university for every 400,000 people&mdash;taken together in the aggregate this is what the institutions are proposing&mdash;would be a country that had universities which, because of their small scale, underendowment and sheer numbers in relation to population, would not be treated seriously by other countries.  Countries, even wealthy countries, which know the impossibility of maintaining universities more numerously in the order of one per million, or something close to that, simply would not take such universities seriously.  Each of the institutions believes it must be a university and each is determined to achieve this for itself.</P>
    <P>The Government's job is not to succumb to pressures from interest groups which, taken in the aggregate are seeking something against their own interests; the Government's duty is to maintain the standard and reputation of Irish education and this cannot be done by proliferating universities around the country in a way which would be totally out of line with any other country in Europe.  We have no doubt of the kind of opposition we will face, but it would be wrong for the Government to put politics first and academic interests second and to proliferate universities in order to have a quiet and easy time with their proposals. I am glad to say that the Government did not think of acting in that way.</P>
    <P>The third problem, that of rationalisation, is a problem in Dublin.  There are facilities for specialised staff and students who are within a few hundred yards of each other but the system is one where each unit jealously guards its resources.  However, there are exceptions. There are marginal cases in some departments where some progress has been made but taking the higher-level educational structure in Dublin anybody who imagines that there is anything like co-ordination or free availability of resources to those who need them is unfamiliar with the institutions. From personal knowledge, I know that the resistance to any change in this area is immense.  We have tried to get over this by establishing a <Col N="348" /> conjoint board and, in the case of science, to ensure rationalisation of the highly costly investment equipment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question, please?  He is talking about students who have reached a point of third level education.  Is he concerned at all about students who are on their way up?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

Students on their way up can get access in different ways to different institutions but they may not be the institutions that suit them and they may find themselves square pegs in round holes.  We want a structure which is closely linked vertically so that the students can move up in the different streams, but also they must be linked horizontally so that if they are in the wrong stream they can move across.</P>

      <P>Our aim is that the students within the university can move backwards and forwards freely so that the student who is a square peg in a round hole can shift to the other side where he may be better off.  This cannot happen now and it is a deprivation that is a serious one for many students and even fatal for many others to their chances of succeeding in life.</P>

    <P>The joint science faculty overcomes the serious defect of the Fianna Fáil proposal for Trinity and UCD which involved an emphasis on physical sciences in one and biological science in the other.  It was always scientifically unrealistic.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am sorry but I do not want to take interruptions because I will only confuse myself and the Deputies if I do.  Nobody can challenge that the decisions we took were academically rather than politically motivated.  I do not think that in anything I have said the desire to get votes can be detected.  A courageous Government can be detected, working out what seems to be in the best interests of the students in the country now and in the future, seeking to create this pattern knowing the resistance it would meet from vested interests and knowing that the political Opposition would be likely to fall into the trap of supporting these vested interests.  We knew there would be criticism but it is criticism that we can face.</P>
      <P>It has come from various interest groups.  Let us consider what they are.  How many of the criticisms are educational criticisms?  There may be some but they are certainly not the ones that make newspaper headlines. For example, there are criticisms from Trinity College&mdash;and to call them criticisms is to understate their intensity&mdash;of the scheme because the balance is disturbed.  This is the basic argument.  I have not heard from a spokesman of Trinity College or any of my friends there a suggestion that there are strong reasons of an academic character for keeping veterinary science in Trinity College rather than associating it with agriculture which will be in UCD.  At no point was it suggested that veterinary medicine would be better in TCD. What was insisted upon was that NUI and TCD reach an agreement behind the backs of the Government of the day that this agreement must be maintained.  Any Government that disturbs it in the interests of giving a better academic solution has no right to interfere in the system in this way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government to their credit did not accept that universities pursuing their own interests, which they are entitled to do, had a right to carve up the system in a way that suited them regardless of the interests of the students.  We do not accept it.  If it is our view that veterinary medicine is better associated with agriculture it will go there.  If this disturbs the balance of an inter-academic agreement that is unfortunate and I am sorry that it creates an intense feeling between rival groups, but this cannot be a consideration in the mind of the Government.</P>
      <P>Take the problem of the VEC on which we had a plea from Deputy Tunney.  Naturally they want to hang on to the technological institutes which they now control.  Do they want to do so because this is necessary in their interests?  Is it better to be controlled in that way than to be an institution with their own governing body to run their own affairs, part of the university system, closely linked to other colleges in the system instead of being partitioned off and kept at a lower level of endowment with a higher level of hours worked per staff member?  I do not think the VEC arguments put forward are academic, they are arguments of sentiment.  We cannot be concerned about that where the interests of students are concerned Even if we offend vested interests we still give the right answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We get the same thing from the various units in the system which are seeking to be separate universities.  I have not heard an argument that seems to me to be a genuinely academic argument on this account. I am a member of the Senate of the NUI and the governing body of UCD. I know how the system works.  As it operates now, it is, I admit a cumbersome and not particularly efficient system but it is not a system which interferes with the running of the universities which, inherently, must of its nature prevent them from <Col N="351" /> running their own affairs&mdash;quite the contrary.  As a member of the governing body of UCD I know that they run their own affairs but there are certain matters such as the appointments of staff and the question of degrees which are dealt with at university level.  This involves a certain amount of travel by academics from time to time, backwards and forwards.  This is a nuisance, but the institutions are self-governing and the university system protects the overall academic interests involved. The claim of each institution to be separate universities would, if given into in each instance, lead to proliferation of universities without parallel in Europe and would undermine confidence abroad in our whole university system.  That is what is put forward.  Though we know that there will be local opposition and we know the pressures involved we know that there could be nothing more politically disadvantageous than to fight against this pressure, we have done so and nobody can fault us for acting in a non-academic or non-educational way or acting in our own political interests.</P>
    <P>On the question of consultations, let me recall that this matter has gone on since 1961.  There was the commission, the O'Malley plan, the Lenihan plan, the UCD agreement, the NUI-TCD agreement, the HEA proposals and the constant pressure for decisions from the Government.  When we do make decisions the cry is why did we not give a White Paper instead?  It is not easy to satisfy people sometimes and perhaps sometimes one should not try too hard when we are trying to do the right thing in the interests of the people and in the interests of the students.</P>

      <P>The House will notice that in the long list that the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave at the very end of his speech all the activity outlined in that last paragraph took place during Fianna Fáil's term of office and not during the term of office of the Coalition Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the long line of consultation took place under the Fianna Fáil administration and the 15 apostles of consultation did not consult at all.  I will take, first of all, some of the points raised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In his own quiet way, he introduced the whole discussion about a unified system or the binary system.  He said that the reforms carried out at second level education&mdash;incidentally the Minister forgot to mention carried out by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;would fail if, at third level, some action was not taken to unify the third level system.  The Minister went on to speak in the themes of the bourgeoise, the heated ideas of undergraduate brains, about the technological part of third level education being the poor relation, the second of the two cultures mentioned by C. P. Snow in his lecture of that title.  There are some of us who think that that title is a misnomer and that, in fact, what he was talking about were two aspects of the same culture; in fact that technological education, technological development is as much a part of the western civilisation as is the development in law, or medicine, or in any of what are regarded as the old respectable university professions.</P>
      <P>I submit, from experience in talking to students at third level non-university colleges in this city&mdash;unfortunately I have not had contact with them in Cork but I have had contact with RPC personnel elsewhere&mdash;that I have not found either in students or in staff any feeling of inferiority.  If, as has been said by a number of Deputies on the opposite side, this area of third level education has been underendowed, surely those in charge of deciding what money is spent, can remedy this situation without going through a whole big rigmarole about &ldquo;comprehensivisation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was going to give them a place in the sun.  Those were his words.  I submit to the House that they achieved their own place in the sun without thanks to the Minister for Industry and Commerce or anybody else.  It is an honoured place and the oil and grease <Col N="353" /> under the fingernails on this side of the House would be the badge of courage and would not carry any stigma either socially or professionally. I said elsewhere that the sophisticated employment that follows on the type of technological training which people get in these third level colleges which we have already, is a concomitant of social availability, social respectability, social acceptability.  In other words, this is a lot of bourgeois nonsense about technology being the poor relation.  I submit that it is attitudinising.</P>
    <P>What the third level colleges want at present is money, Lebensraum, buildings, and freedom to develop in their own way.  They are not second-class citizens on the third level.  That is a subjective approach to the whole matter.  It is subjective in a certain milieu in the capital city.  Is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology some kind of inferior place?  Why should Kevin street or Bolton street be so regarded?  In fact they are not.  What does the Minister for Industry and Commerce want for Cork and Galway?  &ldquo;What do I want&rdquo; he said?  &ldquo;What do I want for Cork and Galway&rdquo;?  Egocentrism gone mad.  What do Cork and Galway want for themselves is also a valid question?  If I have time I will come to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs said when he gave a ratio of so many hundreds of thousands of pounds to each third level institute. How does it change if Cork and Galway are allowed to develop in the NUI?  How does that make any difference to the ratio?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the Minister is so illogical.  I am talking in the context of Cork and Galway.  The Minister was using the argument against Cork and Galway becoming independent universities in their own right.  His statement was completely illogical.  The Minister knows that quite well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was talking in the context of Cork and Galway. I will not be put off.  The Minister did not allow me to ask <Col N="354" /> questions.  I would welcome them but I am very short of time.  The Minister wants excellence and security.  He talks about the centripetalism tendencies in Europe today.  It is the duty of this House to fight against that centripetalism. At the beginning of our campaign to join the EEC, there was talk of that quadrangle in Europe and the industrial pull it had on all mainland Europe.  It was built in to the philosophy of the EEC at that time that positive decisions would be taken to counteract that pull.  What more telling counter-measure in third level education could the Administration take than to give University College, Galway, the right to become a university independent of the NUI?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs also said that the NUI complex involved a little bit of travelling.  It did not involve him in very much travelling. The man who is in charge of a department in University College, Cork, or in University College, Galway, and who has to traipse up and down to Dublin, is involved in a good deal of travelling, hardship and waste of time.  Obviously, this will be continued under the new arrangement.  I submit that we can trust Cork and Galway to aim at excellence, an aim which hardly any university college ever achieves.  It can also guarantee its own security by maintaining its own standards and contacts internationally.</P>
      <P>I found the term &ldquo;spurious local patriot&rdquo; used by the Minister for Industry and Commerce very offensive. I found it very strange coming from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, a leading member of the Labour Party.  When is local patriotism spurious and when is it genuine?  Obviously, it is spurious if it disagrees with the Minister's preconceived ideas.  He claimed that the top brass of the universities did not have the interest of higher education at heart but only in maintaining their own power bloc.  Only the Minister for Industry and Commerce has the interests of higher education in Cork and Galway at heart.  People who are involved in universities obviously do not have these interests at heart.  This is a ridiculous situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="355" /> His whole ideas were expressed in a most patronising fashion which I found disgusting.  I cannot square them with the conclusions arrived at by the Commission on Higher Education, by the Higher Education Authority.  Was it spurious local patriotism?  Was it the influence of the top brass of the universities which appealed to the Commission on Higher Education to recommend independent university status to University College, Galway, and University College, Cork?  It certainly was neither of these two groups who persuaded the Fianna Fáil Party that that should be the case.  That is still their position and it will remain their position.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked about too many colleges.  I have, as an <i>obiter dictum</i>, dealt partly with the illogicality of his remarks on that score in the context of indepenrent status for University College, Cork, and University College, Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with University College, Cork and University College, Galway.  It is the Minister's own proposals that intend to make independent universities out of Ballymun and out of Limerick.  I am dealing with the proposition in relation to University College, Cork and University College, Galway.  The Minister spoke about mobility.  I cannot see horizontal mobility between the universities and the NIHE.  There is a strong element of vertical mobility at the moment in the third level colleges in Dublin, and, indeed, an arrangement for post-graduate work between the third level colleges and Trinity College, Dublin.  This was not adverted to at any stage by any of the speakers.  It was said for example, that it was 50 years of separateness that made the colleges of technology the poor relations and also of inferior status.  That is begging the question.  If a conscious decision of the Administration allotted money to the Ballymun complex and to the buildings there, then they would not be short of money; they would <Col N="356" /> not be short of Lebensraum and they could develop in their own way.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs also referred to resources.  I cannot see how the conjoint board is necessary to guarantee the proper use of resources. The Higher Education Authority will be charged with making demands for money for the various developments and I cannot see why the Higher Education Authority could not perform this function and why it is necessary to have a new conjoint board unless it is that the Government have gone mad on bureaucracy, need more and more bureaucrats, more and more committees, more and more trammels on the university people.</P>

It can be given any powers which we like to give from this House to deal with university education.  It can be given; it can be expanded; it can be strengthened and get rid of this new committee the Minister was talking about.</P>
      <P>With regard to the joint science faculty, it comes rather strange from an Administration that has expressed concern for science and technology above all and this is what is supposed to have put its stamp on the proposals of the Administration, that the science faculities of the University of Dublin and of University College, Dublin, have not been told what is in store for them.  I have not seen a welcoming statement from either of them.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke of interest groups.  Was it an interest group that sat on the Commission for Higher Education, the Ó Dálaigh Commission?  Was it an interest group that adjudged UCC and UCG were entitled to independent status on the Higher Education Authority?</P>

      <P>Why must the Minister stipulate &ldquo;without pay&rdquo;?  I do not agree with the proposition that 24 hours of rest with pay or without pay is an adequate rest for a young person. It contravenes all the regulations of shift work and everything else.  To me, it is a most unjust section because the last paragraph reads:</P>
      <P>.... the employer shall ensure that the conditions of employment of every such employee are such that the employee will have at least twenty-four consecutive hours rest without pay in every period of seven days.</P>
      <P>I do not know why that is in the Bill because, in the first place, I think it is very punitive if the Minister presses this.  On any shift work they would be given more than 24 hours continuous rest a week, so why must the Minister stipulate that the employee should not be paid for it?  Surely that is superfluous?  If the employer wants to pay an employee let the employer pay him, but do not put in the Bill that he cannot pay him.</P>

      <P>We come back to the problem which crops up again and again in this legislation.  We are dealing here with several areas; we are talking about the maximum, we are talking about the norm and about the minimum.  When we speak about this matter of rest, again we are speaking about the minimum period of rest. There is nothing to prevent an employer from paying anything he wishes.  We are here simply ensuring that, in extreme cases, in regard to the question of the possibility of the legal problems, which are comprehensive in character, and how to settle them, I must try to seek an answer to each, even rare, eventuality.  That is what I am seeking to do here.  I seek simply to make sure that these <Col N="362" /> periods of rest are available to the employee but it does not debar the possibility of payment to the employee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An employer shall neither permit any young person to do any work at any time between the hour of <Col N="363" /> 10 p.m. on any day and the hour of 6 a.m. on the following day nor permit any young person to do any work until the expiration of 12 hours from the time at which he ceased to do work on the previous day.</P>
    <P>The question of evening jobs was raised by one of the outside organisations. They asked us to impress on the Minister the necessity for him to review the situation in relation to evening jobs, jobs going on until 10.30 p.m., or possibly 11 p.m. which young people may wish to take in one place or another.  Has the Minister given any consideration to that aspect?</P>

Does it mean at present that no person under the age of 18 years can take up any employment which ceases after the hour of 10 p.m.? There may be young people who work in restaurants, publichouses and did he take that into consideration in the drafting of this section?</P>

      <P>The Minister knows this will be difficult to enforce.  Will the Minister ensure that this section is enforced now that he has indicated that a person of 18 cannot accept work that expires after 10 p.m.?  There is a problem here.  If you are unable to enforce legislation, it is bad legislation. I wonder whether there was adequate consideration given to this?  There would seem to be a point in the representation made to us in relation to young people who might like to take work after school hours or, indeed, after the hours they would be studying at university which could take them up to 11 o'clock or midnight.  It applies to people at 18.  I have no desire to change it but I would like to know if the Minister has given this full and adequate consideration.  Quite a number of people of 18 and younger do part-time evening work and if they are barred from doing work which expires after 10 p.m. we have created a new situation.  We want to ensure that the law can be enforced and will be enforced for the protection of the younger people.</P>

When the Deputy said I would stick to a certain hour, I was speaking in the context of the absence of any other suggestion from any other Member of the House.

      <P>Although I say so myself this has all the quality of a Ministerial amendment. The Minister is seeking here to restrict double employment and if this amendment were adopted by him, it would have that effect.  Once you start meddling around with more than one employer, you are in all kinds of trouble.  It should be restricted to one employer per day.  It is not a great deal to ask but I think it would make it much simpler.  It would also make it a better Bill by being more specific as regards employers or employment of a young person on any one day.  I propose in the amendment that all words after &ldquo;employer&rdquo; in line 32 to the end of that paragraph be deleted.</P>

      <P>There are difficulties as the Deputy mentions. The only concern we have is that the provision in relation to the obligation to work the hours set down should be fulfilled.  How many employers were involved in this process, whether one or two, does not concern the purpose of the legislation.  It is equitable in terms of the provisions of this legislation that if the young person involved decides to work for more than one employer that he should not be prevented from doing so, provided his overall hours of work stay within the maximum hours permitted for his age group under the Bill.  The amendment proposed by Deputy Moore would have the effect of preventing outright an employee covered by the Bill from working for more than one employer in a working day.  I wish to restrict areas of exploitation in this legislation but I do not wish to intervene where that intervention is not called for.  Therefore, I do not wish to be prohibitive just for the sake of being prohibitive and restrictive for the sake of that.  As long as the hours clause is complied with, I do not propose to interfere and I would ask Deputy Moore in consideration of that to withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the dual employment, like Deputy Moore, I feel that this would strengthen the Bill.  The Minister is well aware that it is going to be difficult to implement this section dealing with double employment. It could be treble employment or a variety of employments. How is the Minister going to decide in the case of a person who is hauling turf?  If he is hauling for 10 different people, is that employment by one person who pays him or is it employment by 10 people who pay him or can he only haul turf for two people?  It is going to be a difficult section to implement where there are a variety of employments concerned. I feel, like Deputy Moore, that this section can be abused and will be abused and legislation which we will be unable to implement will be bad legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to ask the Minister <Col N="369" /> how extensive was his examination of this particular problem.  What percentage of people who were examined worked in double employment?  Is there a large sector employed by two employers in the one day or is this a very small minority?  If it is a very small minority and if it is difficult to enforce is it not far better to eliminate it at the moment to ensure that the law can be maintained in a very easy way.</P>
    <P>If we refer back to the suggestion made this morning in relation to some sort of insurance cover for a young person this would ensure absolute control of the situation.  These young people now have no type of insurance cover and there is absolutely no check that one can make on whether in fact they had dual employment and whether they exceeded the hours for two, three or four employers.  There will have to be some means of checking so that the law can be fully enforced in order to protect them to the fullest extent and to protect them to the extent that the Minister wants to protect them in other sections of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am loathe to interfere with the employment situation of all employees in the State up to the age of 18 where a principle is not being infringed.  The effect of Deputy Moore's amendment would be that in fact, for the first time since 1936, because a similar provision was involved in the 1936 legislation, we would invoke a new principle in this area.  We would lay it down that in the area of employment up to 18 a new principle was announced that you could not have dealings with two employers even though you complied with the provisions of maximum hours.  I would put it to the common sense of the Deputies opposite that such a step away from the main body of legislation should not be undertaken save in circumstances which call for such action.  The Deputies plead the extra difficulties of ensuring that there is not infringement of the law because there are two employers involved. There are other sections of this legislation where similar formidable difficulties of implementation apply.  I would, <Col N="370" /> therefore, plead that as a matter of principle where there is no infringement of the hours situation, which is our main concern under this section, the problem of implementation and the practical difficulties related to it in terms of the inspectorate being able to follow through infringements, that those difficulties should not be pleaded as an excuse for laying extra burdens or laying completely outside the law, the case of the young person up to 18 who simply worked one hour a day for one employer and worked the remainder for another employer.  I do not think we should outlaw that practice just because difficulties of implementation might suggest this was the wiser course.</P>

      <P>If one reads subsections 2 and 3 of this section one finds the unfortunate young person is left to carry the can for the employer. Subsection (3) reads:</P>
      <P>Whenever an employer is prosecuted for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for him to prove he did not, or could not, by reasonable inquiry, have known that the employee had done work for any other employer on the day in respect of which the prosecution is brought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The young person could be left in the dock while the employer says: &ldquo;I asked the boy had he worked and the boy said `No'.&rdquo;  So, therefore, the young person is going to bear the brunt of this.  It is very unfair to the young person who might be working for a very big employer.  I can see the Minister's point in saying we should not restrict it to one employer.  That is fine.  We are not doing that, but we are placing the young person in jeopardy. He may be tempted to earn more money and work for one employer for the maximum number of hours allowed and then go to another employer and possibly he would through human frailty say: &ldquo;I was not working before.&rdquo;  So, the unfortunate <Col N="371" /> boy or girl could well find himself or herself prosecuted while the employer says, like Pontius Pilate, &ldquo;I asked him whether he had worked and he said `No' so therefore, I am clear on this&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we should add extra provisions which are not essential.  We have compulsory insurance so that is not the problem. The main problem is the question of the extra burden on the inspectorate involved in chasing up infringements under two employers.  I would say that acceptance of the amendment will not enhance the chances of enforcing this prohibition because it makes the stipulation more restrictive, brings the law into intervention in areas where it is not called for and increases the chances of evasion.  So, I do not know if the job of the inspectorate would be made easier or if the job of implementation would be made easier by the addition of this amendment.  On principle I would say that I think it would be a departure that I would not welcome from the main body of the 1936 legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept that.  I have no objection to the amendment but I have an objection to the wording for the reason pointed out by Deputy Moore.  It appears to throw the onus back on the young person concerned.  The employer may prove that he was ignorant of the fact that the employee had already worked. A young person will not be likely to read this legislation closely and, because of information he gives the employer, the employer may be exonerated. I do not think it is fair <Col N="373" /> the onus should be put on the young person.  Deputy Moore made a very valid point.  It is a point I would ask the Minister to consider.  The amendment certainly corrects a grammatical error and there is no objection to that, but I am not at all happy with the section as it stands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to put the onus on the young person. The Minister will agree that a young person is the last person to study a Bill in detail.  I welcome the amendment made by the Minister earlier this evening that he intends to issue this in a very simplified form for the benefit of young people, but the Minister will agree that there are a great many young people who will never read it and who will never be familiar with the provisions.  Innocently, they may not make known to a second employer some particular aspect of their day's or of their week's activities and, because of that, the onus of the offence committed then passes from the employer.  There must be some amendment here.</P>

      <P>It shall be a defence only for the employer but that does not mean that he will be able to justify it.  It shall be an defence for him to prove that he did not, or could not, by reasonable inquiry have known.  These are rather stringent requirements.  &ldquo;Reasonable inquiry&rdquo; has a long legal history and there is case law to show what the precedents are.  It will only be a defence for him to prove it and he must prove it.  The onus remains on the employer.  The onus of proof is not removed here.  While the Deputy is not worried about the drafting amendment, he is worried about the substance of it.  The substance is that it leaves the employer with quite a heavy liability in terms of proof.</P>

      <P>No. &ldquo;Reasonable inquiry&rdquo; does not simply leave the employer in the role of simply lifting up a telephone.  It would be for those inquiring to decide in each particular instance what constituted &ldquo;reasonable inquiry&rdquo;.  If we did not have this section, automatic conviction of the employer would follow, even if he had been misled by the employee.  I am not suggesting that we should always automatically see through the eyes of the employer.  Neither must we automatically assume the innocence of one side and the guilt of the other.  In this section we put quite a heavy onus on the employer.  He has got to pursue reasonable inquiry and it can only be a defence as long as he proves reasonable inquiry.  That leaves him with a heavy liability and that is the kind of situation we want.  We do not wish to place automatic guilt and we do not wish to leave the employer totally defenceless, where he might be faced with an unscrupulous employee.</P>

      <P>it shall be a defence for him to prove that he did not know, or could not, by reasonable inquiry, have known, that the employee ...</P>
      <P>The situation could be that, when a young person presented himself for employment, the employer would ask that young person: &ldquo;Were you employed previously today?&rdquo;  and if the young person said: &ldquo;No, I was not&rdquo;, would that be accepted as a reasonable inquiry?</P>

      <P>It is not simply a passive role.  Questions will be directed at the employer.  It will be the person investigating who will inquire as to the facts.  &ldquo;Reasonable inquiry&rdquo; will be based on precedents <Col N="375" /> and a conclusion reached as to what was the reasonable inquiry on the part of the employer.  This will change according to circumstances.  That is the power in this particular section.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that this gives sufficient cover; the employer will be forced to fulfil what is required here under &ldquo;reasonable inquiry&rdquo;.  However, if it sets the Deputy's mind at rest, one can consider an elaboration of what constitutes &ldquo;reasonable inquiry&rdquo;.  I think the Deputy should have no misgivings. We will look at it again to see if we can add to what is required here under &ldquo;reasonable inquiry&rdquo;, although the difficulty in amplifying legislation designed for all kinds of cases lies in trying to cover every aspect.  However, I undertake to have another look at this between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(4)  The Minister may, after consultation with the Minister for Education, by licence, exempt any class of employers from complying with any provision of this Act or of regulations under this Act in any case where that class of employers is participating in an approved scheme which combines limited employment experience with education or training.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> I am proposing this amendment in order to ensure that the terms of the Bill may not be a barrier to desirable developments under this section in the future.  It would be of advantage to schoolchildren who may not have an academic bent to be able to participate in specially designed schemes which would combine limited employment experience with education or training. This has been attempted elsewhere. It has not been attempted here yet but I believe it is a task we will embark upon shortly.  This section is designed to ensure that we may avail of this opportunity when the plans and the schemes are at the operational stage.  These amendments will enable me, in consultation with the Minister for Education, to exempt by licence from compliance with any provisions of the Act employers who participate in such approved schemes.  This will leave the way open for the development of suitable schemes through mutual co-operation between educational authorities and employers on a course.  This greater co-operation between employers and the educational authorities is absolutely crucial and will become more crucial in the years ahead.  It is co-operation for itself and we do not see the limit.  Undoubtedly in the future we certainly would hope to see this development in this section designed to facilitate that situation when it comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment but I would like to say that when discussing section 10 the Minister referred to the difficulties that arose regarding my amendment in relation to vocational training and to the difficulties that would be experienced in relation to contact between one Department and another. As I pointed out at that time, there was a section in the Act where the Minister for Education was, and would be consulted in relation to a scheme proposed by the Minister.  I would have thought that the Minister would have given the same consideration to section 10 as he is now giving to this subsection.  We welcome the amendment but we are sad to think that the whole question of technical training and training schemes of one <Col N="378" /> kind or another was not fully and comprehensively examined to ensure that amendments, such as we had on section 10 or other modified amendments, would be brought forward to meet the same type of situation.  The Minister indicated that there was an ongoing situation in the national agreement whereby there was development towards this type of participation. That we welcome but we hoped that the whole Bill would have had within it several forward-thinking suggestions to keep us abreast, if not in front, of continental thinking.  We had the opportunity here through our legislation where we could project an image that would be copied in the future, even by the continentals, rather than lagging behind.</P>
      <P>We welcome this amendment.  We hope that the Minister will consider redrafting section 10 and that it will get the same consideration this amendment received.  The amendment is one which gives additional recognition to people who wish to participate in the schemes outlined in the amendment. In relation to this amendment can the Minister now say if there were practical difficulties with the Minister for Education in relation to section 10 as against this particular section?</P>

I can assure Deputies opposite that this legislation is another step into what I think will be an exciting future in this development between education and employment agencies.  This section is designed to ensure that we meet those possibilities in the future.  I can assure Deputies that the legislation under this section will ensure that I will be coming back to this House of the Oireachtas again&mdash;I hope in co-operation with the Minister for Education&mdash;to lay before the House further schemes in this area.  I have no doubt that the Minister for Education will co-operate fully in that endeavour as I know his deep interest in technological education and in the advancement of education generally in our country.</P>

      <P>Under section 16, subsection (1), the Minister is given powers which I do not disagree with because this being a new concept of legislation there are various aspects of the young person's employment which he must look at.  It gives him the opportunity of looking at individual types of work, seasonal work, and so on.  Under section 16 (1) he can make an order covering them. He has to take into consideration the economic circumstances in the homes of these young people and the conditions which he will specify by order for the particular class of industry or the nature of the work. This is why I am disappointed that he did not accept our amendment. What we were asking for in that <Col N="381" /> amendment was very much in line with section 16 and with the powers being given to him there.  It was a lesson to me to realise that a Minister, for political reasons or otherwise, was not prepared to accept a sensible amendment.  I would ask him again to reconsider it before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>In subsection (2), page 9, line 21, after &ldquo;his trade union&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or his parent or guardian&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment to recognise formally in the drafting of the Bill the rights of parents and guardians to take action on behalf of young persons for the recovery of moneys due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment would meet portion, at least, of Deputy Dowling's objectives.  I am doubtful of the wisdom of his suggestion that I should have power, in effect, to designate other parties to take legal actions on behalf of young persons. I might find myself adjudicating between different parties claiming to represent the person in question.  The concept should not be confused with the choice of representatives of employers or employees I am required to consult under section 6 and section 16.  Therefore, it goes some of the way to meet Deputy Dowling's amendment.  I think his amendment is reasonable but I part company with <Col N="382" /> him in the section of the amendment where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We should compliment Deputy Dowling for dragging more from the Minister and pointing out to him an obvious discrepancy in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider my amendment is superior to the Minister's in many ways.  There was a vacuum in the Bill and I am glad that the Minister recognised this.  This follows on what we had this morning&mdash;the question of recognising the rights of the parent and guardian which was completely omitted from the Bill as drafted.  Since we recognise their rights, and the Minister now recognises their rights, it is difficult for me to understand how the Minister regards my amendment as inferior to his.  The exact phraseology used by the Minister in section 1 is used in my amendment, that is, that &ldquo;such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The section provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  Any sum of money due to an employee from his employer under any provision of this Act shall be recoverable by the employee from his employer as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>(2)  Proceedings for the recovery of any sum due by an employer to an employee under any provision of this Act may be instituted and maintained on behalf of the employee by his trade union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we use the same argument as the Minister did on section 1, the Minister must prefer the amendment submitted by me to his own.  In the event of a parent or guardian not being available in the event of a trade union not being the organised body that would support the individual's claim, there must be some other person who, in the opinion of the Minister, would be suitable to pursue the claim.  I believe that, once the Minister has accepted the definition of the representative employees under section 1, he must also accept my amendment.  My <Col N="383" /> amendment is more comprehensive and falls in line with the definition section in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will accept that in sections 6 and 16 we are talking about different matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the definition section.  &ldquo;Representatives of employees&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;such persons as are, in the opinion of the Minister, representative of such employees&rdquo;. Surely this is more comprehensive?  It means that if a young child is pursuing a claim, and the union, or parent, or guardian, were not available, someone would be deemed suitable by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to the Deputy, with respect, that in the previous definition it relates to sections 6 and 16.  In section 6 I have power to raise the minimum age for employment and I have to consult with representatives of employers and employees.  The Deputy will accept that section 6 relates to something more than the individual, it relates to the class of work, to a group.</P>
      <P>Section 16 refers to exceptions and exemptions, the welfare and safety of employees.  The distinction between those sections and the section we are now dealing with is that in this section we are dealing with the rights of an individual.  The Deputy seeks to give me the right or the discretion to decide between different persons, who amongst those persons will represent that individual interest.  I do not wish to have that embarrassing power because it could very easily place me in a rather difficult situation or place any Minister in my position in a difficult situation of choosing between rival claimants to represent the individual who has the case.  For that reason I suggest to Deputy Dowling that the previous section is excluded in the terms of the representative bodies.  I would point out that there is a right of action existing in common law for the individual.  I do not wish to intervene in that contentious area.  That is why I do not seek those powers.</P>

      <P>That is right, but our amendment is in line with the interpretation section.  The Minister indicated that if a young child, and this Bill refers to young children of 15 and 16 years of age, possibly an orphan, who is not a member of a trade union, has no parent or guardian, he may process his case through the court.  Surely it is ridiculous to throw the onus of processing the case for the recovery of moneys due by an employer to a young person, an orphan who has no parent or guardian, through the courts.  Surely there must be some other means of rectifying this situation in order to ensure that justice is done to this very vulnerable section of society, that we hope will be safeguarded by this particular Bill.</P>

      <P>It is obvious that the Deputy, despite my explanations, has still some disquiet about this section.  I have no reason to wish to leave the Deputy with that reasonable disquiet which apparently he feels, even though on looking at the application of the definitions to section 6 and 16 he will see, on reflection, that these are different circumstances.  Section 17 relates to the individual, it is a complicated area of intricate common law and my own reluctance to intervene in this area where there is this right of the individual to act on behalf of the particular claimant.  I undertake to furnish a fuller statement to the deputy at Report Stage on this matter and explain my reservations at greater length.  I feel that we could be at it for some time tonight and the Deputy would still feel the disquiet he has already expressed.</P>

There must be some other way that the Minister can protect young people.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept our amendment we may put down a new section to deal with this type of problem for the Report Stage.

      <P>I move Amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 9, line 26, after &ldquo;of this Act&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall make available to his employees any other material published by the Minister advising them of their rights under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have a situation here concerning the display of abstracts of Acts.  It states:</P>
      <P>Every employer shall display at the principal entrances to the premises where any of his employees work, and in such other places as an inspector may require, in such a position that it may be easily read by the employees so employed, the prescribed abstract of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want to insert the addition to this. The Minister is not taking into account the literacy problems that exist among young people of school-leaving age and under.  There is little use in publishing abstracts of Acts <Col N="389" /> which one cannot read or understand. It is difficult at times to understand the manner in which Parliamentary draftsmen present this kind of legislation. I know the Minister finds it difficult to understand some of the terms used, but we still expect a young person of school-leaving age or younger to understand abstracts from Acts as published and put up somewhere at the entrance of employment.</P>
    <P>I have seen the Conditions of Employment Act, the Truck Act and other Acts displayed in places of employment.  After a time one is not able to read them because of the grease and dirt that covers them, apart from that, the language and phraseology used is difficult to understand. One would need a legal advisor on entering employment to advise on the person's rights if they were to rely on the abstracts.  Usually one finds at the bottom of the abstract words to the effect that the abstract does not give the full text so that the worker does not get the whole picture.  The abstract contains only some elementary information in order to satisfy the inspector or Minister.</P>
    <P>I think there are a number of other ways in which the Minister could impart this information to young people, for example, public announcements, television and distribution of casettes or leaflets.  We should like to see a more imaginative approach to communication. Posters are another means of advertising which have become popular in different campaigns. Announcements could be made over the intercom system.  These are various ways in which the Minister could make known the rights of the individual. Very often, if an employee stopped to read these abstracts on his way into work, he would be sacked for stalling. I can imagine a variety of circumstances in which the employee would never be able to read these abstracts. I have worked in places where these abstracts were displayed.  I never read them, except the large print at the top of the notice which indicated that it was the Conditions of Employment Act.  I was not able to get near enough to read them as in some cases they were placed behind machines or else <Col N="390" /> they were up too high.  Even if I was able to read them, I am sure&mdash;considering the confusion of Deputies in relation to the phrasing on this Bill&mdash; that a child of 14 would not be able to assess his true position from some obscure abstract.  A more imaginative approach should be adopted and the Minister should use some modern methods in this area.  The system which is in operation at the moment is completely outmoded.</P>

      <P>I did indicate this morning that we would be publishing some kind of a more simplified handbook which would, by cartoons, pictures and drawings, attempt to bring across the provisions of this legislation. I would say in respect of this amendment that under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, passed last year, employees are entitled to receive, after one month's employment, a statement of their terms of employment.  It follows in the case of young people that these terms must comply with the provisions of this legislation.  Deputy Dowling's amendment would mean that I would have to pursue something like 65,000 cases throughout the country to see that the terms of his amendments were complied with.  I think Deputy Dowling stressed the necessity of using imagination.  We shall attempt to do that by distributing in the schools leaflets which explain the situation in simple terms and, of course, our inspectorate <Col N="391" /> will also help to ensure that the provisions of this legislation are made known.  I agree that we always have the problem that we cannot simplify legislation in this House to the extent that, in a court of law, clauses in particular cases will not stand up to a particular case.  Remember what maybe regarded as archaic terminology may, in fact, express an important legal point which is at the moment of proof of great assistance to the person claiming his or her rights.  It would be no help to the person claiming his or her rights in that situation to know that the legislation was in modern pop language but that it had neglected to defend his or her particular situation at that time.</P>
      <P>There is always that tension between the necessity for legislation here to be comprehensive to meet all particular cases and if, at times, we stretch the English language to the point of absurdity, if that helps in particular situations, then it is worth doing.  I agree that that does not absolve us from the necessity of explaining to the persons who must benefit what the provisions are and that I propose to carry through, completely.</P>

      <P>No, I am not accepting the amendment.  The intent of the amendment is already there in legislation and the minimum legislation was passed last year.  The import of the Deputy's further amendment would mean that there would be extra legal obligations devolving on employers and the inspectorate.  This would represent a further burden on a Bill that will mean a lot of extra work for the inspectorate to see that its provisions are implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> Therefore, if the Minister produces a document of any type stipulating that the employer is under obligation to give it to the employee, that will not cause a burden.  The Minister has now, as on previous occasions, quoted a figure of 65,000 people.  If one of that 65,000 people is going to be deprived of his rights, then we have fallen down on the job.  The Minister must ensure that every person is protected; we cannot protect a limited section of young persons or child employees only.  We are merely asking that when the Minister produces a document or documents the employer would be under an obligation to make that material available to the employees.</P>
    <P>Surely that is a simple procedure. If the Minister does not produce documentation then obviously the employer cannot distribute it.  If he does produce documentation freely available to employers it is only right that it be made accessible to employees. This Bill refers to young people.  One would think the Minister was dealing with adults all the time.  These are people of 15 or 16 years, or possibly less, entering employment for the first time who are unaware of their rights and unaware of how to find out what are their rights without any protection from trade unions, without advice from their employers.  We are merely asking that there be some better means of communication with the young person than by the exhibition of some document framed at the entrance to the place of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that if we do impose this extra obligation, since there are penalties attaching to this legislation, if the obligation is not carried through, we penalise.  That means we must ensure that the inspectors must go out to ensure that that obligation is carried through.  That means that the provisions of section 23 apply; that means that we exact fines not exceeding £25 for an offence.  I would suggest that it could go up to a fine not exceeding £50 on a second or subsequent offence, under that section, together with, in the case of a continuing offence, a fine not exceeding <Col N="393" /> £10.  I am simply suggesting that since we are dealing with legislation which has these onerous penalty clauses attached to it, we are not in any two minds at all about the necessity of informing employees.  I want to ensure that an already overburdened inspectorate, in terms of the provisions of this legislation, are not given extra obligations to carry through, obligations which would have to extend to something like 65,000 fresh employees, which is the number covered by this legislation.  The Deputy, in his time of employment, may not have looked at the charts over the machines.  His mind may have been perturbed by other matters.  I think he will accept the reality of that case, that what we should concentrate on is to ensure that we have the right literature with the right information and see that it gets to the right people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that he will have this booklet of cartoons available to project the rights of the individual.  I agree with the production of any document that will convey to a young person his rights.  But the display of an abstract of an Act is a different matter.  It is a very vague thing, especially for people with literacy problems.  Young people in the early stage of their employment may be nervous and concerned. Certainly they are not reading documentation displayed on the walls of workshops.  It is during the first few days or weeks of one's employment that one is assessed on one's capacity to do work rather than to be curiosityseekers reading documents.  I know how management operates in many firms.  Often even adult workers are unaware of their rights and when they try to obtain that information&mdash;which the employer is duty bound to give&mdash; they find it difficult to get it.  I was one of those persons.  Therefore, I understand the problems of an adult worker as against the child worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister will produce a document.  If the Minister does not produce it in sufficient volume to meet the needs of these 65,000 people, then he will be doing an injustice to some of these young people about whom he has spoken freely on occasion. <Col N="394" /> This morning I tried to obtain information from the Department of Education about the number of people who leave primary school each year, the number of people attending primary school and the number entering employment.  The Minister has a figure but I have another figure which does not quite measure up to the figure the Minister got.  I shall not dispute the situation because of 5,000 or 6,000.  The Minister must make documentation freely available to the sections that he is concerned about in this legislation.  If he is going to print a smaller quantity for the purpose of economy or some other such reason, he is failing in his responsibility.</P>
    <P>The terms of the amendment are simple and direct.  They merely ask that the employer make available to the young person any material other than the aspects of the Bill that the Minister has published advising them of their rights.  The inspectors have a job to do and they will have to do that job in relation to every aspect of this Bill.  If the Minister feels that this is going to create a burden on the inspectors then he will have to increase the number of inspectors to ensure that there is adequate and proper protection. Regarding the argument the Minister has used that this will be a great burden on these people who are to get the jobs of inspectors, he will have to think again and ensure that he creates enough posts in order to meet the situation which he has outlined here in this Act.  Our resolution is simple and direct.  It does not say that the Minister must produce documentation but if he does, the employer should pass that documentation to the employee he is taking on.  In taking up employment in all large firms today one is given a booklet indicating the conditions of employment.  One can read this and get a clear picture of what is involved.  In many cases young people are unaware of their rights.  We do not want to see these people pushed around.  We want to ensure that everybody fully understands what the Minister wishes to convey.  I do not think that an abstract of the Act is sufficient in this case to convey it to young persons.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this <Col N="395" /> simple amendment.  It does not complicate or confuse but merely indicates that if he produces documentation and passes it on to the employer, the employer is under an obligation to pass it on to the employee so that he can understand the position.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister of what he said and the record of the House will prove that you referred to the overloaded inspectorate and to the fact that the employer was having other obligations put on him which carried a penalty.  Deputy Dowling's motion, as far as the employer is concerned, is a very minor detail.  It is probably one of the simplest acts that an employer would have to perform within the context of this Bill.  All he has to do is to get some of these booklets that the Minister will be producing, that he has said are necessary.  How does the Minister intend to get them around to all these young people&mdash; 65,000 to quote his own figures?  Is it not a very simple matter for the employer <Col N="396" /> to get, 100, 20 or whatever his needs are for the number of young people employed and issue them to the young people.  The Minister has agreed with Deputy Dowling's amendment in every syllable but because it has come from this side of the House from a Deputy who has put some thought into it, it is not being accepted. I fully support what he says about the notices in workshops being absolutely ineffective.</P>

      <P>In page 10, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following subsections:</P>
      <P>(2)  Subsection (1) of this section shall apply in relation to every order made under this Act by the Minister fixing hours of work in relation to any form of work subject to the modification that every reference in the said subsection to the commencement of this Act shall be construed and have effect as a reference to the coming into operation of such order and every reference in the said subsection to compliance with this Act shall be construed and have effect as a reference to compliance with such order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  This section shall apply to piece work wages (within the meaning of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936) and to wages calculated by direct reference to the number of hours worked but with the modification that for the purposes of such application every provision in this section to the effect that a rate of wages or a minimum rate of wages or a restriction on a rate of wages is to remain unchanged shall be construed and have effect as a provision that the rate of piece work wages or of <Col N="399" /> wages by the hour (as the case may be) shall be so adjusted or varied that the average weekly earnings shall remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>We have had this on other sections, the continued dilemma of confusing certain provisions, whether the norm provisions, whether maximum provisions or whether minimum provisions, in this legislation which has sections to deal with all eventualities and all situations, confusing these with the circumstances of a particular industry, of the bargaining disposition at any particular moment in time.  Section 19 continues the position of the 1936 Act and is merely intended to ensure that if the hours are reduced by my orders&mdash;as I have provision in other sections to amend the normal hours of work and to amend the maximum hours of work&mdash;if I amend the normal hours of work and they are reduced, to ensure that there is no following subsequent reduction in wage rates <Col N="401" /> paid.  It is an unlikely eventuality, and something that is not of very large concern, but we have got to provide for it.  That is why this section is included.</P>
      <P>This legislation in general does not enter into the area of wage fixing. There is no part of this legislation which relates solely to the conditions of employment of young persons divided up into particular wage groups, rest hours, hours of work and so on provided, but it is not legislation to deal with rates of pay.  It would not be acceptable that any legislation passed by the House laid down particular wage rates set down by Parliament.

They look upon their role as one of wage bargaining and fixing the rates of pay in their own particular area.  They do not wish the intervention of the State in that area. Whilst this is the situation and while I understand that there is need for wage fixing, it is outside the scope of this legislation.  It is not a matter with which it is chiefly concerned since it really belongs to other areas of labour legislation.  I am, however, prepared to consider extensions from the joint labour committee system which have the agreement of both unions and employers for the kind of task the Deputy has in mind.  I am prepared to consider their extension to employment sectors where additional protection in the form of wage fixing under the statutory procedures could be shown to be necessary for both young and adult employees.

      <P>I move amendment No. 43:</P>
      <P>In page 11 to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>The provision here reads:</P>
      <P>The powers conferred on an inspector by subsection (1) (a) of this section shall not be exercisable in respect of a private dwelling house unless the Minister (or an officer of the Minister appointed for the purpose) certifies that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence under this section in relation to an employee has been committed by the employer, and the inspector in applying for admission to the house produces a certificate.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate what constitutes a dwelling house?  Is it a private dwelling with a garage attached, which is converted into some sort of factory or office where people are employed?  I feel this subsection needs to be redrafted.  There are factories in the top storeys of houses. One sees private dwellings with some sort of factory attached and a number of people employed in them.  What constitutes a private dwelling house? Could it be a garage converted into a factory or could it be a house without a garage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, there is a very large body of law as to what exactly constitutes a private dwelling house.  I believe this subsection is important.  There is a limitation under common law against entry and it is mentioned in our Constitution in Article 40.  It says that a private dwelling house cannot be entered except in <Col N="406" /> accordance with the law.  There would be many instances in which the employer's records would be kept in the dwelling parts of premises which would also pass as places of business, remembering that many of the people affected by this legislation will be engaged in small businesses.  Shops with living accommodation overhead are examples of what I have in mind. To enable the inspector to examine the employment records kept in the private dwelling areas of such premises, it is necessary that specific provisions on the lines of subsection (2) should be made.  That is why I would ask that it be retained and I would say to Deputy Dowling that his suggested deletion would seriously weaken the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 26 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is probably the most important section in the Bill.  The inspectors constitute the link in the chain for the successful implementation of the Bill.  While the Minister has indicated that these inspectors may be over-worked or that we may not have enough of them to do the job properly, I would hope that there is an adequate recruitment to meet this situation to ensure the enforcement of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Specialisation in young people requires special training and we hope the Minister will have not just any inspector but specialists in the field of communication between the Department and the employer.  This is a highly specialised field.  Far too often we have too many do-gooders or people seconded from one place to another to carry out a particular job. As I have said, we have here the key to the success or otherwise of this Bill. Inspectors should not be located in just one or two centres and they should not operate from Dublin or Cork.  We should have inspectors to cover a wide area.  It is desirable that they should be known to the parents, should be acquainted with the locality, with the school attendance officers, the manpower services or any other social workers in the area.  We hope that the <Col N="407" /> inspectors who will be recruited or who will be given the task will have the necessary qualifications to meet the demands that will be placed upon them by this Bill.  The Minister should indicate now that he is just not going to employ any inspector, that he will have the necessary power to ensure the full implementation of the Bill and that there will be adequate inspectors even if there is to be a distribution of some leaflets at some stage to the people who require them.</P>

I do not think it is there but I support all that Deputy Dowling has said in that respect. It raises for me one query on the Minister's speech on Second Stage.

One could read into that something to the effect that the Minister already has in his Department an adequate inspectorate.  I would not like to think that is the case.  I am sure the Minister will be recruiting many new men for this job.  These people have a very important role to play in their approach to young people.  The statistics and information that will be accumulated from their work will be given to the Department so that any <Col N="408" /> changes that may be necessary can be made.</P>

      <P>We referred in the course of the discussion on this section to subsection (5) dealing with partnerships.  We asked certain questions and the Minister gave certain answers.  However, I believe that the matter involved is a good deal more complicated than was indicated either by the questions or the answers. Rather than go into a great deal of technical detail on the matter I should like to refer the Minister to an article in a magazine called <i>Taxation</i>, dated 25th January, 1975. It was a leading article on capital gains tax and partnerships and it dealt in considerable detail with this situation as it has arisen, and as it has apparently been resolved under the British legislation which in this regard is very similar to what is before the House at the moment.  I would ask the Minister to have that article examined and on the next Stage if there are aspects arising which were not dealt with in previous discussions perhaps he would clarify the position for us.  I imagine that the article in question will be available to the Minister but, if it is not, I can furnish him with a copy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  The Minister will appreciate that the aspects of this matter dealt with there are a great deal more complex than those we discussed in the House on the previous discussion on this section. I should like to ask the Minister a little more about the position.  In regard to the proviso at the end of section 4, subsection (2), a proviso which has been amended in one of the Minister's amendments, I understood him to say that the position is <Col N="410" /> that, on foot of the double taxation agreements between ourselves and Britain, automatically on the passing into law of this legislation, there will be double taxation relief in operation between this country and Britain.</P>
      <P>The amendment which the Minister moved, and which was passed in regard to this proviso, imports the agreements contained in Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  There are a number of agreements contained in that schedule and I wonder would the Minister explain, since there are a number of agreements none of which I think deals with capital gains, on what basis does it happen that there will be automatically granted double taxation relief in respect of capital gains on the passing of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will see that what we provide in section 4 (2), as amended, is that the subsection is not to apply to any person who by reason of provision of Schedule 6 of the 1967 Act is exempt from income tax charges.  It is the person who, by reason of Schedule 6, is exempt from income tax who, by virtue of this, enjoys similar exemption in respect of capital gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the point I am raising.  I think it is true to say that the British capital gains legislation of itself does not contain a provision similar to this.  What I am trying to find out is: what is the basis for saying that automatically Britain will apply double taxation relief in respect of capital gains if I am right in saying that this is not a statutory provision for it and there is no provision for it in the double taxation agreements referred to in Schedule 6 of the 1967 Income Tax Act?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope these terms are sufficiently easily understood.  Subsection (4) provides that gains usually enjoyed in any manner or brought into the State in any way are to be deemed to have been received in the State.  The provisions of section 4 of the Finance Act, 1971, under which income used outside the State in payment of debts is, in certain circumstances, treated as received in the State are to apply to a similar use of capital gains made outside the State. Thus an individual who is not domiciled in the State, but is resident or ordinarily resident here, will be chargeable on any capital gains made abroad and so used in the same way as if he had remitted the gains to this country.</P>

I instanced the case, say, of an American who is resident in Britain but domiciled in America; he is resident both in Ireland and in Britain but domiciled in America.  If he disposes of an asset which he owns, say, in Britain, what is that person's position in regard to liability for capital gains in so far as this Bill is concerned?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a well-established principle of taxation and accepted internationally that where tax arrangements are changed the relief should operate from the date of change.  I cannot say whether any difficulties have arisen, for instance, in respect of double taxation agreements affecting income tax where income tax changes have taken place. But the Deputy knows that hardly a year passes in which we do not have one or more double taxation agreements tabled here in the House as a consequence of new situations arising between this and other countries.  This is an ongoing exercise and it is not possible at any particular stage or at any particular time to say that no difficulty will arise between one country and another, but it has been possible to overcome them all in the process of negotiation.</P>

      <P>Could I ask further if in the event of a situation arising such as I have described&mdash;and there is no doubt it will arise&mdash;in the interval <Col N="417" /> pending the completion of the necessary double taxation agreement, say, with the United States, what will be the attitude of our Revenue Commissioners to such a person's liability? Will they collect the tax and then refund when the agreement is operative? Or, in the light of these circumstances, would they tend to leave the tax outstanding pending the conclusion of the agreement?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal practice, I understand, is to leave the tax outstanding if it is accepted that it would be objectionable, in principle, to collect it.  In this case we are dealing with capital gains which would not accrue until the passage of time. There is less urgency about the matter than there might be in respect of recurrent income.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I wish to follow up something that was mentioned last night in respect of capital gains of companies with investments in this country.  The invitation given by the IDA was mentioned last night and the new undertakings given such as tax-free allowances, <Col N="418" /> free movement of capital within the country and every facility to repatriate their money.  Has the Minister carried out any investigation as to what damage this Bill will do as regards new investments in the country?  Deputy Colley mentioned last night that undertakings were given regarding free movement of, and investment of profits within the country.  These are binding undertakings.  I am not talking about future development and what has happened from last April onwards but I am concerned about guarantees given by successive Governments down through the years as regards the tax benefits which were granted by the IDA and which contribute to a very large extent to bringing investments in.</P>
      <P>Some of these companies will probably think that we are backing down on our commitments to them, and this may create a very damaging image abroad, especially in regard to our standards with regard to investments in this country.  I do not wish to exempt anybody from last April onwards.  We cannot do that to any great extent, but people who made commitments under certain undertakings as regards these taxes&mdash;probably industrialists coming into the country, four, five or ten years ago&mdash;never anticipated that a capital gains tax would apply to them.  I hope that this will not have a damaging effect by undermining confidence.  It is of vital importance that when we make a commitment, irrespective of what Government make it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that the Minister is satisfied that some of the companies that have come here during the past years will not take a poor view of this.</P>

      <P>I am very happy to assure the Deputy, the House and the country that there will be no loss whatsoever of the kind contemplated by the Deputy.  It is now a year ago, this month, since the Government published their outline proposals for the reform of the capital taxation system to replace estate duties.  During that year there has not been as much as a whisper or a murmur of complaint from the IDA or from any investor who came into the country as a consequence of the package of tax and grant incentives.  I am sure that if these people felt that they had in any way been unfairly dealt with, or dishonourably dealt with, they would have complained before this.  There has not been one murmur or whisper. I was interested in Deputy Colley only going as far as page 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the Deputy did not go to page 10 which I shall come to.  On page 3 Deputy Colley quoted the financial incentives. He said that the IDA told foreign investors they would have total freedom from tax on profits generated by exports to 1990, and complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits.  He did not draw attention to page 10, where it is pointed out that in Ireland there are &mdash;and have been at all times since the IDA were set up&mdash;taxes on capital. It took the form of estate duty which ran at rates up to 55 per cent. The abatements which are available on estates of less than £100,000 net value do not apply when estates are above that value.</P>
      <P>When I mentioned death duties yesterday, Deputy Colley and some others opposite tried to assert that death duties were irrelevant in this situation. Of course they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we said that if they are brought in they should be compared with the whole package replacing them, not with one section of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas the exemption from tax on profits is related to <Col N="420" /> profits made on exports, the individual holding shares in a company enjoying these tax incentives would be liable to estate duties here.  The IDA booklet not only draws attention to the rates of estate duty which are exceptionally savage by international standards, but also says under the heading: &ldquo;Proposals for a new Scheme of Capital Taxation&rdquo;, that the Government are considering a new scheme of capital taxation which would replace estate duty.  Therefore, they have been put specifically on notice by the IDA not only of the existing law, which we are now proposing to abolish as from April next, because we regard it as a disincentive to investment and as unfair and likely to break up companies and sensitive business arrangements but that we are also bringing in a new scheme of capital taxation. That new scheme, or the bones of it, have been available to any person contemplating investing in this country for over a year now.  During all that time there has not been one murmur of complaint or one suggestion from anybody until the suggestions made from the Fianna Fáil benches that the Government proposals would be in conflict with undertakings given to foreign investors in this country.</P>
      <P>As I have emphasised again and again, the new capital taxation arrangements are comparable to what exist in most other countries comparable to ours.  Overall, they will be much more easily managed by people as they will not have the upsetting effect which the existing law on capital taxation has on them.  I am sure this is the reason why there has not been one murmur of complaint from people who are knowledgeable about the tax arrangements internationally. They see that Ireland is moving in the same direction as all sensible countries.</P>

I have said that the IDA has made no complaint, no murmur of that sort, and there is nothing on record in the Department of Finance. I am quite certain that if these complaints had been voiced they would long since have been brought to our notice.

      <P>First of all, may I point out that the Minister is, of course, glossing over the actual situation in regard to what happened in mining. Deputy O'Malley last night told the Minister that the announcement was made on a Friday and on the Sunday the Minister for the Gaeltacht, on behalf of the Government, was assuring people that nothing was going to be done in regard to industrial incentives other than mining.  The Minister for Finance can hardly suggest seriously that in the interval, between the Friday and the Sunday, the effect of Fianna Fáil pronouncements&mdash;I do not recall at the moment that there were any, but assuming that there were some&mdash;was such that it was necessary immediately to go in with the kind of statement made by the Minister for the Gaeltacht. The Minister is, in fact, glossing over what really happened, which was that there was a very adverse reaction from abroad.  I am glad that I asked the Minister the question I did ask, because my recollection of what he said a few moments ago is that in the past 12 months, since the Government published its White Paper on Capital Taxation, there has not been a murmur from industrialists or potential industrialists to the Government or to the IDA.  When I asked him whether he was putting it on the record that the IDA had no complaint whatever and received no complaint whatever he said he had not heard about them.</P>
      <P>I would like to make quite clear what the Minister is saying and putting on the record of this House.  As I understand it now, he is saying there is no complaint on record in the Department of Finance.  If the Minister has not consulted with the IDA and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to this provision it is an absolute disgrace, and bears out the suspicion that we have had that the Minister is ploughing on with legislation without finding out what are the likely consequences of it.</P>

      <P>Either the Minister consulted the IDA or he did not.  If he did not consult them it is an absolute disgrace that he should bring in this provision without doing so, having regard to the importance of their activities to the employment situation in this country.  If he did consult them he should be able to put on the record of this House that he did and that they had no objection and received no objection.  He purported to put that on the record of this House, but when questioned he backtracked.  I am now giving him the opportunity again.  Would he say whether he consulted the IDA and did the IDA receive any complaints or &ldquo;murmurs&rdquo;, to use his own word, from anybody in regard to this proposal?</P>

      <P>And if I say that I consulted the IDA Deputy Colley and his henchmen will go to the length and breadth of this country and say that the Minister knew that it would cause unrest and he therefore went to the IDA.  I am not going to get into that game again.  There is no justification for this complaint.</P>

      <P>I want to tell the Minister that we spent many years building up this country.  I, personally, was involved in the activities of the <Col N="424" /> IDA as Minister for Industry and Commerce and it was work of which I was extremely proud.  I am very apprehensive at the effects of the Minister's nonchalant unconcern about the effects of what he is doing on the development of this country.</P>

      <P>It now appears that the Minister did not consult the IDA, which was what we suspected.  If he did consult them, let him say for the record what he was told.  It is an extremely important matter, and the Minister should not be so flippant about the future of this country and particularly of the 100,000 unemployed people.  It is not good enough to have the Minister adopt this supercilious attitude in regard to proposals which are extremely serious in their potential consequences.  Could I ask the Minister to treat this matter a little more seriously?  It deserves serious treatment, which it is getting from this side of the House but not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
