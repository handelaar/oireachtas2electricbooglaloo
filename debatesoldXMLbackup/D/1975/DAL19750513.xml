      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) to the effect that the director of the Government Information Services was flown by aeroplane from Farranfore Airport, County Kerry, to Dublin; if this report is correct; and, if so, the cost of the plane, fuel, and so on, and the reason for incurring such expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Urgent Government business made it necessary to arrange for the return of the head of the Government Information Services from Killarney to Dublin as early as possible on the afternoon of Friday, the 25th April, 1975.  The only practicable mode of travel was by air and, on my instructions, this was arranged.  The approximate cost was £40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say what was the urgent Government business which would justify such a dramatic method of getting back to Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may recall that was during the oil stoppage. In common with a number of other civil servants the head of the Government Information Services was attending the IMI conference in Killarney and it was essential to bring him back arising out of the oil stoppage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. The data requested by the Deputy are not available.  The only source of current information on unemployed persons are the administrative records of the Department of Social Welfare relating to persons who register at local offices, from which the live register figures are compiled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not consider it advisable and desirable that such information should be available and would he so advise the Department responsible for those statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way I can help the Deputy is by telling him that data of professional and technical persons who classify themselves as out of work are available from the five yearly censuses of population but they are not comparable with the monthly live register totals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that the Government are unaware of the total number of people unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It means exactly what I have said.  The Central Statistics Office does not compile this <Col N="1602" /> figure.  The only data we have got on unemployment are the ones with which the Deputy is familiar.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  The question of the unemployment or the under-employment of a professional man is not as easily assessed as the question of the self-employed or the unemployed on the live register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is unable to furnish the House with the total number of persons unemployed.  The Government are unaware of the number because there are no statistics in regard to the two classes mentioned in the questions.  In addition there are the school leavers and the people who are redundant and the people taking the AnCO training scheme.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary give some indication of the colossal number of people who are not included in the live register but who are unemployed?  Have the Government got these figures?  Can they give a true reflection to the House of the total number of people unemployed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of service for the gentleman in question involves the erection of half a mile of a new pole route.  Attention to the application was not possible because of the heavy volume of urgent engineering work on hands in the general area of which the Deputy is aware.  The number of deferred abnormal line work orders in County Galway is approximately 600.  Arrears are being overtaken as fast as possible and it is the intention, as far as practicable, to resume clearance of abnormal line work orders in the latter part of this year.  It is expected that this case, which is not greatly in excess of the normal limits, will be dealt with by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Call offices in three sub-post offices in County Laois, viz: Ballaghmore, Kilbricken and Oldtown, have not been replaced by kiosks.  The use made of the call office telephones is not sufficient to justify provision of kiosks at any of these places in 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no data as to such a sizeable increase but I will make an inquiry as to whether, in fact&mdash;I have also heard this claim made&mdash;if a kiosk is provided because of the privacy the use goes up.  I will have some figures for that and I will provide them to the Deputy if he puts down a general question on that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider the use of a telephone kiosk outside a post office would be greater than those in post offices in view of the fact that the post office is not open for public use for 24 hours of the day while a kiosk would be? Does he agree that the public are denied access to the telephone kiosk when it is in the post office?</P>

Agreements have been signed with local authorities for the provision of kiosks under guarantee at a further 24 locations.  The local authorities concerned include Carlow, Donegal, Laois, Tipperary (South Riding), Westmeath and Wicklow County Councils.  Deputies will realise that the kiosks have been provided throughout the country.  The guarantee system has expanded significantly since January, 1974.  Eleven guaranteed kiosks have been provided since then as compared with ten in the period 1953 to the end of 1973.</P>

      <P>This is a reason which is and has been, unfortunately, rather normal.  Provision of service for the gentleman concerned involves the erection of one-and-three-quarter miles of line work, including one mile of new aerial cable and a quarter mile of new pole route. This is abnormal line work, which is defined as line work exceeding a quarter mile of new pole route and <Col N="1616" /> wire, or its equivalent, from the nearest common pole or cable route to provide service for one applicant. Under present circumstances, which have been prevailing also for some considerable time, other cases which may be dealt with, with less expensive works, take priority.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this applicant employs quite a big number of persons?  I understood that his Department was giving priority where the applicant was a substantial employer.  The firm in question provides very essential industrial service and gives good employment.  It would be a pity if they had to wait that long for installation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy, among other Deputies, did make representations to my Department in March and April of this year on behalf of this applicant.  He was informed on the 28th April last that the usefulness of a telephone for the firm was fully recognised but that, in view of the extensive construction work which its provision would involve, and the heavy volume of urgent engineering work to which the Department was <Col N="1617" /> committed, it was not possible at that stage to give a reliable forecast as to when that order could be attended to.  In the representations the Deputy referred to the large number of men employed and stated that it was essential to the viability of the industry that the gentleman named be in constant contact with customers and employees.</P>
      <P>He mentioned also other specific factors which could identify the firm, which I shall not mention here.  The firm has telephone service at their office in Athenry and in their depot at Clarenbridge, Galway.  There is also a telephone in the residence at Kiltulla of one of the directors.  The three telephone numbers are shown together in the telephone directory under the entry for the firm in question, the residence especially indicated in the directory, presumably for incoming calls for the firm when the office and/or depot is closed.  Service up to 10 p.m. is available at Kiltulla.  In these circumstances, the Department did not consider that extreme hardship would arise by reason of the delay in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I think I can.  I am glad the Deputy asked the question.  The only way of tackling this backlog, as long as the demand continues to rise, is, of course, by stepping up the number of connections.  The number of connections made in 1971 to 1972 was 45,000; the number made in 1973 to 1974 was 61,000, which is an increase of 35 per cent.  In addition to the increase in connections, there has been a slight diminution in the rising rate of demand with the result that, for the first time, in the first quarter of this year, installations slightly exceed new applications.</P>

      <P>There is a matter of substance in Deputy Molloy's query which is somewhat overlaid by other matters.  It is alleged this person has been treated in an inconsiderate way by my Department.  That would be a very serious matter and this letter is being evoked to show that.  The point is, of course, that there are certain criteria in regard to health applied in in the case of applicants for appointment to full-time established posts in the civil service and they are more stringent than those which are applied in the case of applicants for short term <Col N="1625" /> employment.  Deputy Molloy, who was himself in charge of a Government Department, knows that very well and he should have been aware of that when he became so angry about this matter.  The postmaster's letter was an attempt to help the gentleman in question by pointing out to him that, even if he failed a health test in the civil service competition, he might get unestablished employment where the health test is less severe.  I cannot see that that shows any lack of consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he is aware this man has stated that on more than one occasion since he has been examined by doctors and they could not find anything wrong with him and this man claims he has been wrongfully dismissed?  Independent doctors have given the opinion that he has a clean bill of health and I make a special appeal to the Minister on humanitarian grounds as a so-called socialist with some interest in the worker to take a particular interest in this case and examine the file and satisfy himself that the man did get fair play because he is carrying a heavy grudge over the manner in which he was treated by the Minister's Department.  He used to deliver the letters to my door for quite a period and he was wrongfully knocked off by the Minister's Department over 12 months ago and I have sympathy with him.  He is a small man who cannot stand up himself and fight the Establishment and I will do it for him.</P>

      <P>There are 498 night and Sunday telephone attendants employed in my Department.  Their pay rates and general conditions are determined under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service and if members of the grade are dissatisfied about pay rates&mdash;or about other conditions of employment&mdash;it is open to them to have claims pursued by their union through the scheme or, where appropriate, directly with the Department.</P>

Will he have this matter examined or, if he has examined it, is he satisfied that the arguments are well founded?  I am completely satisfied that these employees are discriminated against and this has been going on for years; it is not just in the Minister's time.

      <P>I am satisfied that very great leniency and forebearance had been extended to him over a period of some 11 years and the decision to retire him was taken only after it had become clear that there was no prospect of his being capable of giving regular and efficient service to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the medical aspects are concerned, he was examined, following <Col N="1630" /> a history of absences, by the chief medical officer in October, 1971. Since then the absences continued in spite of promises of amendment.  Before retirement took place, the case was referred, on appeal, to the medical referee appointed under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, who confirmed the view that the incapacity was likely to be permanent.</P>

      <P>RTE Relays have advised their subscribers, as I think other cable companies have too, that cessation of relay of 405-line programmes will enable them to provide improved 625-line pictures, which is, of course, what interests most viewers.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to take it that as far as the Minister is concerned, because he believes this step will improve reception of the 625-line broadcasts, that it does not really matter that those who are on 405-line broadcasts will cease to receive them long before it is necessary for them to cease receiving them?</P>

      <P>It is a question of the greatest good and the greatest number.  The numbers are rather convincing.  It is estimated that there are only about 15,000 405-line sets still in use in the Dublin area as compared with a total of about 193,000 sets.  All of the 405-line sets must now be 12 years old since it is understood that manufacture of 405-line only sets ceased here about 1963.  Of course, it is quite evident that 405-line has to be phased out.  That is now happening to the considerable advantage of most viewers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will make a statement on the dispute which has arisen with civil servants in his Department resulting in the picketing of his Department's offices and the danger that occupational injuries benefits and disability allowances may not be paid in consequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1645" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been served with notice by the Civil and Public Services Staff Association that as from Thursday, 15th May, 1975 its members consider themselves to be in dispute with him concerning the accommodation provided at the Department's headquarters offices in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada, Store Street, Dublin.  The Minister has been informed that restricted pickets will be placed on Áras Mhic Dhiarmada and on two adjacent public offices in Store Street on the morning of 15th May and on each successive Thursday morning until the executive committee of the association reviews the position or until its complaints are resolved.  The notice states that the pickets will preclude members of the association from attending for duty before 2 p.m. on the days in question. The staff in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada represented by the association comprise mainly officers in the general service grades of clerical assistant, clerical officer and staff officer.</P>
      <P>If the action threatened by the Civil and Public Services Staff Association is proceeded with the inevitable effect will be that the issue of benefit cheques to certain people who are claiming disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit will be delayed.  Persons who would normally expect to receive their benefit cheques on the morning of Friday, 16th May may not receive them until Friday afternoon in the Dublin area or until Saturday morning in areas where there are postal deliveries on that day.  In some few cases it is possible that cheques may not be delivered until the following Monday.</P>
      <P>Callers to the Department's public office in Store Street on Thursday morning may also be inconvenienced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is greatly concerned by the effect which this action of the association will have on persons entitled to benefit payments and to persons wishing to contact the Department's offices in Store Street.  He wishes to assure all social welfare beneficiaries concerned that every possible <Col N="1646" /> effort will be made to minimise the effect of the association's action.</P>
    <P>Steps were taken by the Department as long ago as 1971 to improve the accommodation position when some sections of the Department were transferred from Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to new accommodation at Phibsboro' Tower and since 1973 a total of over 500 officials were transferred from Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to new accommodation at D'Olier House, D'Olier Street, and Oisin House, Pearse Street.</P>
    <P>In April, 1974, a deputation from the executive committee of the Civil and Public Services Staff Association was informed by the Minister of the impending transfer of staff to Oisin House as soon as the accommodation there was ready for occupation and he also indicated further measures which were then in train designed to improve working conditions in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  These improvements included brightening of the interior of the offices, the application of solar heat reflecting film to the window panes and of reflecting paint on part of the roof.  It was on that occasion that the general secretary of the association stated that in his opinion the building was not and never would be suitable as offices and demanded that it should be vacated.  The improvements then indicated by the Minister have since been carried out or are in actual course of completion. Moreover, following the transfer of a staff of 130 officials to Oisin House in September, 1974, the staff remaining in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada were re-located to better advantage and this process is continuing as certain necessary items of equipment and furniture become available.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the general secretary of the association is fully aware, still further office accommodation has been sought by the Department, which should be ready for occupation in a few months' time.  The total staff of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada will then be in the neighbourhood of 800 only as compared with the present total of 940&mdash;it was 1,040 in 1973&mdash;and working conditions then should, by any standards, be entirely satisfactory. There can, of course, be no question <Col N="1647" /> of entirely vacating the building as demanded by the association.</P>
    <P>Since the meeting with the Minister on 30th April, 1974, the association has not sought any further discussion with the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary state whether this is the first strike in the history of the Civil Service and of the nation? The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that the association and the Minister had talks on 30th April, 1974, and that the association has not contacted the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister.  Did the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary make any effort to contact the association?  What negotiations, if any, took place to prevent this strike which will have very severe effects on people who will not receive their entitlements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether or not there have been previous disputes involving civil servants.  As regards the meeting on 30th April, 1974, this meeting was at the request of the association.  On receiving that request, the Minister convened a meeting in a very short time. A full discussion took place at that meeting and it was explained that the Minister was concerned about accommodation and working conditions of the staff in the Department of Social Welfare and indicated that we were in the course of completing negotiations for Oisin House as additional accommodation.  Oisin House has now been occupied by the Department of Social Welfare and this has relieved any overcrowding that might have occurred in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  The demand of the general secretary of the association is for the vacating of Áras Mhic Dhiarmada.  As I indicated in my reply, it is not possible to comply with this demand.  The Minister indicated at the meeting in April, 1974, that he was and would be available to meet the staff association on any occasion that they requested such a meeting. Quite frankly, I was somewhat surprised personally that the only communication the Minister or myself <Col N="1648" /> received from the association or its general secretary since that meeting was a communication which indicated a week's strike notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will appreciate that this is a very serious matter and that since 30th April, 1974, some negotiations between the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister and the association should have taken place?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the persons most affected by this strike are new or short term cases whose finances are disrupted because of sudden illness or injury and what provision, if any, is he making for those individuals who are short of cash and just cannot continue?  Will the Parliamentary Secretary say what provision he intends to make for those people apart from the other 7,500 to 10,000 people who are also affected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister indicated in reply to the Deputy's special notice question, every possible effort will be made to minimise the effects on recipients of social welfare as a result of the action proposed to be taken by the association.  The Minister is extremely concerned lest any hardship should be caused but everything possible is being done so as to ensure the absolute minimum delay in the issuing of cheques.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that if a stoppage occurs it will be impossible to ensure that there will not be delays in some cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps are being taken to minimise hardship? Even at this late stage would the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister contact the association concerned in order to try to avoid this very serious strike and its consequences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that those who would be affected by a stoppage of the workers concerned would be those least able to endure delays in receipt of benefits.  The Deputy knows, also, that I have some experience of industrial relations.  I understand that the demand of the general secretary of the association concerned is that Áras Mhic Dhiarmada <Col N="1649" /> be vacated but it is not possible to meet such a demand.  To indicate a willingness to take action might appear to the organisation concerned as meaning that the demand was being met.  As was pointed out in the original reply, all the improvements sought at the meeting held in April, 1974 have either been met or are in the course of being met.  The general secretary of the association is aware that apart from D'Olier House and Oisín House, both of which are now occupied, we are in the course of negotiating for additional office premises.</P>
      <P>It would not further the interest of anyone concerned inadvertently to mislead the association into believing that an impossible demand could be met but it is only fair to point out that, when speaking to the association in April, 1974, the Minister indicated that he is available at any time to discuss any matter which the association may wish to have aired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is being put with a view to helping the people concerned.  Assuming that the strike will be prolonged and in order to ensure that social welfare recipients can obtain some benefits, would the Parliamentary Secretary, in consultation with the Minister for Health, consider the possibility of benefits being payable through the Eastern Health Board in order to ensure that people in dire need will not suffer undue hardship as was the case on <Col N="1650" /> the occasion of a dispute affecting the bus services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies should be conscious of the potential seriousness of this situation.  As has been indicated clearly the strike notice concerns a series of half-day strikes on one day each week.  These stoppages will cause some delay to certain categories of beneficiaries but I do not think any arrangements advocated or made not to counteract potential difficulties would be helpful in the circumstances.</P>
      <P>One can only hope that the stoppages will not take place but, irrespective of what developments may occur, Deputies can rest assured that every effort will be made to minimise the effects for those people in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>

      <P>In connection with my ruling last Thursday on the claim to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order No. 30, Deputy Callanan stated that attempts by a number of Members&mdash; he mentioned Deputy Connolly&mdash;on the previous day to raise the proposed increased CIE fares on the Estimate for Transport and Power had been ruled out of order by the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although I was not aware of any such ruling I proposed to look into the matter.  Having done so, I can find no ruling to this effect.  Deputy Callanan may have had in mind the ruling, as at column 1341 of the Official Report, by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle during a speech by Deputy Connolly.  At that point Deputy Connolly was referring in some detail to the price control procedures operated by the National Prices Commission and the profits, which he <Col N="1651" /> stated, resulted from these procedures. Prices as such are not a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle ruled accordingly.</P>
    <P>I should add that each member of the Opposition who spoke on Wednesday referred, and in my view, relevantly, to the CIE fares increases. The references are, Deputy John O'Leary at columns 1287 to 1289, Deputy Connolly at columns 1336 to 1340 and 1344 and Deputy Hussey at column 1351 of the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from that statement, I made it clear at the time that I was not sure who had been in the Chair when the ruling in question was made.  When Deputy Connolly referred to the increased CIE fares and to the increased ESB charges, the occupant of the Chair said that prices are not a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power.  When Deputy O'Malley wished to discuss the increased charges I said that somebody in the Chair had ruled that matter out of order.  As appears in the Official Report, it was the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who ruled Deputy Connolly out of order.  I wish to protect my integrity.  Deputy Kelly said that the ruling referred to did not appear in the Official Report.  I was not prompted by anybody in what I said.  I merely referred to the ruling I had heard.  I assumed that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was correct in that ruling.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a number of points on section 12 which have been dealt with by the Minister.  There are a couple of points on subsection (7) to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Perhaps I might start by referring the Minister to line 34 on page 13 which reads: &ldquo;...may be given in respect of it under the Income Tax Acts.&rdquo; The whole of the sentence is &ldquo;... and it shall not be given under this Act if and so far as relief has been or may be given in respect of it under the Income Tax Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I preseume that what is intended to be conveyed here is that if certain circumstances qualify for relief under the Income Tax Acts relief cannot be claimed under this Bill irrespective of whether it has been sought or given and, therefore, any situation which under the Income Tax Acts would qualify for relief is automatically excluded from relief under this section.  I take it that is what is intended to be conveyed by that.  I wonder has the Minister considered whether this is a fully reasonable provision.  Of course, I can see the reason behind it, but is it not possible that somebody could find himself in a position where he would be entitled to claim relief under the Income Tax Acts but, for one reason or another, he would not claim it, possibly because he was not aware of it, and would thereby be precluded from the relief both under the Income Tax Acts and under this Bill?</P>
      <P>I wonder whether it is absolutely necessary to provide that such relief is excluded under this Bill and whether it is not practicable to provide that relief will not be given under both Acts and thereby ensure that the relief in question is given, that at least it is available, and that it is not excluded entirely under this Bill whether or not it has been given under the Income Tax Acts.  There may be good reason why this cannot be done, but I would ask the Minister to consider whether it would not be possible to provide that the relief would be given under one or other Act but not under both.</P>

      <P>It would be unacceptable that income should be charged to capital gains tax.  Nobody is so proposing.  In the same way, it is similarly unacceptable that losses that would arise out of the possession or disposal of capital should then be available for reducing liability for income tax.  We are dealing here only with losses or gains arising on the disposal of a capital asset and not with earned income or dividends or any income of that nature.  It would be a grave error indeed to proceed to legislate here that losses arising on the disposal of a capital asset should be available against income.  If a person is engaged in the business of acquisition and holding and disposal of various capital assets of one form or another, that person's trade would fall to be assessed for income tax purposes and, in such cases, the losses would be available for setting off against any possible income which there might be. To duplicate the availability of the allowances to my mind would be wrong in principle and unfair in application.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if the Minister and I are talking about the same point.  Clearly what is involved in this subsection is a situation in which, but for the provisions of this subsection, relief would arise under the Income Tax Acts, so the distinction which the Minister is making between capital on the one hand and income on the other does not arise in this context.  If there were a clear distinction of that kind, there would not be any need for the provisions in subsection (7).  What is provided for in subsection (7) is that where relief is available under the Income Tax Acts, whether it is received or not, it is not to be given in respect of losses under the capital gains tax provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, I can see reasons for this.  When I was suggesting consideration for the provision that relief might be given under one or the other but not under both codes.  I was referring, as the section does, to circumstances in which relief could arise under the Income Tax Acts and, but <Col N="1654" /> for this subsection, could arise in respect of capital gains.  In the context of what the subsection deals with the distinction which the Minister is drawing between capital and income does not seem to arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subparagraph (1) of section 2 of the First Schedule provides for the exclusion of considerations taken into account for income tax, and subparagraph (1) of section 4 excludes from sums allowable any amounts allowed for income tax.  The effect of these exclusions would be that any gain on an asset chargeable to income tax and any loss on an asset allowable for income tax would not normally come in for capital gains tax.  In certain situations, and with regard to assets which might in some circumstances be capital, for instance, land, it might be of benefit to the taxpayer to endeavour to take the asset outside the income tax range and have it regarded as capital in order to get relief for a loss.  The type of situation where this might occur would be where there was no income and there would be no likelihood of there being future income to set off the income tax loss against it. Obviously it would be to the advantage of the taxpayer to swing the loss over from an income tax loss to a capital gains tax loss.  It is necessary to prevent this happening.  Therefore, it is provided that as far as relief has been or may be given in respect of the loss under the Income Tax Acts, it shall not be given against a capital gain.  The use of the phrase in subsection (7) puts that beyond any doubt.  It ensures that the taxpayer will not have any device with which to do so.</P>

      <P>Is it not clear under this arrangement that a person may be taxed on gains and, within a short time afterwards, may suffer serious capital losses?  For instance, on a forced disposal of an asset.  Is there <Col N="1655" /> not a case for saying that there should be provision to carry back losses for at least two years preceding the assessment?  Effectively, capital gains tax is, by its nature, a long-term tax rather than an annual tax although it is treated here in a year of assessment.  I suggest to the Minister that there could be cases of considerable hardship where a person has become liable to a tax on a gain and has paid it but soon after suffers serious capital losses.  As I understand the subsection in those circumstances such a person may not get any benefit in respect of those losses unless, at some time in the future, he manages to bring about a capital gain which may never happen.  Difficult circumstances can arise and I wonder whether it is essential, from the Minister's point of view, to restrict the carrying back of losses entirely as is done in this subsection?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that we are applying the same principles as apply to income tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may not but there are many cases where people may be in a continuing loss making situation.  There is also the danger that if we were to open it in the way suggested by the Deputy losses could be fabricated in order to recover tax already paid on a gain.  I do not think that should be facilitated by the Legislature.  There is probably no tax law which will operate in all cases in total easement of the taxpayer.  If such laws existed there would be little point in creating liability for tax if reliefs were always available, if future losses were always available against taxes which had already been paid.  I do not accept that we should now introduce <Col N="1656" /> into capital gains a relief which is not available under the income tax code and which I have never heard people argue in favour of introducing under the income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between the income tax code and the capital gains tax code.  In the normal way people have some kind of income each year whereas they may not have a capital gain each year.  Capital gains tax is, by its nature, somewhat long-term.  The Minister has referred to the possible fabrication of losses but if people can fabricate losses they are not going to suffer under this subsection because they will fabricate a loss in respect of the year of assessment in which they have become liable to the gains.  It is the man who cannot, or will not, fabricate the loss who will suffer.  I urge the Minister to have another look at this.  I realise there are some difficulties but I do not think the problem is insuperable.</P>
      <P>I have indicated the circumstances in which considerable hardship could ensue.  I do not believe it is impossible to devise a method of rewording subsection (7) in order to ensure that some relief can be given in cases of the kind I have indicated.  I assume that the Minister's general attitude is that he would not object to a relieving provision of this kind provided it would not be abused?</P>

Surely the Minister will appreciate that unless we get this right now it will take a long time to get it right in future.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the whole concept is an outdated one.  In effect, what the Minister is saying is that the husband and wife living together&mdash;I stress that because there is a provision later for a change in the situation where they are not living together&mdash;are one person and that is why a disposal between them does not count for the purpose of capital gains, and similarly they are treated as one for the purpose of exemption.  I wonder how much reality this has in relation to life as we know it?  I submit that the exemption of £500 is in the Bill mainly for the purpose of administrative convenience, so that the Revenue Commissioners do not have to trace every possible small transaction.  That exemption is applied to each individual unless they happen to be married and living together, in which case the Minister will only give the equivalent of what is given to a single person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision for a disposition between a husband and wife not counting for the purpose of capital gains is not as great an advantage as the Minister seems to think.  In effect, all it is doing is postponing liability for capital gains which will become payable eventually <Col N="1659" /> by the surviving spouse.  The Minister must find it difficult to justify restricting the allowance in the case of a married couple to the same figure as that applying to a single person.  He will make a grave mistake if he carries this provision into this Bill and it will be difficulty to change it in the future.  I do not think the Minister would have any difficulty in accepting the proposition at this stage that the husband and wife should be entitled to an exemption of £500 each or a joint exemption of £1,000.</P>
    <P>Later in this section we provide for the situation where the husband or the wife may apply to be treated separately and there are complicated provisions in that regard.  In those circumstances, it is not clear to me if they are to be restricted as before to a joint £500 divided proportionately or whether they will get an exemption of £500 each.  Either way, the Minister should have no great difficulty at this point in conceding the same exemption to a husband and wife as that given to two single people and I would urge him to do it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could only entertain that if a disposal between a husband and wife were to be taken into account in calculating the £500 exemption.  If they want absolute equality of treatment with that allowed to single people, it would have to be carried right across the board.  We could not have a situation where they would be more favourably treated, which is what Deputy Colley is suggesting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as they would be more favourably treated&mdash;and I contest that&mdash;there may be a case for it.  Does the Minister accept that the exclusion of disposals between spouses is only a postponement of liability for capital gains, that it is not an exemption?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that if a husband disposes of property to his wife and if she disposes of that property <Col N="1660" /> after his death the gain is assessed on the difference between the price at which she sells and the price at which her husband bought the property originally, not the value at the time of disposal?  The alleged benefit is only an alleged benefit; it is only a postponement of liability, not an exemption.  I doubt if one could say the benefit of such postponement is of such value that it is necessary to restrict the exemption given to a husband and wife to the same amount as that given to one individual.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not treating the husband and wife as one individual because if he was a disposal between a husband and wife would be treated as though they were one individual and the question of liability on a gain would not arise in the way I have indicated where a wife disposes of property after the death of her husband.  Under this Bill she would be liable for tax, calculated on a gain made up of the gain arising from the date on which the husband originally acquired the property.  This is not the same treatment that should be given where the husband and wife are regarded as one person.  Consequently, the Minister should not restrict the exemption in the way proposed in this section.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> We are putting forward a case here which indeed the Minister has put as regards thresholds allowed between husband and wife.  The Minister must agree that this is only a postponement or deferment if the property is sold.  If the husband passes it to the wife and the wife disposes of it ten years later, the property goes back to be valued from 1974, the value of the property at 1974, and capital gains will accrue therefrom. But if she sells to a stranger, then there is no concession allowed here at all.  She becomes liable to the full impact of the capital gains.  Therefore, in effect, what Deputy Colley is saying is correct&mdash;that it is only a postponement.  That is the reality of the situation.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the treatment is entirely as if they were one.  I agree that, to some extent, it is so but I do not think it goes the whole way.  In this case I wonder if the Minister is not perhaps adopting a doctrinaire approach on the basis that it seems to him the logical consequence of apparently treating them as one is that one restricts the allowance as though they were one person. I wonder whether this is not a doctrinaire approach that is a bit removed from the realities of the situation.</P>

This exemption of £500, on the basis of our studies at present, is the most generous exemption given anywhere; it could be made £250 for a single person, then it would be double for a married couple if it was left at £500.</P>

The separate existence of the wife as a separate person seems to be ignored.  The whole section is geared to the proposition that, as far as possible, one treats the married couple as one, and that one is the husband not the wife&mdash;that is the message that comes through all the way in section 13.  That approach is completely out of date.  The Minister ought to reconsider the whole concept involved here. For instance, on what basis does the Minister justify saying that the assessment and the whole application of the capital gains tax code is to be directed at the husband as though he and the wife were one and she did not count, unless there is special notice given to the Revenue Commissioners?</P>

If we were to treat them as separate persons, liability would arise and it is not improbable that there would then be a disclination to transfer from husbands to wives.  We are avoiding that by ensuring that, if one spouse is generously moved to make a present to the other, liability to capital gains tax will not arise.  We are also conferring freedom on the wife to have herself separately assessed if she so wishes, a choice which may not be available to the other sex, and the husband cannot invalidate that choice if she exercises it.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) provides that where one spouse transfers an asset to another the asset will be deemed to have passed from the one to the other at the value at which the first spouse acquired it.  This is what we were talking about earlier.  Accordingly, at the time of transfer there is no question of any gain or loss.  In the proviso an exemption of the above treatment is made where the property transferred is trading stock in the hands of one spouse or the other.  This is because trading stock is circulating capital in the hands of the trader and any gain or loss on the disposal of the stock is a trading profit or loss for the purpose of income tax.  In the case of married persons where either the husband or the wife is carrying on a trade an asset, which is in the hands of one would not be trading stock, and could well be transferred to and taken in as the trading stock of a trade carried on by the other or in the reverse situation an item could be withdrawn from the stock of the trade carried on by the one and transferred to the <Col N="1670" /> other who, being a non-trader, would take it not as trading stock but as a chargeable asset.  In such situations there could be a conflict with income tax or commercial accountancy principles if disposals of trading stock between one spouse and the other were deemed to pass at the original cost of the stock to the one making the disposal.  The special rules for the treatment of transfers to and from trading stock are provided for in Schedule I, Paragraph 15.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister explain the effect of that proviso in simpler terms?  I refer to the effect as distinct from the intended meaning of it.  As I see it, the section is saying that in the normal way if there is a disposal of property between a husband and wife this is to be treated as if there were no loss and no gain on the transaction unless the asset in question is part of a trading stock. What is the effect of the &ldquo;unless&rdquo; part of it?  If they are not to be treated in that way it means there could be a gain or a loss as between the husband and the wife.  That is my understanding of it.  Would the Minister say if that is correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this proviso we are substituting for the original cost the market value of the property at the time it transfers from one spouse to the other.  We are providing here that this will occur where one of the parties is a trader.  The trade account will be credited with the market value of the stock which is taken out.  It has to be done for income tax purposes.  The recipient will be credited with receiving the asset at the same value as it is recorded in the trading account.  The market value rule is also to apply where an asset is taken into the trading stock by a spouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to take the asset at the market value for income tax purposes.  Quite clearly, it would be an anomalous situation to have the one asset valued at market value for income tax purposes and at its original cost value for capital gains tax purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be an anomaly but is it not also an anomaly that the husband and the wife are being treated as one person and with the exemption being restricted to one person?  There is also provision here that if there is a disposal between a husband and wife of trading stock they are to be treated as two people.  That is also an anomaly but it does not seem to be forcing the Minister to consider providing for the husband and the wife exemption the same as that for two single people.</P>

      <P>They are for income tax purposes, not I admit the whole way.  There is a special married <Col N="1672" /> woman's allowance in respect of earnings.  I am speaking of the income tax code.  There is a recognition of the fact that she is separate from her husband, whereas it seems to me that what is being done in this Bill is treating the married woman, who is living with her husband, as if she does not exist until it comes to a problem where trading stock is involved in which case she is treated as a completely separate individual.  When the Minister has considered all this, I do not think he will be able to convince himself that the treatment set out in this section and in the previous section is logical.</P>

The allowance which is given to the working wife is not available to a wife who may have unearned income.  It is a working wife's allowance and is paid because she has an income in respect of her labour.</P>

      <P>At least it is a recognition of her separate existence.  I <Col N="1673" /> hope the Minister will reconsider the whole position which I believe is strengthened by this proviso to subsection (5) which shows that when a problem arises the Revenue Commissioners, in treating the husband and wife as one, forget this figment of the imagination and suddenly the two are treated as separate individuals. Could I come back to the query I had in regard to that proviso?  It says:</P>
      <P>Provided that this subsection shall not apply if, until the disposal, the asset form part of trading stock...</P>
      <P>What is the Minister's interpretation of &ldquo;until the disposal&rdquo;?  From when until the disposal?  The day before or its original acquisition or which?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the time it was taken into trading stock until the actual moment of disposal.  This section will operate to the relief of people because on the taking of an asset out of trading stock a liability to income tax would arise.  If we did not have this special treatment of trading stocks, the situation would arise in which in later years the person holding the asset on ultimate disposal would pay the capital gain calculated on the original cost value instead of the market value on the date of acquisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is true.  If you did not have this proviso in they should not have to pay at all according to the Minister because it is a transaction between a husband and wife and is exempted.  That is what the Minister was saying earlier.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we are involved in a trading situation here where an income tax liability arises and this is what makes this proviso <Col N="1674" /> necessary, to protect the income tax payer from a double charge which would otherwise arise.  If it was not part of trading stock, the income tax liability would not arise and, therefore, a double charge would not arise.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17a.</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (1) (a), to delete lines 48 to 50 inclusive and substitute &ldquo;for a consideration equal to their market value at the date of death; but&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that where the property devolves on death, the person receiving it will be assessed if he is to be assessed for capital gains tax in future, on a base of the value of the property at the date he got it.  The provision in the Bill is that it has this practical effect, that if, we will say, a farmer acquired a farm 40 years ago and the farm passes on his death to a nephew and the nephew farms it for another 30 years and then disposes of it on his retirement.  In order to assess the gain on which he will pay tax the Revenue Commissioners will value the farm at its value 70 years previously and then its value at the date of disposal 70 years later.  There will, of course, be a huge and artificial gain and a situation in which the kind of liability for tax that can arise could be quite out of proportion.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the section would read:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this Act, the assets of which a deceased person was competent to dispose&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  shall be deemed to be acquired on his death by the personal representatives or other <Col N="1675" /> person on whom they devolve for a consideration equal to their market value at the date of death.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider very seriously the implications of this section if it is not amended in the way I have suggested.  This section, as drafted, could lead in the long term to an enforced retention of property by a legatee since the alternative could attract capital gains tax liability accruing over the deceased's period of ownership.  In the case I have indicated it would be a liability accruing over 40 years and then over another 30 years in the case of the man who got it.  This position would be particularly inequitable where an asset was passed from generation to generation.  Chargeable gains accruing to the legatee on the disposal of a private residence of a deceased would not appear to attract relief under section 25 but the disposal on death of a family business or farm to the immediate family would render ineffective the relieving provisions of section 27.  All this seems to flow from the provisions of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of this section.  I do not quite understand, and I would like the Minister to explain, the reasoning behind a provision to go back to the date of original acquisition no matter how far back it is in order to get the base from which you calculate the alleged gain on which capital gains tax is levied.  I would have thought that the kind of case I have outlined would itself illustrate the injustice and, perhaps, the impracticality of this approach.  I hope the Minister will agree that an amendment on the lines I have proposed would make for greater equity and greater acceptance of the equity of the capital gains tax as it is proposed to be implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in subsection 1 (a) of section 14 proposes that an asset passing to a legatee on the decease of another person is to be deemed to be taken by the legatee at the value at which the deceased acquired it.  This ensures that in the event of a subsequent sale of the asset <Col N="1676" /> by the legatee his base cost, for the purpose of computing the capital gain made by him, would be that of the deceased.  If a legatee were to be treated as acquiring the asset for capital gains tax purposes at its market value, he could dispose of it immediately or very soon after acquisition and escape capital gains tax while, at the same time, because of the very high exemption thresholds which are afforded in the capital acquisition tax he might not be charged to any capital acquisition tax.  This is particularly relevant in the case of transfers on death by parents to their children where the threshold of exemption in respect of each child is £150,000.  The possibility of a charge to capital gains tax on a disposal is intended to ensure that tax is payable at the time of liquidity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not closed my mind to the suggestion contained in Deputy Colley's amendment.  I would be prepared to have a look at it between now and Report Stage.  However, it would be undesirable to allow the principle involved to be applied extensively.  This could lead to a situation in which there would be holders of substantial wealth who would never be called on to pay tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At least I am heartened that the Minister has indicated his preparedness to consider the amendment. I shall endeavour to reinforce the case I was making.  Am I right in thinking that the kind of case we are contemplating here is one in which, in terms of the White Paper, it was intended that there would be a liability only either to capital acquisitions tax or capital gains tax but not to both but <Col N="1677" /> that, subsequently, the Minister decided that as an anti-avoidance measure he would have to apply both?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Without going back over all that ground again, I suggest to the Minister that the fact that he is now applying both taxes in a situation where the White Paper said this would not occur is all the more reason for not accepting the section as drafted and for accepting the amendment. The case the Minister has been making is designed to produce a death duty situation, a situation which we were told was being got rid of.  The very high exemption limits of which he was speaking very favourably in the House not long ago are now being used as a reason for applying capital gains tax on a valuation from way back.  There is a considerable contradiction in the case the Minister has been making for the various provisions but I do not wish to labour the point except to say that to accept the section as drafted would be inequitable.  I presume the Minister's willingness to reconsider the matter indicates that he will have an amendment for Report Stage but that, in the absence of any such amendment, we would be entitled to move an amendment.  I should like the Chair's guidance on this because I understand that, technically, if the amendment is not accepted here nobody but the Minister can table a similar amendment for Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for the very generous exemption of £150,000 in respect of capital gains tax is that we do not wish to see comparatively small farms or businesses broken up. That is part of the Government's philosophy.  Death duties have the effect of breaking up comparatively <Col N="1678" /> small businesses and farms.  No liability to capital gains tax would arise if a person received an asset but did not dispose of it.  Capital gains tax will arise only in the case of a person disposing of an asset of their own volition but if that person wished to dispose of the property the Bill visualises that it would be appropriate that he pay capital gains tax.  I mention this as an illustration of the thinking behind our legislative proposal.  However, as I have said, I have not closed my mind to Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister has told us that a threshold of £150,000 is to avoid the breaking up of small properties.  I agree with that but situations can arise where it is desirable even in the national interest that property be disposed of.  I am thinking of cases of properties that may be inherited by sons and nephews.  Because of this section, whereby valuations from 30 or 40 years back can be taken into account, the person who inherited any such property would be inhibited from selling it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point the Minister made, there are two distinctions to be made and then follows Deputy Fitzpatrick's argument.  First, there is the case of a legatee who is a son or a close relative of the deceased and who would be exempt from capital acquisitions tax in respect of the inheritance of a property worth, say, £100,000.  The Minister is right in saying that no capital gains would arise until such time as the property was disposed of.  However, if the legatee finds it necessary to dispose of the property, there arises the point raised by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  Perhaps the Minister will say that if the original holder of the property had disposed of it during his lifetime, he <Col N="1679" /> would have had to pay capital gains tax so why should not his successor pay.  I can see that point but let us take the second case and this is where the law may be becoming somewhat harsh and near to the confiscation of property.  Let us suppose that the legatee is a stranger and if first he pays capital acquisitions tax on the asset and then decides to dispose of it, he will have to pay capital gains tax also.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to become involved in the question of charitable trusts and so on but suppose a sum of money or property were left to a very deserving cause which would not come within the definition for other exemptions and, assuming, that the cause is in the character of a stranger their only use of that legacy might be to realise it, to dispose of it.  The result would be absolute penal taxation, double taxation.  Both of the Acts will be impinging on it in this case.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister's difficulty and I am not trying to create a difficulty. I am trying to clarify the argument. Will the Minister take a point like that into consideration when he is considering Deputy Colley's case?  I admit the Minister's logic where a son or a close relation is concerned. In the other case the effect might be completely to inhibit what you might call Christian neighbourliness.  I am being cautious in what I say because this needs a complete study of the exemptions, but let us get at the kernel of what I am trying to say.  A deserving person could be left a real asset and he could be paying capital acquisition tax on the legacy and, perhaps, being forced by that very fact to dispose of the asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As soon as he does that, capital gains tax comes into operation. Deputy Colley's idea about the market value would help in minimising this. Since the Minister has so reasonably said to Deputy Colley that he will consider this, and since Deputy Colley is withdrawing the amendment, I am just trying to help the Minister with this argument.  I am not pressing anything on him.  This shows the complexity of the whole code.  I am grateful <Col N="1680" /> to the Minister for setting the precedent and bringing in the wealth tax as well as the other one and I will avail of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few questions I want to ask the Minister.  First, if the personal representative disposes of an estate for the purposes of division between the beneficiaries or legatees, can a chargeable gain arise on the personal representative's disposal of the property and, if so, who is liable to the tax arising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The personal representative has the liability to pay the tax on the sale of any such asset.  This would be similar to the liability which lies on any executor or personal representative to meet the liabilities of the deceased or any liabilities which may arise out of the administration of the estate.  Of course, the liability would be no greater than the asset he is handling and, in the case of capital gains tax, it would be no more than 26 per cent of the gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am really coming at here is this.  If the Minister were to accept my amendment or something very similar, presumably a disposal of the property by the personal representative within a reasonable time of acquiring it on the death of the person who owned the property would not normally lead to capital gains tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless there were a very rapid increase in value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;whereas it could very often lead to it if the section stays as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could never be more than the asset.  Assuming that the asset had a nil value at the date of acquisition, it could be no more than 26 per cent of the sale price and, in normal circumstances, that would <Col N="1683" /> be 26 per cent of the difference between the original and the disposal value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be very substantial unless the base value is that on the date of acquisition by the personal representative.  The Minister has answered my question but we will have to wait the outcome of his consideration of that matter to see how this provision will operate.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) refers to &ldquo;amendments of assessments or repayments of tax&rdquo; and I should like to know if there is any provision in this, or in any other Bill, regarding interest on repayments of capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision in this Bill dealing with that aspect but I would need to consider the matter further before giving an explicit reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A section was passed in another Bill which provided for interest on a number of different taxes and for interest on repayments of taxes in limited circumstances.  My recollection is that that section did not include capital gains tax.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to it to see if he would ensure that there is provision for interest on repayments of capital gains tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases of repayment of capital gains tax would be very rare.  In what kind of circumstances would it arise except if it was a miscalculation of what the capital gain was?  Invariably in capital gains tax cases the gain would be known and it would be a question of fixing 26 per cent of that.  There would be a case of setting off losses in the event of death against previous gains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the major case where it might arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a special concession which is being given.  I will look at the matter.  I am not saying no to the Deputy's request but it strikes me as not being similar to cases where, for instance in the case of wealth tax, an assessment would be <Col N="1684" /> made which on appeal would be found not to be justified.  The Revenue Commissioners in such a case would be making a refund of tax similar to that done in the case of income tax where an excess amount is paid and on appeal it is found to be excessive.  This is a different situation, in which the case for refund with interest is not as strong as it is in the others. I am thinking out loud now and I am not refusing to consider the matter further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

There could be another legal act, for instance a judgment of the court, which in effect would be a distribution of property.

      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a problem that may be arising in regard to the financial year 1974-75.  Will this capital gains tax legislation operate from April, 1974?  In the case of gifts I believe it will be February.</P>

      <P>During 1974-75 there is liability for legacy duty under the death duty code and the situation can arise, under subsection (4) of liability for legacy duty and capital gains tax at the same time.  That is a liability which would not arise after April, 1975.  Will the Minister give particular consideration to the situation arising in that period, where legacy duty ceases to be levied from April, <Col N="1686" /> 1975?  There is one year of double liability.</P>

It is only from the date of publication of the Bill that liability arises.

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the further huge increases in CIE fares and ESB charges sanctioned by the Government, and calls on the Government to take immediate steps to counteract the hardship and damage to the economy caused thereby.</P>
      <P>This motion has been put down to highlight the effects the increases will have on the economy.  These massive increases authorised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for CIE fares and freight rates and for ESB charges can only be described as the harvest reaped by a Government that is bankrupt of policies and leadership. Despite all the warnings in the past two years from this side of the House and from practically every responsible, experienced observer outside, the Government have done nothing about the fundamental problems that exist. Even now when the consequences of this bankruptcy move from central Government to semi-State bodies, this so-called open Government make use of procedural devices to prevent criticisms in this House of the Ministers who have been responsible for our economic mismanagement.  They should be required to render an account of their stewardship.  The buck must stop somewhere and it is right that it should stop here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No longer can we accept the paltry excuses that we have been getting, such as outside influences, ongoing studies and the teasing out of problems <Col N="1687" /> which we heard from the Government during the debate on energy and on the economy.  These latest price increases can only be described as a rape of the living standards of the people about whom the Government professed to be so concerned. The Government have raped the Exchequer, the farming community, the small businessman and the motorists.  They have permitted the multi-national companies to obtain enormous profits, as we revealed in this House.  Last December when a 15p increase per gallon was put on petrol the Government assured us the users of public transport would not be affected.  The people concerned now realise the truth of the Government's statement.  In addition to the 15p increase the companies were allowed other increases as they wished to apply them.  They were able to do this because their products were removed from the structure of the National Prices Commission on 12th December, 1973, and we were put into what is known as the Outer UK Zone, to which seven days' notice applies.  There were further increases which affected CIE, the ESB and other aspects of our economy.</P>
    <P>In the last two years the Government have succeeded in fostering and feeding what can only be described as an economic monster, the greatest this country has ever known.  In two short years they have not set out any economic policy; they have made some disjointed efforts which are destroying our economy.  The Government are diverting the energies of productive management by their constant sallies into irrelevant taxation areas.  They can only be described as Nero fiddling while we are being consumed by inflation.  The Government cannot continue to plead ignorance, as they have been doing for the past two years.  Their lack of an energy policy has resulted in a final insult to the many thousands of electricity consumers who were exhorted in the last two years to save energy.  The Government forgot to tell these people that because they conserved energy they would be fleeced.  One of the reasons put forward for the ESB <Col N="1688" /> increases was the drop in consumption.</P>
    <P>The increase of £200 million in our oil bill need not have been so great if the Government had taken action. This bill is rather like a stone dropped in the middle of a lake; the first ripples are not of great consequence but as they extend they multiply in size and effect.  Our oil bill has affected every sector, as we forecast.  It has triggered off cost increases and they, in turn, have created pressures for wage increases that were not foreseen.</P>
    <P>This is the result of the lack of any real action being taken with regard to the £200 million oil bill about which we hear so much.  The Government have done absolutely nothing to balance the economic effect of these increases.  They have done nothing to cut State expenditure so that we might be able to come to grips with the problems facing us.  Those are the effects as seen by most people here today.  The Government have increased the burden on productive industry with every taxation increase and the increases in insurance stamp contributions thereby starving small businesses of vital capital with which to finance increasing stocks and meet labour costs.</P>
    <P>This is the reason also we are now approaching something in the region of 105,000 persons unemployed at present. We maintatin it is deceitful of the Government to say that our priority must now be employment, even bearing in mind the present 28 per cent inflation rate.  Had the Government come to grips with the situation much earlier they would not now be trying to cope with the irreconcilable problems they have created.  Such a substantial employer as CIE where 75 per cent of its revenue is absorbed by the wage bill must be one of the greatest sufferers in the circumstances.  Eventually the Government must take a stand somewhere and nowhere better than at present with regard to CIE and the ESB, two of our major semi-State bodies. If the budget policy for 1974 had proved correct, the solvency of those semi-State bodies could have been maintained without resort to these new massive increases as can be seen from <Col N="1689" /> the report of the National Prices Commission.  Not once since October, 1973 have we seen any evidence whatsoever that the Government even appreciate the reality of that lack of policy. October 1973 saw the commencement of our energy problems, what has become to be known as the energy crisis but there has been no leadership from the Government in this respect.  Surely the nation is entitled to guidance and a responsible approach from any Government elected?  This is our people's entitlement no matter what Government may be in power.  They are entitled also to something better than the efforts the Government have been making, which seem now farcical to everyone&mdash;complete lack of action in regard to the energy crisis which has been debated over the past two years and particularly during the last 18 months.</P>
    <P>We are now entitled at least to ask some questions.  Why, for instance, are there increases granted now?  Why are they so massive?  If we fail to receive a suitable or acceptable explanation, surely we and the people are entitled to conclude that the economic and financial affairs of the country are beyond the control of responsible Government Ministers and beyond the understanding of the Government of the day. Each week we witness some further proof of increases following increases.</P>
    <P>A few months ago this House approved a £14 million subsidy for CIE when there was a long debate on the matter.  We thought then, and were entitled to conclude, that the principle at least involved in such a massive subsidy would prove to be of some assurance that the Government had a realisation of the seriousness of the problem or had come to grips with the economic and social necessity of ensuring that CIE be permitted to continue its operations through the difficult period then being experienced and which has continued.  Are the increases now being levied on the already over-burdened fare-paying public&mdash;and the increased freight rates&mdash;proof that the Exchequer is bankrupt?  That is the only conclusion to which we can come.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance <Col N="1690" /> introduced the famous 15p taxation on the gallon of petrol last December one of his statements then was to the effect that public transport would not be affected thereby.  That has not proved to be a very correct forecast, no more than have some of his other excuses given at that time.  We remember only too well all the other reasons he advanced at that time which were without foundation.  Now there is the final insult that every fare-paying passenger using public transport, every manufacturer and supplier using CIE for the carriage of their goods are being asked to carry this additional burden.  We wonder if the Government realise the effect these increases will have on the economy or is their need for money so great at present that the Exchequer can no longer meet its budget subsidies, placing CIE in the position where such increases are absolutely necessary, because that is what they are doing? The urgency of these increases sanctioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to be for the purpose of increasing CIE's cash flow. I wonder if the Government realise that the minimum fare they are permitting to be applied in Dublin city is the exact equivalent of 1s. 7d. in old money?  The Government must be completely insensitive if they think that will appear to the public as just another rise among the many we endure week after week.  This latest one will have a most serious effect on the less well off people who use the Dublin public transport system and, indeed, people who use the system all over the country, people who have to use the public transport system to commute to their place of work whether it be in Dublin, Clare, Limerick or anywhere else.  These are the people who will be hit by these increases.  Fare-paying passengers are less well off but they will have to suffer.  They cannot afford cars, not to talk of affording petrol at the price it is.  They have no alternative but to use public transport.</P>
    <P>Fares have increased 25 per cent and that increase will have very serious economic repercussions.  Freight charges will inevitably result in price <Col N="1691" /> increases and those price increases will have to be met by the fare-paying passegers of CIE.</P>
    <P>It cannot be argued that these increases are necessary in order to reduce the utilisation of CIE.  That argument was advanced in regard to the petrol increases and electricity increases in the past.  That argument can no longer be advanced to justify the present massive increases.  Neither can we be told that there is need to dress up our statistics for the benefit of those lending us money from abroad.  That argument no longer holds good.  We have reached the stage at which the economic mess is so great the Government are forced to increase indirect State revenue hour by hour.  That is what is being done in the case of the ESB and CIE charges and in the case of other State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>In December, 1973, we warned the Government of the consequences of the oil crisis.  We are now paying the price of the Government's inactivity in the interim.  It is regrettable that that should be the situation our citizens are facing.  In October, 1973, and on various occasions since, we highlighted what the consequences would be if adequate steps were not taken. We spelled out the effects on our economy, on the people themselves and on the State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce assured us more than 18 months ago, that all the problems relating to the energy and oil crisis were the subject of ongoing study and the Government would ensure everything would be done to relieve the burdens that might be caused because of the oil and energy position.  No results have been forthcoming.  There have been no reports.  No solutions have been advanced.  No solutions seem to be even contemplated.  Nothing has happened.  We are still waiting for the results of the ongoing study and for the solutions.</P>
    <P>As we have said on numerous occasions, the first essential is to become self-sufficient in refining capacity.  By being self-sufficient we will <Col N="1692" /> have control over stocks and profits. We said three years ago it would take three years to become self-sufficient in refining capacity, whether that selfsufficiency is brought about by an extension of Whitegate or by building a new refinery.  There is no evidence of anything like that.  We have not as yet any natural oil resources.  We all hope we will reap some benefit from any oil that may result from exploration off the south coast but, even if oil is found there, we simply do not have the capacity to refine it and the possibility is that we will find ourselves exporting crude oil to foreign refineries and shipping the finished product back again.</P>
    <P>We are in exactly the same position now as we were in October, 1973.  We are three years away from exercising any control over our stocks and over the profit margins the multi-national companies have been mulcting us with for the last year and a half.  The ESB are paying something in the region of £40 a ton for oil&mdash;hence the fuel surcharge on every ESB bill.  Nothing has been done to relieve the people of this surcharge.  While the ESB are paying £40 a ton for oil Whitegate is exporting oil at £8 a ton.  Surely this is an indefensible position.  Some action could have been taken.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Gas Company had a contract for naphtha.  That contract started in 1967-68.  It appeared to be a very good contract from the point of view of the multi-national oil companies.  When the oil crisis occurred it became a good contract for the Dublin Gas Company and a bad one for the multi-nationals.  The latter were not long in putting in the boot to ensure they would get an increased price for the naphtha.  Surely we could have done something about the situation in which we were exporting oil at £8 a ton and the ESB were importing oil at £40 a ton.  Had some action been taken there would have been some relief of the burden of charges with which electricity consumers are now faced. Nothing has happened.  We believe the ESB, Aer Lingus and other big oil users should get encouragement from the Government to do something about it themselves.  It is possible for <Col N="1693" /> the Government and also for the ESB to go out and buy crude oil on the open market far cheaper than the price they are being charged now.  It is also possible for the ESB to hire a tanker.  Tankers are so plentiful nowa-days that the owners of tanker fleets would nearly pay you to charter one of them.  They are left idle all over the Mediterranean, Britain and the Continent.</P>
    <P>Oil is not scarce so the ESB could buy oil far cheaper than the price they are paying to the multi-national oil companies.  They could transport the crude oil to the Continent and make contract arrangements to have it refined to their own needs.  This would cost far less than the £40 per ton which they are paying now for this oil, which is supposed to be Russian oil.  It is not Russian oil most of the time.  The Russians are good brokers and they buy the oil in the Gulf and sell it to the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Government should go out and do something about getting supplies of oil instead of talking about the £200 million oil bill.  The crude oil could be refined on the Continent at a reasonable price.  There are many refineries there which are not working to full capacity.  The oil refinery is the real solution to the oil problem.  We could then become self-sufficient in relation to oil refining even if we are still forced to go out and but oil in the Gulf.  We could control the stocks and the profits.  We should be well ahead with the construction of a refinery in view of the chance of finding oil off the south coast.  We are in the same position as we were in October, 1973, and it looks as if we will go on in that position.  We will continue to be at the mercy of the multi-national oil concerns because the Government are not facing up to the oil problem.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing whatsoever about an energy policy for the ESB. We have only seen references to the burning of pound notes on television and people being asked to use less and less current.  People did this and now the prices report has given this as one of the reasons for the massive increase in charges.  The people will be <Col N="1694" /> paying more for using less and there will be more people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Government should face up to the realities facing the country.  They should do something realistic about them.  They should cut down the £200 million fuel bill instead of acceding to price increases as they did in the past week in relation to two of our large State bodies.  People had enough worries about ESB bills up to now but they will be far greater in the future.  The people are also faced with the prospect of increased unemployment and a decreasing amount of money going into households.  The Government are doing nothing to relieve the situation.  We have made suggestions about how the Government can eliminate the high costs in relation to the ESB and oil prices.  It is time the Government did something.  We find it difficult to believe that we have Ministers from the Labour Party who are permitting a minimum charge of 1s 7d in old money on buses in this city.  There should be a full inquiry into the cause of these massive increases instead of just a report from the prices commission.  The increases should be suspended until such an inquiry is completed.  The Government may well know the causes of these increases but the ordinary people have no idea of them but they certainly know what the effects will be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the nub of the matter.  The Opposition party come in here and waffle away&mdash;they have done this consistently for two years&mdash;about what is wrong but when they are asked to <Col N="1695" /> produce something which will deal with the situation they have nothing to offer.  Deputy Barrett's contribution this evening is the same speech that he has made for the past two years about the energy situation.  I do not propose to follow that now.  I hope to be in the House next week on the International Energy Agency and I will point out that Deputy Barrett, Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy O'Malley came into the House without even reading about the International Energy Agency, about which they purported to know so much and which they tried to advise the Dáil and the country not to sign.  Their three contributions were a mass of half truths, misinformation and ignorance.  Next week I will point out exactly what they were.</P>

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Barrett.  If the Deputy has something to contribute he will get his chance later on.  In the meantime let the Deputy stay quiet.  The increased costs which have been referred to are increased costs in the running of CIE and the ESB and there are three ways in which they could be met.  They could be met by a Government subsidy, which, of course, would mean taxation, which the Opposition would say should not be imposed and which they would oppose vehemently; by increased charges, which they are now opposing or&mdash; this is the solution they would like&mdash; by declaring workers in CIE and the ESB redundant.  They would like to see these people put out on the road. They pay the same prices as people who are not employed by CIE or the ESB.</P>

      <P>Are the Opposition suggesting that the workers in CIE and the ESB should not get the wage increases which were freely negotiated between the trade unions and the employers' bodies last year and this year?  Deputy Barrett seemed to suggest that we were now substituting the fares increases for the £17 million which was budgeted for earlier this year.  That sum still stands and that is the Government's contribution to the running of CIE.  Alongside that must go the fare structure.  The labour cost element in CIE is 66 per cent not 75 per cent as Deputy Barrett said of the total operating expenditure.  There are only three ways in which this figure can be reduced: (a) by sacking the men, which is evidently what the Fianna Fáil Party want; (b) Government subsidy; or (c) increased charges.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I be allowed to make my contribution without interruption?  I did not interrupt the previous speaker. The Government decided that CIE should endeavour, as far as possible, with increased charges, to work within the limit of £17 million which they allowed in the budget for CIE.  The increases which have been sanctioned by the Government were recommended by the National Prices Commission which is is a body composed of trade unionists, consumers and industrialists set up to adjudicate on and examine applications for price increases.  They recommended that CIE should be given those increases and the Government sanctioned them.  Of the £13 million increased costs, £11 million is in respect of wage increases.  It will be paid out in wages to the workers whom, I suspect, Fianna Fáil would like to sack.  I think that is the object behind their motion&mdash;to sack a proportion of the 20,000 workers in CIE and the 10,000 or 11,000 in the ESB.  This is what they really want.</P>

      <P>They want to cut down employment in CIE and the ESB.  Increased subsidisation would <Col N="1697" /> mean increased taxation which they would also oppose.  The workers in CIE and the ESB are not immune from price increases in other sections of the community.  The Opposition have an instant solution for every problem without giving it more than superficial thought.  The cream on the top of the pint is all they ever think about.  The body is below it.  They should look at this deeper and see what is the real situation and not come in here having looked at the problem only in a haphazard, shallow way.  They should come in here and tell us what they want.  Do they think that CIE and ESB workers should not get wage increases?  Is that what they are suggesting?  It seems to me it is. That everybody else&mdash;Dáil Deputies, Ministers, public servants, workers in ordinary industry, should be allowed wage increases but not CIE workers. That is what they are suggesting&mdash; unless they want subsidies and subsidies mean taxation and that they do not want either.  The only other alternative is price increases.  The Government decided that the subsidy of £17 million given to CIE should, as far as possible, be adhered to in this financial year and that the fare increases were justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about CIE and about the difficulty of running a huge complex such as this. It is the biggest employer in the country.  There are 20,000 people working in CIE.  It has many different facets &mdash;the buses, the trains, the provincial buses, the canals, shipping, freight and so on.  It needs careful watching by the board of CIE and by the Government at all times because there is an element of subsidisation every year and the Government must be satisfied that this money is being used to the best account in the public interest. I am, in my meetings with the board of CIE, constantly impressing on them the need for efficiency in their operations, the need for getting the best value because of their public commitment.  This will involve a large capital investment on the part of CIE in the modernisation of the railways because the highest proportion of loss is in the running of the railways.  It runs <Col N="1698" /> to about 80 per cent of the loss incurred by CIE annually.  This goes back over many years.  The chairman of CIE said last week-end that they are, on a phase basis, going to reduce the staff over a number of years but not drastically, not putting 2,000 or 4,000 men out of work.  If 4,000 men from CIE were let off in the morning there would be no necessity for the fare increases but that would mean that there would be a cut back of 20 per cent in the services.  The 20 per cent that would be cut back would not be the remunerative ones but the unremunerative ones going into rural areas, the ones that are most lightly used.  Those are the ones that I want to see kept because many people are living far from population centres and they need public transport and they need a means of communication for which urban dwellers have not the same need.  I want to see those kept. If we were to adopt what seems to me to be the policy of the Opposition and make 4,000 or 6,000 people redundant in CIE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To meet the increased charges it would be necessary to make 4,000 people redundant.  I do not like to have to ask the Government to sanction fare increases because I recognise the social role of public transport and I recognise the necessity to keep CIE operating as efficiently as possible but I must be realistic.  I must present the same choices to the Government as I have presented to this House.  It is unacceptable to the Government that people should be made redundant in CIE at this stage to avoid the increased charges.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to the House to hear that only 13 per cent of the total railway passenger journeys on CIE represent full adult fares and that 65 per cent of the Dublin suburban rail services are concession fares.  There are the 10-journey and weekly tickets on Dublin buses and the commuter tickets on the provincial services.  All those concession fares make up the balance. Even though the 25 per cent and the 33 per cent increase on the basic ticket rate is what is advertised and published on the rail side only 13 per cent of the people are paying those.  In addition, there is the free transport.  A considerable proportion of the people who use CIE enjoy free transport. There are the school-children, everybody over 67, blind people over 21, veterans of the War of Independence and their wives and widows.  In fact, 28 per cent of the total journeys on provincial long distance bus services represent free transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the 25 per cent increase on rail freight, 80 per cent of freight is carried at concession rates. The rates are negotiated between companies and CIE.  When the terms are being negotiated, the negotiations will be at a higher level but at present only 20 per cent of the freight carried by CIE is carried at the full rate.  Within the EEC the road freight service of CIE will have to operate commercially. In future we cannot subsidise that side of CIE operations.  Before the coming into force of the relevant EEC regulations I said that I wanted this side of the business to operate commercially. <Col N="1700" /> While we can justify the subsidisation of bus and train services we cannot justify the continued subsidisation of road freight carriage.  CIE are making an investment over a number of years of £20 million for the modernisation of their freight handling department so that, hopefully, in future that section of the company's operations will become profitable and may even make a contribution to the general profitability of the whole company.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in an article on British Rail in yesterday's <i>Financial Times</i> it was stated that five years ago that company's loss was £50 million but that in the current year the British Government will have to subsidise them to the extent of £438 million.  During the past five years the subsidy to CIE in respect of railways has been of the order of a multiple of 4½ whereas the subsidy to British Rail by the British Government has multiplied nine-fold in the same period. Allowing that CIE operate in very much more difficult circumstances than is the case of British Rail in England, because of the very much smaller population here, CIE are not as inefficient as some commentators would have us believe but I am not satisfied that they are totally efficient. Also, with regard to British Rail, that company have had two increases already in 1975 with the threat of another later whereas the increase being applied now by CIE is the first general increase for them here and I am hoping it will be the only one although I cannot make any promise in that regard because the 16th wage round has not been taken into account in the increase applied for by the company.  Obviously, for the same reason that I outlined earlier, this wage round will have an effect on costs in the future.  The workers in CIE are as entitled as others to their wage increases.</P>
    <P>Regarding the ESB, it has been said that there is to be an 18.3 per cent increase in charges.  I would point out that that increase is on the basic tariff. The increase on the total ESB bill is 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism in the report of the National Prices Commission <Col N="1701" /> and among various commentators outside this House of overstaffing in the ESB.  Four or five years ago the Fletcher Committee were set up to investigate the ESB and they concluded that there was overstaffing but they recognised this situation as being due to historical reasons&mdash;the economy of the country, and so on. The overstaffing was reckoned at the time to be in the region of 10 to 20 per cent.  Since then the ESB have been working on this &ldquo;fat&rdquo; in their system and have reduced their staff by more than 5 per cent despite the fact that their number of customers has increased by 100,000 and that their output has increased by 40 per cent. It would not be desirable that the company should render 1,000 people redundant.  The cost that would be involved in redundancy payments from the point of view of the Exchequer would be much greater than the carrying of the increased cost of staffing.  In their April report, the National Prices Commission stated that there was overstaffing in the ESB to the extent of 20 per cent.  The company do not accept this and have expressed a wish to discuss the matter with the consultants concerned.  I shall be looking forward to a report on those discussions and, after examination of it, I shall decide what action to take regarding the ESB and their overstaffing problem.</P>
    <P>During the past five years, also, there have been no temporary or casual staff employed by the ESB. Overtime during that period has dropped from 12 per cent to 7.4 per cent of the payroll.  The company have been affected by the energy crisis.  The point has been made in the NPC Report and by other commentators that the increase in charges is necessary because of the conservation of energy policy of my Department.  When applying for the increase the ESB said that there was a drop in demand but there was another element in that situation.  I refer to the economic climate of the past 18 months.  Growth in the ESB during the past five years has been mainly in the industrial sector but when that growth levelled off, the ESB found themselves in a zero growth rate situation <Col N="1702" /> although prior to then they had capital commitments to cater for the growth rate.  In discussions with them today they told me that the element of the 14 per cent increase that is attributable to the conservation policy of my Department is less than I per cent.  In other words, if there was no conservation policy, the price increase being imposed would be 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Rather than laying off people the ESB have been following a positive policy.  For instance, they are on the point of coming to an arrangement with the Saudi-Arabian Government for the production of electricity in that country.  They are pursuing a similar policy with the Iranian and Iraqi Governments.  Using their present design and construction staff they will go to those countries to help the respective governments set up generating and distributing systems, work that they have carried out very successfully at home.  Therefore, rather than cursing the darkness they are lighting candles and going out to seek new business.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking here before Christmas regarding a subsidy for the CIE rail service I said that I favoured an examination by a committee of this House to look into the affairs both of CIE and the ESB.  I repeated that at my party's Ard-Fheis and I am glad to say that the Government have taken a decision to set up a joint Oireachtas committee to look into the whole question of State bodies operating in a commercial manner. Details regarding the committee will be announced by the Minister for Finance within the next ten days or so.  I am glad that this committee is being set up, first, because public bodies should be accountable to this House and, secondly, because it will give Members of both Houses the opportunity to educate themselves regarding the operations of these organisations.  It is my wish that semi-State bodies would operate in as open a manner as possible and that as many people as possible would be familiar with their operations, their problems, their difficulties and their running.</P>
    <P>In the past week I had discussions <Col N="1703" /> with the chairman of CIE about the possibility of conducting meetings of the board in public and allowing the Press in to hear the discussions of the board members and, in particular, allowing in members of the staff of CIE so that they could appreciate the problems of the board and have an overall look at the general operations of CIE.  The more open all our State companies are, the more understanding of them will be the public, and the fewer frivolous motions from the Opposition will come before the House.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> To add the words</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and, further, recommends that consideration should now be given to the question of setting up a parliamentary committee to monitor the affairs of CIE and the ESB to ensure full public accountability&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is really an addendum.  I call upon the Government to set up a parliamentary committee to monitor the affairs of these bodies and all semi-State bodies.  When I was in Opposition I asked a number of questions on this matter but, unfortunately, many of them fell on deaf ears.  The recent increases emphasise more than ever the need for closer scrutiny of these bodies.  We have State monopolies with no competition.  They have no obligation to operate efficiently.  I read in the annual report of CIE that they are the largest single commercial enterprise in the country and are totally dependent on the community for survival and prosperity. They should have added that they are operating without any public accountability.  With a gross expenditure of £65 million, it is time they were accountable to the public.  As every Deputy knows, you cannot ask a question in this House about the policy of these bodies.</P>
    <P>Recently CIE made a decision about something affecting the community and they felt they were not obliged to discuss it.  I went to the Minister for Transport and Power and he said he had no responsibility in the matter, that it was a matter for CIE.  It was a policy which was contrary to the wishes of the people.  It was a question of roads owned by CIE which they were handing over to the public.  They were selling their houses and they would not accept responsibility for them.  The local authorities said they must be put in order before they would take them over.  CIE said &ldquo;No&rdquo; and the Minister for Transport and Power said: &ldquo;I cannot interfere in this matter.  This is a semi-State body.&rdquo; To me this answer was not good enough.  These bodies should be accountable to the public.</P>
    <P>I was interested in what the Minister <Col N="1706" /> said about free transport.  I do not think CIE provide that.  The Government provide it and pay CIE.  CIE collect for it.  The Minister made a point about freight charges&mdash;20 per cent only at full rate.  Who is subsidising whom?  Some of our biggest industries are being subsidised.  The policy in regard to subsidisation and fare increases is interesting.  There is no consistent policy.  In July last the National Prices Commission recommended increases but they were turned down by the Government.  Then in December the Government approved those increases.  With a policy like that&mdash;and I am critical of the Government in saying this&mdash;the management of a semi-State body would not know where they were.  It is provided that these semi-State bodies must break even but, if they do not break even, they are not accountable to the Dáil.  Not even once a year can the affairs of these semi-State bodies come before the Dáil.  This is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>If we accept that CIE are providing a social service&mdash;and I agree they are &mdash;we may have to consider full subsidisation and, perhaps, at no great extra cost we could provide it as a free service.  We might offer this as a concession to workers in national wage agreements.  With the way CIE are being subsidised at the moment a little more money might make the service available as a free service.  The Minister talked about the labour force.  We must talk about a future on-going policy for CIE and we must talk about redeployment.  I do not think we should have one policy for today and a different one for tomorrow.  We must look ahead and have a proper national policy and decide what type of labour force is needed and what kind of rationalisation is needed.  Having regard to inflationary trends, we have to decide what increases will be due in a year's time.</P>
    <P>Quite suddenly we are hit with these increases and we do not know when the next is due.  This is not good enough.  If we had projections for the coming year having regard to inflationary trends, we might know what increases will be due.  We should talk about future expansion and what the <Col N="1707" /> cost will be.  We could talk about employing everybody in CIE and the ESB.  We could solve the problem of 103,000 people unemployed by pushing them into CIE and ESB but that is not the answer to an unemployment problem.  We could not just pour them in.  We would have to rationalise these companies.  We would have to get people employed elsewhere and get one company operating normally and move them into another industry.  We should aim at rationalisation and planing for the future.  We might get people employed in other industries.</P>
    <P>The ESB are also a State monopoly with no competition.  We talk about the fuel clause variation and this is understandable but what is not understandable is the decision by the Minister for Finance to apply VAT to the fuel clause variation.  This, to me, was trickery.  I went to the ESB about it and they said: &ldquo;We have no authority in this.  It is by the direction of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;  It was understood by all that the fuel variation clause was applied because of the enormous increases in the cost of fuel but I do not think any Minister for Finance has a right to take advantage of that and apply VAT to it.  The Minister should seriously consider telling his colleague that this is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There is no opportunity of raising these matters in the House except when the Estimate is introduced. There is no public accountability. The public are the shareholders and they have a right to attend the annual general meetings and ask questions. I do not see why these State bodies do not hold an annual general meeting at which representatives of the public can attend.  I was pleased to hear the Minister announce that a parliamentary committee will be set up.  It is important that an examination of the books of these bodies takes place.  In December, 1973 the Taoiseach announced that the Government would be disposed to favour the establishment of a committee to examine and report on the activities of State sponsored bodies.  I would like to see this parliamentary committee <Col N="1708" /> having the right to examine books and call in experts to examine them and question the management of these bodies.  I hope we will see this in operation shortly.</P>

      <P>The increases by CIE and the ESB were shocking and breath-taking.  However, it appears that these are by no means the end of the price increases in each of these bodies for this year.  The February report of the National Prices Commission makes clear, as the Minister did, that the cost of the 16th round of the national pay agreement is not included in the enormous increase just sanctioned.  That was the biggest wage increase ever given in the history of the State.  The basic rate is not all that enormous but the actual rate of increase that will have to be paid is enormous because for the past 12 months inflation has been so high.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to work out what the further increases will be but clearly they will be substantial because we are told that 66 per cent of CIE's costs come from wages.  That company will now have to meet a huge further wage increase that was not taken into account in the increase in charges.  The increases in wages are effective from this quarter.  Even after increasing fares by 33? per cent CIE have to provide for the payment of the 16th round.  When are we going to see the end of this?  In the last ten months, from July, 1974, to May, 1975, just before the last increase was given, up to today the following are the increases in CIE rates and fares, as set out in the February Report of the National Prices Commission:</P>
      <P>Rail passenger, main line&mdash;50 per cent.  Dublin City buses and suburban rail&mdash;60 per cent.  Provincial city buses&mdash;60 per cent.  Provincial long-distance buses&mdash;50 per cent. Rail and road freight (major traffics)&mdash;44 to 47 per cent.</P>
      <P>It looks possible that by the end of 1975 CIE's fares will be 100 per cent higher than they were in July, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB made a clearer and more intelligible application for their increase.  They included the 16th round but they also say, according to the <Col N="1709" /> National Prices Commission report, that they will be making a further price application from 1st September, 1975, on top of the 18.3 per cent they received recently.  This is conditional on the ESB achieving a zero growth rate.  I did not think we would ever come to see that day with the ESB. They hope they will be good enough not to increase their sales of electricity.  The March report of the National Prices Commission states that the ESB believe that this estimate&mdash;in other words a hope that they will achieve a zero growth rate&mdash;could well be unduly optimistic, and that it will only be attained if there is a postive sales recovery in the year of the order of 7 per cent above the present trend.  That presumably refers to the trend for the first quarter but I do not know what happened in the weeks since then.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Deputy O'Connell refer to the unaccountability of such bodies and the belief of the Minister almost in the perfection of CIE and other semi-State bodies who tend to make their own rules and let the consumer or taxpayer pay for it. The National Prices Commission point out that of the amount claimed which they wipe their hands of&mdash;they said there was nothing they could do about it if the Government were going to insist on it&mdash;they did not want to grant £4,150,000 which was not allowable under the normal criteria laid down by the Government to the Prices Commission for consideration in relation to firms generally.  If CIE were not a semi-State body or a monopoly answerable to nobody, they would have had to deduct that £4 million from what was allowed to them eventually by the Minister.  A private company would have had to do that but CIE have got away with it.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that things are lax in CIE when the normal rules do not apply?  They are not accountable to anyone and the normal criteria for price control do not apply to them. The figures are set out in detail in page 192 of the report.  CIE claimed and got from the Government £14,517,000; the amount allowable in the opinion of the National Prices <Col N="1710" /> Commission was £10,393,000 but the entire amount was allowed.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have said they have no role in the consideration of the increases.  That is why it is downright misleading of the Minister to tell the House the Government have sanctioned only what the National Prices Commission recommended.  The commission did not recommend those increases and the reports dealing with CIE and the ESB set out many arguments why their hands are tied completely.</P>
    <P>In the case of the ESB, the hands of the National Prices Commission are tied by the terms of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927.  The CIE spokesman is quoted in the report as saying, &ldquo;The Government have re-affirmed ...&rdquo;; in other words, the National Prices Commission cannot allow the normal criteria to apply because the terms of the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, take precedence and, no matter how inefficient or otherwise, the ESB are expected to be allowed to balance their books each year.  Therefore, so far as the National Prices Commission are concerned they cannot stop them.</P>
    <P>It amounts to almost the same thing with CIE.  There is not the precise statutory direction as in the Electricity Supply Act, 1927, but the history of the dealings of this Government with increases recommended in relation to CIE have been so confusing from the point of view of the National Prices Commission that the latter have washed their hands of the business and they have let it go.  They are not making any recommendation one way or the other.  It is not correct to say that either of these increases were recommended by the commission. They have pointed out their hands are tied and that they have no function in the matter.  The question of considering prices for semi-State boards with virtual monopolies does not arise so far as the National Prices Commission are concerned because different criteria are applied.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could give an example of the differing attitude to the question of subsidies and increases in fares.  In July, 1973, the Government considered <Col N="1711" /> the report from the National Prices Commission in relation to CIE fares. The recommendation of the commission was for certain increases, significantly below those sought by CIE. The Government examined the report; they said they would not pay any extra subsidy and then proceeded to give increases to CIE higher than those recommended by the commission.  In July, 1974, the commission made certain recommendations in relation to a further application for an increase; the Government announced they were accepting the recommendations because they thought they were correct but instead of an increase of 30 per cent or more for the Dublin city bus services and suburban rail services they said they were reducing the increase to 20 per cent, with CIE responsible for the rest.</P>
    <P>With regard to the ESB, on 1st August, 1974, the National Prices Commission recommended an increase in their charges of 7½ per cent but, as was pointed out on page 179 of the report, the Government allowed an increase of 16 per cent.  Is it any wonder the National Prices Commission have washed their hands of trying to do anything in relation to CIE or the ESB?  I have given three examples of totally contradictory actions by the Government in relation to price increases by these two bodies and the recommendations of the National Prices Commission, and Deputy O'Connell gave the House a further example.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have no function in these areas and that is why the House should reject the meaningless amendment to the motion in the name of Deputy Barrett and myself.  That amendment states: &ldquo;that Dáil Éireann recognises the role of the National Prices Commission&rdquo;.  It may be that Dáil Éireann recognises that role but certainly the Government do not because on three different occasions in a period of a year they followed three different policies.  Is it any wonder that in their two reports the National Prices Commission washed their hands of this matter and said the Government will <Col N="1712" /> have to sort it out?  They have given the history of what happened to their previous recommendations; some were cut down and in other cases increases well in excess of what they recommended were granted.  The one thing the Government have not done&mdash;in the words of their own amendment&mdash; is to &ldquo;recognise the role of the National Prices Commission&rdquo;.  It is an attempt to pass the buck to the National Prices Commission but it has not worked because the commission have passed the buck to the Government.  They have said there is nothing they can do in relation to these two bodies.</P>
    <P>These matters are very important because they have a tremendous influence on the whole question of inflation and, therefore, on our industrial future.  They also have a tremendous influence on the lives of ordinary, less well off people.  As a general rule it is only the poorer people who are obliged to have resort to CIE. They have no choice in the matter. The people who might be able to pay these exorbitant increases rarely, if ever, use CIE.  The damage done by these monstrous increases to the budget of less well off people in every part of the country is enormous and as I pointed out, they are only the first instalment for 1975.  I have shown where there will be further huge increases before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>A point must be made about the timing of these two increases.  The CIE increases came into effect last Monday and I think the ESB increases came into effect on 1st May.  Do the Government realise that by announcing the increases last Monday rather than next Friday they have increased the wages that will have to be paid as a result of the price index going up by 1 per cent at the end of the quarter, on 15th May?  They have increased all wages by 1 per cent by not holding these matters for a few days.</P>
    <P>This is not a question of playing around with the price index or anything of that nature.  If the Government were any way genuine about an attempt to control inflation, they could have put this off for a few days which would have had the effect of <Col N="1713" /> keeping wages down for a certain period at least.  The cost to all employers in the State of this increase coming into effect on Monday last, rather than next Friday, will be, in a full year, £90 million in wage increases.  The cost in public service pay alone is £1 million in the first three months period or £4 million at least in a year because the cumulative effect of these two price increases is to increase the price index by 1 per cent with the consequental effects that has on wages under the 16th round agreement and further resultant effects on inflation running throughout the economy.  In fact, by this increase having come into effect on Monday last, CIE themselves probably stand to have to pay substantially more than they would have had to pay had the announcement not been made until the end of this week.</P>

      <P>Let me refer the Minister to subsection (5), line 25, page 15. At the end of the line he will see the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo;.  The context is: &ldquo;assets of the deceased ... which he could, if of full age and capacity, have disposed of by his will, assuming that all the assets were situated in the State and that he was domiciled in the State....&rdquo; I should like to inquire from the Minister if the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; in that context means even if the assets were not so situate.  In other words, in a case where the assets were not situate in the State, are they deemed to be situate in the State? Is that the effect intended to be achieved by using the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; in that context?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; in that case, in effect, means that the assets are <Col N="1714" /> deemed to be situate in the State even though they are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because they were unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The subsection now reads:</P>
      <P>(5)  In this section references to assets of which a deceased person was competent to dispose are references to assets of the deceased ... which he could, if of full age and capacity, have disposed of by his will, assuming that all the assets were situated in the State and that he was domiciled in the State.... </P>
      <P>I shall omit the remainder for the moment.  The word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; seems to me to be slightly ambiguous there in that it could mean assets of which he was competent to dispose, being assets which the deceased could, if of full age and capacity, have disposed of by his will, if they were all situate in the State.  Or it could mean assets of which he could have disposed of by his will whether they were situate in the State or not but, for the purposes of this subsection, being deemed to be situate in the State.  I do not know if I am making it clear to the Minister the alternative meanings of &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; in that context that I think arise.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to get at is the intention of the use of the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo;.  I do not think I can put it any more clearly than by asking: is it intended that whether the assets are situate in the State or not it will not affect the competence of the person to dispose of them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We assume that his competence covers all his assets irrespective of their location.  It includes any assets which a deceased person <Col N="1715" /> who dies domiciled in the State could have disposed of by his will, irrespective of the location of the assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not mean then that they are deemed to be situate in the State whether or not they are for the purposes of this subsection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. One could dispose of assets which were not located in the State because they are the laws of this State which would operate in relation to the disposal.  It is really a question of competence to dispose of the property and that competence is determined by our law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because if the assets were situate in the State nobody would challenge the competence to dispose of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But does the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; in that context not strike the Minister as somewhat unusual?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be&mdash;and offhand I cannot even say in what circumstances this could arise&mdash;but there could be laws of some other State that could be a restriction in this area.  We are providing that they are the laws of this State which will apply irrespective of any restrictions which may apply in some other jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Minister wants to achieve but I want to put it to him that the use of the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; there is somewhat ambiguous.  I would suggest that he might have it looked at again to see if it could be made less ambiguous.</P>
      <P>May I also refer the Minister to the second portion of subsection (5), the reference to the severable share in any asset to which immediately before his death he was beneficially entitled as a joint tenant?  Is the effect of this provision that, if the asset were severable but not in fact severed, liability would arise for the surviving tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I can <Col N="1716" /> understand the Deputy's concern about the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; which does appear to be all embracing, perhaps too extensive or too wide.  We gave the very widest and most serious consideration to the wording of this section and we could not find any other more apposite wording to deal with the particular situation we want to cover.  We wanted to cover all assets which would be affected under Irish law and there was no other word we could find other than the word &ldquo;assuming&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is, if the assets are severable, as envisaged, but not severed before death, does liability for capital gains tax arise in that case and fall on the surviving joint tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably, in the case of a joint tenancy, which is not severed, the share of the deceased joint tenant will pass to the surviving joint tenant. I take it that is not deemed to be a disposal because it is a transfer on death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, if it is not deemed to be a disposal, then liability will not arise at the time in regard to the share which the surviving joint tenant is receiving but, in due course, if he disposes of that share, then liability will arise.  On what basis will the liability be calculated?  What will be the basis for the calculation of the gain?  Will it be the value of the share at the date he acquired it, namely, the date of death of his former joint tenant, or will it be the date of acquisition by the deceased joint tenant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where property under joint tenancies is disposed of but consideration received for the disposal is taken by the joint tenants in equal shares, notwithstanding that they may have contributed in different proportions to the cost of acquisition&mdash;this arises out of the nature of a joint tenancy&mdash;the chargeable gain or loss of joint tenancy is to be computed on this basis, except where they divide the proceeds among themselves in proportion <Col N="1717" /> to their original contributions. The computation then would be on the basis of their original contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where they dispose of the joint property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few angles to this.  The one envisaged clearly in this subsection is not the one I am pursuing.  Where property is held by joint tenants and is severable, but is not severed before the death of one of the joint tenants, am I right in thinking that the share of the deceased joint tenant passes to the surviving joint tenant and no disposal arises on that passing on death?  That is step No. 1. Step No. 2 is, if the surviving joint tenant disposes of that share in due course, what is deemed to be the value of the share of the deceased tenant for the purpose of assessing capital gains tax?  Is it the value at the date it was acquired by the surviving joint tenant, which is the date of death of the deceased joint tenant, or is it the value at the date it was acquired originally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It has to be the date of the original acquisition because a joint tenancy of its nature is a unified ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister would agree though that the surviving joint tenant would only have acquired that share on the death of his joint tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there would be no loss or gain at the time of his acquisition of the share that the deceased joint tenant originally had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so what is the point of saying in the subsection that references to assets of a deceased person include references to his severable share in assets to which he was entitled as a joint tenant?  That would suggest that his share, although not severed, is to be included in the property deemed to pass on his death whereas the Minister seemed to suggest a moment ago that that share would pass to the surviving joint <Col N="1718" /> tenant who, if he disposed of it, would have to pay capital gains tax on it calculated on the basis of its value at the date it was acquired. Does there not seem to be a double liability arising here?  On the one hand, the liability arises in the hands of the surviving joint tenant and, on the other, on the basis that under this subsection the share is deemed to be part of the assets passing on the death of the deceased tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties all the time here is that one has to approach every particular asset from a number of different angles; one, the person who originally held the asset and, on the other hand, the person who succeeded to the ownership of it. What we are deeming here is that the person who has a severable share on death is the owner of that severable share.  There cannot be any doubt about that.  When we come along to calculate the gain later on of the person who succeeds to that share we calculate the gain as that which follows the original acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a discrepancy here?  What is the point of including it as part of the property passing on death?  What is the reason for including it in that way?  What is the effect of doing that?  Is this case in the same category as the others I was talking about earlier which the Minister undertook to have a look at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on whether or not one takes the original value or the market value at the date of the transition of the ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I am really coming at.  It seems to me that it comes into that category or alternatively that subsection (5) should be reworded.  This subsection seems to me to be bringing a non-severed share of a joint tenancy into the category of property passing on the death of a person to be treated in the same way as any other property, whereas in the normal way with a joint tenancy, as the Minister has indicated, it would be deemed to be property passing to the surviving joint tenant and, when disposed <Col N="1719" /> of, having its original value at date of acquisition taken into account in assessing the amount of the gain.</P>
      <P>There seems to me to be some discrepancy in those two approaches.  If there is, it ought to be clarified.  Even if there is not, I think it is a case coming within the same category as the ones we referred to earlier where there is a strong case for the base value for the purpose of calculating the gain being fixed at its market value at the date of acquisition by the person who becomes liable rather than its original value perhaps many years previously when acquired by the joint tenancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17f:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (4) (b), line 16, to delete &ldquo;shall,&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;shall, except where at any time previously, those assets, while forming part of that settled property, were, by virtue of subsection (5), deemed to be disposed of and immediately re-acquired for a consideration equal to the whole or a corresponding part of the market value of the asset,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) (b) could give rise to an anomaly where in the course of administration of a settlement the provisions of subsection (5) of section 15 had been applied at any time.  Subsection (4) deals with the treatment of an asset which passes out of a settlement to a person who becomes absolutely entitled to it on the death of the person who had a life interest in it.  It provides that there is not to be a charge to capital gains tax at that point and that the person absolutely entitled takes the asset at its value of entry into the settlement.  To ensure that any gain accruing before 6th <Col N="1720" /> April, 1974 is not charged it is necessary to provide an apportionment formula and this is what was proposed by the words &ldquo;... and shall, if the trustee had first acquired the property at a date earlier than the 6th day of April, 1974, be deemed to be at that earlier date&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The effect of this apportionment provision is that the time at which the trustee first acquires the asset is to be substituted for the time the person becomes absolutely entitled to the asset and time apportionment will take place from that earlier time, being a time before 6th April, 1974. This provision was intended to apply to the simply case where an asset was put into trust for the life of a person with remainder to another and the latter became absolutely entitled on the death of the first person.  The manner in which the provision operates may be seen from the following example.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister describing the situation unamended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On 6th April, 1970 A creates a trust in an asset worth £1,000 for B for his life and remainder to C.  There is no charge to capital gains tax on A by reference to the £1,000 as it occurred before 6th April, 1974.  On B's death the property passes to C and there is no charge and C is deemed to have acquired the asset for £1,000 at 6th April, 1970.  If C disposed of the asset on 6th April, 1980 for £1,500 he would be charged to capital gains tax on £300.  Suppose that A created a trust on 6th April, 1970 for B for life, then for C for life, then for D, with remainder to E and that after the death of B on 6th April, 1975, C on 6th April, 1976 and D on 6th April, 1980, E then acquires the asset.  There will be a charge under subsection (5) on 6th April, 1975, say, at a market value of £1,200 and, again on 6th April, 1976, say, at a market value of £1,400, but no charge on 6th April, 1980, with a market value of, say, £1,500.  If E disposes of the asset for £2,000 on 6th April, 1985 there will be a gain of £600, that is £2,000 less £1,400, but this gain would, as the <Col N="1721" /> subsection stands, be apportioned over the period from 6th April, 1970 to 6th April, 1985, 15 years, and only £440 would be chargeable.  It is not logical to apply the time apportionment formula in a case where the base cost is taken at a date subsequent to 6th April, 1974 and there is no reason why the charge should not be £600 instead of £440.</P>
      <P>To correct the anomaly it is necessary to exclude the case where there has been a charge under subsection (5) because a consequence of the charge under that subsection is to bring up the base cost to the market value at the time of the charge.  It would be wrong to provide for time apportionment back to a date before 6th April, 1974 when the base cost for calculating the gain is a value fixed at a date subsequent to 6th April, 1974.  The amendment proposes, therefore, to achieve the necessary correction by interpolating in the subsection the words set out in the amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(12) (a) In this section `life interest' in relation to a settlement&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  includes a right under the settlement to the income of, or the use or occupation of, settled property for the life of a person (or for the lives of persons) other than the person entitled to the right,</P>
      <P>(ii)  does not include any right which is contingent on the exercise of the discretion of the trustee or the discretion of some other person, and</P>

    <P>(iii)  does not include an annuity, notwithstanding that the annuity is payable out of or charged on settled property or the income of settled property except where some or all of the <Col N="1723" /> settled property is appropriated by the trustees as a fund out of which the annuity is payable and there is no right of recourse to settled property not so appropriated, or to the income of settled property not so appropriated. </P>
    <P>(b)  Without prejudice to subsection (6) (b), where under paragraph (a) (iii) an annuity is to be treated as a life interest in relation to a settlement, the settled property or the part of the settled property appropriated by the trustees as a fund out of which the annuity is payable shall, while the annuity is payable, and on the occasion of the death of the annuitant, be treated for the purposes of subsection (5) as being settled property under a separate settlement.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>There is no change in the substance of this subsection which is mainly concerned with the definition of &ldquo;life interest&rdquo;.  The first part of the existing subsection sets out the definition and the last part of the subsection sets out that in certain conditions the property out of which the annuity is payable is to be treated as a separate settlement.  The revised draft divides the subsection into two parts (a) and (b).  The first part contains the definition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is what the amendment says.  Paragraph (iii) says it does not include an annuity except where some or all of the settled property is appropriated by the trustees as a fund out of which the annuity is payable and there is no right of recourse to settled property not so appropriated, or to the income of settled property not so appropriated.  That does not seem to relate at all to whether the annuity is related to a life but rather to whether it is appropriated by the trustees to a fund, whether there is a right of recourse to the settled property. They seem to be the factors that take an annuity out of that exclusion but it seems to me, on the face of it, that an annuity which is related to a life, and this is quite frequent, is by this definition being excluded from a life interest. There may be a good reason for it but it is not obvious to me at the moment why that should be so.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Deputy is concerned with relief for the taxpayer and this subsection would operate to the relief of the taxpayer.  On that account, while I know there are certain difficulties in interpreting and understanding the section, I do not think one need be unduly worried about it because it operates in that way of easement to the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I am not entirely convinced by that.  Furthermore, I think there ought to be a good reason for <Col N="1725" /> different treatment of what appear to be similar interests.  A life interest in the ordinary sense of certain property is dealt with in one way.  A life interest which is in the form of an annuity for life appears to be dealt with differently.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I know there is still some difficulty regarding interpretation but Deputy Lalor must be encouraged to know now that he would be justified in believing in me.  Suppose an annuity is payable out of the general fund of a settlement, there would be no disposal, actual or deemed, as soon as that general charge would cease.  But if funds are appropriated specifically there is a disposal when the annuity ceases.  However, if it ceases on a death there would be no charge.</P>

      <P>One could almost say &ldquo;without prejudice to any other section of this Bill, such provision will have effect&rdquo;.  However, I am advised that the phrase is necessary to provide for a situation where, for the purposes of subsection (5), the same settled property would fall to be regarded as being a settled property under a separate settlement in accordance with the provisions both of subsection (6) (b) and subsection (12). Perhaps I should give an example to explain the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us say that under a settlement, property is held to pay the income thereof in equal shares to A, B and C for their lives subject to the payment of an annuity of £100 to D for his life.  A's interest is a life interest which is a right to a one-third part of the income of the settled property and this part falls to be treated as being under a separate settlement in accordance with the subsection (6) (b).  In <Col N="1728" /> order to answer the annuity, the trustees appropriate, say, £1,000 of 10 per cent loan stock out of the funds already segregated to provide the incomes for A, B and C, respectively. This loan stock would, under section 12, be treated as being under a separate settlement.  The position then would be that one-third of £1,000, £333, would be common to the two separate settlements.  In these circumstances the provisions of subsection (6) (b) would prevail on the termination of a life interest and the part of the settled property representing A's interest, including the specific fund appropriated to the annuity, would be regarded as a separate estate to which the treatment in subsection (5) would apply.</P>

If I understand the Minister's illustration of the situation which he has just given us, when it came to the crunch of reconciling the two contradictory things he said that subsection (6) (b) would prevail.  Why would subsection (6) (b) prevail?  &ldquo;Without prejudice to subsection (6) (b)&rdquo; does not seem to me to make it prevail.</P>

I do not think the phrase &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; is the right phrase to <Col N="1729" /> achieve what the Minister wants to achieve.  It is confusing and in substance what it is saying is that you have two contradictory provisions.  I believe it does not convey, in circumstances where the contradictions arise, that subsection (6) (b) will prevail. That could be said quite clearly or more clearly.  I urge the Minister to have it looked at again to see if what is intended as described by him cannot be more clearly conveyed in the wording.</P>

      <P>A gift in settlement, whether revocable or irrevocable, is a disposal of the entire property thereby becoming settled property notwithstanding...</P>
      <P>Does that mean that the gift causes the entire property to be deemed to be disposed of or does that relate only to the gift itself?  It would appear to mean that a gift in settlement causes the whole of the settled property to be deemed to be disposed of even though it is only the gift that is being disposed of.  For instance, if the gift formed one-tenth of the settled property on the face of it this subsection seems to be implying that a gift, whether it is revocable or irrevocable, causes the whole of the property to be subject to a disposal within the meaning of this subsection?  Is that the intention?</P>

It may be received in different proportions by the recipients of that property&mdash;that is another day's work&mdash;but the property that is disposed of which one must be able to measure at the time of the disposal is whatever is given.

      <P>It comes back to the definition of settled property. What happens if a person divides his property into three parts, if he gives one part to his wife, one part to his daughter and keeps one third?  I have great sympathy with the Minister, the Revenue Commissioners and the parliamentary draftsman.  We are going into a line of country where a great deal of ingenuity is used to dodge all kinds of taxes.  We seem to have reached the ridiculous stage where a person cannot divide his property into three parts and retain one part without paying tax on what he keeps or else the whole operation can be defeated by calling it a gift and paying on two-thirds.  We are legislating in an area where there are many dangers so far as settled property is concerned, where there can be complete evasion by a simple operation. Will the Minister tax a person if he divides his property into parts, if he gives some to his children and keeps a part for himself?  Will that person be taxed on what he has not disposed of?</P>

      <P>In this competition between the State and the tax evaders, between the ingenuity of the advice and administration available to the Revenue Commissioners in competition with lawyers advising clients on how to get around the law, we have got to the point where the State is winning hands down.  It will beat all the discretionary trusts but if the Minister does not tax the part of the property that is left the purpose of this section will be defeated by the simple transaction of dividing the estate into disposals.  The limits and reliefs must be considered in conjunction with the capital acquisitions tax. I am concerned that between the two measures we will meet with some unforeseen situations.  A man with a substantial amount of property will dispose to the limit of £150,000 and he will be taxable for capital gains only on the fraction he has disposed of directly.  He will get off scot free on what he has retained.  I am making these points in a general way because, quite frankly, one would want to retire for a month to consider the full implications of this legislation.  Many loopholes will be blocked but we are leaving the hall door wide open when the three Bills are taken together.</P>

      <P>It is only if he settled a kind of life interest for himself.  I can understand the Revenue Commissioners' point here because this is where big money may be involved.  I imagine this will be a problem only with big estates.  But, if one takes the reliefs under the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill into account there, it might be better for the Minister to give the exemption at this point rather than let it work out, remembering that each child will have his £150,000 limit, will he not under the other Act?  I am saying this purely to be helpful and I realise the fairly large amount of money that would be involved but I wonder could all this be done in a simpler manner.  With all this legislation we are getting very near the stage where the House might have to consider whether or not the Revenue Commissioners be set up as a judicial body, give them general powers and then, subject to appeal to the court, and not try to define their powers.  Their powers are so wide now that, perhaps, a new concept of this is necessary but that is a Second Reading speech.</P>

      <P>One of the most significant differences between our legal system, which we have inherited from our association with Britain for so long, is that we have this notion and practice of trusts.  These are strangers to the Roman law system that operates say, across the European continent.  It might be said that the effect of this would be to discourage people from creating a trust to settle property on themselves and so on.  Probably it means one gets a clearer definition and recognition of where property lies if one has not got those interfering trusts.</P>
      <P>As Deputy de Valera said, we are arguing here over a very small number of people who create trusts because of the massive wealth holdings they possess.  If a trust is created whereby somebody settles property on himself, that is very seldom the end of the trust.  It usually carries on to somebody else.  It is settled on the person himself for life and passes afterwards to somebody else.  To that extent invariably it involves some alienation of proprietary rights which existed before the trust was created.  Obviously, there would be little point in the creation of a trust simply to settle property on oneself for life and leave the future to guesswork or to somebody else.  Those kinds of trusts are very rare if, indeed, they exist at all.</P>

      <P>I was going to ask the Minister whether or not a trust stood up at all if the donor or his wife <Col N="1739" /> was involved in it.  In actual fact, I do not think there are any trusts like that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, very seldom. I simply cannot think of one where it would be created in isolation.  Invariably, it is linked with some on-going rights to some other person, or persons, in some cases, yet unborn or unascertained.  But there is no worthwhile value&mdash;and certainly there will not be in the future&mdash;in the creation of a trust under which a donor would simply settle the property on himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case mentioned by Deputy Colley where a person gave away one-third to himself, one-third to his wife and one-third to his child.  Why would such person give it away to anybody?  Why not keep one-third and give away two-thirds?  Why have a third in a trust? I cannot understand why one would place a third in a trust.  If it was for a wife, why not give it to her?  Why put it in a trust?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would assume that in a case like that the donor might be keeping a life interest and, perhaps, giving his wife a life interest.  Why should he be liable to capital gains tax on the life interest he retains in his own property?  I can understand why he should be liable on what he is alienating to other people.  Of course, the Minister is correct in saying that technically once he disposes of it to, say, a trustee, in trust for himself for life, it is an alienation. But, in real terms, so far as it is held in trust for himself, it is not an alienation.  On the face of it, I do not see a loophole in that.  If there is not a loophole, I do not think we ought be imposing a tax in circumstances in which, for the purposes of carrying out these arrangements, the man is, in effect, retaining an interest in portion of his property.  That he should have to pay capital gains tax on it does not seem to be a reasonable proposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not the point of the whole thing?  Under the old death duties code there were a whole series of devices, in settlement, in trust and with private companies to escape the consequences.  Sometimes if one looks at a thing like this in principle before one gets lost in the words, one gets further.  What the Minister is really dealing with in this section is based in the area properly appropriate to the capital acquisitions tax but the trouble in which the Minister finds himself is that in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill his limits make it difficult for him.  Am I correct in that so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Substantially, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the Minister's problems.  What the Minister is trying to do is partly to deal with blocking loopholes well established under old legislation.  I shall not open up old sores by saying. Not having abolished death duties, the Minister is afraid that the old incidents will remain, and remain they will.  If we look at it that way, one has to ask what is the purpose of the settlements about which we are speaking?  In every case in the past they were to evade death duties.  The Minister's problem is that they will be adopted again now, not so much to evade capital gains but, in the first instance, the continuing trust will be to evade the contingency of death.  If that is the background, then there is no point in resorting to trust merely to avoid capital gains.  One has to put something in.  One must put in one's provisions.  I am not saying one should omit them because capital gains could be evaded by the same devices.  But I think you could afford to leave the property that remains with the settler free and tax the fractions disposed of only.  One should take care, at the other end, that it is not done in such a way that there <Col N="1741" /> could be an escape through the device of the other Bill.</P>
      <P>Therefore for that reason a look at the principle of what is involved might be beneficial, whether or not there is need for adjustment between two different Bills, quite apart from the amendment of the section involved here.  But this will occur only in relation to large estates and a relatively small number of people.  Perhaps the Minister should consider certain powers being granted to the Revenue Commisioners to deal with the abnormally large estates in their own separate rights.</P>

      <P>To take Deputy Colley's example, is this section devised to prevent a trust being formed that would never fold up?  Is that the reason this is brought in?  You would have these three and an insurance company could be the fourth and the trust could be held in perpetuity and would never break up and nothing would ever be paid on it.  Is that the reason this is brought in?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our concern is that something might be fabricated which would perpetually postpone any possibility of collection of capital gains tax.  If the donor were to reserve a fraction absolutely for himself, if it were under some trust arrangement which limited the total position and benefit of that element to himself, then it would not be caught.  This is a rather unreal situation.  People do not create trusts just for the fun of it.  They are usually engaged in them for avoidance purposes or for the benefit of people who, for very good reasons, should not be given absolute control of property themselves.  There are many cases like that.  There always will be.  We are concerned here with somebody who is alienating his existing property rights to some other person or group and, in that case, there is a disposal of an interest and in such circumstances we say that disposal is taxable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the <Col N="1742" /> distinction and I quite agree with the Minister.  If the donor keeps his own absolute interest, even if it is under the name of a trust, this will pass on his death anyway and I suggest it is captured here.  It is very easy to devise so that the date will be the date of death.  I do not see any logic or wisdom in taxing him for capital gains when, in fact, he does not part with the property.  Suppose a man holds a property in fee simple and he disposes of two-thirds, one-third to his wife and one-third to his child, that is clearly taxable.  Suppose he keeps a life estate for himself the situation is not really changed.  Everything can be collected on death on the valuation and I have no objection to taking it for valuation purposes, but he should not be taxed on the one-third he is holding merely because there is a change of name.  If he were selling it would be a different matter.  It cannot be postponed beyond his death.  We have strayed a little from Deputy Colley's original point, but all these things should be looked at as well.  If it is converted it really does not make a difference if he has all the incidence.  It is quite different though if he keeps only an annuity and gives rights to others.  This needs careful looking at.  It certainly intimidates me.  We are starting here on a course of legislation that will have very unforseen consequences.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I think the Minister should look at the simple trust as we know it.  I know there are the trusts Deputy de Valera talks about where an annuity is kept and the rest passes. Where a man allocates a third to his wife, another third to his son and keeps a third himself I cannot see how he could be subjected to capital gains in that simple type of trust.  It is different in the case of the more sophisticated type of trust that Deputy de Valera was talking about.  I think it would be ludicrous to subject a man in a simple trust to capital gains and exempt his wife and son.</P>

      <P>There is a danger here of losing sight of the wood for the trees.  Could I suggest to the Minister in his consideration of this that he would remember this, which was the basic point I was trying to put: we should not impose a tax on an arrangement whereby a man retains, whether through a settlement or otherwise, an interest in property which he has unless failure to do so would open a large scale loophole for the evasion of tax.  That is the simple proposition I put, which I think would be acceptable to both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a danger that this subsection may in fact be doing just that, applying capital gains tax to property which a man is in fact retaining simply because instead of owning it absolutely he would thereafter own it under a trust.  Unless that kind of arrangement creates a loophole there is no justification for applying tax to it.  There is a danger that not only we but the Revenue Commissioners and the draftsmen may be losing sight <Col N="1746" /> of the wood for the trees.  The Minister ought to reconsider this subsection in the light of that.  He has undertaken to reconsider it and I am asking him to bear this in mind, which is the basic principle put by this side and indeed by Deputy Belton.  Would the Minister bear this in mind in his reconsideration of subsection (2)?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>This makes it all the more imperative to have a change in the wording I referred to earlier about &ldquo;is a disposal&rdquo; and about confining it to the operation of this capital gains legislation.  If these provisions are to apply to settlements, whether made before or after 1974, and if the wording &ldquo;is a disposal&rdquo; is to be retained it seems to me that subsection (2), for example, could certainly affect liability for death duties in cases that are subject to them.

We are not dealing with settlements created before the appointed day but we are dealing with the disposal of property after the appointed <Col N="1747" /> day.  Some of them might take effect as a consequence of settlement made before the appointed day.</P>

Could the Minister provide in regard to the settlor in retaining the part he retains, the liability did not accrue until his death and that then the account could be balanced between all the acts and not to tax the whole lot at the one time?

There is this provision here:</P>

      <P>There could be.  The trustees will then be treated as the nominees of that person and any subsequent <Col N="1748" /> transfer of the property by them to him will not mean a future capital gains tax charge.  The manner in which this result is achieved by the subsection is to treat the trustees as disposing of the property and immediately re-acquiring it as trustees for a consideration equal to its market value at the date when the beneficiary becomes absolutely entitled to it.</P>

      <P>This subsection reads:</P>
      <P>On the occasion when a person becomes absolutely entitled to any settled property as against the trustee....</P>
      <P>I take that to mean that when the trust falls in, if some person becomes entitled as against the trustee the trustee becomes defunct.  In other words, the person becomes absolutely entitled to it.  Am I right so far?  That is a common enough case.  If there is a trust and then one person becomes absolutely entitled to the property the trust virtually ceases and the trustee falls out.  Am I right in taking that meaning?</P>

      <P>It will be disposed of by the trustee to him but if it is to be deemed to be disposed of by the trustee for the purposes of this Act it is attracting a special tax.  It seems that what is being said so far is that where there is a case of settled property which falls into one ownership and the trustee becomes discharged that circumstance is to be deemed, for the purpose of this Act, as a disposal by the trustee to the person absolutely entitled within the meaning of this Act and attracts tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to make my point on subsection (9) I must read the subsection:</P>
      <P>If any amount of capital gains tax assessed on the trustees, or any one trustee, of a settlement in respect of a chargeable gain accruing to the trustee is not paid within six months from the date when it becomes payable by the trustees or trustee, and before or after the expiration of that period of six months the asset in respect of which the chargeable gain accrued, or any part of the proceeds of sale of that asset, is transferred by the trustees to a person who as against the trustees is absolutely entitled to it, that person may at any time within two years from the time when that amount of tax became payable be assessed and charged (in the name of the trustees) to an amount of capital gains tax not exceeding the amount of capital gains tax chargeable on an amount equal to the amount of the chargeable gain and, where part only of the asset or of the proceeds was transferred, not exceeding a proportionate part of that amount.</P>
      <P>I have another point to raise on the subsection but the first one is, how is a person assessed and charged in the name of the trustees?  What precisely does that mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary liability here would lie on the trustees in these cases.  They might pass property to the beneficiary.  It is primarily designed as a tax avoidance clause to ensure that on the winding up of a trust liability to tax is not avoided. This is done by empowering the Revenue Commissioners to assess and charge the beneficiary on the amount of the capital gains tax applicable to the assets which were held by the trustees and by the trustees transferred to the beneficiary.  Such an assessment may be made within two years from the time the tax charged <Col N="1753" /> on the trustees became payable.  The tax charged is on the trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but what I am interested in is how is a person assessed and charged in the name of the trustees, in other words, the beneficiary.  How is he assessed and charged in the name of the trustees?  What does that mean in practice?  How is it done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The charge is on the trustees and is chargeable on the trustee assets if the trustees transfer the assets to others.  It still remains a tax which is payable by the trustees. The trustees cannot avoid the liability simply by transferring their assets to the beneficiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You could have a situation in which a beneficiary might have certain allowances and certain rights of his own and possibly losses of his own on other property which would be outside the trust.  They could not be set off against the liability which arose on the original trust which was being broken up.  That is the reason why we speak about the charge being in the name of the trustees.  There will be no more right to offset anything against that liability other than what already existed within the trust itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The form of assessment would be issued to the beneficiary, Mr. X, in the name of So-and-So, the trustee&mdash;is that the way it is done?  I am questioning this because I do not think I have ever seen a phrase like this in legislation before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say I have any more familiarity with the usage than the Deputy because I have not, but he will see the necessity for doing it in this Bill.  If it were a tax charged against a beneficiary whom we will call B, and the trustees are A, the tax charged is against B, and B might be in a position to claim certain <Col N="1754" /> allowances which would not be available to A as the trustees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be achieved by a different wording.  I am slightly concerned at the technical problem which may arise on foot of this phrase of charging somebody and perhaps suing him in court in the name of the trustees.  The Revenue Commissioners may run into a little difficulty with that.  I would urge the Minister to have it reconsidered.  If the only point involved is to ensure that the individual cannot claim his personal allowances in the way of losses, and so on, that might be achieved in some other way.  However, that is a matter for the Minister and his advisers.</P>
      <P>I want to refer the Minister now to the phrase immediately following those brackets.  In the context it reads &ldquo;...that person may at any time within two years from the time when that amount of tax became payable be assessed and charged (in the name of the trustees) to an amount of capital gains tax not exceeding the amount of capital gains tax chargeable on an amount equal to the amount of the chargeable gain...&rdquo; I think the Minister will agree that that is somewhat unwieldy, to say the least of it.  What I want to know is if that portion coming after the brackets is equivalent to the amount of capital gains tax so assessed on the trustees. Is that what it means?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It also says that it cannot exceed the amount equal to the amount of the chargeable gain.  I would find it hard to think of circumstances in which it could exceed such an amount.</P>

      <P>Subsection (1) says that an individual shall not be charged with capital gains if the amount on which he is chargeable to capital gains does not exceed £500.  This seems to state that he will not be chargeable if he is chargeable.  The words &ldquo;chargeable&rdquo; used in both contexts seem to be wrong.  In this regard I should like to refer the Minister to subsection 1 of section 17 which refers to a gain not being a chargeable gain in certain circumstances.  How can a person be chargeable and not chargeable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is chargeable under section 5 (1) which states that the total amount of chargeable gains accruing to the person chargeable in the year of assessment shall be subject to capital gains tax.  We cannot ignore the charging section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a chargeable gain.  All gains are chargeable gains unless certain allowances are given and in this section we are stating what the exceptions and reliefs are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct.  Section 5 defines what is a chargeable gain and it goes on to state that if that gain does not exceed £500 <Col N="1758" /> it is not to be collected.  However, Deputy Colley is also right when he refers to the wording used in this section.  Would it not be better to state that the individual shall be exempt from payment of capital gains tax for the year of assessment?  The distinction is that section 17 (1) concerns property while tax is under consideration in section 16.  I believe a compromise can be reached by an acceptance of Deputy Colley's point and using the words, &ldquo;shall be exempt from payment&rdquo;, instead of, &ldquo;shall not be chargeable to capital gains&rdquo;.  That would remove the ambiguity.</P>

      <P>I can recall being reprimanded as a student when I said there was always virtue in compromise and I was asked if that was universally true.  In the light of experience I can say it is not universally true. There are some matters upon which one cannot compromise.  I am not saying that this is one of them.  Section 5 imposes a charge on all gains and the only allowances given are losses which may be set off against gains.  The only argument between us is whether the words &ldquo;an individual shall be exempt from payment of tax&rdquo; should be put in instead of &ldquo;an individual shall not be chargeable to capital gains tax&rdquo;.</P>

If a man had capital gains of £450 and was not chargeable but if he had shares in which there was a sudden boom after his death, would the capital gains be limited to those accruing before death?  If the words &ldquo;before death&rdquo; were not there, it is quite clear that if the estate were sold in the week after death <Col N="1760" /> capital gains would be payable on the year of assessment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 20 in the name of <Col N="1761" /> Deputy Colley.  Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 are cognate and might be discussed with amendment No. 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 18, lines 18 and 19, to delete &ldquo;consideration for the disposal&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is fairly fundamental to this Bill.  It is to assess capital gains tax on the amount of the gain rather than on the amount of the consideration for the disposal. In this Bill and particularly in this section we are making the criterion for chargeability the amount of the consideration.  I understand that in the capital gains tax legislation in Britain, the criterion is the amount of the gain.  I would suggest to the Minister that this is a more logical approach and that a number of anomalies can arise by accepting the approach in the Bill of basing the criterion on the amount of the consideration.  As an example, under the Bill as it stands, a person might buy a farm for, say £10,000 and might sell it for £45,000. The amount of the capital gains tax he would pay on the £35,000 gain under the Bill is nil.  But, on the other hand, a person might buy a farm for £45,000 and sell it for £55,000 and be liable to capital gains tax on the £10,000 gain.  This arises because the amount of the consideration is the criterion used in the Bill for assessing the basis of the capital gains tax.  I suggest it is more logical to approach the liability to capital gains tax on the basis of the gain rather than on the amount of the consideration.  The very nature of the tax itself, given to it in the Bill, is capital gains tax. Surely a tax should be levied on the gain.  If one gets oneself into the area of the amount of the consideration, quite a number of anomalies can arise.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept the change that is involved here in assessing the tax on the gain.  It seems to me to be not only more logical but, perhaps, more equitable if, in fact, it is a capital gains tax with which we are dealing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I am unable to agree to accept the amendment because it would play into the hands of the exceedingly wealthy and confer no benefit on the ordinary person.</P>
      <P>For instance, under section 17, there would be no charge on the disposal of a chattel where the gain, as distinct from the total price, was £2,000.  Under section 26 any person on retirement from business would be free from capital gains tax if the consideration did not exceed £50,000. Deputy Colley seeks to substitute gain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to discuss with the Minister the question of the thresholds but the Minister will appreciate that what I am at here is the principle of whether the assessment should be on the gain or on the consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That does put a different complexion on it because the amendment seeks the deletion of &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; and the substitution of &ldquo;gain&rdquo;.  Let me just deal with the implications of Deputy Colley's amendment.  Under section 27 a disposal within the family would be free of capital gains tax if the gain did not exceed £150,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was well aware of that when I put down the amendment but I thought the Minister was the person to decide the thresholds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the important thing in dealing with capital gains tax is the gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is the profit we are seeking to tax.  The major argument with regard to capital gains tax is that it is analogous to income.  A gain in certain situations is analogous to income and tax is imposed on income according to the size of the net income, not the gross income.  To some extent I suppose it <Col N="1763" /> could be argued that &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; should be regarded as the gross figure but we are taxing here the net profit made and not the gross profit.  It is the gain which represents the net profit.  I think the gain is the most important element to try to determine, and to tax that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is because there could be a situation in which one could have quite a sizeable amount which would avoid tax were one to adopt the proposals suggested. For instance, in the case of a disposal of firm or business, the amendment would almost eliminate capital gains tax in many of those cases.  Taking the proportion of gain into consideration at say, 20 per cent, a firm or business disposed of for up £75,000 might not be taxed at all.  If the rate of gain taken into consideration was 50 per cent, the value of the disposal could amount to approximately £300,000.  I fear that the adoption of the amendment would put outside the charge quite wealthy people.  They could arrange their affairs in such a way that a fairly rapid turnover of the assets would avoid liability to tax at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the pay related principle here, as I understand it what Deputy Colley is saying&mdash;I do not think the Minister feels very strongly against it&mdash;is that the exemption should apply to the capital gain rather than to the amount of the consideration.  That is the fundamental point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the tax should be levied on the whole principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has done that in section 16.  He has given an exemption on the capital gains tax. We come then to section 17&mdash;I already touched on this point&mdash;and under subsection (1) the gain accruing by the disposal of an asset not exceeding <Col N="1764" /> £2,000&mdash;that is, the moveable asset&mdash; will not be chargeable.  I am wondering if a better approach would not be if the Minister decided a suitable threshold at which he would exempt in the same way as he exempts under section 16&mdash;it will probably be a higher level&mdash;in other words, to attach the tax to the capital gains.  That is the first point.  There is a kind of change of philosophy between these two sections and that bears out what Deputy Colley said.</P>
      <P>The next point is something the Minister said.  After all, what matters is the gain.  That is what the Minister is after.  It does not matter whether it is a chattel being disposed of for less than £2,000 or property unexempt being disposed of for £2 million, in both cases there is a standard for assessing and charging a capital gain. If the Minister charges according to the same standards and then brings in a measure of exemption he will get all his gain on the £2 million and he will exempt the equivalent of the £2,000.  It is a question of principle of approach here.</P>
      <P>To recapitulate, in section 16 the Minister adopts the principle of charging but giving an exemption where the tax chargeable does not amount to more than £500.  In section 17 (1) he changes his approach. Under that one will be chargeable to capital gains but, if the capital gains tax does not exceed £500, under section 16 one is exempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

But under this section it is related to the amount of disposal and, if the Minister is right in his point that he is interested only in the gain, then by continuing to relate to the gain he could get the same effect and there will not be that confusion in the £2 million case.  I think that is the net point at issue.</P>

      <P>Once the consideration is a known, stated thing it is readily identifiable and, for reasons of administration, there is a great deal to be said for specifying that items of consideration should be looked at rather than gain.  If it is gain one has to look at every transaction to see wherein a gain evolved at certain separate levels but, if one takes consideration, one does not have to look at every transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make it clear that this and the cognate amendment I have down were designed to get at this principle of dealing with gain rather than the consideration.  As I indicated, I did not attempt to set new thresholds in each of these cases because, if the Minister accepted the principle, he would set new thresholds himself and, in order to assess them, one would have to have a good deal of information available probably only to the Revenue Commissioners.  Certainly it would not be available to me.  In so far as the Minister suggested these amendments would create all sorts of huge exemptions, while he is technically correct, that is clearly not what is involved here.  It is the principle that is involved here and, if the Minister thinks about it, I suggest he will find it is more logical, avoids anomalies and even finds the kind of evasion that would arise under section 17 (2) (a) where tax is being set off against consideration.  That is completely illogical. I did give an example of one anomaly that arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of administration, the Minister says it is easier to deal with consideration.  I suggest that in order to find out the consideration you must know the gain and it does not really matter from the administration point of view whether one goes for consideration or for gain, you <Col N="1766" /> still need two items of information, original value and disposal value.  You know both of these whether you are going on the basis of consideration or on the basis of gain and, that being so, I do not think there is any administration advantage to suggest there is a great deal of logical advantage and control in this because, if you want to give the exemption, you must determine the exemption in relation to the gain.  If you determine the exemption in relation to the consideration it is totally unrealistic and you could have a situation in which somebody dealing with a transaction under £2,000 could have a much bigger gain as against somebody dealing in a consideration much greater than £2,000. Yet, the Minister is exempting one and not the other and, under subsequent sections where the same principle is applied, you get much greater anomalies like the one I illustrated of the man making a gain of £35,000 in one case being exempt from tax and, in the other case, a man making a gain of £10,000 is liable for tax.  These various anomalies can be avoided if one accepts the principle of these amendments of working on the basis of gain rather than consideration.</P>
    <P>I suggest it is illusory to think there is any administration difficulty in going for consideration and the acceptance of the principle of going for gain rather than for consideration gives much greater control in regard to exemptions and means you can pinpoint precisely how much exemption you will give whereas under the provisions of section 17 and other similar sections you really have no control over the kind of exemption you are giving because you are relating it to the consideration whereas the tax is, in fact, on gain so that to exempt on the basis of consideration bears no relationship to what should be the basis for the tax.  I suggest, therefore, that the Minister ought to accept the principle of these amendments.  I do not think there are any great problems from the point of view of drafting.  There may be some consequential amendments needed and, of course, the exemption limits would have to be changed if we were adopting <Col N="1767" /> this.  I suggest that the Bill would be far more acceptable and far more logical if those amendments were accepted.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dowling gave me notice of his intention to raise the method of compiling unemployment statistics on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald had two questions today seeking information in relation to the number unemployed.  It is regrettable that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government are not aware of the number of people unemployed.  The Government should be ashamed of themselves if they know the number of unemployed and will not tell us.  If they do not know, they should also be ashamed of themselves.  It is pathetic to think there are so many people unemployed and the Government admit they do not know the number.</P>
      <P>It is impossible to take corrective action if one does not know the full extent of the problem involved.  The Government use the live register which gives a figure of approximately 103,000 people unemployed.  Last week there was an increase in the unemployment figure of 1,200 people so a very serious situation faces the country.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to give the full facts to the people.  They should ensure that the large number of people unemployed at the moment have something to look forward to in the future but when they do not know the full facts no corrective action can be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did the Government tell the captains of industry and the people they brought together last week?  The trade unions need to know the full facts.  The Government do not know how many professional people are out of work.  They do not know how many of those who have recently left school are unable to obtain employment. <Col N="1768" />  The hide-and-seek game they have been playing for the past two years must be brought to an end. There must be realism in their approach.  Is it a panic situation when they are now relying on the information that comes from the statistics office which is passed on to Deputies in the House?  We want to know the full facts.  When we know them we can make suggestions for corrective action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am waiting for one even now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to know the full facts so that we will have a clear picture of the situation.  We will then know if the plans put forward by the Government or the Opposition will meet the situation.  We saw last week where some of the people still in employment were offered pianos in their paypackets but people cannot eat them.  People are now asking how many will become unemployed in the future.  Some weeks ago they saw the sign outside the Mansion House: &ldquo;Good Government at Work&rdquo;. People passing by were glad to see that somebody was at work.</P>
      <P>What is the situation now?  The Government are not working and they do not know what the unemployment situation is.  They have no plans to provide employment for those people. There are many wrecked homes today in the Parliamentary Secretary's constituency, in my constituency and in many others because the Government failed to assess the situation a year ago and take the necessary remedial measures.  Every day we interview distressed wives and depressed husbands. The Government do not know those people are unemployed.  It is about time they revealed the true story.  The Parliamentary Secretary interviews people and he does not know they are out of work because they do not appear as digits on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the future hold for the people still at work?  Shortly many of them will join the dole queues.  Do the Government intend taking any remedial action in the future?  Nobody can assess the situation when we are <Col N="1769" /> not given correct information.  The temperature of the unemployed is 103 at the moment and everybody knows what happens when one exceeds that. Reports recently have indicated that the figure on the live register will swell in due course.</P>
    <P>Workers in CIE and the ESB are concerned about the situation because all the small factories have gone to the wall and we will now have to deal with the large industries where the scale of unemployed will be more substantial.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary let us know the full facts so that we can examine the situation fully?  If the Government have not got the full information in relation to this matter, there must be many other things on which they have not full information.  When Deputies seek information it is the duty of the Government to give it to them.  Unfortunately, they have not got the information for us notwithstanding the fact that they have more advisers than any two Governments in the past to keep them up to date on the unemployment situation.  The Revenue Commisisoners could tell them how many people are out of work.  There are places besides the Central Statistics Office they can get information from.</P>
    <P>We demand that the House and the country are told the truth about the situation.  The people can then assess the Government in relation to their promises and activities.  They are either untruthful in indicating to the House that they do not know the full facts or if they know then this hiding of the true situation is something we will have to examine in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our reason for raising this matter on the Adjournment is to appeal to the Government to show, even at this late stage, a concern for the critical unemployment figures which we believe they are not showing at present.  I am sorry that it is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach who is here tonight.  I am sorry that the Ministers with responsibility for employment are not in the House to hear Deputy Dowling and me speak on a problem which we believe should get top priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1770" /> Deputy Desmond, speaking on a motion some weeks ago, referred to the live register.  He said the figures were misleading and, with his type of arithmetic, succeeded in reducing the figure of 102,000 odd, as it was then, to an approximate figure of 80,000. He did not add on the out workers, the professional people or the school leavers.  Of course they are also unemployed people.  The number of unemployed is, in fact, far greater than the figure of 103,500 which available statistics tell us it is.  There is no point in any Government spokesman telling us that the live register has been compiled in the same way as it has been for many years, that the same system is employed now as was employed by Fianna Fáil.  It must be the duty of any Government and any office holder to strive continuously for improvement and for the compiling of more and more statistics to enable them to proceed with corrective action and positive steps to remedy this terrible situation.</P>
    <P>According to statistics we have at present 35,000 more people unemployed than we had at this time last year.  That means 35,000 more people without wage packets plus their wives, children and other dependants. There is a growing lack of confidence. I do not want to stand here wailing continuously about the situation but I appeal to the Government to do something positive.  During the emergency years, under the leadership of Éamon de Valera, we were kept out of involvement in a world war.  At that time we had a problem with regard to essential supplies for our people. Positive steps were then taken by the Taoiseach and Government at that time to deal with the situation.  A Minister for Supplies was appointed to handle the critical situation.  I submit that at present we have a problem that needs the attention of a Government Minister.  The two men primarily responsible at present, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Labour, have many and varied duties.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been giving particular attention to oil development off our coast and this is <Col N="1771" /> understandable because it is his duty to do it, but perhaps by giving so much attention and time to that he may not have had time to devote to the current employment situation.  The same applies to the Minister for Labour who has responsibilities in many fields and many time consuming duties.  Would the Government consider the appointment, on a short-term basis at least, of a Minister with responsibility for employment?  This is a frightening unemployment figure. Such a Minister could direct his attention to a number of things but I would suggest that he should, first of all, look at the ailing industries situation. In my opinion, there are four, four that are vital to our economy and vital if we are to maintain jobs.</P>

      <P>I accept that fully, Sir, but I also submit that the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be assuming the responsibilities of the Chair in this House particularly when it is something that does not suit himself.  Perhaps I may go back to the live register in the few minutes remaining to me.  I believe that the Minister appointed should have responsibility for compiling proper statistics, for an analysis of the register and the industries affected by the register, the workers who remain outside the live register, such as the out workers and professional people.  I would refer to something that is going to affect professional people in a big way.  It is the appointment now, even by semi-State bodies, of contractors from another country at a time when our employment figures are as they are.  Before the Ceann Comhairle rules me out of order for saying this I want to say why I am saying it.</P>

      <P>I may have disagreed with the Chair at times.  I am <Col N="1773" /> sorry, Sir.  I never intended to bully you.</P>
      <P>My reason for referring to this is that this will create unemployment for many professional people.  I am sorry the Parliamentary Secretary has introduced heat to this debate.  I did not intend it.  I wanted to join with Deputy Dowling in saying that I believe there is no concern being shown by the Government as was instanced again today.  In their two-and-a-half years of office they have not taken steps to have the live register embrace all sections of our people so that vital statistics might be available to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald foresaw and attempted to deal with in advance, but of course without success, the simple answer to the point of view implicit in the question raised here this evening, namely that there is something faulty in the method by which these statistics are collected and made available.  The system has been the same certainly since I came into either House of the Oireachtas nearly six years ago and since I was getting those things through the post.  The system has not changed since then.</P>
      <P>While I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald that every Government must seek to improve on those gone before&mdash;this Government have an up-hill task in that respect&mdash;I must emphasise that everything said by Deputy Dowling, in so far as it implies that this Government were embarking on a new exercise in concealment, was totally unfounded and disgraceful.  Through the Department of the Taoiseach this Government have published statistical returns in exactly the same way as they have been returned by any other government.  I repudiate and reject any suggestion that figures issued by this Government are &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; in any way or that they understate or state wrongly the picture.  If, because of the way they are compiled, they do not convey the entire picture they are not in any way the result of this Government having changed the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> The statistical position is the same as we found it but, no doubt, we will get around to improving it as we hope to improve many other areas.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to emphasise to the House that the employment situation throughout the western world is disastrous.  It is so bad that the greatest democracy on earth, as they proudly proclaim themselves and which has more than 200,000,000 in-inhabitants&mdash;the USA&mdash;are not able to issue a measly 1,000 visas to students who would wish to spend a couple of months in the States this year.  That situation is reproduced on the same scale in other parts of the western world.  We cannot expect to escape scot free.  Figures quoted and questions asked in this House every week reflect our failure to escape this situation, but these figures are a by-product of the administrative process of dispensing welfare benefits to people who are without work.  The figures cannot be accurate in respect of people who, for reasons of their own, do not present themselves for benefit.</P>
    <P>There must be a large number of people who, although not presenting themselves for benefit, are the victims of the labour situation.  But there is nothing new about that.  School leavers seeking jobs will not be reflected on the live register but there is nothing new in that, either.  It was the same ten years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference is that there were opportunities then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But is not the situation much more serious now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Order, please.  Deputies must allow the Parliamentary Secretary to utilise his ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that a condition of employment scarcity is one in which it is much more difficult for school leavers to find employment, because they are competing with people who have lost their jobs, but the idea that the figure would be inflated dramatically if we were merely <Col N="1775" /> to publish the numbers of school leavers who will be looking for jobs shortly is wrong because it is a figure which could not be substantially greater, but which may be smaller in comparison with some years than those that have gone before.  Unless these figures for school leavers have accumulated with large numbers of school leavers from previous years who have not been employed at all they could not be significantly greater in number than the number of school leavers who sought employment last year or any other year.</P>
      <P>However, since the Deputies have gone to the trouble of raising the matter on the Adjournment I can tell them that, although the figures for persons not yet at work are not collected weekly&mdash;they are collected at the five-yearly census period&mdash;in April, 1971, the number was returned at 13,318 of whom about 11,500 were in the 14 to 19 age group.  I would not say that is an exact equivalent of the numbers seeking work but it will give the House an idea of the order of magnitude of the extra figure, but it is an extra figure which would have been approximately of the same order as in previous years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not wish to hear this, but I can tell him that the figure is one which cannot be inflated by the appearance of disemployment or by the appearance of redundancy and cannot be affected by the fact that people are suddenly out of work because these are people who never were at work.  In order to make <Col N="1776" /> that figure significantly greater than it is now the Deputy would have to allege that there was a build up from previous years so great as to make this figure this year significantly greater than in other years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There are last year's 11,000 so that this year there will be 22,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case I heard being made here this evening. Of course, school leavers who are not yet employed will have to be added to the total unemployment figure.</P>
      <P>The other point raised was that of professional people.  This category, for census purposes, includes those listed as higher professional, not counting those in religious occupations, together with a further category who are employed gainfully as directors, managers and company secretaries. the figure totalled 21,000 plus in 1971. For the purpose of this debate we may describe those as professional but if the Deputy wishes to have it on a narrower basis the figure would sink to 6,000.  A figure of 21,000 is a very small proportion of the number of employed people, and a relatively higher percentage of disemployment among that category would not affect substantially the total for the very large number of unemployed people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>The numbers of persons who would return themselves as out of work in the census of 1971 would be included in the global figure for that year and this was 64,692.  When compared with the live register for the same period which was 59,000 plus about 5,500 additional persons who at that time were not on the register because of the employment period order, there is an extraordinary correspondence of about 64,800.  That suggests strongly that any category such as that envisaged by the Deputies of professional or self-employed people who are disemployed must be tiny.  I have no doubt that there are such persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1777" /> In the first couple of years I practised at the bar I appeared in full panoply of wig and gown and I earned roughly £2 a week.  I do not know whether that would be called unemployment or under-employment.  I certainly regarded myself as a professional person, but I was making far less than anyone now drawing assistance would be drawing. It may be that there are social reasons why somebody who regards himself as a professional person would not register himself or describe himself as unemployed even if he is making something which is barely keeping him alive. Whatever the reasons may be, the numbers of professional people likely to return themselves as not at work in a census period are minute, or appear to be minute, so far as we have been able to calculate them from the figures I have given.</P>

      <P>The Government are as well aware as Deputies opposite&mdash;better in fact&mdash;that unemployment is perhaps our primary problem.  Deputy Fitzgerald urges the creation of a separate Ministry to handle this problem.  I do not think that is feasible but I recognise the good intention behind the suggestion.  I say that merely to enforce my submission that the Government are in no way complacent or neglectful in regard to this problem.  It is a horrible problem.  It is one which we face in common with other countries.  Trying to make it out as being worse than it is is similar to spreading demoralising propaganda when people are at war.  I am sure Deputies opposite would not wish to do that.  I hope the putting down of this Question on the Adjournment is not to be understood as that.</P>
