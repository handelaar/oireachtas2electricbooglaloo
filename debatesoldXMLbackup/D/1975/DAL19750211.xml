    <P>9.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education the present position of the boards of management of County Wexford vocational schools which were created by order dated 22nd March, 1974; whether these boards are now acting autonomously; and the nature of the agreement under which the vocational education committee agreed to dispense with the necessity for the confirmation by them of the acts of the boards of management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Boards of management were set up in all of the vocational schools&mdash;eight&mdash;in the administrative area of County Wexford Vocational Education Committee.  Each board consists of four members of the vocational education committee and two representatives elected by the parents of children attending each school.</P>
      <P>I assume that the agreement mentioned by the Deputy is the 15-point agreement between the County Wexford Vocational Education Committee and the Teachers' Union of Ireland which was signed on behalf of both parties on the 5th April, 1974.  The first point of the agreement referred to the establishment of boards of management for the vocational schools in the committee's area and the performance of the committee's functions of administration of each school through the board of management.</P>
      <P>As regards autonomy, my order of the 22nd March, 1974, made under section 21 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, authorised the appointment of boards of management in the County Wexford Vocational Education Committee area and provided in paragraph 5 thereof as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> that the Committee having agreed to dispense with the necessity for the confirmation by them of the acts of these Boards of Management, sanction is hereby accorded under Section 21 of the Act to dispensing with the necessity for such confirmation.</P>
    <P>A vocational education committee cannot devolve on any other body their overall responsibility in matters of finance and in the organisation of the scheme, so that the extent of the autonomy of boards of management relates to day-to-day management and their authority in matters of finance and general organisation is subject to such conditions as the committee may decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a great deal of confusion, misunderstanding and frustration among the members of the boards of management and among members of the vocational education committee in County Wexford about the powers of the boards under this order made by the Minister?  Is this order still in force?  Clause 5 of the order says: &ldquo;the Committee having agreed&rdquo;.  Is the Minister satisfied that the vocational education committee then in existence in County Wexford did agree?  A number of members said they cannot remember ever agreeing. What powers, if any, have these boards of management?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very long question, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they complete autonomy, partial autonomy or no power?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point raised in the Deputy's supplementary question related to confusion.  I agree there has been some confusion in this case but I hope it has been cleared by my reply.  His second question asked if the vocational education committee then in existence agreed to this.  Yes, they did agree in Room 114 of Leinster House.  He then asked if the agreement was still in force.  Yes it is. The fourth part of the supplementary related to powers.  The powers delegated <Col N="8" /> to the boards of management are broadly those set out in point 1 of the agreement of 5th April, 1974. They relate to the general management of the school, ensuring that the school is suitably maintained and equipped and ensuring that classes are held on time and in accordance with the approved time table.  In order to enable the boards to exercise their powers under points 1 and 2, the vocational education committee shall allocate a sum of money annually to each school.  It will be a matter for the vocational education committee to lay down appropriate guidelines in relation to the expenditure of this money by the boards of management.  Any expenditure proposed by a board over and above the sum allocated to them by the vocational education committee shall be referred to the committee for approval.  All expenditure of the boards must be properly vouched for. It is always open to a vocational education committee to refer back to a board of management for clarification or amplification or with a request for reconsideration, any proposal made to them by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that in effect, the boards of management in County Wexford have full autonomy over the management of the schools, other than in regard to expenditure? I take it that money is allowed at the beginning of the year for the use of these boards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of this further attendance will be determined by the requirements of each individual <Col N="9" /> school.  In this connection may I draw the Deputy's attention to paragraph 3 of the circular letter No. 1/75 which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In relation to paragraph (c) of the proposals, dealing with supervision of pupils, including supervision at &ldquo;games&rdquo;, it is desired to confirm that there are two aspects in question in the matter of &ldquo;leeway&rdquo;, firstly, the difference between a teacher's time-tabled class contact hours and the agreed maximum of 23 hours per week and, secondly, hours such as may be available from further attendance of teachers at school beyond their time-tabled class contact hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that if there are 18 class contact hours and 23 agreed hours, there will be five hours reckonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the band of hours to be worked by all teachers is within 21 to 23, with an average of 22 plus.  Therefore, a teacher would need to be time-tabled for more than 18.  We are now talking about vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference between the 21 and 23 would be the operative hours.  Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Noonan</b> asked the Minister for Education why games are no longer regarded as a class subject in vocational schools which have not got a physical education teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the agreement relating teachers' hours per week to class contact on the teaching of subjects <Col N="10" /> of the approved curriculum, it was not considered appropriate to include time spent on games for the purpose of reckoning such class contact hours except in the case of a teacher of physical education.  This does not prevent games from being time-tabled in any school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the general outcry by various vocational committees as a result of this agreement?  Does he not agree that this is taking education back 50 years by relegating physical education and games as an unimportant subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that there was a substantial reduction in hours granted to the teachers and it is incumbent on me as Minister to see that a reasonable number of class contact hours is maintained for that section of the teaching profession. It is not necessary or desirable that games should be excluded.  Indeed, games can be included in the way suggested in the previous question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the subject of games is every bit as important as academic subjects? Would he not agree that by laying down this principle he is relegating the role of games in education?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of that, does he not realise the serious plight of young people in smaller vocational schools throughout the country whose teachers have devoted so much time to their physical education and would he not review his decision in the light of this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is not trying to give the impression that I am preventing teachers from taking <Col N="11" /> games in small vocational schools around the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise the Minister is not the only party to this agreement, that there are two parties to it.  However, in view of the representations now being made to him and in view of the representations being made throughout the country as a result of this agreement would the Minister not contact the TUI again with a view to ensuring that games again becomes a subject on the curriculum of all the schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has on previous occasions evinced sympathy towards the problem of dyslexia and indicated that it was proposed to have in-service training courses for teachers to enable them to identify dyslexia.  Has any progress been made in this regard?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to in-service training for teachers to qualify them in remedial teaching very significant progress indeed has been made.  The number of primary teachers who attended the special course for remedial teaching in 1971-72 was 25; in 1972-73 this rose to 50; in 1973-74 it was 100, and this year 147 primary teachers are taking a special course in remedial education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which, I think the Deputy will agree, is significant progress. In relation to post-primary teachers the equivalent figures are 1971-72, 25; 1972-73, 50; and 1973-74, 79.  These are related to remedial problems in general.  They are not solely confined to the identification of dyslexia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep in mind the special need to have the problem of dyslexia identified and to proceed with much more comprehensive in-service training courses in this regard?  It sounds impressive to quadruple the number of these courses but when you realise that there are still only 100 teachers involved it is pretty inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Each successive output from the course is continuing to operate in the schools and each new course represents an addition to the total volume.  There are technical problems in relation to both the identification and the remedy of dyslexia on which I think academic opinion is not as yet totally unanimous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his Department, in consultation with the Association of Remedial Teachers, will structure a course for slow learners in post-primary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is open to individual schools to structure courses suitable for the needs of slow-learners and to submit them to the Minister for approval.</P>
      <P>Needs vary from school to school and from area to area and especially from pupil to pupil.  It is doubtful whether one single prescribed curriculum for slow-learners would be suitable for every single school.  Apart from the question of meeting needs it might be regarded as &ldquo;second best&rdquo;. However, this is a matter which is being studied.  A number of curriculum development projects are being carried out and while these are not concerned primarily with slow-learners the results should yield useful information. A number of individual schools have submitted, and have had approved, programmes for slow-learners. One of these programmes is being studied in some detail.  In addition the Department initiated, last May, a survey of all second-level schools, providing remedial education in order to obtain information on numbers needing and receiving help, the type of methods and programmes used and the materials used, and so on.  The data obtained and being processcd at present should be of considerable help in reviewing the situation of remedial education at second level.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>All second level schools which have recognised teachers engaged in remedial education may receive grants to enable them to purchase test materials for use in remedial education work. <Col N="15" /> Vocational education committees and the boards of comprehensive and community schools may, within the limits of their sanctions, spend money on recommended materials for remedial education purposes.  The Department have provided these authorities with lists of recommended equipment and materials.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I have that information but I gave, in response to an earlier question, information as to the second-level schools which have remedial teachers recognised. In relation to the first part of my reply, those schools will be receiving the test material.  In relation to the money for material, I do not have that information.  I imagine the grant might not necessarily be a recurrent grant because when material would be bought in one particular year with the grant given in that year it would last for a number of years. Therefore, the reply for any given year might not be as significant as it might appear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that the grants for the purchase of this remedial equipment are made on the basis of so much per pupil involved, that the amount is completely inadequate and that remedial teachers generally would assert at any time that they cannot really carry out effective remedial teaching without equipment and that the position in regard to the provision of this equipment is completely unsatisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The committee on the form and function of the intermediate certificate examination submitted among their recommendations a proposal for a school certificate for every secondary pupil leaving school.  This proposal, as well as the others made by that committee, is being considered at present and the position of the slow learner will receive careful consideration in that context.  Again I would stress that it is not considered entirely desirable that there should be too much formal separation of the slow learner from his fellow pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Minister has already stated that a certificate will be given to the normal learners, showing the degree and the subjects attained, would the Parliamentary Secretary not think that it is especially necessary to give such a certificate to the slow learner, whose achievement may be much greater although he may not have reached the same standard as the normal learner?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he proposes to take appropriate action to provide accommodation for young people who are on trial or who have been sentenced for serious offences so that proper medical treatment may be given them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Accommodation for boys under 16 years of age on remand awaiting trial and for whom the courts consider custodial care is necessary is provided in the remand and assessment centre at Finglas, County Dublin. Over a 12-month period this centre can accommodate about 360 boys.  Accommodation for girls on remand is available in six smaller training centres situated in Dublin and elsewhere. Proper medical services, including psychiatric services, are available in all these centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special schools at Lusk, Finglas and Clonmel provide a rehabilitation programme in an educational setting <Col N="18" /> for boys found guilty of offences. Appropriate facilities for girls are provided in the training centres already referred to.  Again, all necessary medical care is available in these schools and centres.</P>
    <P>There are some offenders whose behaviour results from emotional difficulties or personality disorders and for whom treatment in a medical rather than an educational setting is indicated. Residential provision for such children is in the hands of the health authorities.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the assessment and treatment facilities for young offenders is being approached as part of a programme of fundamental change in the system of child-care which will entail the enactment of new legislation.  As the Deputy will be aware, a full-time task force is working on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>May I state, arising from that reply, that I think we are more interested in the children who cannot be accommodated rather than those who can be accommodated? We read harrowing stories each week of youngsters being sent to places like the Bridewell because there is nowhere else to send them.  What immediate steps are the Government taking to remedy this appalling situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The long-term needs in this area are being examined and identified as part of the work of the task force set up by the Minister for Health. I indicated last year, as an interim measure, the capital provision in the immediate future which is being provided for the extension of the assessment and special school facilities. There is a problem in quantifying exactly how many extra places are necessary because to some extent it has been the experience in other countries that a sort of Parkinson's Law operates, that the more places you provide, they are inevitably filled by the courts.  That should not be so in some cases where many of these children could be better cared for in the community. There is a need for better information as to exactly how many places in each of the categories are needed, namely, remand, remand for assessment <Col N="19" /> and residential care subsequent to sentence.  This is a matter which, as I said, is being examined by the task force, on which my Department are represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give a guarantee that in future itinerant children or, indeed, any children, will not be sent to the Bridewell when they get into trouble?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy probably has a particular incident in mind which occurred in the last two or three weeks.  The problem here was that this was a group of eight children and the assessment centre, which is primarily designed as an assessment centre rather than as a remand centre pending sentence&mdash;most children on remand are remanded at home on the bail of their parents&mdash;was not in a position to cope with what was an unprecedented event for it, eight children together, who were already in a coherent group of young people acting together in a particular way. They were not in a position to cope with such an unusually large group coming together and unfortunately all of them could not be accommodated in Finglas.  Two are now accommodated there.</P>

      <P>The comprehensive study of the entire youth service which I undertook is at a very advanced stage at present.  However, youth policy, as the Deputies will appreciate, cannot be determined in isolation but must be seen as part of a wider educational context including adult education, sports and recreational development.</P>
      <P>Decisions will be taken within a wider context, but I feel that until the youth policy document is available for discussion it would be inappropriate to comment further on the policy at this stage.

      <P>That is why the Parliamentary Secretary has been interrupted so many times in the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy O'Kennedy has just stated is not correct. However, I shall not go into that. This is not an easy area in which to formulate a policy.  There is a great diversity of organisations and needs which have to be taken into account. The subject itself presents obvious problems in finding concepts and realistic targets for a policy and one must have such identifiable targets, I believe, for a policy reassessment if one is not to waste public money.  One basic decision I have taken is that <Col N="23" /> youth services should not be isolated either conceptually or administratively from analogous services for other age groups, such as sport and adult education. It immediately follows from this that we also have to have some idea of future plans in such analogous areas as well if we are to see how youth services fit in.  I am glad to say that I have a &ldquo;sport for all&rdquo; policy now at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that the non-publication of the comprehensive policy is holding up progress. This may be somewhat overstated.  We already operate a flexible grant-in-aid scheme for national and voluntary organisations to one or other of which nearly every youth club in the country is affiliated.  There is nothing stopping groups within those organisations coming up with new schemes at this minute so long as they are within the budget of their own national organisation. Indeed, I have been successful in getting reasonably improved resources for this grant-in-aid scheme this year and also in introducing a new flexibility in the form of a new subhead for aid.  I have also made it clear that this scheme will continue and that the initiative of voluntary organisations will remain.  However, a problem does arise where individual local groups look for special aids outside the context of this grant-in-aid scheme, or where structures are sought to be set up which would create precedents elsewhere.  To be fair to everybody, one needs a comprehensive policy in that situation and that is what I am engaged upon.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary accept that various youth organisations, the National Youth Council and the National Federation of Youth Clubs, and all organisations concerned with youth are gravely concerned and have expressed consistent dissatisfaction with the Parliamentary Secretary's failure to promote and publish his youth policy?  Does he accept that?  Does he accept that they speak on behalf of the youth and they have expressed total dissatisfaction and frustration because of the Parliamentary Secretary's failure to produce a policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of interpretation.  We can only interpret their views.  It appears that the Parliamentary Secretary does not share the dissatisfaction which the rest of us apprehend from the youth organisations. That is regrettable.  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any justification for associating the youth programme with other areas, such as the adult education programme and the recreation programme and, in particular, may we take it now that, if the Parliamentary Secretary fails to take any step in the area of recreation, which he has, in fact, failed to do, that his justification for not taking any further steps <Col N="25" /> towards implementing a youth policy now that he has informed us that all three areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree progress has not been made.  Very significant progress has been made in increasing the level of the grant-in-aid last year to youth organisations and in obtaining this year in very difficult economic circumstances considerably improved aid for the same scheme in the 1975 Estimates.  When the policies become available it will be evident, I think, and I hope the policy will be available in the not too distant future, that they are in many ways interdependent.  The Deputy will agree, I am sure, that it is undesirable that we should have a sort of youth ghetto apart from those provisions in other areas.  He will also agree that in many areas the input into youth policy is an educational one given in an informal setting during leisure time and in that way it is analogous to both adult education and, indeed, to the educational aspect of sport promotion.  I am anxious to try to see these proposals accomplished to the full.  I really merely wish to see a rough outline of where the other schemes are going so that we can go ahead on a more precise and definite basis.</P>

      <P>In relation to what Deputy Colley has said, although I appreciate that we have not absolutely fixed this day fortnight, we cannot fix any date substantially later because the Second Stage of this Bill must be taken within 20 sitting days of the passage of the budget.  The last day on a normal sitting schedule when this Bill could be read for the second time would be 4th March.  Deputy Colley will appreciate that there is not a lot of elbow room if a fortnight is allowed before the Second Reading debate begins and that will effectively limit the amount of time which the Second Reading debate can occupy. Perhaps the Opposition Whip and I can talk about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out on another occasion in the House, there is a good deal of financial legislation to be got through including, in particular, the Finance Bill.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out there is a statutory time limit but nevertheless we cannot tolerate a recurrence of what happened on the last Finance <Col N="38" /> Bill.  Therefore, the Minister, and the Government, may have to give consideration to the statutory time limit in this year if the business cannot be got through in the time.  I think it should be accepted that whatever happens we are not going to rush through the Finance Bill, or any other Bill, without adequate consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, and I think the Government generally accept, that the time limit under which we are now operating is perhaps restrictive and we may have to have a look at it again. However, it is there at the moment.  I should like to point out yet again that the unseemly all-night sittings to which the Deputy has referred meant that the section of the Finance Bill which has now left us in this situation was not discussed on the Committee Stage.  This was the consequence of an agreement, a perfectly clear agreement about the disposal of the Committee Stage, not having been adhered to.  I see no reason why that should happen in regard to the Second Stage which is all we are concerned with now and I see no reason why the Committee Stage should not get ample discussion after Easter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is not resuming at the moment.  I should like to recapitulate the position in regard to the amendment we are discussing.  The amendment is designed to distinguish between the rate of capital gains tax charged, on the one hand, on quick gains and, on the other hand, charged on gains arising over a long period of years as a consequence of hard work, effort and skill on the part of people with shops, or businesses of any kind, or indeed, in certain trades or professions.</P>
      <P>While the Minister has not actually said it, he has implied in some of his comments that administratively this would create many difficulties.  I would suggest that this is not so because, in regard to any gain, it is necessary for the Revenue Commissioners to determine the date of acquisition of the asset and the date of disposal, in order to calculate the gain.  Therefore, the application of a sliding scale depending on the length of time for which the asset was held should present no real difficulty at all to the Revenue Commissioners.  I would suggest that administratively there is not a problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the principle involved, I would suggest to the Minister that if he went outside his house and asked people he met casually on the street what their views were on the principle involved, he would find that the great majority would favour the principle involved in this amendment.  That fact is reflected in the discussions in this House.  As the Minister knows, two members of his own party have spoken in favour of the principle involved. We have not heard from the <Col N="41" /> Labour Party in this debate at all. We do not know what their views are, despite the vociferous nature of their comments in the past.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the principle of what we are suggesting commands wide acceptance.  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that we on this side of the House are not tied to the precise terms of this amendment, to the number of years involved, or the rates of tax involved.  I feel very strongly that, if this capital gains taxation is to have any semblance of equity, we must build into it a rate of taxation calculated on the lines we have suggested.  There is widespread support for this and no great administrative difficulty in doing it.  Therefore, if the Minister resists the principle he must produce a convincing case, which he has failed to do so far.  I would again ask the Minister to accept at least the principle of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said on a number of occasions and I repeat that the proposal from the Opposition of a multi-rate system for the level of different rates of tax would produce a system of taxation which would be cumbersome, complex and confusing.  It would be full of anomalies and inequities.  The benefit of the anomalies and inequities of the system would accrue mainly to the well-to-do and would lean heaviest on people who were forced by family circumstances to realise assets in the short rather than the long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that, since we announced that the rate of capital gains tax would be 26 per cent, we have received virtually no complaints at all from the financial community or from anybody who would be liable to the tax.  Once the tax rate is lower than that in comparable countries, and particularly in Britain, the taxpayers appear to be content.  At no time has there been any agitation for a multi-rate complex system such as is now proposed from the Opposition benches.  The system they propose would certainly irritate taxpayers in general.  It would impose upon taxpayers quite considerable administrative costs, costs of engaging professional <Col N="42" /> advisers, and so forth.  To accept the amendment would be to accept as desirable in taxation, complexities, irritants and costly administration which we believe should be avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every step which would be necessary in order to avoid the difficulties generated by this system would tend only to make it more complex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What difficulties are there?  Could the Minister spell them out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Other countries have had the experience which I am describing.  I will give a few examples just to indicate who I have in mind. First of all, the system would almost certainly provoke people into planning artificial transactions to achieve for themselves more favourable results. The differences in rates which could apply to transactions, maybe within a matter of days, could vary by 4½ per cent, 3 per cent or 1 per cent.  For instance, a gain made on an asset held for seven years would be taxed at 23 per cent, while one which was held for just one day more than seven years would be taxed at 18½ per cent.  You could have a situation in which two transactions within a week of one another could be charged at different rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, a gain of £100,000.  The tax liability on that £100,000 could vary by as much as £4,500 in a matter of 24 hours.  Any system of taxation which would allow such a gain to be made by people who remained locked into a situation to take advantage of a more advantageous rate of taxation, to my mind would be clearly undesirable.  In the kind of situation we are dealing with in most cases it would not be just a matter of one simple gain but a multiplicity of gains by people who had become expert in locking themselves into a situation which gave them tax advantages.  Even if the scale of rates <Col N="43" /> were to be arranged more uniformly than in the proposed amendment, varying by 2.6 per year, the tax variation on a gain of £100,000 could be as much as £2,600 in a matter of 24 hours.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the treatment of losses.  Under Deputy Colley's amendment, people would be encouraged to fabricate losses in order to set them off against future gains. Supposing a person had losses of £1,000 available to set off against gains and, in the year in which it was proposed to set them off, that taxpayer had gains of £1,000 chargeable at 26 per cent, gains of another £1,000 chargeable at 9½ per cent, gains of another £1,000 chargeable at 3 per cent, and gains of another £1,000 chargeable at 1 per cent, against what gain would the £1,000 loss be set off?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the well-to-do who could afford to postpone making gains would be the people who would be able to juggle the loss situation to set off the loss to their own advantage in a way which would mean that they would be able to get relief from the tax not open to people of lesser means.  These few examples&mdash;and they are but a few of many illustrations which could be produced to show the complexities and inequities of the system&mdash;should suffice to indicate that there is a great deal to be said for having one rate, a uniform rate which is known to everyone and which avoids situations of locking into assets and holding assets in order to avail of more attractive tax concessions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the reasons which the Minister has given for refusing to accept this amendment in Deputy Colley's name. Quite honestly, I do not accept any of the reasons he has given.  I do not believe he accepts them himself because the rather tentative and vague way in which he put them forward indicated to me that his heart is not in the objection, that he sees the equity of the amendment and the equity of the principle involved and he really has no argument against it. Unfortunately, we have run into this <Col N="44" /> problem with the Minister many times.</P>
      <P>Excellent suggestions that are put up from this side of the House are turned down for the sole reason that they are proposed by this side of the House.  As Deputy Colley said, a number of the Minister's own backbenchers have spoken in favour of this principle and they see that it is just and equitable, far more so than what the Minister wants to push through.  The Minister is digging his heels in.  The reasons he purports to give are not really serious reasons at all.  He speaks of a difference of 3½ per cent or 4 per cent between certain of these rates and says that, if somebody realises his gain in just under seven years and somebody else realises it in just over seven years, there is a difference in the rate of tax payable.  Of course there is; that is the whole point of this.  But what the Minister does not advert to is that the man who realises his gain after one week, an-in-and-out merchant, has to pay only the same rate of tax as a man who has held the asset for 20 years. That is far more inequitable than the fact that someone, just before the seven years expires, pays a slightly higher rate than someone who sells just after the seven years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there must be differences each year, but the real inequity is that someone who holds an asset for only a month or even a week pays 26 per cent, which is the same rate as somebody who holds for 20 years.  We have in mind particularly the type of person who has built up a business over a 20-year period and who, perhaps, in doing so has never drawn out of it the income to which he is entitled for his labour, drawing only sufficient to keep himself and his family going.  He could justifiably have drawn considerably more but did not do so because he knew he was building up an asset which would be available to him in his later years.  Now, that has been swept from under him&mdash;he pays 26 per cent tax on it on top of income tax and so on.  That is grossly unjust.  It may well have happened in relation to many people in this country in the past month, that without putting money outside the country, there has been a <Col N="45" /> sudden rise in equities on the Irish Stock Exchange from a very low base between early January and early February and somebody who invested £10,000 a month ago in certain Irish equities could well have made a capital gain of £6,000 or £7,000 on his investment within a month.  Even though he has made his money in a month without lifting a finger he is asked to pay only the same rate of tax as a man who has spent 20 years building up a business and never engaged in speculation of the type that is popularly understood by the quick-in-an-out operation.</P>
    <P>This is totally unjust and the Minister knows it, but he has in no way answered the arguments put up by Deputy Colley.  It is entirely unjust that an in-an-out operator who made a lot of money in a month pays only the same rate as a man who has laboured all his life in a business and who is penalised in his latter days because he realises the gain which his own labour &mdash;not luck or speculation&mdash;built up over the years.</P>
    <P>A further argument in favour of a decreasing rate over a period of years, as suggested here, is the one that arises because of the inflationary situation in which the country is plunged at present.  On an earlier amendment of Deputy Colley's, even though he had no answer to it in principle or otherwise, the Minister caused his backbenchers to walk through the Lobby to vote down something they knew was right.  Presumably, he will ask them to do it here also.  But if he accepts this amendment, even in principle, the Minister can undo some of the harm which forcing backbenchers to walk through Lobby did last week as regards inflation, because the longer one holds an asset the more the capital gain is inflated and the more nominal is the gain.  Even on the principle of inflation, apart from the anti-speculation principles involved in our amendment, a sliding scale of this kind is just and equitable.  If you hold an asset for 15 years and make a paper gain of £10,000, everybody knows it is not a real gain and that the asset is worth no more in real terms when you realise it than it was 15 years <Col N="46" /> earlier when it was worth £10,000 less.</P>
    <P>Therefore this amendment has the double benefit of being anti-speculative and of penalising more heavily those who make a quick kill with no effort on their part, and penalising less heavily those who have spent a lifetime working to build up a business. It has the twin advantage of being at least to some extent a safeguard against inflation in that the inflationary element in the gain is less heavily penalised by this sliding scale which Deputy Colley proposes and which the Minister has to agree&mdash;because there is no argument against it&mdash;is right in principle.  I cannot accept the Minister's argument about administrative difficulties.  There are none. The Revenue Commissioners have to decide when the asset was acquired and when it was sold and it is only a question of subtracting one from the other and finding how many years that is and applying the appropriate rate of tax.  That is not beyond the capabilities of the Revenue Commissioners. There is no greater administrative problem involved than if you had a flat rate.</P>
    <P>A capital gains tax is not a bad thing in itself.  It is regrettable that the country is now going to be plunged into a form of capital gains tax which is clearly inferior and less equitable than it could be.  This arises because the Minister is impervious to all arguments and all reason.  Anyone to whom I have spoken, no matter what his persuasion, is in no doubt that, above all else, the two things that need to be put into this Bill as it stands are: an anti-inflation clause and a sliding scale of rates.  The beauty of the sliding scale is that in itself, to some extent, it is also a built-in anti-inflationary measure.  If the Minister is interested in equity as between different taxpayers he can accept this.  We are not asking him to accept it precisely as it is; it can be changed.</P>
    <P>I understand we are now discussing amendment No. 6 because amendment No. 5 is technically out of order because the rates incorporated in it are higher than those the Minister proposes. <Col N="47" /> We are not allowed to propose a higher rate of tax.  But, had amendment No. 5 been in order, we would have preferred it to amendment No. 6 because we consider it to be more equitable.  It may not be open to us to amend it on the lines we wish.  But it is open to the Minister to bring in an amendment on that basis either now or on Report Stage.  If he does not do that, he is saying in effect that the man who made a quick killing on the stock exchange in the past week or month should pay only the same rate of tax as a man who has sweated for the last 20 years to build up a business and who did not derive any income from it other than for his immediate needs.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I can only hope that the Minister will see reason, because everyone else sees the reason in these amendments and how much more beneficial they are.  It is a pity the Minister for Finance digs his heels in, even though he has no case whatever to make.  It is done out of sheer obstinacy.  Obstinacy like this on the part of a Minister is not a way of achieving good legislation in this House or anywhere else.  He should be prepared, as is everyone else&mdash;and as he must be privately&mdash;to accept the principle involved of a sliding scale over a period of years to hit the quick speculator hardest and to hit least of all the man who has put in economic effort and brought about economic benefit to the country as well as to himself.  Also if the Minister would accept the principle of the built-in anti-inflation element inherent in this sliding scale, we could save an awful lot of argument.  We would have a much better Bill and a more equitable capital gains tax that would be much less resented by people who have worked hard all their lives but which would be less welcomed by quick speculators who are capable of making £5,000 or £10,000 in a week on the stock exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> When we reported progress here last Wednesday I thought the Minister would have another look at the Bill and come back with some suggestion <Col N="48" /> today.  I believe that the Minister, in his heart, agrees with the principle of our amendments.  I am convinced that any fair-minded Minister would see the merits of what we put forward.</P>
      <P>We have said time and time again during the discussion of this Bill that we are in agreement with the principle of capital gains tax.  In the matter of short-term gains, we have said we would be prepared to go for a higher level of taxation.  The Minister said here last week that capital would be tied up until after the period of 15 years had elapsed in order to avoid capital gains tax.  I do not believe that will occur at all.  I am quite convinced that the opposite will be the case now. The average person engaged in speculation will have no intention of waiting for 15 years to elapse in order to avoid capital gains tax.  I feel the people who will hold out now are companies that have run down&mdash;I am speaking about 20 or 30 years from now&mdash;businesses that are not doing so well and who find themselves faced with this taxation when they sell.  There is every likelihood that such people will hang on too long, something that will not be beneficial to themselves or the country. It would be much better if they were encouraged to sell their property to somebody who could operate it properly than to hold out with this taxation hanging over them.</P>
      <P>I think I mentioned already the fact that when shares go down on the stock exchange very few people sell. The same thing will happen here. People with this capital gains tax hanging over them will hold out, firstly, because they may not be in a position to sell.  The arguments put forward by Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley are very realistic.  We are talking about people who have had property for 25 to 30 years.  We know that other people when they retire, be they in the public service or in semi-State bodies, do so on two-thirds, or whatever may be the case, of their salaries as pension. We are dealing with a group of people who have built up assets over, perhaps, a term of 20 to 30 years.  This constitutes their life's work, much of their own and their families' effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> When such a person reaches the age of 50 or 55 or even 45, he wants to retire.  Remember, his retirement pension is built into the assets he has created over the past 20 or 30 years. That is the type of person about whom I am concerned.  During the development of that business he will have drawn very little salary from it.  In the initial stages he will not have had it. Perhaps he was subject to a large overdraft, and by the time that overdraft had been paid off and the business built up there were very few assets available from that business he had built up for his wife and family.  Such assets constitute also a means of a pension, although I know such a person can now take out an insurance policy for that purpose.  I should like to know if that man can claim a loss in 20 years' time by virtue of the fact that he has not taken out an insurance policy.  Undoubtedly any asset he may have would constitute part of such an insurance policy or pension scheme which should be deducted from those assets.</P>
    <P>We are asking that such long-term investment be exempt.  We are not asking the Minister to adopt the exact format of our amendment.  We are asking him merely to accept the principle of it&mdash;that after 15 years such long-term investment will be exempt from income tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned several complications which could arise.  I feel such complications would be overcome were our amendment simplified somewhat.  Indeed if one considers the Irish and English Stock Exchanges at present, if there is an upswing in the economy there is every likelihood that shares will rise by 20 per cent to 30 per cent.  That could happen over the next 12 months or two years.  People getting in on the ground floor now with capital available for investment will make a quick kill.  That type of person will be subject to the 26 per cent rate of taxation just as will be the person who has developed his business or company over the years.  That, is most unfair. The Minister, or any rational person, examining the situation must take that into consideration.  When this Bill goes through the House in a few <Col N="50" /> months' time there will be people making massive profits on the stock exchange, selling shares within two years and getting away with a tax of 26 per cent.  On the other hand, the person who has dedicated his time and energy to building up a business will be subject to the same rate of tax.  The Minister is certainly making a mistake in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know it is probably the Minister's idea to simplify the Bill.  I suppose it is the best type of taxation if it can be operated, but we must not simplify the Bill to the extent that we burden the taxpayer.  It is the duty of the Minister for Finance to introduce an equitable Bill, especially with regard to the taxpayer.  The Revenue Commissioners are a competent section of the community who have dealt with the tax code down through the years. I am quite sure they would be well able to handle the complexity of Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>Therefore I would hope the Minister would take another look at this and consider the type of person for whom we are seeking a concession. We do not see it so much as a concession as their entitlement.  There should be some distinction drawn between the short-term gain of 12 months to two years and the long-term of 15 to 20 years.  We have not spelled out for the Minister how he should do so, but I am sure it is within his competence and that of the Revenue Commissioners to draw up some formula whereby he can say: &ldquo;If you come into this country and make £100,000 or £200,000 in 12 months, you are certainly going to pay more than a man who has spent his lifetime, working and employing people here&rdquo;: We want the Minister to accept that principle.  I hope the Minister will consider an amendment for Report Stage, because if he does he will be improving this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised the Minister has not softened on the arguments that were put forward here last Thursday.  I thought that if he got a chance at the weekend to think over our arguments and the arguments which Deputy Dockrell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Deputy Collins and Deputy Belton had put forward on Second Stage, he would have seen the light and realised how these provisions would hit family businesses.  I also thought that those three gentlemen, feeling frustrated that the Minister had refused to take their advice in the House, would have gone to consult him during the week in his room.  I presume they did and that he is still adamant in not accepting the amendments.</P>
    <P>On the Stock Exchange in the past month the index has ranged from 146 to 280 at the moment, nearly double the amount of money.  It is grossly unfair that a person could spend £20,000 on shares and make practically the same amount of money by selling them and he pays only 26 per cent, while the farmer or businessman who is at a grave disadvantage has to pay the same tax.  I know a farm which was valued back in the mid-forties at £6,000; today it is worth about £200,000.  The land is still the same.  There is no improvement.  I would say it was as good in the 'forties as it is today.  There is no real gain there, although the Minister would see a profit of nearly £200,000 and would be collecting £50,000 tax on that.</P>
    <P>Where there is a family business, there should be an allowance over the years.  We have proposed 15 years, which we think is generous, but if the Minister thinks it should be 20 years, we shall accept that.  There is no comparison between the gain there and the gain that takes place on the Stock Exchange, where the man does not do one iota and has no say whatever in the business in which he has invested. That is why we thought it was fair to have a much higher rate for the Stock Exchange speculator, while the family business should have no tax imposed, particularly if it is in existence for 15 or 20 years.  There is nothing in the Bill to accommodate the farmer, the businessman, the factory owner, who has retired on medical grounds.  The doctor tells him he is not able to continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am on the amendment. I am trying to point out that this man, because he is physically unable to carry on his business, has to sell it with a view to investing the proceeds in an insurance company or on the Stock Exchange to give himself and his family a livelihood.  It is not fair that a man or a widow who is unable to carry on a business should be charged that same rate of tax as a speculator.  In every financial provision here the widow always got preferential treatment.  There is no such recognition in this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned here that there could be anomalies, that in 24 hours a man could save £3,500 or £6,000 tax, just because it came to the end of the year.  This principle was already accepted.  In the case of a person getting married, he gets an allowance for the whole year right back to the previous 6th April.  Where a child is born a minute before midnight on 5th April, he gets that allowance for the whole previous 12 months.  The Revenue Commissioners have already been dealing with that over the years, and I have never heard any of them criticising that as being difficult to work.  It would be exactly the same here if the Minister accepted our principle of having a different rate each year with a sliding scale which would be going up.  We have set out the guidelines, but if the Minister thinks a different sliding scale would be easier to work, we should be prepared to accept that.  However, we want the Minister to accept the principle of a sliding scale with freedom from income tax after 15 or 20 years, which is the normal lifetime of a business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has met many shopkeepers in his Dublin constituency, self-employed people, who have had to give up their business through failing health and who have nothing to fall back on when they become ill and when they are short of pensionable age.  They may have no income whatsoever, and it is pitiable to have to say to them: &ldquo;The only prospect open to you is home assistance or the disabled person's allowance&rdquo;.  If it is a rented shop <Col N="53" /> there would be no asset, but a business, if sold by the owner, would provide an income for him over the years of bad health until he would go to his reward.  However, the Minister proposes to charge him 26 per cent tax on an amount which in many cases would barely be able to keep him going over the years, particularly with inflation as high as it is at present.  We all know of people who have retired and invested money either in the bank or on deposit or in shares, who are on fixed incomes. What looked to be a very good income for those people four or five years ago is reduced considerably in value.  They are feeling the pinch now, and the Minister is doing nothing to help them.</P>
    <P>The Minister will get his 26 per cent from these people just as he will get it from the person who sells his business merely because he regards himself as having reached the peak in that business and would like to go into something else where he could speculate further.  The quick-gain merchant should be taxed heavily but there should be exemptions in respect of old established family businesses.  I trust that the Minister will reconsider the matter in the light of the arguments we have put forward and that he will introduce an amendment, if not on this Stage, on Report Stage, so as to ensure justice for the people for whom I have expressed concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the reasons put forward from both sides of the House and, I would suspect, despite the Minister's own common sense, it would appear that this amendment and the principle involved in it are not to be accepted.  All I can say is that we have done our best to point out to the Minister what is involved.  Now, we can only accept the fact that the Minister regards the quick profit merchant as being in exactly the same position as the man who works for years to build up his business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is logical to conclude from the contents of the Bill and from the resistance to the amendment we have put forward that this is the Minister's <Col N="54" /> view but it is not our view and neither is it the view of the people generally. We have no desire to hold up discussion of this Bill unnecessarily but we regard this amendment as vitally important to the whole idea of trying to arrive at an equitable capital gains tax system.  We have put forward all the reasons why the amendment should be accepted.  We have been agreed with by Deputies from the other side who spoke on the matter but the Minister is obdurate in his opposition to it.  With respect, the reasons he is giving are unconvincing, to say the least.  We cannot do any more but it goes on record that the view taken by the Minister is as I have outlined.  Unfortunately, however, that is not much help to those who will have to operate under what is clearly an unjust Bill, a Bill based on wrong principles.  We have done our best.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (3) the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided always that the foregoing rates of tax shall be halved where an individual disposes of an asset which is, or is an interest in, an asset used for the purposes of a trade, farming, profession, office or employment carried on by the individual, or as the case may be by the individual's family company, other than a private residence to which section 25 applies, and the individual, or the individual's family company as the case may be, has owned the asset throughout the period over which the gain was made and the individual was <Col N="57" /> throughout that period engaged full-time in the trade, farming, profession, office or employment or was a full-time working director of the family company as the case may be.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment was, as can be seen from the use of the plural word &ldquo;rates&rdquo; in the first line, designed to apply to the rates proposed in the previous amendment.  However, it can still be applied by using the singular &ldquo;to the rate of 26 per cent&rdquo; provided by the Minister in the Bill.  The basic proposition involved in this amendment is that in the case of a capital gain made by somebody who had been engaged full time in a trade, in farming, in a profession, in an office or in employment or as a full-time director in a family company, that where the capital gain arises on the disposal of an asset consisting of the businesss, farm and so on as I have described, the rate of tax would be halved.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to acknowledge in a tangible way the difference between capital gains arising on the sale of a person's business or farm and on the other hand, a capital gain arising in any other way, particularly from the kind of quick profit operation we have been discussing on the previous amendment, but, indeed, in any other way.  We believe that a capital gain arising on the sale of an asset which consists of a person's business in which the person has been engaged full time is clearly in a different category from any other capital gain.  The Minister may say that he has made provision for this in the exemptions in sections 26 and 27.  I would not be in order in discussing the details of those and all I want to say at the moment in that regard is that the provisions in sections 26 and 27 show that the Minister acknowledges that there is a difference between one kind of capital gain and another but that it does not meet a situation as fully as it would be met if this proposal to half the rates in cases of the kind I have mentioned were to be accepted.</P>
    <P>It will be noticed, perhaps, that the amendment, as drafted, applies to a person who is engaged full time in a trade, farming, profession, office or employment.  It seems to me that the provisions in sections 26 and 27 do <Col N="58" /> not go that far.  I cannot be sure of that and we will have to ask the Minister to spell that out when we come to the section so, perhaps, he will do so when he is dealing with this amendment.  On the face of it it seems to me they do not go as far as this amendment goes and while that might appear to mean that this proposal is more liberal than sections 26 and 27 in practice I think it is more restrictive because it seems to me that the exemptions proposed by the Minister would apply to these various kinds of assets whether or not the person involved was engaged full time in them except in the case of a family company, whereas this amendment applies only where the person involved was engaged full time whether it was a family company or a trade or a farm or a profession and so on. I am not absolutely certain of the correct interpretation of sections 26 and 27 but I think that is so and I am drawing attention to the difference that arises.</P>
    <P>As I have said in regard to other amendments and as applies to all the amendments I have down, I have tried to indicate the principle involved in the amendment.  I have not endeavoured to cover every possible contingency in the drafting.  If there are contingencies which the Minister feels would arise if this amendment were accepted which would not be intended and would not be acceptable then, of course, it is possible to deal with that with the resources available to the Minister.  Again, we are talking here about the principle involved which is the application of half rates instead of full rates where a capital gain arises on the sale of an asset which consists effectively of a trade, business, farm, profession, or family company in which the individual concerned has been engaged full time. The Minister has already indicated that he accepts that there is a difference between that kind of capital gain and others and what we are urging him to do is to acknowledge that difference far more effectively than he does later in the Bill by accepting the proposition that in such cases the rate of capital gains tax should be half that which it is in other cases.</P>

      <P>We have provided quite generous relief for the person in business and people who have family businesses in sections 26 and 27.  We have provided this relief where the person disposing of the asset has been in business for a period of ten years prior to the date of disposal.  In defining what qualifying assets are, we also provide what the family company is and it has the meaning which Deputy Colley has in mind, that is, the genuine involvement of the person disposing of the asset.  There must be, in equity, a limit to any tax concession given and the concession which we have given, which puts a £50,000 limit if a person is disposing of an asset to a stranger and a £150,000 limit if the person is disposing of an asset to one of his own family, is generous by any measure. Those limits would allow a person to acquire quite a substantial benefit if the money was to be invested for the purpose of getting a pension and having regard to the fact that we have provided relief even above those ceiling figures, we would not consider it appropriate that a 13 per cent rate would be given across the board irrespective of the size of the asset being disposed of because this would mean that the greatest benefits would go to people with the greatest assets.  I do not think that is appropriate.  We have ensured that the vast majority of family businesses and family farms are outside the liability to tax.  I think that is a proper way of dealing with it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The Minister mentioned that the sum of £50,000 for a person over 55 years of age was very generous.  He should read what the Confederation of Irish Industry have said.  They consider that £50,000 is not adequate when inflation is taken into consideration.  If the rate of inflation continues as it is, £50,000 will probably not buy a local authority house in six years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were trying to differentiate here between two types of person&mdash;the person who invests a sum of money in a business and spends his whole life running it and the person who, <Col N="60" /> in partnership with another puts £20,000 or £30,000 into the business. They may decide to let it run itself, get the profits from it and, perhaps, sell it after a certain length of time. We thought there should be a distinction between both types of business.</P>
    <P>We believe there is merit in our amendment.  As Deputy Colley said, it shows in a tangible way that the person who runs the business on his own has given the fruits of his labour to it over the years.  On the other hand, people in companies just draw profits from them.  I hope the Minister will look at the amendment in a favourable light.  I think £50,000 is a ridiculous figure when we see the value of property today.  You can only secure very little for £50,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given an assurance that these thresholds will be adjusted from time to time.  The taxpayers, in the light of past experience, have no reason to believe that I will not honour my word or the Government will not honour the undertakings they have given.  We have already made adjustments in the thresholds of tax liability.  We need to compare the existing law and what the Bill proposes. Death duties are a form of capital gains tax because gains made by a person during his lifespan are not at present deflated in respect of the rate of inflation during that person's life but they are caught for estate duty on all assets above £10,000.  In certain respects if there is a widow and dependent children they are at different thresholds.  When one considers that a private house and its contents, all moneys, all accounts in banks, all savings and the business and every form of asset are caught at the moment for the full estate duty it is quite clear that this Bill is providing a very substantial alleviation to people in relation to their business assets and, indeed, all assets.  The whole will be exempt from capital gains tax.  The business assets will only be involved if there is a disposal of the business and the proceeds are not reinvested.  Even if they are disposed of and not reinvested, the rate will be 26 per cent and in some cases the assets will not be caught.  If they <Col N="61" /> are passing on to a member of a family and valued at £150,000 they will not be caught.  The sum will be £50,000 if it is going to a stranger with certain relief above that.  In contrast with the existing tax liability, we are providing tremendous relief by the abolition of death duties as and from April next.  This new tax, which will arise only when there is a disposal of an asset, is at a much lesser rate and will not impinge in the same way as the old tax on business assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister feels a comparison should be made between the death duty system and the system he proposed.  I am afraid he simply cannot confine the comparison to the effect of the capital gains tax because he has made it clear on Second Stage in relation to gift tax that in certain circumstances both capital gains tax and gift tax will be applied in the one case.  In addition, he proposes a capital acquisition tax generally which in many cases can be simply another form of death duties payable on death.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not abolishing death duties in that sense.  In addition to that, he proposes to apply a wealth tax.  If he wants to make a comparison, he has got to compare the whole package he proposes with the former system and not merely pick out capital gains tax legislation which we are discussing.  Apart from that point, I would like to point out in regard to the relief in the case of disposal to a family to which the Minister referred under section 27 of up to £150,000, he knows that in the vast majority of cases envisaged no money will change hands.  It will be the notional valuation of the property.  The father transferring the property to the son will not get £150,000 in return.  It is imaginary to talk about that as being a situation in which there is this very substantial relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned this could be invested and a very adequate pension got from it.  That might be true if you got money but, of course, in these cases you do not get the money. In the other section giving relief, where there is disposal of a business in which <Col N="62" /> a person has worked after he has attained the age of 55 and it is disposed of to somebody other than a member of the family it is proposed to give relief up to £50,000.  Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed to the rate of inflation and the Minister should not forget that the problems arising in this regard are very recent.  They certainly were not acute until after he became Minister for Finance.  I suppose the Minister realises, when he is talking about this relief for people who have been running a business for quite a number of years and have attained 55 years of age that he is talking about relief of £50,000 but he is also providing in another section of the Bill that you can win the Sweep, win £50,000 and pay nothing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because if you were to subject a gain to capital gains tax you would have to allow losses. As most people put out more money to make gambling wins it would end up in a situation in which there would be no gain at all.  This is international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that in the White Paper he proposed to apply this capital gains to Sweep winnings.  I must confess that I and other people thought of other explanations for its exclusion besides the one the Minister gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who wins the Sweep is not normally the kind of person who can produce evidence of large scale losses on betting, as the Minister well knows.  The fact is that in the case of someone who wins £50,000 in the Sweep he proposes that person will not be liable to capital gains tax but the big concession he is talking about is in the case of a man who has worked for years building up his business and who has reached the age of 55 and wants to sell: if he does sell and realises £50,000 he will <Col N="63" /> not pay capital gains tax.  When one contrasts these two cases one sees very clearly how much necessity there is for a real distinction between the kind of gains we are talking about in this amendment and other kinds of gains. One can see the necessity there is for a much greater distinction than is provided by the Minister, who treats that kind of case in exactly the same way as the case of the person who wins £50,000 in the Sweep.  The Minister has accepted in principle the distinction between this kind of gain and the others, but we are saying he has not done nearly enough in practice to recognise that distinction, although he has accepted it in principle, by the amount of tax and the rate of tax which will apply.  We are suggesting that in a case of that kind the rate of tax should be halved.</P>
      <P>I doubt if anybody would seriously argue that the situation in which one wins £50,000 in the Sweep is in any way comparable to the situation in which a person has worked for years building up a business, has attained the age of 55 years in order to qualify for the same kind of relief and exemption as the person who won the £50,000.  That illustrates very clearly the necessity for this amendment, the necessity for applying a much more realistic rate of tax in cases of the kind we have in mind here.  When the Minister was replying earlier he said that the reliefs proposed in sections 26 and 27 would apply to persons engaged in trade, farming, a profession, office or employment, or a family company which had been full-time engaged for ten years.  In all these cases a person had to be ten years engaged.  Is that what the Minister intended to convey?</P>

      <P>I do not want to pursue this too far, but the Minister will <Col N="64" /> have noted that in our amendment we are making it more restrictive than the Minister's proposal in so far as the person concerned has to be engaged full-time in the trade, farming, profession, office or employment, whereas in the reliefs to which the Minister referred the full-time requirement, as far as I can see, applies only to the family company.  I am not making any issue about that at the moment.  I am merely drawing attention to the fact that the amendment as drafted is quite restrictive.  It is not intended to be and would not operate as a loophole for people who should not be entitled to relief.  It is quite restrictive and is applicable to the person who has genuinely been engaged full-time in the business, in farming, or whatever it was.  In practice the amount of revenue involved will certainly not be enormous.  In principle it is very important that the Minister should give practical recognition by way of the rate of tax applicable to the distinction between this kind of capital gain, if one can call it a capital gain at all, and the other kind we talked about, including the extreme case of the person who wins £50,000 in the Sweep.  I would hope the Minister would see that treating these two kinds of cases on the same basis is both indefensible and untenable.</P>

      <P>The relevant comparisons here are not with the very few lucky enough to win the Sweep but with the people who actually own business assets.  I want to give a very simple example now to show the immense relief that will be given to the vast majority by these new capital taxation proposals.  Under the existing system, if a man were to die leaving a business valued at £150,000 to his widow the estate duty payable by the widow would be £67,500.  That would be a rare case.  As I pointed out earlier, under the present law, the home, its contents, bank accounts and everything else are caught.  Under our proposals, in the case of the man who leaves a business worth £150,000 to his widow, estate duty will be abolished and there will be no liability therefore to estate duty.  There <Col N="65" /> will be no capital gains tax liability in that situation and the exemption threshold under capital acquisition tax means there will be no liability to capital acquisition tax and, under the added wealth tax, the position will be that the tax will not amount to any more than £500.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Immortality is something man has not yet achieved, though it is something most of us like to dream about; one would have to have a lifespan of about 135 years before paying under our proposals the kind of estate duty to which people are subject at the moment under existing law.  This shows the unreality of the emotive criticism of many of our proposals.  As far as the vast majority of taxpayers are concerned they will be vastly relieved under our proposals.  There will be exemption from the existing estate duty and those who avoided estate duty will in future be called upon to pay a reasonable amount of tax from time to time. Under capital gains they will be required to pay 26 per cent of the gain when they dispose of their assets, and then only when they dispose of certain assets.  Gifts of money, homes and their contents will not be involved.</P>

The vast majority of humble Irish family businesses will get substantial relief under our proposals.  They will not be involved in any liability and the proposal by the Opposition to reduce the rate of tax from 26 per cent to 13 per cent is a relief, therefore, which would apply only to people who are unusually wealthy.</P>

However it is wrong to approach any taxation proposal as though the proposal involved some element of hostility or envy.  We are proposing a system of taxation which takes account of the ability of people to pay.  People who have these holdings are in a position to pay the comparatively reasonable rates of tax proposed and which will apply only in certain situations.  In the circumstances, I am sorry but I cannot see my way to accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>One would almost think the Minister was going to give away all the tax that will be collected by this capital taxation programme. The amount of estate duty collected at the moment is approximately £12 million.  Will the Minister tell us what he expects to collect in a year under the three capital taxation programmes &mdash;capital gains tax, the gift or acquisition tax and the wealth tax? If the Minister gave us this information we would know how the taxation will affect the country.  The three new measures he intends bringing in will give him ten times the amount of money collected under the legislation dealing with estate and death duties.  From the point of view of the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners the Bill we are discussing is particularly desirable in that it starts rather small but it increases because of inflation.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the reliefs granted under sections 26 and 27. Admittedly there are reliefs granted, but much more remains to be done. We should give preferential treatment to the family business.  In many cases the people involved did not take high wages in an effort to build up the business.  In many instances where there was a large overdraft the family slaved to make the business work and accepted a lower standard of living than might otherwise be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is necessary for businesses to expand, otherwise they may collapse.  It is not possible for them to stand still.  This is of benefit to the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="67" /> because if the firm concerned have to dispose of their assets the Revenue will get more tax.  There is nothing in the Bill that gives recognition to those who did not take a fair income from their businesses during the years.  In normal trade union conditions they would have been entitled to much higher salaries.  Special recognition should be given to family businesses, especially if they have been in existence for ten years.  These people should be charged at half the rate, as we propose in our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been rather selective in his example.  He chose a case, as I pointed out in an interjection, where there was no disposal under the capital gains tax and, therefore, the capital gains tax did not arise.  It would be more to the point if the Minister had chosen a case where disposal did arise and capital gains tax was applied.  On a quick calculation I make 26 per cent of £150,000 to be £39,000.</P>

I could choose an example under the existing death duty system of a widow with a large family and show there could be a large estate with no death duty payable. I could show that people would be far better off than under the Minister's proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many such cases I have come across.  This is despite the fact that the Minister did not increase the thresholds in his last budget. However, if I were to choose such an example it would not prove any more than the example selected by the Minister.  It does not help to choose selective and extreme examples. The kind of case we are talking <Col N="68" /> about in this amendment is the situation of a person who has been working for years at a business or a farm, who builds it up and who reaches the age where he has to retire.  What he gets for his business or his farm is the only source of money on which he can live in retirement.  That is the kind of case we are talking about, not the case where there is no capital gains tax paid.  That does not deal with the practical problems we are trying to cover here.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out previously, the amendment is drafted to be quite restrictive in its application but where it does apply&mdash;in the kind of case I have mentioned&mdash;we suggest the rate should be halved.  It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that in such cases we are giving relief up to £50,000 and that no capital gains tax is payable.  It is not sufficient for the reasons mentioned by other speakers and also for the reason I mentioned before, namely, that it is only putting it on the same basis as somebody who wins the Sweep.  That is not good enough in the kind of case I have mentioned.  I am not talking about people who are making quick profits on the stock exchange or from other kinds of business activity.</P>
      <P>I am talking about the person who is engaged full time in whatever the business is and who when he comes to sell it is dependent on the outcome for his livelihood thereafter.  That person in the circumstances we are talking about we suggest should be liable for only half the tax.  There is a strong case for saying that it should be less than that but we are only saying that it should be half the tax as compared with the person who makes his capital gain as an incidental to his business, his trade, his farming or who happens to win the Sweep.</P>
      <P>In my view it should be clear that the two cases are totally different and should be treated as totally different. I have not seen the Minister make any real effort to justify the treating of these different kinds of cases in the same way.  This is what the Minister is doing in the Bill as it stands and which he will continue to do if he does not accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>In my view there is a great distinction here.  I do not think they can be treated in the same way but the Minister thinks they can be treated in the same way because he proposes to do so in the Bill.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The amendment we have down on the inflation clause and this amendment are the most important amendments to the Bill.  I am surprised that the Minister has adopted this attitude.  I was not speaking politically when I spoke on the amendment on the inflation clause and I am not speaking politically now on this amendment.  There is a definite distinction between the short-term speculator and the long-term developer. If this Bill is put through in its present form it will result in bad law. In my view this Bill will encourage short-term speculation because there is no great benefit to be gained from long-term development.  There is no benefit to be gained by a person who devotes his time, his talents and his money to developing his business over a long period because the incentive of deriving some benefit from such a business in 20 or 30 years' time has been taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> During the next three or four years it will not be unusual to see short-term speculators making capital gains of £200,000.  Such people will be subjected to the capital gains tax but the man who runs a family business will be subject to a tax at the same rate even if he devotes a lot of his time and energy to expanding the business. A lot of these businesses have been expanded with a view to the proprietors retiring in 20 or 30 years.  If they do so now the Minister will take the same percentage of tax as he will take from the short-term speculator.  Many of those people built up their business with a view to retiring with sufficient assets to tide them over for the remainder of their life.</P>
    <P>Such capital gains will be made on the stock exchange because shares are at a low price.  A lot of gain will be made in the next few years because it is very difficult to sell today.  Those who are in this for short-term gain will pay their 26 per cent tax but they will only remain in business for a few years.  The man running the family business will not be inclined to put as much effort into the development of that business because he will always be conscious of the tax he will have to pay if he decides to sell the business and retire.  I am surprised that the Minister is not bringing in an amendment for Report Stage to differentiate between the short term speculator and the long term developer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not met us part of the way and has not seen the logic of our arguments.  A speculator who buys shares and makes £10,000 or £20,000 profit makes almost 100 per cent profit within at least a month. Such a person carries on his own business without employing anybody.  In the family business a certain amount of employment is given.  In small family industries a great amount of employment has been given over the years but this has not been recognised by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person who makes a quick gain should be taxed whether the gain is on the stock exchange or is involved in the purchase of land or house property. <Col N="71" /> There has been criticism of such speculation in the past few years because people have secured property by paying a deposit and, through legal wrangling, have held up the completion of the deal for up to 12 months. When such people realised that they had a buyer who would give them a quick and big profit&mdash;in some cases it was double the price&mdash;they completed the deal immediately.  Such people paid only 25 per cent of the cost price as a deposit and did no other work. Through legal wrangling they kept that individual out of his money until such time as they were able to sell it and make a huge profit.  Under this Bill, they are treated in exactly the same way as the person who has built up his business, his industry or his farm.  When he has to sell and retire on pension he has to pay the same 26 per cent tax as the other people I mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister should accept this amendment and, in the case of a family business, industry or farm, the rate should be 13 per cent as against the 26 per cent the Minister proposes to charge to all under this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for radical amendment of the proposals of the Minister for Education on the re-organisation of third level education.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In education genuine consultation with parents, school authorities, teachers and students will be introduced.&rdquo; These words are probably familiar to the House as point No. 9 in the 14-point plan of the Coalition Government.  A virtue is made of consultation. That is a &ldquo;quare one&rdquo; in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Provost of Trinity College, Dr. Lyons, is on record as having said that on this issue the Minister made a virtue of not having consulted universities in advance.  Professor Dawson of <Col N="72" /> the same university stated that in fact the Minister's proposals&mdash;or the Government's proposals as the Minister is very careful to point out, thus in a way taking some of the heat off himself&mdash;were inspired by political considerations. I want to quote from <i>The Education Times</i> of December, 26th, 1974:</P>
    <P>It would seem that the only consistent policy behind all the changes which the Government has made in the scheme amicably agreed between the National University and Trinity College is that of diminishing Trinity.  The full list of changes in the redistribution of Faculties are (a) that Trinity shall not be the sole centre of dental education in the State, (b) that Trinity shall not be the sole centre of university education in law in Dublin, (c) that the sole Faculty of Veterinary Education shall not be located in Trinity but in UCD, (d) that Trinity's Faculty of Natural Science shall, with that of UCD, be jointly controlled and (e) that while Trinity shall have a Faculty of Engineering Science it shall be &ldquo;without capital investment&rdquo;.  There are no compensatory changes whatever.  The NUI-TCD agreement minimised costs to the ratepayer, was fair to both UCD and TCD and was fully endorsed by both the Senate of the NUI and the Board of Trinity.  It seems clear that the Government has made a political, not an educational, decision.</P>
    <P>I do not need to say in this House how important an institution the University of Dublin is, of which Trinity College is the only college. I am not saying that we can accept what Professor Dawson said as being, in fact, true.  He is speculating, as we are all speculating, on what are the various activities which lie behind the proposals which saw the light of day on 16th December.  What I am saying is that, when the Provost of Trinity College and a senior professor of Trinity College are doubtful about the motivation and feel wounded about the proposals, that is a serious situation indeed.</P>
    <P>Due to the length of time that <Col N="73" /> university has been in existence and due to the diaspora of its students&mdash; a diaspora which other universities have with it, but not to the same extent, both because the University of Dublin is longer in existence and has its fields of activity spread in a wider net&mdash;when the Provost of Trinity College speaks like that and when Professor Dawson, a senior professor of the university speaks like that, we should know the reason the proposals were made.  This will go out to every corner of the globe because, when the Provost speaks, he is speaking to his graduates in every corner of the globe and as serious educationalists we will be derided, and we will deserve the censure of those people.</P>
    <P>I am making a plea for light in the situation, a plea which I made from the very first day the proposals were revealed to the country.  In various discussions about the proposals since then, when the Minister was questioned, he skipped lightly over some of the points made by Professor Dawson.  We were expecting, and I was pleading for, a White Paper which was promised a long time ago but which did not come.  Apparently a Green Paper, or what is thought to have been a Green Paper, was presented by the Minister to the Government. In fact, we are told that these proposals are not the proposals the Minister, acting on the advice of the officials of his Department, put before the Government, that they were rejected.  All this area in such an important question needs light and it is up to the Minister to throw light on what has happened.</P>
    <P>Of particular concern to Trinity College, and to the people in general who are studying the situation, is the idea of the conjoint board in the context of two independent universities. Why is there a need for this conjoint board?  We are waiting for its personnel and its functions.  Why the duplication if one of the basic reasons for these proposals is to save money and to use our resources wisely?  This White Paper that turned green and then disappeared in the Cabinet, is supposed to be the paper published <Col N="74" /> in the current <i>Education Times.</i>  I do not know whether it is.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us.  The conjoint board seems to be a duplication of the HEA.  If the HEA have not got the powers at the moment, this is the House which can give them the powers to perform all the functions in the relationships between the various universities, between the various colleges now brought into the HEA bailiwick.</P>
    <P>We are in the dark also about the joint Science Faculty called a Co-ordinated Science Faculty.  How will it be co-ordinated?  Will this conjoint board, if it ever sees the light of day, co-ordinate these science faculties? Has the idea of cross-registration, which was mooted many years ago by the Irish Federation of University Teachers, been dropped?  Or is the Minister thinking of cross-registration in regard to the joint or co-ordinated faculty of science?  We need to know because, particularly in the planning of a science faculty, we must know well ahead.  A university must know well ahead what it must do, what will be the conditions of its existence.</P>
    <P>When this particular university speaks it is heard in every corner of the globe.  University education in Ireland will suffer if the Minister does not clear himself pretty soon of the charges that were made against him by members of that university.  I come back to my opening sentence.  This Government took office, and the Minister for Education in particular, promising consultation at every level before taking any action.  The Minister is quoted&mdash;the quotation is from <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash;as saying:</P>
    <P>Is there a suggestion here that the Government in taking decisions must in fact consult continuously with other bodies when it makes the decisions?</P>
    <P>The language is not too clear, but it seems to be a rejection of the first principle of consultation which we were led to believe was to motivate the activity of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>The late Donogh O'Malley&mdash;go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire air&mdash;decided <Col N="75" /> there would be a merger of universities in Dublin.  That idea seems to have gone.  Trinity College and the new university, whatever its name may be, in Belfield, are to be separate and distinct universities, but the Minister in his new proposals is acting as a match-maker elsewhere in university education.  The lady Trinity and the gallant UCD must stand rigidly apart although they are on the same side of the Liffey but the Minister is shot-gunning UCG and UCD into a marriage presumably to legitimate the new National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick&mdash;different principles for different places.  I have on other occasions mentioned the tendency to metropolitan thinking in the present Administration.  In their treatment of UCG and UCC the Government are guilty of this metropolitan thinking&mdash; settle Dublin's problems and anything will do for the rest.</P>
    <P>All we got from the Minister so far as a reason for keeping UCG and UCC joined in a National University of Ireland so far as I can trace is &ldquo;for a wide variety of financial and educational reasons&rdquo;.  It could be contended that the Ó Dálaigh Commission examined both the financial and educational reasons in 1967 when it advised that they should have separate university status.  It could also be surmised that the Higher Education Authority did the same thing in 1973 when it advised that UCG and UCC should have separate, independent university status.  The Commission itself is on record as saying:</P>
    <P>The working of the university system requires, under its constitution, expensive cross-reference and cross-consultation within the university itself, between the university and the colleges, and between the colleges&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>They are talking about the old NUI now.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and these requirements unnecessarily delay the making of decisions and bringing the college into each other's business even when they have no particular interest in it.  Proposals travel outwards <Col N="76" /> and upwards and are not decided where the need is present and the knowledge is most fully available.  Cumbersome procedures have to be observed and decisions that would seem very often to require only the exercise of an executive function must wait the authority of the central legislative body, many of whose members may have no interest in the matters in question.</P>
    <P>That is taken from Report 11, page 410.</P>
    <P>Those statements are as true today, if not more so, as when the Commission made them.  No doubt the Minister has received, as I have, a memorandum from the Governing Body of UCC putting forward its case for independent status.  Among the points made&mdash;I shall not go into detail now &mdash;is this one of how cumbersome it is to run a university on the lines of a National University of Ireland.  It sets out convincingly reasons why UCC and UCG should be universities in their own right but, to emphasise the point I made a few moments ago, it points out that it takes from the time a university college has made a decision that it wants to set up a structure or make an innovative appointment a period of 18 months from idea to achievement.</P>
    <P>I take it that the people who prepared that document know what they are talking about.  In fact, in private conversations with members of both colleges I have found that this is the case.  The Minister may say that the structures will be different in a new NUI.  That may well be.  But no matter how different they are, when you have a new bureaucracy you will slow decisions and put chains on the people who are involved in developing university colleges.</P>
    <P>University College, Galway, is also anxious to be freed.  The Minister in an early statement rebutting their claim cited evidence that was given by some member of UCG before the Higher Education Commission stating that they were not ready for it then. I think he has been adequately answered by the people who said that the Minister had forgotten that Donogh O'Malley had crossed the <Col N="77" /> scene in the meantime and had spread secondary education widely throughout the country, particularly in rural Ireland where it was needed, and that there were far more people in UCG now than when that person was giving the evidence and that the numbers were increasing, that university education was becoming more accessible to more people and that that was basic to the educational philosophy of this party.  I am proud to say that this party, while not achieving all we wanted, went well on the road to that achievement.</P>
    <P>The social and economic benefit of University College, Galway, has been emphasised by the college in its plea for independent status.  I do not have to make any long speech.  Very eloquent people in this House, particularly a very eloquent backbancher on this side of the House, and speakers from all sides of the House, on occasion, have outlined how important it was to have as many ameliorative structures as possible in the west because this side of the House, and I am sure the other side, feel the west has something worth saving.  Consequently one of the radical amendments to this document for which we are calling is that the college in Cork and the college in Galway be granted independent status.</P>
    <P>The Irish Federation of University Teachers, of which Deputy Thornley was the founder secretary, have spoken lucidly, well and convincingly on the Minister's proposals.  They are afraid of too much public control of the universities and the third-level institutions&mdash;that this is implicit in the document.  It is all right to say that 80 per cent of the finance comes from public funds and that consequently there must be a great measure of control. I agree with that.  There should be a great measure of control financially. It is the duty of the Administration in power to see to it that resources are used wisely.  But that is a different thing from trying to control the universities.</P>
    <P>The Federation of University Teachers have endorsed also the decision of the Higher Education Commission and the Higher Education <Col N="78" /> Authority on the benefits to university education generally that would ensue from independent status for the two colleges I have mentioned.  They decry also the fact that the Minister promised a White Paper on third level education and did not give it to us.  I must here and now castigate the Minister for not having done so.  A great deal of the obfuscation of policy, which is all that one can call the proposals in many respects, would have been removed had we had long ago a White Paper which could have been discussed.  We could have helped the Minister to put together more reasonable proposals, at least proposals that were lucid and clear.  We might even have strengthened him going into the Cabinet meeting where his colleagues devoured him, threw his proposals aside and came up with these.  Indeed the Minister may not be to blame for their obscurity to any great extent.</P>
    <P>With regard to the technological sector, the Minister is right in stressing its importance in third level education. What the higher colleges need at present is <i>Lebensraum</i>, plenty of it. They are bursting at the seams; they are crying out all the time for accommodation. They are quite happy with their studies and achievements, and rightly so.  A concentration on providing them with plenty of living room would be desirable on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>I am on record elsewhere as saying that I regret that the proposals ask the RTCs to look towards Limerick and Dublin and that they ask the top level of the colleges to look to the universities. Originally it seemed there would be no possibility of selective development of degree courses in the regional technological colleges.  Apparently from a reply the Minister gave to somebody&mdash;and, again, one should not have to depend on journalists to elicit this kind of information&mdash;it seems that this will not be so in all cases.  But the more the attention of the regional technological colleges is directed on their localities, on the needs of their own localities, on the social structure of their own localities, the better the contribution they can make to the country and to education in general. <Col N="79" /> At times the Minister must live in cloud-cuckooland because I saw a statement he made that the RTCs largely have welcomed the scheme. This is not so.  They are worried about many things.  I have mentioned one of them already.</P>
    <P>They are worried also that the proposed Council for Technological Education will not have any representation from them and that the two National Institutes of Higher Education, one in existence and one to be created, will have so much control in this National Council for Technological Education.  Naturally, they are worried.  It comes back to the first point I made: that they are afraid that they will be in a position to be downgraded by the institutes, sometimes because the institutes are developing courses which they do not want the RTCs to develop.</P>
    <P>On this occasion I am glad the Minister laid it on the line that these decisions were Government decisions, because we have had the spectacle over the last 12 months or so of representatives of the people belonging to the junior party in the Coalition Government luxuriating in a superior educational policy, disowning the Minister's. Perhaps they were right in so doing.  But I want to point out the immorality of that with regard to any proposals such as these that come before this House and people.  The Minister's policies are their policies; the Minister's mistakes are their mistakes in these proposals on higher education and in every other field.  They have a responsibility for them.  They have their own Members in the Cabinet. They have their own remedy, if they do not agree-and their own remedy should not be to put the Minister in the public pillory in order to remain the seagreen incorruptibles of the educational scene.</P>
    <P>The regional technological colleges are anxious about the National Council for Education Awards.  One moment it is abolished, the next moment it is not abolished; it is back, but under a different name.  It gets more and more curious.  In the short time it has existed I think the NCEA has justified itself.  I am of the opinion <Col N="80" /> that it should be maintained and I am prepared to argue that in this House. The RTCs have developed a confidence in it.  The NCEA also has structured courses which have gained the recognition of outside bodies.</P>
    <P>Under the new structures there is the danger also that the good man in the small town who feels that he has not scope to develop will move&mdash; his eyes will be on a staff position in Limerick or in the new National Institute of Higher Education in Dublin.  This also puts the whole idea of the RTCs at risk.  It puts the country at risk of being impoverished, if the RTCs are not allowed to play the role designed for them.  I have examples, but I have not time to give them to the House, of degree courses that have been structured in some of the RTCs, where people have dedicated themselves to these courses and where they fear the future.  I am not saying their fears are 100 per cent valid, but the way the proposals were made left them with no option but to fear for their future and the future of the courses.</P>
    <P>At the level of the national institute, the vocational education committees seem to be about to get the hammer. As I said of the colleges themselves, the committees have every right to be proud of their achievements in the development of third level education within the vocational education system. How the university and NIHE link is going to be established and how the difficulties are to be ironed out, I do not know.  But I do know that if the vocational education committees are removed from the scene it will be a great loss to that particular field of third level education.</P>
    <P>Many of the vocational education people, committee members and others, have made a strong plea that the regional technical colleges should be represented on all the relevant bodies, particularly the Council for Technological Education.  I said that the Minister at times seemed to be living in a different world when he claimed that, for the most part, the heads of the RTCs were in favour of his proposals. I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20th December, 1974:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> The principals of the eight regional technical colleges in the country have expressed &ldquo;deep concern&rdquo; at the Minister for Education's proposals for the future of higher education.</P>
    <P>In a statement yesterday they described the proposals as a &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; and warned that if implemented they would ensure that the vocational system would continue to be &ldquo;the poor relation&rdquo; in third level education.</P>
    <P>They condemned the abolition of the NCEA.  As I said, I think it should be maintained and given added power.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proposed abolition of the National Council for Educational Awards and its replacement by another council which will be badly constituted and severely restricted in its powers of awards is detrimental to the interests of the Regional Technical Colleges and of technical education generally, and ultimately will be seriously damaging to applied science and technology in Ireland,&rdquo; the statement said.  &ldquo;The decision to sacrifice the future development of technical colleges while appeasing the long-established vested interests in third level education is an abdication by the Minister in matters that are of vital importance to the future development of the nation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If the Minister has any delusion about what the heads of the colleges think, then that should remove it.  The Union of Students in Ireland made a very close analysis of the proposals, and I think I could recommend to the Minister, despite their occasional kicking over the traces and antagonising people, that they do a very close study of proposals.  I do not always agree with either their actions or their conclusions but we must pay them the tribute that their research staff examine carefully the proposals that emanate from the Department and from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan, the Chairman of the Vocational Education Committee here in Dublin has also expressed his alarm, and I am asking the Minister to listen to these people who are experienced in the administration of vocational education.  They are not just <Col N="82" /> talking for the sake of talking.  They fear that somehow or other the structures and the courses they have worked on and brought to perfection, in some cases, are endangered by what he proposes.  I put down this motion in the following words:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls for radical amendment of the proposals of the Minister for Education on the re-organisation of third-level education.</P>
    <P>I had intended to deal with the purported Green Paper.  I did not get it in time to do so, and I would not have had time anyway.  However, when I say &ldquo;radical amendment&rdquo; I mean radical amendment: first, that University College, Cork, be established as a university in its own right; secondly, that University College, Galway be established as a university in its own right; thirdly, that the Minister preserve the regional technical colleges by giving them representation on any board in which they have an interest, any board that deals with them on validation level, on assessment level or on structuring level; fourthly, that the vertical mobility that exists at present in the third level colleges should be maintained; and the Minister, if he intends to go through with his proposals, will have a lot of hard work to do in this area in bringing the top portion of the third level institutions into harmony with university requirements.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister not to exclude the vocational education committees from the running of the third level institutions which they have been running and which they know so well, and which they have been running with success.  I am asking the Minister to maintain the NCEA and extend its powers to perform a dual function, that of validation of degrees and of structuring.  I am asking him to consider also Maynooth College as a possible independent university institution.</P>
    <P>I am asking him finally to remove the charge made against him, justly or unjustly&mdash;and in the light of the amount of information he has let out to the public, how can we know whether it is justly or unjustly&mdash;that <Col N="83" /> the Government have acted politically in their dealings with Trinity College, so that we shall not be the world's fools wherever educationalists gather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Opposition put down a Private Members' motion calling for the radical alteration of the Government's proposals&mdash;I think it was put as the Minister for Education's proposals&mdash;I expected we would have been given some <i>rationale</i>, some reasoned case, which would guide us towards a view of how this might be done.  I have listened without interruptions to the Deputy although on a number of occasions I would have liked to ask questions in order to elucidate points he was making.  Therefore, I expect to be heard totally without questioning.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough in dealing with higher education for someone to come here and recite a litany of grievances which particular interests have expressed either privately to the Deputy concerned or by way of the media in respect of the Government's proposals.  I have noted briefly some of the points raised by the Deputy.  He began by quoting from TCD and from Professor Dawson. The most charitable line that I could take in relation to what was written by Professor Dawson would be to remain silent.  Even one's own colleagues could be embarrassed by what was written by the professor for <i>The Education Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough either to trot out in this House the alleged grievances of one of the colleges in Dublin.  I refute the unsubstantiated charge, and the Deputy was good enough not to substantiate it, that the Government's proposals in respect of higher education were politically motivated.  They were not, as anybody reading them carefully will realise.  In the first place what benefit would there be in allowing considerations other than education considerations to guide us in relation to these matters?  I should like the seconder of this motion, Deputy Faulkner, when he comes in, to elaborate on this charge made by the <Col N="84" /> Opposition.  I challenge him to say what precisely is meant by the Opposition when they quote political charges.  Do they mean party political charges?</P>

      <P>This is the kind of smear innuendo that is unworthy of this House.  I ask Fianna Fáil either to dissociate themselves from the professor's views or to substantiate them from their own point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned the policy of a merger of the two universities in Dublin.  I have not got the verbatim account before me but I should be surprised if it reveals that Deputy Wilson came down either for or against this policy.  Am I to take it that the Fianna Fáil policy on higher education is to merge the two colleges in Dublin, a suggestion that was made by the late Donogh O'Malley in 1967?  Mr. O'Malley proposed a merger then and I challenge the Opposition now to clarify whether they adhere yet to that Fianna Fáil policy which, as far as I know, has never been departed from publicly.  It ill behoves Deputy Wilson to speak in the terms he used.  Subsequent Fianna Fáil Ministers, and there were two, made references and proposals in relation to higher education but they did nothing about solving the problem although they had opportunity in plenty to do so.  Therefore, it comes ill from Deputy Wilson to make the points he made and to complain about lack of information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>I do not wish to waste the time available to me in <Col N="85" /> going through all the points raised by the Deputy but consultation was one question about which he made a song and dance.  What we are dealing with here are not, as the Deputy would suggest, proposals.  They are decisions, decisions for which this country has waited for a number of years while people dithered and failed to make up their minds.  At least, this Government have issued the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I have here a document from the Minister entitled <i>The Government's Proposals in Relation to Higher Education.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying, as I have said publicly on a number of occasions, that these are Government decisions.  I reiterate that so that there can be no misunderstanding on this point.  The litany of grievances to which the Deputy subjected us included references to UCC and UCG. The difficulties which all agreed existed in relation to the present NUI are advanced as reasons why one should depart from a federated university between these colleges or any other college that should wish to join them.  We heard also about IFUT. Did the Deputy come down on the side of IFUT?  Is he saying in effect that the proportions as between the State expenditure on higher education of 80 per cent and 20 per cent should be maintained or should the State contribution be increased?  If the State's contribution should be increased I should like to have heard that at Question Time to-day when these matters were being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy talked about the obfuscation that would have been avoided if a White Paper had been published. I have dealt already in public with this question.  The decisions that have been taken by the Government are the decisions which will form the basis on which the White Paper will be elaborated.  There is no obfuscation in relation to these decisions.  They are clear.  As I have said elsewhere, some of the fuss about them is because they are not acceptable to some people and, consequently, the red herring <Col N="86" /> of a White Paper is being drawn across the track to obscure that point.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note that the Deputy agreed with me generally on the question of the technological sector.  However, he seems to be under a misapprehension and not to have read my previous statements in regard to the taking over of the colleges by the universities.  There will be no taking over by any university of the technological colleges.  I have tried to make that clear in a number of statements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>The Deputy said I have laid it on the line that these are Government decisions.  It should not be necessary to do it but people in discussing these matters have tried to give the impression that these had been my personal views for a long time.  Now, at last, when I have got home the message that the decisions are Government ones, these people are not pleased either.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the NCEA. Does the Deputy mean simply that he wishes &ldquo;NCEA&rdquo; to be retained?  This is not a matter of major importance. Does he wish their functions to be widened?  I have said on a number of occasions that I intend widening the functions of the NCEA.  Is the Deputy saying that he wishes degrees to continue to be validated by the NCEA or whatever body will take over from them?</P>

      <P>If that is the case the Deputy is coming down firmly in favour of the binary system and it would be helpful if the seconder of the motion would tell the House clearly whether Fianna Fáil are in favour of the binary system, and the keeping apart of the autonomous sector and the technologically integrated sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were treated also to the views <Col N="87" /> advanced on behalf of the chairman of the Dublin VEC but we were not told whether the policy of allowing the Dublin VECs to continue to be the governing structure of the NIEC in Dublin should be followed in relation to Limerick city VEC.  Perhaps the seconder of the motion would enlighten us on that matter also because he or his immediate predecessor were in office when the Limerick NIHE was instituted.  I have not seen any reference in any record to the fact that that college should have been given to Limerick city or Limerick county VEC.</P>

      <P>We have heard from Deputy Wilson that the principals of the RTCs spoke about this matter as a tragedy.  The statement he is quoting from was issued in early days and from memory I could give him the name of one principal of an RTC who wrote letters to the papers saying there was a lot of merit in the Government's proposals and calling generally for agreement with these proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, the Deputy can hardly say that all the principals of these colleges were against these proposals.  References were made to the USI and others.  At no point&mdash; and I listened very carefully and attentively to what Deputy Wilson said&mdash; did it come through to me what the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party is in relation to higher education.  We have been treated to a litany in some cases of the publicised grievances of certain interests in relation to some doubts they may have and in other cases, to the lack of understanding of the purport and direction of those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I made it clear when I made the Government's decision on higher education known on 16th December last&mdash;and as I have repeated since&mdash; my immediate concern in making the announcement was to inform the public of these decisions.  I am convinced <Col N="88" /> that in doing so I did what was correct.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that at the time of my statement on 16th December, the many interests and institutions which are intimately involved in higher education, and the general public, had for seven years been awaiting decisions which would indicate the trend of future development. It is not, I think, an exaggeration to say that these seven years constituted a period of anxiety and of unsettling uncertainty about the future for all concerned with higher education and its development.  It was a period throughout which various, and I underline the word, proposals, counter-proposals and alternative suggestions from some of the interests concerned emanated and various recommendations followed one another in a seemingly endless series; it was a period which one might say was rich in everything except decisions which would signpost the way ahead.</P>
    <P>In this connection let me say that on becoming Minister for Education I soon discovered, in the course of discussions which I had with deputations from higher education interests&mdash;and I have already given the Dáil details of the number of these meetings&mdash; that the sense of frustration which had enveloped many of those with whom I spoke was so strong that I formed the impression that almost any decision that would end the uncertainty would be welcomed by them. Indeed, the very Opposition which is now calling for a radical amendment of these proposals repeatedly asked me when these decisions would be forthcoming.  In fact I have a very clever recollection of hearing academics speak in these terms.</P>
    <P>It would, of course, have been an easy matter to present decisions to the public shortly after I became Minister.  It might even have won a measure of public acclaim that the mists had at last been scattered.  It would not, however, have been the action of a responsible Minister for Education or Government.  Rather would it have been irresponsible in the extreme. <Col N="89" /> So, while under continuous pressure to expedite decisions I pressed on with a detailed examination and a thorough survey of all aspects and areas of higher education.  At the same time, I continued to receive deputations from bodies whose views I felt would be valuable to me in my examination of higher education as a whole.  I say &ldquo;higher education as a whole&rdquo; designedly, because I was aware that some at least of those who were, understandably in the circumstances eager for early decisions, appeared to see higher education in rather traditional terms, a higher education which was somewhat confined in range and scope, and where institutions were concerned centred in the main in the traditional-type institutions such as universities and other long-established institutions.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is far from being the true situation. While higher education may in another age have been associated largely with the universities, the situation had changed radically with the establishment and rapid expansion of a network of new third level educational institutions, in which a great variety of new programmes, both general and specialist, was fostered and developed. Indeed, the whole landscape of higher education was changed by this development. The result of the emergence on the scene of this&mdash;let me call it&mdash;modern aspect of higher education and the importance of its rational development from the outset made it imperative that third level education in its entirety should be studied as a unit and decisions relating to it taken as such.  In fact the questions on which decisions were awaited had become much more difficult and complex than they were, for example, in the time of my predecessor who announced by a simple statement about a merger in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It did a lot of good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We await clarification if this is still Fianna Fáil policy. What had begun as a relatively, in retrospect, clear-cut matter of rationalisation of the university situation in the Dublin area, and consequential <Col N="90" /> restructuring of the university system generally, had now encompassed a much broader field requiring the most careful consideration.</P>
      <P>After exhaustive examination of the situation the Government reached the decisions which I announced in December last.  I am aware that the substance of these decisions has drawn criticism from some quarters&mdash;some of this criticism is, I feel sure, due perhaps to misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the Government's purpose and intentions.  Our decisions have been inspired by a desire to effect rationalisation of the system of higher education in its entirety and to guarantee maximum interaction between institutions to the benefit of our students and of the quality of the education which must be provided for them.  To this end we decided to initiate the establishment of the structures necessary to secure a comprehensive system of third level education in the country.  We took this decision, having considered all the advice available to us.</P>
      <P>I need not say that I am convinced we took the correct decision.  The establishment of a comprehensive system has been the central guiding principle underlying our plan.  I await with eagerness clarification by the seconder or some other speaker of the underlying principle guiding the Opposition's view of third level education. Such a system facilitates making the ideal of real and genuine equality in education a reality.  When I use the word &ldquo;equality&rdquo; in this context I have in mind the equality of opportunity in access to higher education, equality of opportunity within the system of higher education and equality of opportunity within the matter of recognition of courses and qualifications, whatever the institution on which they are based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me point out, too, that the overall comprehensive framework for which we have opted is calculated to make access to higher education a reality for many, who, under an alternative plan, might not have been afforded this opportunity.  To me it seems clear that the opportunities for student mobility between institutions <Col N="91" /> and different educational levels&mdash;and these are most desirable objectives&mdash; are offered in a comprehensive system to an extent that no alternative plan would be likely to provide.</P>
    <P>My list of the advances that are inherent in a comprehensive framework of third level education is not at this point intended to be exhaustive. We have been guided by a strong desire to ensure greater liaison and co-operation between a great variety of institutions old and new, and have formulated decisions which aim at breaking down the traditional isolation from one another of these institutions the common purpose of which should be to serve the same ends, the welfare of the students and of the country generally.  As I have already said at my Press conference, the Government are confident &ldquo;that they may rely on the goodwill of all the parties involved in higher education in securing the best possible service to all students, whether whole-time or part-time, adolescent or adult&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is one important aspect of the Government's decisions to which to date little attention has been given by those who have commented upon the decisions in general.  It is our clear commitment to devolution of authority in relation to the institutions that constitute the sphere of higher education. I am referring now to that section of my statement of 16th December, when I announced a list of bodies which are to be designated institutions for the purpose of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  These institutions are as follows:</P>
    <P>the Conjoint Board of the Dublin Universities,</P>
    <P>the Council for Technological Education,</P>
    <P>the National Institute of Higher Education, Dublin and Limerick,</P>
    <P>the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies,</P>
    <P>St. Patrick's College of Education, Drumcondra,</P>
    <P>Our Lady of Mercy College of Education, Carysfort Park, Blackrock, Dublin, <Col N="92" /> the Church of Ireland College of Education, Rathmines,</P>
    <P>the National College of Art and Design, Dublin,</P>
    <P>the College of Education for Teachers of Specialist Subjects, Limerick,</P>
    <P>the National College of Physical Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>Mary Immaculate College of Education, Limerick,</P>
    <P>St. Catherine's College of Home Economics, Sion Hill and</P>
    <P>St. Angela's College of Home Economics, Lough Gill, Sligo.</P>
    <P>I invite the Opposition to agree with me that the Government's decision to designate these institutions was the right decision so that we will know where they stand in relation to these matters.</P>
    <P>In addition to the specific functions given to it under the Act, the authority has the general functions of:</P>
    <P>(a)  furthering the development of higher education,</P>
    <P>(b)  assisting in the co-ordination of State investment in higher education and preparing proposals for such investment,</P>
    <P>(c)  promoting an appreciation of the value of higher education and research,</P>
    <P>(d)  promoting the attainment of equality of opportunity in higher education,</P>
    <P>(e)  promoting the democratisation of the structure of higher education.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>Clearly, these are all functions which the authority with its experience and expertise can carry out most fruitfully and effectively in the context of the comprehensive structures which we propose to establish.  Incidentally, I did not hear the Opposition comment, favourably or unfavourably, on our recent decisions to widen the personnel to increase the number of persons on the Higher Education Authority, particularly from the areas of technological education, which we desire to see integrated with the autonomous sector.</P>
    <Col N="93" />

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there are two designated institutions, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and the College of Pharmacy and these as designated institutions deal directly with the Higher Education Authority, not with my Department.</P>
      <P>In deciding to designate 14 additional institutions, which I propose to do at an early date after consultation with the Higher Education Authority, we are not motivated by any desire to abdicate responsibility on our part. Rather have we decided to do so because of our firm belief in the value of devolution of authority.  Aside from the Government's expressed intention to devolve authority where appropriate and feasible, there is another important point to be made with regard to the bringing within the ambit of the Higher Education Authority of those institutions I have just mentioned. These institutions provide third level education or have close involvement with higher education.  It is more than a little strange then that the body directly charged with the development of higher education should up to the present, because of the sharply-drawn lines of demarcation that have run through the structure have been more or less confined in its endeavours to part of higher education.  Our decision to designate the additional institutions will end that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson in his contribution was worried about the regional technical colleges.  I am not too clear, having listened to the Opposition, to what extent they wish the regional technical colleges to become degree-awarding institutions.  I hope Deputy Faulkner will follow me and with his experience in relation to those colleges may I remind him that the regional technical colleges were established for the specific purpose of providing technicians for the local regions and for our industrial progress generally. It was never the intention&mdash;I invite the Deputy to give me his view on this&mdash;that degree courses should be followed in these colleges except in very exceptional circumstances.  If <Col N="94" /> Fianna Fáil's suggestions about the RTCs are carried out then inevitably we will have to build a new series of colleges to do the job for which these RTCs were set up originally.  Since Deputy Faulkner is likely to follow me I should like to know why the previous Government did not accept the Higher Education Authority's proposals on reorganisation when submitted to him on 9th December, 1971, or early in 1972.  Perhaps he will explain to the House why the then Government decided to discontinue the building of the dental hospital in Cork.  I take it the Opposition are not going to suggest to me and to the Government that our decision to provide a dental hospital in Cork was the wrong decision.  In the so-called call for radical amendment of these proposals, are we to have them amended so that the dental hospital in Cork is going to be taken out?</P>

      <P>In further reference to devolution of authority I may say that it is a major part of the overall policy of the Government of which I am a member that the decision-making process should be decentralised as much as possible.  The National Coalition Government hold it as a priority that power must be vested in the people, and that they must have a voice in the formulation of policy in relation to their needs.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the next speaker would let us know whether Fianna Fáil would have taken the RTCs from under the authority of the VECs.  We have decided to leave the RTCs under the VECs for the very reasons I am stating: that we wish the people to have a voice in the formulation of policy in these areas and also because such a substantial proportion of the work of these RTCs is post-compulsory&mdash; apprenticeship, technician and adult education.</P>

Our decisions, I am confident, will ensure the necessary responsiveness to local needs.</P>
      <P>I am now concluding and I look forward eagerly to an exposition of the philosophy of the Opposition in regard to higher education.  I call on the House to vote down with disregard the motion which is before us calling for radical amendment of the Government's policies on higher education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter under discussion is a very serious one.  I regret the Minister adopted the attitude <Col N="96" /> he did in his statement.  He had an opportunity to throw some light on the confusion which followed the announcement of his proposals but he evidently took the line that the best means of defence is to attack, especially when he did not propose to say anything in relation to his own proposals or to throw any light on them.</P>
      <P>He appears to be particularly anxious to know what the Fianna Fáil policy is in relation to third level education.  The actual position is that the Opposition and the country are very anxious to know what the Minister's proposals are.  He was well aware of the fact, when he announced his proposals, that there was a considerable amount of confusion.  Nobody really knew what was involved and when the Minister got an opportunity, in replying to questions in the Dáil, he refused to take it.  Tonight he refused again to take that opportunity. He treated the whole matter in a very light manner.</P>
      <P>Last week <i>The Education Times</i> published a document which purported to be a study carried out at the request of the Minister for Education by a committee in his Department with regard to the future of third level education in this country.  Its publication just a few days before this debate on the Private Members' motion in Deputy John Wilson's name placed me in a bit of a quandary because some of the conclusions I had reached as to the manner in which the Government decisions on higher education came about are very similar to the conclusions which most people who have studied the document and with it the Government's decisions have reached in relation to this matter since the publication of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply want to point out, apart from what I have already said, that the notes I prepared for this debate were prepared shortly after the Minister's proposals were made known. When he refused to answer individually the very important questions on third level education put to him in this House by Deputy Wilson I had no doubt in my mind as to why he adopted this attitude.  The reason was he simply had not got the answers or <Col N="97" /> he had only a very vague idea of them.  Let me refer to the published document again.  Obviously, the divergence between what he proposed and what was later on decided by the Government was too great to be easily digested.</P>
    <P>When I heard some time ago that the Government proposed to set up a Cabinet sub-committee to examine the merger proposals and to make recommendations to the Government and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs were to be members of the committee, but very particularly when I saw that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was to be a member of the committee, I had not any great difficulty in identifying the likely line along which his fertile imagination would take him, nor for that matter the institution which was most likely to find itself in the most favoured category.  I was long enough dealing with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, when he was spokesman on Education, to read the signs.  I would even go so far as to say possibly at some stage during the discussions by the sub-committee the Minister for Foreign Affairs took it on himself to write the document.</P>
    <P>I might add that the nod towards the technical and technological side of education and the pretence that it was being upgraded was simply a sop to the attitude of the Labour Party Conference in Galway to the general education policy of the Minister for Education. It is now seen to be the meaningless gesture it really is.  In my view it is very much worse than that because the effect of the proposals is to downgrade the technical and technological education in a manner which could only have been expected from the Cabinet academics who formed the sub-committee and for whom university education is the be-all and end-all of existence.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that these proposals will result in third level comprehensive education is nonsense.  In fact they show every indication of handing over technical and technological education to the control of the universities at a <Col N="98" /> very vital level, that is, at third level. When I was Minister for Education, I never tired of pointing out that our educational system was lopsided and also that if we were to make progress as a people we had to get away from the heavy, and I might add historical, emphasis on the academic side.</P>
    <P>We took very positive action to do this.  At one stage the only course available in the technical schools was the group certificate two year course. We introduced the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations to vocational schools.  We established the regional technical colleges to provide some third level education on the technical side.  We established the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick to give further and more advanced third level education.  We proposed to build a further national institute of higher education in Ballymun. It was not called an NIHE at that particular time but it is the same proposal the Minister has put forward. We established the National Council of Education Awards to concern itself with courses and qualifications up to degree level on the technical side.</P>
    <P>It is accepted throughout the country, perhaps not by the present Government, that exceptional progress was made in a very short time in the technical and technological sides of education. Nevertheless, I think we will have to accept that the growth is a relatively new one.  Our aim was to give equality of status and equality of esteem to all aspects of education. When we established and developed the community schools, which I am glad to say, despite any efforts by the Government, are not only accepted but are being called for by the people of the country at the present time, we did not hand over technical education to secondary education.  Again, we gave equality of status to all forms of education at post primary level in these schools.</P>
    <P>We had an aim. These are just some of the practical steps which we took to achieve that aim.  In my view it is quite different from a situation where to all intents and purposes <Col N="99" /> at a vital level technical and technological education is being handed over to the universities. These new proposals were dumped on the Minister for Education.  I accept the statement that the proposals are Government proposals.  They certainly did not emanate from the Department of Education.  I had knowledge over a number of years of the senior officers of that Department and I would not for one moment accuse them of putting forward such proposals.  However, they are now saddled with them and I have no doubt they are at present trying to extract from them some kind of answers to Deputy Wilson's questions, which I suppose will be the substance of the White Paper when we get one. I do not envy them their task.</P>
    <P>I regret very much the Minister for Education allowed himself to be saddled with these proposals.  He has only himself to blame if he must now try to defend them with all kinds of meaningless special pleadings.  It is quite clear from the number of times the Minister contradicted himself when replying to supplementary questions asked by Deputy Wilson that he had no real idea of what was involved in the proposals and his question to us as to whether we were aware of such a thing as collective responsibility rang somewhat hollow.  The Minister boasted, as he boasted again today, that he had within two years produced decisions on third level education which the former Administration had been unable to do in the previous 16 years.  I ignore the considerable inaccuracy in the number of years since the merger was first announced, but surely the Minister will agree that whether he is to be commended or otherwise on such decisions depends on the quality of the decisions.  If the proposals are of poor quality and unacceptable to the general body involved and therefore unworkable the fact that the Minister produces them in two years is not worthy of any commendation.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to draw attention to the fact that this Government, after the merger situation, made decisions which altered <Col N="100" /> radically not only the previous Government's proposals but also the UCD-TCD agreement and the final proposal of the Higher Education Authority all of which had been discussed, debated and considered over a very long period. The Minister may say, as he did say, that we were demanding that he should introduce his proposals quickly but we did not for one moment assume that, when he would introduce them, they would be totally changed from the original proposals which were being discussed and considered by the various bodies concerned.</P>
    <P>If the sub-committee were to come to a reasonable conclusion in regard to this exceptionally important and involved matter it would have been necessary for it to concern itself not only with a synoposis of the various proposals which, I would assume, the sub-committee had before it but also to get a real feeling of the situation and, perhaps most important of all, to approach the matter objectively. Quite obviously the committee did not approach the matter objectively.  Candidly, I doubt if some of its members were capable of so doing.</P>
    <P>When one remembers the Government's 14-point plan election promises, which were referred to earlier by Deputy Wilson, and takes note of the stress laid on consultation, particularly in educational matters, it is interesting to note the take it or leave it presentation of these proposals.  We were originally promised by the Government, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, a Green Paper to be followed by a White Paper on the subject of third level education.  Neither materialised and belatedly we are now once again promised a White Paper and this only because of the pressure of public opinion and this White Paper will simply attempt to clarify the proposals put forward by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated on a number of occasions, and again here today, since his proposals were issued that there had been over the years long consultations on the subject of the merger and that many interested bodies had contributed their views orally and in writing and all this consultation had been sufficient and the <Col N="101" /> decision of the Government had now been made and therefore nobody could accuse him or the Government of lack of consultation.  The Minister must be aware that beginning at the time when the original proposal to merge the two Dublin universities was announced and down the years since then, not only until we left office but, I would say, of necessity for quite a time afterwards, the matter was pursued along certain well-defined lines between the Department and the various interests involved and, indeed, between some of the interests themselves&mdash;for example, the NUI and TCD discussions&mdash;and everybody concerned was aware of each step taken, all recognised the road travelled and all were coming by degrees to accept, I think, that a reasonably worthwhile solution was in sight and then, in a relatively short space of time, the new Government issued their proposals which, in some instances, were completely at variance with the painstaking progress which had been made up to then.  Those involved were offered a package out of the blue without any prior consultation on a much changed content, and I want to emphasise that aspect, and they were told the package was not negotiable. To suggest that an effective comprehensive higher education system for the whole country could possibly be created in this way is absolutely ridiculous and it underlines the amateur approach of the Government's concept of consultation.  Consultation means not simply discussing the matter concerned with those interested and then coming to a decision but also, particularly in a matter so important as this one, bringing the various groupings involved with you so that the final decision will be recognised by and accepted by those concerned even though they may not agree with everything.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that the whole matter will be discussed when legislation comes before the Dáil.  It is quite obvious basic considerations will not be affected with the passage of a Bill through the Dáil and we will end up with an Act setting up a system unacceptable to a large section of the <Col N="102" /> interests involved, a system which will, I am afraid, remain a source of conflict for years to come.  In an aspect of such national importance as higher education this is disastrous.  The Minister may claim that were he to discuss the proposals beforehand with those concerned he would simply have further wrangling and much time would be lost before a final decision was reached.  I agree this could be so but in the event of such radical changes made by the Cabinet sub-committee and the Minister in relation to all the previous proposals, whether those of the former Government or of the NUI-TCD agreement or of the final recommendations of the Higher Education Authority, the intelligent and sensible thing to do would have been to allow all concerned to continue the discussions so as to reach a reasonably amicable agreement which would then be worked out by all concerned.  The Minister may force the legislation through the Dáil and Seanad but where will that leave the higher education system and the students involved in it if institutions are forced to work a system which to many of them is unworkable and unacceptable?</P>
    <P>I can say from my experience of dealing with this matter for quite a considerable time that everyone, even the most intransigent, had come to recognise reform was needed: that universities could not remain in splendid isolation, unaffected by changing times, that money was not as plentiful as we would wish, that the greatest use had to be made of the limited resources available and I had come to the conclusion we were approaching a point where a reasonably amicable agreement was possible.  I was not averse to forcing the issue to some extent to speed up the process, but I would never have dreamt of suddenly producing something so different from that which had been so carefully, patiently and even painfully charted over a number of years. The main body of educated opinion is opposed to the proposals put forward and I have no doubt that the lack of understanding as to why some basic changes were made without any attempt at consultation is partly the cause of the opposition.  I found that <Col N="103" /> after the initial problems and perhaps confrontations the univertsities and the other higher level institutions gave reasonable co-operation along a course they had come to understand, if not to accept altogether.  They now find themselves suddenly, and by their own admission, faced with changes without any reference to them.</P>
    <P>It is proposed that the National University of Ireland as it exists should be dissolved but should be resurrected in a truncated form with the resulting rump consisting of University College, Cork, University College, Galway, and the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  I might add the National Institute of Higher Education would be foolish to join in the depressed institution which will be created.  I find it particularly difficult to understand the decision to join UCC and UCG together to form one university considering they are 150 miles apart whereas the universities in Dublin, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, are both situated in the same city and they are being retained as two separate universities. What makes it more difficult for me and possibly for others to understand is the fact that while many complex problems were discussed over a long period relating to the new structure for higher education never once did anybody suggest, let alone propose, that these colleges should be united to form one university. From the beginning the proposal was that the colleges would each form a separate university.  This was the original proposal of the previous Government, it was accepted in the UCD-TCD agreement and was fully accepted in the final proposals of the Higher Education Authority.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Capital Gains Tax Bill, 1974: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 7:</P>
    <P>To add to subsection (3) the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided always that the foregoing rates of tax shall be halved <Col N="104" /> where an individual disposes of an asset which is, or is an interest in, an asset used for the purposes of a trade, farming, profession, office or employment carried on by the individual, or as the case may be by the individual's family company, other than a private residence to which section 25 applies, and the individual, or the individual's family company as the case may be, has owned the asset throughout the period over which the gain was made and the individual was throughout that period engaged full-time in the trade, farming, profession, office or employment or was a full-time working director of the family company as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Colley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing an amendment designed to halve the capital gains tax in the case of persons who obtain a capital gain by reason of the sale of their business or farm in which they have been engaged full time.  In the course of the discussion of this amendment reference was made to the exemptions provided in sections 26 and 27 and in that context reference was made to the fact that a person who wins a prize in the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake is exempt from tax.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Minister why a person who wins, for instance, £200,000 in the sweepstake should be totally exempt from capital gains tax whereas under the Minister's proposals a person who has been building up his business during the years must have attained the age of 55 years, and if it is a family company must have been engaged full-time as a director for ten years, before he can get exemption of up to £50,000? It seems there is a contradiction here and I do not think the interjection the Minister made earlier to explain the situation in regard to the sweepstake prize sufficiently explains this apparent contradiction.  Would the Minister care to enlighten the House on the thinking behind these apparently contradictory provisions?</P>

      <P>As I mentioned earlier with the greatest respect there is no connection between <Col N="105" /> the Deputy's amendment, where he is seeking to get a half rate of capital gains tax on farming and business assets, and gains and losses in gaming. However, if he persists in being irrelevant and if the Chair permits me I shall reply briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister introduced other matters in sections 26 and 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I introduced the treatment of business assets under the existing law and under the law as it will be after we have carried through our amendments.  Inseparable to any system of tax on capital gains is the right of a taxpayer to offset losses against gains.  I take it the Deputy is with me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he accepts that as a principle that should be respected, then he knows why gains made from gaming and lotteries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Gaming, yes; lotteries are different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  They still require a person to wager, to make an investment in the hope of making a gain.  If a person's profits from such a wager were to be subjected to capital gains tax, one would necessarily have to entitle the taxpayer to set off investments and losses against tax liability. As I mentioned earlier, invariably the amount wagered is in excess of the amount won and the result would be that the Exchequer would be in the ridiculous position of having to give more concessions in respect of losses involved in gaming than it would collect in tax.  That is the reason that in this country, and in most countries which I have had the opportunity to study, gains from gaming are exempt because one cannnot involve the gain unless one is prepared to set off the loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, of course I agree with the principle that if one is to tax the gains one must be prepared to allow the losses and this applies in the case of the sale of a business.  However, in the case of gaming&mdash;betting as it is commonly <Col N="106" /> called&mdash;a problem clearly arises.  I suggest that if a person who wins £200,000 in the sweep will be able to claim losses in respect of gaming, or certainly in respect of the lottery, that would mean that the Exchequer would end up with no revenue.  I do not want any misunderstanding on this.  I am not opposed to the exemption of the lottery or gaming for the reason the Minister gave in the case of gaming.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about why there should be exemption where a person wins £200,000 in the sweepstake.  The best the Minister can offer by way of contradiction or argument against this amendment is to say he is providing exemption of up to £50,000, subject to fairly rigid conditions in the case of a person selling the business that he has built up during many years.  On the face of it there is a blatent contradiction here and, with due respect to the Minister, I do not think what he has just said is any answer or explanation of that contradiction. What he has said applies to gaming but not to lotteries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same anomaly occurs under existing law where the result of a lifetime's labour could be caught for estate duty with rates up to 55 per cent, whereas the gain from gaming would not be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are anomalies under the existing law and there are aspects that are far more favourable than some aspects of the new proposals but we are not discussing that.  What we are discussing is a proposal to bring in capital gains as part of an overall packet of taxation and, in that context, the Minister is obliged to explain and justify the provisions he is bringing before the House.  I do not think it is an answer to say there are anomalies in the existing law.  That is not what the House is being asked to deal with now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to see that the Minister refuses to accept this amendment also, as he has refused to accept other amendments put down by Deputy Colley.  This amendment is eminently fair and equitable.  I made the case earlier today in relation to the rates of tax and the question of a <Col N="107" /> sliding scale of tax over a period of years that an asset that someone has held for a long period, which he has built up with his labour and enterprise, should not be subject to the same rate of taxation as a profit which somebody makes virtually overnight on the stock exchange or in something similar.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Colley has highlighted the total anomaly and injustice that will be perpetrated under this Bill if it is passed without any amendments on the lines suggested. Someone who makes overnight without lifting his finger £200,000 on the sweepstakes or wins some large amount on gambling or some similar enterprise without any effort is exempt but a man who has spent, perhaps, 20 or 30 years building up a firm and putting a lot of effort, time and enterprise into it is heavily penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see any merit or equity in that and I do not believe that the Minister, or his backbenchers, can either.  However, the Minister still digs his heels in and forces this House, by virtue of the majority which the Government have, to pass into law things which everyone knows are inequitable.  The Minister has pledged himself to try to get rid of any of the anomalies in our tax laws <Col N="108" />&mdash;I do not deny that there are many anomalies and problems related to our taxation system generally&mdash;but he is creating by this Bill far greater anomalies, inequities and injustices than exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>A man who spends 20 or 30 years building up an asset is, under this Bill, to be taxed to the hilt if our amendment is not accepted while a person who makes the same amount of money after, perhaps, only a month on the stock exchange and without any effort pays the same amount of tax.  The worst insult of all is that a person who makes £200,000 on the sweepstakes purely as a piece of good luck but without the faintest effort on his or her part is to be totally exempt.  If someone makes a large sum of money as a result of gambling, he pays no capital gains tax but the man who has put something into the community and into the economy over a long period of years, who has helped many people besides himself, is taxed on that at the full rate.  Such a person should not be taxed in these circumstances but if he is to be taxed the very least that should be done in equity is to charge him at half the rate applicable to people who gain vast sums within a short period and without any effort on their part.</P>

The second line of subsection (1) contains the words &ldquo;that is, in respect of&rdquo;; otherwise the subsection corresponds exactly with that in the British legislation.

      <P>Most of it.  There are deviations which we shall discuss as we come to them.  On this section, which is the section charging capital gains, we have put forward a number of amendments which have been defeated. These amendments in our view go to the root of making the capital gains tax an equitable tax so far as we can do it by way of amendment. Without repeating the various arguments put forward, I shall just recall that our amendments were designed to ensure that there would be a sliding scale of capital gains tax so that one could distinguish between short term gains which, in the main, are what people understand by speculative gains on the one hand and on the other, long term gains which, in the main, are the results of hard work and skill applied to a person's business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> In addition, we have tried to ensure that half the rate of tax would be applied to a fairly tightly-drawn category of persons selling their own businesses in which they have been engaged full time.  The Minister has not seen fit to accept either of these amendments or&mdash;and we stressed this more than once&mdash;the principle involved. We were not in any way tied to the actual wording of the amendment but, in our view, in the absence of amendments involving the principles enshrined in the two amendments I have mentioned, this section will make the Capital Gains Tax Bill unacceptable and inequitable and will almost certainly induce people to try to evade, if not to avoid liability for, capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister is naive if he believes that there will not be loopholes discovered and availed of and failure to make the charging section reasonable to the average person&mdash;I think the Minister has failed to do so; I think we have demonstrated that there was broad support on both sides of the House for the principle we put forward&mdash;and to accept that thinking which reflects the thinking outside this House will have an unfortunate effect, to say the least, and certainly, as far as we are concerned, it makes this section specifically and in general unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I regret that this is so.  I think the Minister had an excellent opportunity of getting broad support for what is being done in the Bill and of making it generally acceptable.  He did not see fit to avail of that opportunity presented to him and as far as we are concerned the section is unacceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I waited to see if the Minister would reply to Deputy Colley but I note he did not.  It is significant that there was no reply to Deputy Colley.  In fact, no reply is possible to the points he made and the fact that the Minister is not able to make a reply only bears out what we all know.  This is the key section, the charging section, and without the limitation on the charge to tax which we have suggested in amendments <Col N="112" /> which have all been defeated by the votes in many cases of people who believe in them this tax is inequitable and unfair.</P>
      <P>The arguments have been made in full and it is only necessary to summarise them.  Basically, the way this tax is being charged will penalise honest endeavour by people who have made, and would be prepared to make a genuine contribution to the economy, people prepared to build up the wealth of the country, to give employment and further employment.</P>
      <P>The attitude of many people when they realise the effect of section 3, when it is eventually brought home to them will be to say: &ldquo;Why should I bother?  Why should I spend ten or 20 years of my life trying to build up a business with all the worries and problems associated with it and then, on top of income tax, corporation profits tax, VAT and all the other things that I had been paying during my industrial or commercial career, I find at the end of it when I wish to dispose of my business that I am charged 26 per cent capital gains tax on an asset on which there is probably no gain in real terms while at the same time a speculator going in and out of shares at short notice can make that amount of money in one week and pay only the same tax?&rdquo; Worse still, a gambler can make that amount of money in five minutes and pay no tax at all.  Somebody can win £200,000 in the Sweep&mdash;which is the most obvious and least meritorious capital gain possible because it is a pure lottery&mdash;and pay no tax of any kind.  But the man who spends 20 or 30 years of his life&mdash;possibly all his working life&mdash;slogging away is taxed to the hilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find that unacceptable and it would be found unacceptable in any country where there is no differentiation in the capital gains legislation between those who work for their money and those who do not.  That is the fundamental defect of this Bill, as introduced, with this bald section that every capital gain excepting those specially exempt will be charged at the rate of 26 per cent irrespective of how it was made.  We regard that as <Col N="113" /> inequitable and unfair.  We think it should not be passed in that form.  I would say that view is held by the great majority of Members of this House and certainly by the great majority of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his obstinate fashion, is forcing through this provision against the wishes of the House and of the country.  He cannot complain if in this and future years he finds people giving up business, getting out of the country, and getting their assets out, if that is the way they are going to be treated.  We need to build up the wealth of the country.  We are under capitalised.  We have many economic problems.  This legislation will do absolutely nothing to help that situation of under capitalisation, of underinvestment.  This is killing enterprise.  It is killing the man who is prepared to go out and word hard.  It is killing the man who is prepared to go out and take a risk.  Those are the people who will build up this country.  We do not want any doctrinaire solution imposed and shoved through this House.  If the Minister wants to do that, I cannot stop him.  But at least let him do it now with his eyes open and let those who support him have their eyes open also in regard to what they are doing.</P>
    <P>This is the last opportunity we shall have in this House of debating this section.  It is the kernel of the Bill. This section is dealing with the matter in a totally wrong fashion and will cause far more loss to the economic life and the prosperity of the people than any other section.  If the Minister wants to do that, let him; but he will not have our support in so doing.  I hope that at least some of those who sit behind him will be prepared to put the country first and the future prosperity of our people first rather than have the political charade of walking through the lobbies behind an obstinate Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Minister an opportunity, if he wishes, of replying to the two very logical cases made, both based on equity.  The Minister should realise that a fisherman uses different sizes of mesh to catch different species of fish.  In the <Col N="114" /> business world there are two species. First, you have the individual businessman, or the family business, or company who over the years have devoted energy, brains and investment to their business.  Circumstances may arise in which they have to dispose of it.  Anyhow, there is a capital gain involved. The other type of person who engages in business, as Deputy O'Malley said, is the speculator who makes a kill profitwise.</P>
      <P>I would go even further than the amendment tabled here.  The amendment tabled is selective in relation to time: if a person makes a purchase and sells quickly, he must pay a higher percentage of capital gains tax, and that applies downwards on a sliding scale over a period.  I would add another set of scales which would further tax the person who engages frequently in speculative activity.  In other words, on a first transaction there would be imposed a certain rate of capital gains tax.  A second transaction carried out shortly afterwards would be taxed at a higher rate, and so on.  In other words, the real speculator would find it difficult to make large profits on speculative transactions. At the same time people genuinely engaged in commerce, industry or any of the other profit-making activities which aid the economy on a long-term basis&mdash;seeing that they are taxed already in various other ways&mdash; should receive some concession because they are not speculators but genuine business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister steamrolls this section through the House, he will see the folly of his ways in years to come.  He will see that people with money to invest, who are running businesses they want to improve, will ask themselves the question: &ldquo;Is it worth my while in time, energy and grey hairs to put myself or my successors in danger of having to pay this penal tax?&rdquo;  This is not a tax on speculators.  It is a tax on Irish industry and commerce and on decent people who engage in those activities. The Minister will regret the day he introduced this legislation.  I hope a Government will come along, in the not-too-distant future, who will put right the effects of this.  The effects <Col N="115" /> will be disastrous for anyone in business, for anyone contemplating going into business and indeed for those we are trying to encourage to set up industries here and engage in other manufacturing activities.  They will not touch us with a forty-foot pole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very worried about this section because, as previous speakers have said, it affects not the speculator but the small family businessman, the person who has built up a family business over 20 or 30 years, the person who had to keep ploughing profits back into the business to maintain an adequate flow. Such a person may have to retire from that business for some reason, be it old age or the fact that he cannot cope with modern tendencies.  Having paid all of his taxes throughout his business lifetime, that is the only investment he has for the rest of his life.  The Government now propose to take 26 per cent of that from such people.  This is unfair to the main sector about which we are always talking, be it a farm or a business: the small family run affair.  This is a disincentive to such people to improve the standard of their businesses, to have any interest in continuing their businesses or indeed to having the initiative to set up new businesses.  I would make a particular plea in respect of the person who has to give up business through ill-health.  Take the example of a family grocer.  There is just himself and his wife.  He has a small shop which he sells and on which he has to pay 26 per cent as a capital gain, which it is not.  This man has a bad heart.  He has to pay his own medical expenses.  Out of this money he hopes to earn an income on which he can live.  The Minister proposes to reduce that income, by imposing this obnoxious tax on him.  He is not getting at what Fianna Fáil wanted to get at, the speculators.  He is getting at the ordinary honest hardworking person.  He is about to destroy them, and in destroying them he is also destroying rural Ireland in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The main argument on the Fianna Fáil side is that no <Col N="116" /> allowance has been made for inflation. At the moment everybody is free from capital gains tax, even those who make a quick sale, and those who win the Sweep or other lottery.  Now they will be caught under the 26 per cent provision.  I think most people would prefer to pay some other tax rather than death duties.  Fianna Fáil say no allowance is made for inflation under the proposed system, but I shall give one example on which I have factual information, because it happened my own parents.  Under death duties inflation is not taken into account.  If a person dies and leaves property to his wife, let us say, to the value of £200,000, about £100,000 will have to be paid in death duties. Within a certain number of years the wife dies, and that is the end of the £100,000.  An estate in England, through successive deaths, went from £8 million to something like £500,000.</P>
      <P>Under the capital gains tax, if a property is bought for £100,000 and its value increases to £200,000, £300,000 or £400,000, there will be an allowance of £150,000 if the property is left to a child.  If the owner dies and capital gains tax is paid, that property is valued, and if there is a second death, it is valued at the time of the second death not the first, whereas under death duties it works differently; you are hammered twice.  I would like to see a lower rate, but this is a more equitable system than we had heretofore.</P>
      <P>I shed tears when Deputy O'Malley says the Deputies over here will walk in behind the Minister.  I could shout that from the roof tops in regard to Fianna Fáil.  When they were in power they were marching in behind the Minister and they did not even know what was under discussion.  They can forget that as an argument.  Under this system you are given allowances for your house which were not given under death duties.  Although there are other provisions in the Bill I would be against, and with which I shall deal later on, I agree with this provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> No one in this House is in favour of death duties.  I have always criticised death duties and I am delighted <Col N="117" /> they are being abolished.  I agree with Deputy Belton that no account is taken of inflation under death duties, but I do not think that is an excuse to make a bad Bill out of this by ignoring inflation.  The most objectionable thing about this section is that we are bracketing speculators and businessmen together. Our argument last week and again today is that these two categories should be separated.  Anybody with ready money over the last few months has been, and will be able over the next few months, to buy shares at a reasonably low rate and with the upturn in the economy and the increase in share prices, they will make a substantial profit.  They will only hold these shares for 12 months or two years.  I should like to see these people coming in at the rate we proposed originally, 50 per cent, because they contribute nothing to the economy, only make their substantial profit and move on.</P>
      <P>We have been trying to draw a distinction between the short term speculator and the businessman.  The businessman who spends his whole life building up and expanding his business, very often takes a small salary from it and ploughs any profits back into the business to bring it up to modern standards.  He is building up an asset for himself so that, perhaps, after 20 or 30 years he can sell and have sufficient left to invest for pension purposes and so on.  This section of society very seldom make provision for pension.  People in other walks of life are automatically provided with a pension.  The businessman should not be bracketed with the speculator who makes a quick profit on the stock exchange or the developer here in Dublin who can make substantial profits in a very short time.  That type of trade will always be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that if this clause were put in to exempt him after 15 years, this money would be locked up, and he would not sell.  Certainly where a short term developer is concerned, a man who builds and sells again, he will not wait for 15 years to realise his assets.  He will move every three or four years.  There will be no way of holding him up or <Col N="118" /> of locking up his assets but there is the long-term businessman or developer whose business is his way of life.  This man is not interested in changing business every four or five years.  It is probable that he will have made only one move or, at the most two, during his life.  This is the person in respect of whom this tax will be a deterrent because it would be to his detriment to move to a different type of business.  The Minister is unwise to continue with this section in its present form.  Although the views of the House have been made known to him he has not made any move to change his proposals and to bring in some type of scale.  He has said that from an administrative point of view this would be very difficult. All taxation is difficult and complicated but it should be within the bounds of possibility to arrive at some type of scale whereby the short-term speculator could be distinguished from the genuine investor in the State.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to introduce an amendment on Report Stage which would embody the spirit of our amendment.  In that way he will be endeavouring to be fair to every section of the community and the Bill will be a much better one than is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again there have been five or six speeches from this side of the House to none of which the Minister has replied.  The only reply from the other side, if one could call it that, was from Deputy Belton who spoke almost exclusively about the alleged iniquities of death duties and who said that while what is proposed here is bad, death duties were worse.  The Deputy fails to recall that the charge to a capital tax contained in this section is only one of three capital taxes that are to be introduced.  If one were to assess anything as an alternative to death duties, one can only do that properly, as said on Second Stage, when one sees the three taxes that are proposed in lieu of death duties.  It is wrong that we should be asked to legislate in respect of one-third of a capital taxation package without knowing what are the other two-thirds. <Col N="119" /> Deputy Belton's morbid horror of death duties might be mellowed a little if he were to see the entire package that is to be put in place of death duties.  As what we have here is only one-third we may take it that the final package will be horrific.  Various arguments were put forward by the speakers from this side of the House as to why this section should not go through in the rather bald form in which it now is.  There has been no answer from the Minister to those arguments.  Each of us waited to see if he would choose to answer but I suggest that the reason for his not answering is because he cannot answer and because the points that have been made are correct.  Yet, this Bill is to go through and this is called democracy.</P>
      <P>There are serious consequences in putting through an anti-enterprise measure of taxation such as this. During the past year or 18 months there has been a serious loss of confidence among businessmen.  They are frightened and nervous and are not prepared to take risks.  The man, more than anyone else, who has caused that situation is the Minister for Finance and this measure is another instalment in a long sorry tale that is building up to a situation in which a man who would seek to take risks with his capital or who would show enterprise in business will very soon reach the stage of asking why should he do so.  This is a country that should be trying to create wealth but it is nowhere more obvious than in this section that all the Government are doing are trying to come down like a ton of bricks on everyone who has the imagination, the enthusiasm or the courage to try to build up a business or other enterprise. This section more than any other in the Bill is designed to have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is drawn unfairly to hit hardest those who work hardest and who take the greatest risks but to hit <Col N="120" /> least those who do nothing but speculate for a short period and who put nothing into the economy.  The ultimate insult is to exempt entirely those who win at gambling, on the sweepstake or on some other lottery where their efforts are nil.  There are many people beginning to take the view: &ldquo;Why should we bother because each time we do the present Minister comes down on us?&rdquo;  When they realise the implications of this section they will be confirmed in their views and there will be an increase both in the numbers of people and in the volume of money leaving this country in recent months.</P>
    <P>It is the mentality behind this kind of legislation that has the country on the downward trend it is on today. Let those who take part in the charade of a vote that will result in this section being passed at least know what they are doing and let them ponder on the consequences for this country in future years of what they are doing.  Let them be assured that when Fianna Fáil are returned to power, as we will be at the next election, despite the gerrymandering efforts that have been engaged in to keep us out, some amendments based on the principles we have outlined here will be made to the capital gains tax so that we will have a situation where people will not be crucified every time they take a risk with their capital or show enterprise or work hard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;Part XXII of the Income Tax Act, 1967 (double taxation agreements)&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;the agreements contained in Schedule 6 to the Income Tax Act, 1967&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in the spirit of the agreements for reciprocal relief from double taxation which have existed between Ireland and Britain for many years.  In Britain they have a similar provision in their capital gains legislation which provides specific relief for Irish residents from a similar charge in respect of business assets in the United Kingdom and rights on the United Kingdom continental shelf.  There is a doubt that the proviso as expressed in the Bill <Col N="123" /> could include a person resident in a State other than the United Kingdom with which we have double taxation treaties who has only one source of income in Ireland such as an interest and who would be exempt from Irish income tax on that interest but would not be exempt on income from other sources in this country.  The matter is now put beyond doubt by inserting in the proviso a reference to schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act, 1967 which contains only our taxation agreements with the United Kingdom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had discovered for myself by looking at the 1967 Income Tax Act that the substitution relates only to the agreement with Britain, whereas what is in the Bill at the moment refers to other countries as well.  I am afraid I have not quite got the reason for the change that the Minister has given.  Could he give it to us in somewhat simpler terms than he did?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is intended to deal only with the double taxation arrangements between Ireland and Britain.  It will be an ongoing exercise to negotiate such other double taxation agreements as may be necessary between Ireland and other countries where they have capital gains tax legislation but we are dealing here only with the Irish and British situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish-British agreement covers capital gains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will as a result of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But if the Minister did not introduce this amendment and if the Bill stood as drafted, I take it the double taxation agreement with countries such as the United States and Canada would also be included. Why does the Minister want to exclude them now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not specifically excluding them or the possibility of them but each one would want to be looked at separately.  What we are doing here is dealing with the <Col N="124" /> specific Irish and British situation which has these reciprocal arrangements and we will ensure that in capital gains tax legislation the same discipline, the same rules, as apply to income tax will also apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will further negotiations be necessary to achieve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is hardly any tax situation that has not got some grey area. There will, of course, be such negotiations and if further explicit agreements are necessary they will be completed so as to give full effect to the true spirit of ensuring that nobody is taxed twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would certainly subscribe to that objective but it is not clear to me why the Minister does not propose to leave the Bill at least as it was so as to cover the double taxation agreements with, for instance, the United States and Canada &mdash;there may be other countries involved&mdash;and proceed then as he proposes to proceed in the case of the double taxation agreement with Britain to have such negotiations as may be necessary to incorporate the capital gains tax legislation.  I am afraid it is not clear to me why the Minister proposes to exclude them which is how I read the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer the Deputy to section 38 which contains the provision about double taxation relief in general?  The situation with Britain gives Ireland unilaterally relief and we give relief in exchange but in other cases there are specific agreements entered into between Ireland and the other countries.  The arrangement has always been to do it between Britain and Ireland on a reciprocal basis but the initiative is taken by the host country in each case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say and I imagine the Minister may not be able to say off-hand whether the existing double taxation agreements with the United States and Canada would cover capital gains.  If they would not it would appear to me to be a relatively <Col N="125" /> simple matter to negotiate to ensure they are incorporating the existing agreement.  Indeed it would seem to me to be a matter of some considerable urgency to do so.  Therefore I am not quite clear why the Minister proposes to exclude them.  If I understand him correctly what he is saying is that as between ourselves and Britain automatically there will be applied a double taxation relief without any further negotiations or agreements, whereas in the case of the other countries mentioned it would be necessary to conduct further negotiations and to have an addendum to existing agreements, because otherwise we would be giving the relief unilaterally. Is that what the Minister is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but of course there is not any objection in principle to giving retrospective relief.  That would be the intention in negotiating such agreements.  Nobody would be caught in any double taxation liability. The difficulty in relation to the Bill is that we cannot specifically say what the Bill will do until such time as it passes both Houses.  It is only after that you can get down to the nitty-gritty of specific agreements between prospective countries. The Irish and British situation is somewhat unique.  It allows us to apply to the capital gains legislation the spirit of the income tax exemptions which are already there and are contained in Schedule 6 to the 1967 Act.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 4, the section specifies the persons who are chargeable to capital gains tax and the extent to which they are chargeable.  A person normally resident in the State will be chargeable on gains made on the disposal of assets whether the assets are situated inside or outside the State. A person who is neither resident nor <Col N="129" /> normally resident will be charged only if he disposes of the assets of a business carried on by him in the State or of his interest in lands or minerals situated in the State or of exploration or exploration rights situated on the Continental Shelf.  He will also be chargeable in respect of gains on the disposal of unquoted shares which derive their value from such assets in the State.  A non-resident person who is exempt from income tax under double taxation agreements is also exempt from capital gains tax.  A person, including a company, resident in the United Kingdom but not resident in the State will qualify for this exemption which corresponds, as I said, to the similar relief from British capital gains tax accorded to a person resident only in Ireland who has a business in the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points I want to raise.  The first point is in relation to subsection (3) which refers to subsection (1).  Subsection (3) provides that subsection (1) shall not apply in respect of gains accruing from the disposal of assets situated outside the State and the United Kingdom.  One would have thought, on the face of it and on the basis of what the Minister said earlier about the reciprocal arrangements between here and Britain, that the phrase &ldquo;and the United Kingdom&rdquo; would not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>I am aware that this subsection follows very closely subsection (7) of section 20 of the 1965 United Kingdom Act, but in the British Act the reference is to gains from property outside the United Kingdom, whereas here we are saying gains accruing from the disposal of property or assets situated outside the State and the United Kingdom.  Take the case of an American who has an American domicile, who is resident in Ireland and also resident in the United Kingdom, if he realises a gain on property he has in Britain it would appear that that gain would be liable both in Britain and here without remittance at least until and unless a reciprocal agreement is made with the United States.  Would the Minister agree with that assessment of the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="130" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, a question of the amount of the gains received in this State.  There might be some assets in the United Kingdom, assets outside the State, where the gain would be received in the United Kingdom. Here we are dealing only with gains received within the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the introduction of the phrase &ldquo;situated outside the State and the United Kingdom&rdquo; seems to me to complicate the matter. Could the Minister explain why it is our legislation refers to assets &ldquo;situated outside the State and the United Kingdom&rdquo;, whereas the corresponding provision in Britain is &ldquo;outside the United Kingdom&rdquo; and does not refer to this State at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have used the same formula as that used in respect of the treatment of income tax.  The Deputy will appreciate we are not answerable for British legislation and I cannot explain why the British legislation is in the form the Deputy says it is.  I cannot explain why they did not incorporate the &ldquo;Republic of Ireland&rdquo; in their particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I raise the point is that the Minister told us earlier that effectively there would be a reciprocal arrangement between ourselves and Britain whereby there would not be double capital gains taxation.  On what does that rest?  One can see that one leg rests on the phrasing of this subsection where we specifically provide for the case of assets situated outside the State and the United Kingdom but, since the British legislation does not have a reciprocal provision, on what do we rely to ensure that what the Minister says will happen will, in fact, happen &mdash;that is, that there will be relief of that kind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not so provided within the existing law, and I believe it is by virtue of Schedule 6 of the 1967 Act, then it is a matter which would come up for negotiation under a specific agreement to cover these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that we are providing for it in our law but they have not provided for it in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="131" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the existing agreement between Ireland and Britain ensures the same treatment even if it is not specifically written into their particular act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is reciprocal one would think they should have written it specifically into their legislation or, alternatively, we do not have to write it into our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this is again another example of Irish legislation being superior in clarity to British legislation in not leaving the matter in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I have certain doubts as to the clarity of the provision.  If the Minister assures us that there will be relief from double capital gains taxation between ourselves and Britain despite the provision in this subsection without a corresponding provision in the British legislation, that is the primary point with which we are concerned.  However, with regard to other countries the negotiation and completion of double taxation agreements on capital gains is a matter of considerable urgency, even more urgency than would normally arise in the case of changes in our taxation for reasons I shall explain in more detail on another point relating to investment here in industry from abroad.</P>
      <P>The provisions of subsection (5) would appear to have the effect that gains on the disposal of partnership assets are to be charged on the partners separately.  I referred to this matter on Second Stage.  There appears to be no rules provided for allocating the gains to the individual partners and this could lead to considerable difficulty.  I cannot recall what, if anything, the Minister said on this point and I should like him to let us know what he has to say about the absence of rules for the allocation of gain between individual partners having regard to the fact that the Schedules provide detailed rules for almost every other contingency dealt with in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I recall correctly, in reply to the Second Stage discussion <Col N="132" /> I said that so far as partnership assets were concerned they would be dealt with in the same way as partnership profits are dealt with under the Income Tax Acts and that on the break-up of a partnership one would look to the actual position of the partnership in the partnership accounts in order to see the respective shareholdings of the partners.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy appreciates, a partnership is not a legal person as distinct from the individual members. In a partnership, for income tax purposes the assessments are made on the individual partners and not on the partnership as such.  The Income Tax Act, 1967, does not lay down any rules for the apportionment of profits as between partners.  This matter is dealt with in section 71 of the Act and it provides that each individual partner is to be treated as if any profits or gains arising to him from the trade are the profits of a trade carried on solely by him.  In effect, therefore, the partnership profits are apportioned in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the partners.  As the Deputy knows, the agreement can be either written or oral but in each case it is to the specific agreement one looks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the agreement as to the division of capital between partners or the division of income that would apply to capital gains or liability for tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be the capital assets of what determines a person's ownership.  I agree there could be a situation where partners might have different shareholdings of the partnership assets but would agree to share the profits.  In such a case the profits are no more than salary or a reward for current labour. On the break-up it would be the actual ownership in the shareholding in the partnership that would decide in what way the gain was to be apportioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, any division for the purpose of capital gains would be on the basis of the division between the partners in relation to the <Col N="133" /> capital in the partnership as distinct from income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further matter arising on this.  As the Minister knows, in the event of changes in the profit-sharing ratio, in the event of admissions to the partnership or of people retiring, there could appear to be a gain but, in fact, it would not be a gain.  Nevertheless, under the terms of the section there is the danger that it could be held that it was a gain.  I should like to know what the Minister thinks would happen in such a case, whether such a nominal gain would be regarded as a gain for the purpose of this section and, if so, what rules would be applied in dealing with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy referring to a situation where on the introduction of a new partner he is given an interest in the partnership by way of a proportion of the assets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the entry of a partner or the retirement of a partner the net effect when all the arrangements are made is that one partner at least, and perhaps more than one, may appear to end up with a capital gain in the sense that the value of his share in the partnership increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would be no charge in such a case where there is a genuine allocation of partnership assets so long as there is no consideration passing.  If there was a consideration there could be an actual gain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that a purely nominal rearrangement that on the face of it would show an increase in the share of one partner with no consideration passing would not count for the purpose of capital gains?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another matter of considerable importance that I wish to raise on this section. This section specifies the persons chargeable with capital gains and as such it brings into account industries <Col N="134" /> attracted to this country by the IDA. In dealing with this matter previously, the Minister referred to this as companies that come in here, get grants and then pull out of the country.  Of course, that is not the real situation with which we must concern ourselves. The fact is a surprisingly high percentage of companies from abroad which had invested here at the instance of the IDA have reinvested their profits in this country.  It is easy to visualise a situation where such a company would dispose of portion of their assets without pulling out of the country; they might even be expanding their operations in another area of the State.  Such a company would be disposing of portion of those assets which had been created by the reinvestment of the profits which had been earned free of income tax.  That is a kind of situation I am concerned with.</P>
      <P>I have here a booklet issued by the IDA in November, 1974, <i>Industrial Incentives.</i>  This booklet gives a summary of the incentives available. Under the heading, &ldquo;Financial Incentives&rdquo;, it says:</P>
      <P>Total freedom from tax on profits generated by exports to 1990.</P>
      <P>Later it states:</P>
      <P>Complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits.</P>
      <P>If the Minister does not know&mdash;I hope he does&mdash;I can tell him, as somebody who has had personal experience as Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the vital importance in attracting industry here not only of the incentive of tax-free profits on exports but also, and very important, of the complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had personal experience of dealing with potential investors.  One of the questions they were always concerned with was what would happen after they had set up, obtained the benefit of the grants and then generated profits.  They were always anxious to know if we would restrict them on taking the profits out of the country.  It was always a matter of vital importance that we were always <Col N="135" /> able to assure them that they were free to do what they liked with those profits.  As a result, and the Minister can check this if he wishes, a high percentage of these people reinvested their profits here because they felt complete confidence that if at any time they wanted to dispose of all or portion of their assets they could take their money out.  Because they were guaranteed this and because there was no pressure on them they were prepared to reinvest their profits here.</P>
    <P>This booklet I have referred to later gives in more detail what the incentives are and under the heading, &ldquo;Tax Relief For Export Profits&rdquo; says:</P>
    <P>Tax legislation as at present in operation provides a major financial attraction.</P>
    <P>The Minister may be tempted to argue that the phrase &ldquo;as at present in operation&rdquo;, gives him a let out but I suggest it does not because further on, having detailed what is available, it says:</P>
    <P>As no relief is available after April, 1990 it follows that only companies which commenced an export trade before April, 1971 are entitled to the full 20 years relief.</P>
    <P>The clear implication of that statement is that those who come in under the existing tax legislation will get the reliefs specified here without any interference by the Government.  That would be a reasonable inference even if the rules were to be changed for new entrants coming in.  I would regard that latter proposition as being an extremely serious one at a time when more than 100,000 people are unemployed.</P>
    <P>All the efforts of the Government should be directed in any possible area of activity that will generate employment. We know, and it is generally acknowledged&mdash;in fact the Government frequently referred to this&mdash;that the most potent area open to us is the IDA and their activities. Therefore I would regard it as extremely serious if the effect of this section was to either inhibit the activities of the IDA or, worse still, to go <Col N="136" /> back on the promises made by the IDA to foreign industrialists.  The document from which I quoted was issued in November last under the present Government, and therefore it is not a question of previous Administrations; it is a question of a clear commitment given by successive Governments to foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the effect of this section is that, if a foreign industrialist is induced by these kinds of promises to set up an industry here and makes profits from exports, he will be free of income tax.  Heretofore the position was that those people could if they wished remit immediately those profits to their home base or they could leave them here.  A substantial number of them have reinvested them here, but they could take them away and this was one of the promises made to them.  The effect of this section is that, if they reinvest in this country and at some stage decide to repatriate a portion of the investment arising from their profits, and sell off some portion of their assets and repatriate the money they gained from that sale, under this section they will become liable to capital gains tax at 26 per cent.  I believe that is the effect of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another serious effect of this.  Heretofore a substantial number of these industrialists reinvested their profits here but if this Bill is passed there will be a built-in inducement for them to take their profits as soon as they are earned and send them out of the country.  If they do this they will not pay tax, but if they reinvest their profits and then subsequently dispose of the assets at some form of gain&mdash; as the Bill is drafted with no provision for inflation they are likely to show a nominal gain&mdash;they will immediately be subject to capital gains tax.  The clear result of this will be that in future any such firms instead of reinvesting here will take their profits out fast.</P>
    <P>That, on top of what appears to be a breach of the undertakings given by successive Governments, by the IDA with the authority of successive Governments, <Col N="137" /> verbally and in writing, constitutes a most serious defect in this Bill.  At any time it would be extremely serious but it is difficult to visualise a time when it would be more serious than at present when we have at last count more than 100,000 unemployed and the figure almost certainly rising.  I think it would be fair to say that most people would find it incredible if the Government were to enact legislation to do this.  I hope the Minister can reassure us that that is not what this legislation is doing.  On the face of it, that is exactly what it is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been trying to make a laugh of any alternative system.  The undertaking given to investors from countries abroad was to exempt profits earned on exports from income taxation.  That is the only <Col N="138" /> undertaking which was given.  As I said last week, no sane person in the world assumes that any tax regime in any country will remain static and will never vary.  Businessmen do not make business decisions on the basis that tax regimes will never vary, unless some special contractual arrangement is entered into.  No undertaking has been given in respect of any taxation other than exemption from income taxation on profits from exports.</P>
      <P>I pointed out on the Second Stage that the only occasion when liability to capital gains tax arises will be when people are disposing of assets.  If foreigners come into this country succumbing to the bait of getting exemptions from taxation on their export profits, and avail of very generous capital grants which have to be paid for by the Irish people, I do not think it is wrong and the Government do not think it is wrong, that if such people decide to pull out of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not pull out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they should pay a capital gains tax of 26 per cent. If they do not pull out of the country but reinvest the proceeds of any disposal which they may have here of capital assets in the business, they will get roll-over relief.  I cannot accept Deputy Colley's suggestion that there is an element in our proposals to encourage people to bail out.  Quite the contrary.  If anything it encourages such people to stay in business here and if they are disposing of a business asset here to roll over the proceeds of that into further investment here.  As long as they do that they can continue to make handsome profits.</P>
      <P>If they try to withdraw from Ireland I cannot see that it is wrong for our people to recover part of the investment made, and part of the gain made by such people, and part of the capital investment by the Irish people by means of a capital gains tax.  I cannot say what the position in Japan is but the other significant foreign investors in this country all have capital gains tax and they are amazed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to discover that Ireland has not got a capital gains taxation system.  I am not aware that New Zealand is a significant investor in Ireland nor am I aware that Australia is.  Countries which are and which are well known to be, the United States of America, Britain, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Belgium, all the EEC countries, have a capital gains tax.  Canada has a capital gains tax and other countries which already have invested here, and may have even greater investments in the near future, Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden, have a capital gains tax.  It is extraordinary that Fianna Fáil seem to believe that the rest of the world is living in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</P>

      <P>I have said before and I say again to Deputy Colley that he does not enhance his cause by interrupting or by endeavouring to shout people down.  He should let his arguments stand or fall upon their inherent merits.  The IDA undertaking given to investors coming in here was to exempt from taxation profits on exports.  If the Deputy would read again what he read to the House, he would observe that the IDA pamphlet is very clear in stating what exemptions from taxation liability will be given.  It is also clear in pointing out that at the time the document was published there were no restrictions or disadvantages in relation to other matters.  The very fact that it said that put everybody on notice that that situation would not necessarily last forever.  No reasonable person assumes that tax codes will remain forever unchanged. It would be a most inequitable world in which the <i>status quo</i> was maintained forever and a day.</P>

The position now is that what the IDA have been telling potential foreign investors no longer holds true except in this instance; provided a foreign industrialist here repatriates his profits in their entirety the minute he makes them, then what the IDA told him will hold true.  If, as many of these people have done, thank goodness, he reinvests in this country, he is then caught and what the IDA told him becomes untrue.</P>

      <P>This is not the first time this happened in the short and tragic reign of this Government.  This is the second time.  The first time was when they made an announcement in relation to mining.  They made that announcement on a Friday.  There was an outcry and a very legitimate outcry from everyone who was inveigled into this country by the skill of the IDA over a long period of years.  So loud was the outcry even late on a Friday evening and all day Saturday that the IDA got on to the Government and said: &ldquo;For God's sake, tell them you have only broken your word in relation to mining and that you will not do it in relation to everyone else.&rdquo; That Sunday afternoon, less than 48 hours after this announcement in regard to mining, the Minister for the Gaeltacht was scheduled to open a factory&mdash;which had already been open for a year&mdash;at Shannon Airport and availed himself of the opportunity to assure&mdash;and I heard him&mdash;all industrialists at Shannon and elsewhere in Ireland who had come in under promises given by the IDA and SFADCo that despite what the Government were doing in regard to mining, they would not break their word in regard <Col N="142" /> to anything else and that industrialists at Shannon and elsewhere were safe and need not sell out and go home. We had hoped, and the IDA who had done so much for the country had hoped that was the end of it and that this Government of idiots had learned their lesson&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it would not happen again.  Now it has happened again.  I pity the IDA with the problems they are facing, trying to sell this country.  And this happens twice in less than two years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley was perfectly right when he posed this question in detail and at length.  The Minister stood up and prefaced all his remarks with abuse of Fianna Fáil and their alleged Toryism.  Deputy Colley said: &ldquo;We know what the answer is now.&rdquo;  How right he was.  But all the abuse from this Minister, who has been inflicted on and is afflicting this country for the past 23 months will not change the facts.  We have now a situation in which, for the second time, the solemn promises which the IDA were authorised to give by successive Governments to potential industrialists coming here have been broken.  It is not the fault of the IDA but of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only one way out for the IDA: they will now have to tell all industrialists&mdash;not just potential ones but all existing ones: &ldquo;Provided you immediately repatriate all your profit and leave nothing in this country you will be free of tax but if you leave it lying around it will become liable to capital gains tax.&rdquo;  In those circumstances any normal industrialist will take his money out and it is a tragedy for this country which, as I have constantly said, is totally under-capitalised, if that happens.  There is <Col N="143" /> capital available out of the profits of existing industries.  Most industrialists who have come in and have made profits have reinvested them.  It is still open to them to do this but they become subject to tax and the undertakings given to them by the IDA are broken.  They are entitled to go to the IDA in an aggrieved fashion and ask why this solemn promise was given and is now broken.  The only answer I can see from what the Minister has told Deputy Colley is, that provided they repatriate their profits immediately without investing them, take them out of the country as soon as they are made, they will not be subject to tax and the IDA will technically have kept its word in that regard.</P>
    <P>One of the things pointed out by the IDA as being equally important with total freedom from tax on profits is &ldquo;complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits&rdquo;, in other words, freedom in invest here as they saw fit or elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if they do that they will be acting differently from the way the vast majority of them have acted up to now and the losers are the people and the economy of this country.  In order to squeeze the last penny out of everyone with this tax the Minister, even at a time when the most glorious achievement of this Coalition Government is 101,000 unemployed, still goes after anyone that might make any gain or profit anywhere even though it may be people who came in here on positive assurances from the IDA given on the specific authority of successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mining episode and this measure have created a climate of uncertainty and doubt, a feeling that Ireland is no longer a safe place to go into because the present Government cannot be relied on, will change its mind from day-to-day or week-to-week; promises made and always honoured in the past are no longer kept; anything you are told by the IDA in good faith may be retracted a week, or a month or a year later. Ireland is no longer a place where the rules of the game are always kept; it is governed by a slightly &ldquo;chancy&rdquo; outfit who will change their minds at every whim and therefore Ireland, in the eyes of many industrialists who would otherwise have come here in <Col N="145" /> the past two years, is a place to steer clear of; if you are in doubt at all, you do not go in.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we had a very recent example of that very close to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and myself. That is Alcan which was to come to Aughinish Island or Foynes in County Limerick and which, according to the great speeches made some months ago when it was announced, was supposed to be in production in December, 1976.  We are told in today's papers that the earliest it could be in production, if it ever starts, is sometime in or after 1980.  The reasons are given.</P>
    <P>The feelings of industrialists in various parts of the world in relation to this country are now well-known.  In Canada particularly people are very cautious.  They have good reason to be cautious and it is not just coincidence that in Canada they are most cautious because they all know at first hand some of the things that have happened.</P>
    <P>This factor on its own would always be important but while it may not be of major importance it should not be glossed over by the Government in the flippant, arrogant way in which the Minister for Finance attempts to do these things.  This, combined with the mining episode, with the general growing doubt, the lack of confidence, the uncertainty of foreign investors and industrialists in relation to Ireland at present adds up to a situation in which our industrial development in future years will be seriously impaired and damaged.</P>
    <P>I have given you one example of it, Sir, which unfortunately, for both you and me is very close to home and is a serious loss to an area where the people thought it would be of major benefit.  There are many more of them but we never hear about a lot of them because, in a country like Canada, meetings will take place between people who have a business interest in Ireland and those who have been thinking of making an investment here in industry, mining or anything else.  We do not hear about these meetings, officially at any rate.  There <Col N="146" /> are no IDA men present and there are no Irish Embassy officials present. They are private meetings between individuals and it is as a result of those meetings that we hear, some time afterwards frequently, that the investments which could have been made are not being made.  These are the kinds of reasons why they are not being made.  These are the kinds of reasons why we have now 101,000 unemployed people, and that that figure is rising every week.  These are the kinds of reasons why we have a trade deficit of £504 million which shows no sign of abating.  These are the kinds of reasons also why private housebuilding has come almost to a stop, with everything consequent on that.  These are the kinds of reasons why this country is depressed, in every sense, why the people are depressed, annoyed and frustrated at what is happening here and to the prosperity and progress they knew previously. All those things add up and this is one of them.  This is not unimportant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Malley would not allow himself to be consumed with hatred of people who criticise his Administration then he might not lose his reason.  The reality, as distinct from the emotive, irresponsible, chatter of Deputy O'Malley, is that in 1975 industrial investment from abroad will be at the highest figure ever achieved.  As a consequence of that the State has to match the confidence of investors from abroad with an increase of 43 per cent in the amount of money advanced by the State for industrial development in 1975.  Those are the facts as distinct from the emotional abuse from Deputy O'Malley.  Not that I think house construction has anything to do with the remarks made by the IDA but, as he brought it in, the State is contributing another 30 per cent above last year's record investment in housing construction.  Therefore, it cannot be said that there is any lack of money for those purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the mining front this country has produced, in mining taxation, a scheme of taxes which is quite reasonable by any international standard, particularly compared with what now <Col N="147" /> obtains in Canada, the country to which Deputy O'Malley made so much reference.  I hope that if Deputy O'Malley has any further contribution to make on this or any other section of the Bill he will restrain himself from engaging in political abuse and will rely rather on the facts.  I want to deal with an allegation he made about profits earned on exports being liable to tax unless immediately repatriated.  Of course, that is not so. Any profits which are reinvested here would not become liable to tax, even when they are realised.  What would become liable to tax would be such gain as was made on those profits after they had been invested.  Thus, if, for instance, £100,000 worth of profits, instead of being taken immediately, were reinvested here and £10,000 were realised on that investment later on, it would be the £10,000 only that would be subject to tax at 26 per cent, not the £100,000. The allegation that the profits themselves are taxed is without foundation. As I have said already, there is no progressive country in the world&mdash;and unless a country is seen to be progressive and modern people will hesitate to invest in it&mdash;deserving of that name that has not long since a capital gains tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Malley made that suggestion because the Australian Government attempted to do, as Fianna Fáil intended <Col N="148" /> to do, and that was to introduce capital gains tax starting at 50 per cent.  But they saw the folly of that.  Apparently, while Fianna Fáil are ready to throw out some remarks about Australia, they have not taken the trouble to find out just what was faulty in what was proposed originally in Australia.  Leaving aside Australia and New Zealand which have not got a capital gains tax and, to that extent, are unique&mdash;any other comparable country has had such capital gains tax long since&mdash;I am glad that the day has now come when Ireland is moving, as every other sensible country has long since moved, towards bringing in a system of capital gains taxes.  Where people with comparatively small incomes are taxed at 26 per cent, 35 per cent and more, it is inexcusable that we should postpone the introduction of a capital gains tax to tax the gains made on investments. The allegations made here about the IDA are without any foundation, as the facts prove, as distinct from any irresponsible comment that may be made on them.</P>

My information is that they went round the world looking for another £40 million.  They went as far as Japan and could not get it.  They are seeking an investment of £40 million which has accounted for a great part of the delay.  The main point of this argument is that people who export reap a profit and if they invest that gain they will be taxed on it.  If they invest that money and the goods from that company are exported, that is tax free. However, if they sell off the property, should they be let off with all the profits?  They can take their profits, but I see no reason why they should not pay the capital gains tax.  Suppose they were to invest money in hotels&mdash; not the most profitable business, I agree, in the last eight years&mdash;or other businesses not connected with the export market, why should they be free of capital gains tax if they sell the business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that if increased exports were taxed we would be breaking our word, but not if the property is sold. Very often the enticement has been factories at very low prices along with grants from the State.  Some companies have got £1 million grants and the State has not got a penny back. How far do we have to go?  It might be better to give the people the money and not have them manufacturing at <Col N="150" /> all if that type of industry were to be encouraged.  As I say, if such companies are selling off for capital gain they must be treated as the Irish citizen is treated.</P>

      <P>It was, I suppose, a moment of light relief to hear the Minister for Finance advising Deputy O'Malley not to engage in political abuse and instead to stick to facts as given by the Minister for Finance. The facts to which he referred included the provision of a 30 per cent increase in the availability of money for housing this year.  He knows, as we do, what that represents in terms of additional houses&mdash;nothing.  He also referred to the increased provision for IDA grants.  The Minister knows that, allowing for inflation and allowing for the fact that industries in general now attracted by the IDA are far more capital-intensive than they have been and this is a tendency which will increase, what he is talking about in terms of money&mdash;and it is a projection for 1975, not a performance&mdash;is approximately the same level as in 1974 in terms of jobs, and I repeat it is a projection.</P>
      <P>The sad fact about all this discussion is that the Minister for Finance clearly does not understand what Deputy O'Malley was describing when he was talking about the climate for investment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, who was directly responsible for the IDA, should understand this.  I do not know whether he does or not&mdash;he may have ideological difficulties&mdash;but it is vitally important that the Minister for Finance should understand it, too, because it is the Minister for Finance who brought before this House the mining legislation referred to by Deputy O'Malley.  We are not talking about future mining; in fact, I have expressed the view that the rate of taxation imposed in that legislation is too small.  We are talking about going back on an undertaking given to existing mines and to existing industries. The Minister does not understand that even the suggestion of doing this affects the whole climate of investment, the whole operation of the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="151" /> I have personal experience of this, and I must confess I am absolutely appalled at the performance of this Government when it is repeated. Goodness knows they should have learned from what happened in mining, where the Minister and the Taoiseach and other Ministers had to get up one after the other and promise that they would give an undertaking in writing, although we had it in legislation, that the incentive for industrialists would not be taken away. I do not think the Minister has grasped the significance of the second point quoted by me and by Deputy O'Malley from the IDA brochure, and I shall quote it to him again:</P>
    <P>Complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue semantics on that, but I want to tell him&mdash; because he obviously does not know&mdash; what that means in practice to a potential industrialist from abroad who is going to invest here and create employment.  I have had these discussions with a number of these people myself and I know the questions they put to me.  What they say is: &ldquo;We know of other countries which have various inducements better than those available in Ireland, but they are no good to us because we have seen what they have done to people who went in.  They went in on the basis of the inducements and then the rules were changed.  They tied up our money so that we could not take it out, and they imposed this, that and the other restrictions afterwards.&rdquo; The thing they were vitally concerned with from their point of view was, what was the use of investing quite successfully in this country if the ultimate result was that they were not going to be able to repatriate the profits that were available?  Therefore they wanted a complete assurance on this.  That is why the IDA have said here: &ldquo;Complete freedom from Government control over investment of profits.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If you are to have complete freedom as to what you will do with your profits when you generate them, one <Col N="152" /> of the freedoms you must have is to repatriate them immediately.  Another is that, if you wish, you can reinvest them in this country.  Then if you do that, you may reach a stage where you will want to repatriate some either to your home base or to an investment in another country.  I am not describing a situation of selling out the whole operation, to which the Minister and Deputy Belton referred. I am describing where there is a portion of the operation being disposed of and the proceeds taken out of the country for whatever purpose.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in that case the capital gains tax applies only to the gain, but I pointed out to him that on the basis of inflation and his refusal to accept a built-in arrangement in this Bill for inflation, unless the money is invested in something like stocks and shares&mdash;which people of this kind do not invest in in this country; they invest in business and in real assets&mdash;any investment will show a nominal gain, so they will become liable to capital gains under this.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks he can argue semantics with these people and tell them what he is proposing to do is not a breach of what was promised to them, he is wasting his time.  This is what he apparently does not understand: it is the climate that is created that is important, and the climate which he and his colleagues are creating is, as Deputy O'Malley described it, one of distrust of this Government, distrust of the ability of the people dealing with us from abroad to rely on what is promised to them by and on the authority of the Government.</P>
    <P>Whatever problems we may have had under successive Governments in the past, we never had this one.  It is only under this Government that this problem has arisen.  Apart from whatever may be the opinion of people in this country, numerous people outside the country now find themselves in the position of not being able to depend fully on undertakings and assurances given by this Government.  That sort of situation is appalling in so far as our reputation and honour are concerned but it is worse from the point of view of the possibility of economic <Col N="153" /> development and growth and of industrial development.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that members of the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance do not seem to understand the importance of this.  In the past, in relation to undertakings given in respect of existing mines and, here again, the Minister demonstrates that he does not understand it is in the economic interest of this country that, even if the Government consider a particular deal to be a bad one, they should carry it through in order to maintain our reputation as people with whom a deal can be done and honoured.  If we lose that reputation we may never recover it.  Once it has happened, and it has happened under this Government on too many occasions, replacement of the Government will not solve the problem because so far as investors abroad are concerned it is something that can happen again. Is is of no interest to those people whether Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour are in Office.  They are dealing with the Irish Government and to them one is the same as the other.</P>
    <P>Up to the advent of this Coalition whatever Government were in Office, we had one reputation of which we could be proud, that was that anybody who made a deal with an Irish Government could be sure that deal would be honoured and that there would be no attempt by way of clever semantics or otherwise to go back on the spirit of the agreement.</P>
    <P>With all the sincerity at my command I impress on the Minister that what he is proposing in this section is very clearly in breach of the spirit and, to some extent, the letter, of the undertakings given to the various industrialists who have invested here. I am referring to undertaking given by the previous Governments, by previous Ministers and by the IDA.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this which was referred to both by the Minister and by Deputy Belton and which revealed a great deal.  Each of them asked why, if these people are taking their assets out, they should not pay capital gains tax.  That is a plausible argument but I would remind the Minister of the undertaking that <Col N="154" /> was given to such people.  This was that they could have complete freedom in regard to the investment of their profits, whether here or abroad. To suggest that one can advance theoretical arguments or alleged arguments of equity, as the Minister endeavoured to do, to justify this is to miss the wood for the trees.  These undertakings were given to these people most of whom, surprisingly, reinvested their profits in this country.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister may say about undertakings, about the wording of them or about the wording here, he cannot deny, as indicated by Deputy O'Malley, that a foreign investor faced with the choice of reinvesting his profits productively in this country and paying capital gains tax ultimately or, alternatively repatriating his profits immediately free of tax, will opt for the latter course. It is obvious that he would do so. Can the Minister suggest seriously that it is in the best economic interest of this country that this should be so?  There is no point in talking of equity in taxation if what the Minister is doing in trying to achieve equity is reducing the national cake. That is creating inequity.  I did not believe that we would ever see such a situation here.  On another occasion when the Minister was arguing in favour of the principle that comparable incomes should pay comparable tax, I said to him that if he could carry that to its logical conclusion he would find himself abolishing the export tax relief.  The Minister became very annoyed and said I was being mischievious. However, here he is trying to advance a somewhat similar argument to justify what is happening but the effect of what he is doing can be disastrous.</P>
    <P>One could break this into two parts. First, there is the situation of those firms who have invested already in this country on the basis of the IDA, Government-authorised inducement and the second category could be those who may do so in the future. To take the first category, I suggest there is no answer but that such people will regard, and rightly so, the consequences of this section as <Col N="155" /> a breach of the undertakings given to them.  In my view that is a totally indefensible, untenable position.  In respect of the second category, those who may invest in the future, the Minister would be on strong ground in saying that this taxation would be applied.  He would be wrong in saying that but at least there would not be any question of a breach of an undertaking and of the horrible consequences that could result for all our people from any such breach.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that if the Minister were to consult with the IDA who are in the field in this area&mdash;I have no knowledge of what is their view on what the Minister is proposing&mdash; their view would be that, in relation to people whom they are trying to induce to come here and help to reduce the appalling problem of unemployment, they will have their hands tied if this section goes through as it stands.  They will have to tell people that they could reinvest in the country but that should they make profits they will have to pay tax, whereas if they took their profits out quickly they would not pay any tax. Surely the Minister cannot suggest that is something that is in the economic interest of the people and, in particular, of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to think again about this section.  The consequences of what was done in the past were serious but the consequences of doing the same kind of thing again are incalculable. The damage would be very serious.  We have built up our economy, given it a much broader base and made it strong but there is a limit to what it can stand.  I am afraid that under this Government which seems to be lacking so much regarding knowledge of what is needed in order to induce investment and get our economy moving, that even the strength that was built into our economy in recent years will not be sufficient to stand the strain being imposed on it by this unthinking approach which appears to be totally ignorant of the importance of a suitable climate for investment and of the major role of the Government&mdash;or any Government&mdash;in creating that climate. <Col N="156" /> That being so, I have not a great deal of hope that the Minister will see the light.  I hope he will, but if he does not, I want to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House saw the light and warned him.  We did our best, but despite all these warnings, the Minister went on, backed by his colleagues, each of whom will be responsible directly for the consequences of what is involved in this section and what it will do to investment here and to our unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On 15th November last I asked the Minister for Education when he proposed to fill the position of Headmaster at Portlaoise Vocational School, County Laois; and if he would make a statement on the failure of the vocational committee to fill this vacancy.  The Minister, in his reply, said:</P>
      <P>The question of the filling of the vacancy for a principal teacher in Portlaoise Vocational School has been the subject of correspondence between my Department and the County Laois Vocational Education Committee for some time.  The committee have not yet submitted a proposal in the matter of which I can approve in accordance with established practice, procedure and regulations.</P>
      <P>By way of supplementary I agreed, but asked if he was aware that the vocational education committee were in a direct challenging position to him. He replied:</P>
      <P>I intend taking steps in the near future to remedy the situation once and for all.</P>
      <P>I asked him if he could give me any idea of what steps he intended taking. I pointed out that the situation called for strong action because the committee had decided against implementing his directive.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might like to wait and see what happens.</P>
      <P>I said we had been waiting for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> It is because we have been waiting a long time that I sought permission this afternoon to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I want to take the opportunity of thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, for providing that facility.  I have a feeling that the Minister may also welcome this opportunity of making a comment on the matter.  This problem has been with him and the parents and teachers of the Portlaoise vocational schools since June last year when the former headmaster retired.  Following an advertisement, the former vocational committee, which was controlled by a political group made up of supporters of the Minister's party, set up a selection committee who made no recommendations to it.  They, in turn, submitted recommendations for approval to the Minister.  Their number one recommendation, Mr. Parsons, was not qualified for appointment to the position of headmaster under memo V7 of the Department.</P>

However, I will endeavour to avoid mentioning names but this will be difficult.</P>

      <P>Most of the local papers in my constituency are full of this and names have been bandied about to a great extent.  I am sure the Minister will have read cuttings from these papers.  However, I will avoid mentioning names in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man recommended did not qualify for appointment under departmental <Col N="158" /> regulations for appointment. Although I was not a member of the committee&mdash;nor was any member of my political party&mdash;I understand that an alternative was selected.  It transpired that this successful candidate had not the necessary qualifications for the job.  As a result, the Minister refused sanction and told the committee they would have to submit the name of another applicant who is qualified under the regulations.  At the July vocational committee meeting there was a reply from the Department refusing to sanction their choice.</P>
    <P>A new vocational education committee had been elected, on which a certain number of Fianna Fáil nominees had succeeded in being appointed. Since then we have had a rebellion against the Minister's decision by nine votes to five.  The five people who consistently supported the Minister's view, as laid down by the regulations, have been four Fianna Fáil nominees and a nominee from a Labour county council.  The reaction of this new committee to the Department's refusal was to appoint their successful applicant as a teacher in charge.  This was not acceptable to the Minister and he conveyed that to the committee.  Their reaction by a nine to five majority, was to appoint their selection as acting principal.  He could not be appointed because, under the regulations, he needed five year's teaching experience but had only four.  His appointment as acting principal arose because the Department had replied that there was no such position as teacher in charge.</P>
    <P>At the September meeting the Department's reply to that decision said they could not sanction that proposal and called for the filling of the headmaster's position as per memo V7, paragraph 126.  That letter went on to say that the candidate placed next by the selection board should, in the normal course, be appointed because he was qualified.  However, the rebellious committee, by a majority of nine to five, reaffirmed its previous decision. The local paper commented that the Minister should now disband the committee or eat humble pie and let the committee have its way.</P>
    <P>A leading councillor&mdash;not the chairman, <Col N="159" /> Deputy Flanagan, who is the leader of the rebellious group, and I am pleased he is here to hear my comments&mdash;has already had a hand in creating a committee of agriculture which turned out to be illegal, in appointing co-options&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to give the House an idea of the type of man with whom we are dealing.  I am showing the type of man who is rebelling against the Minister.  He said the committee is facing serious inroads into its authority, that it should stand firm behind its decisions and reject the Minister's recommendation.  He is more conscious of the authority of the vocational education committee than of the authority of the Minister of State dealing with education.  The same councillor went on to attack the Department of Education for its discourtesy in saying that they could not do what they wanted to do and reiterated that the vocational education committee in Laois was the boss as far as this was concerned.  In November there was a headline in the local paper &ldquo;Vocational Education Committee continues to defy Minister&rdquo;.  It went on to say that despite a threat from the Minister that unless the matter was satisfactorily resolved he would have seriously to consider invoking the relevant powers conferred on him by the Vocational Education Acts.  The Chairman of the vocational education committee, Deputy O. J. Flanagan&mdash;he is in the House&mdash; quoted from letters he had had from the Minister on October 4th and, again, on October 23rd.  He indicated that the Minister had requested a special meeting to go ahead and authorise what he was recommending. Deputy Flanagan indicated at the meeting that he had replied to the Minister that there was no need for a special meeting in view of the fact that they had no intention of implementing the Minister's requirements or directives.  The other councillor, the leading big wig in Fine Gael to whom I have already referred, presented a long-winded justifying letter and it was <Col N="160" /> circulated to the committee.  As a result the Minister instructed one of his officials or the Secretary of his Department to write back and this letter came before the December meeting as the final proposition by the Minister.  This was after I had raised this matter in the House.  The letter said that unless the committee at its next meeting, which he anticipated would be held on Monday, December 9th, adopted a proposal of which the Minister could approve the Minister would be left with no alternative but, without further correspondence with the committee in the matter, to set in train the procedures which could lead to the committee being dissolved in accordance with the provisions of the Vocational Education Acts.</P>
      <P>What was the reaction of the Laois Vocational Education Committee chaired by Deputy Flanagan?  That the committee instruct their legal adviser to initiate legal proceedings in the High Court regarding the appointment of the proposed headmaster.  Nine out of 14 of the committee stood on their dignity and would not be dictated to by the Minister who, in this case, was endeavouring to carry out the regulations as laid down by him and by his predecessors.</P>
      <P>The report of the January meeting was a very small report in my local paper which said that the committee were still awaiting the legal adviser's report.  There was nothing on the agenda.</P>
      <P>A meeting of the vocational education committee was held in Rathdowney today.  The chairman was not there but his mouthpiece acted as chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>He indicated to today's meeting that he could not possibly continue to be an active member of a committee which was acting totally against regulations.  He withdrew from the meeting and said he would not return to a meeting of the committee until this was resolved.  His example was followed by three other members of the committee.  I was unaware when I asked to raise this matter on the Adjournment that this had occurred. The acting chairman indicated that he was instructing the CEO not to notify the four members who left the meeting today of any further meetings of the vocational education committee and that he would be moving as soon as possible for their replacement on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings up an interesting point because the previous vocational education committee, which was made up completely of Fine Gael people, were not in agreement with each other in relation to the original appointment of the gentleman the Laois VEC want to see appointed despite <Col N="162" /> the regulations.  Three former councillors and a Fine Gael man who was a candidate for the council at the last election had all opposed the decision to appoint this non-qualified man during the term of the old committee. One is tempted to ask where are they now to back the other people who are opposing this.  They are not on the committee.  Those four people, although they were all qualified for reappointment, were all removed from that committee in the reshuffle and one of them is another Deputy of the House, Deputy McDonald.  He was removed because he did not agree with the rebellion against the Minister and against the regulations.  There are many people in rebellion against the Minister under various headings.  The Minister said today at Question Time that it is not unusual for him to be worried about a number of things.</P>

      <P>I have waited since the 10th November for action by the Minister.  I am conscious that he is anxious to do the proper thing but he is being thwarted. I know an approach was made by representatives of the people in favour of the man who is not qualified asking him to withdraw voluntarily and make the job easy for them but I understand that has not happened.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say by way of reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has given a fairly accurate version of what has happened.  I should also like to put on the record, so that everybody concerned may know precisely what has happened, what are the facts in the case.  An advertisement was published in the public press in April, 1974, and in it the County Laois VEC invited:</P>
      <P>Applications from suitably qualified candidates for the position of principal of Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
      <P>It was also stated in the advertisement:</P>
      <P>Qualifications and conditions of appointment as set out in paragraph 12 (b) and Appendix C (ii) Memo. V.7 of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Memorandum V.7 is a document issued by my Department which governs the appointment, qualifications and scales of salary of permanent full-time teachers under vocational education committees.  The memorandum also covers appointments in the case of whole-time teachers permanently established to posts of responsibility in such schools, including posts as principal and vice-principal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advertisement specified that the qualifications and conditions of appointment, as I said, for the post would be those set out in the paragraphs I have mentioned.  Paragraph <Col N="164" /> 12 (b) of the memorandum in operation at the time of the advertisement read as follows:</P>
    <P>The person appointed to any post as principal should be a fully qualified teacher with a capacity for organising.  The choice of teacher will depend on the requirements of the centre, but should be such that he can be employed at the centre for the appropriate number of teaching hours.  In the case of a school with a points rating over 449, the person appointed should have not less than five years whole-time teaching experience preferably in the vocational education service. In the case of a school with points rating up to 449, the period of whole-time teaching experience should be not less than three years.</P>
    <P>The points rating of Portlaoise Vocational School exceeded 449 at the time and still does and pursuant to the above terms of paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7 the requirements that a person appointed to the post should have not less than five years whole-time teaching experience in the vocational education service was applicable in the case.</P>
    <P>According to information supplied to my Department, the County Laois VEC received nine applications for the post in response to their advertisement. In accordance with normal practice the candidates were called for interview by a central selection board on 17th May, 1974.  In accordance with established practice, the central selection board consisted of seven members, four nominated by the County Laois VEC and including their chairman, one representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and two officers of my Department.</P>
    <P>The selection board reduced the candidates for that post to a first and second choice.  The order in which these two candidates were placed by the four nominees of the VEC on the selection board was not acceptable to the other three members of the board, namely, the representative of the Irish Vocational Education Association and my two nominees, because the candidate placed first by the VEC <Col N="165" /> nominees did not have the minimum of five years whole-time teaching experience required by the terms of paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7, whereas the candidate placed second by the VEC nominees complied with this and the other requirements for the post.  In the event, the report of the meeting of the selection board on 17th May, 1974 was signed only by the four nominees of the VEC and also by the committee's chief executive officer as secretary to the selection board but not by the other three members of the board.</P>
    <P>The first choice candidate of the members of the VEC on the selection board is a permanent whole-time teacher of English and History and has been in the whole-time employment of County Laois VEC since September, 1971.  He was previously employed on a temporary basis as a teacher in Terenure College, Dublin from September, 1970 to June, 1971. He has not, therefore, the minimum of five years whole-time teaching experience required by the terms of paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7.</P>
    <P>The second choice candidate of the members of the VEC on the selection board is a permanent whole-time teacher of Science who has been in the whole-time employment of County Laois VEC since October, 1963.  He, therefore, complies with the requirement of five years whole-time teaching experience prescribed in paragraph 12 (b) of Memorandum V.7.</P>
    <P>On 20th May, 1974 the chief executive officer of the committee wrote to the Department indicating that, notwithstanding the views expressed by the IVEA representative and my nominees at the meeting of the selection board on 17th May, 1974 the VEC members on the board had selected as their first choice the candidate who did not fulfil the requirement in respect of teaching experience. The CEO requested an indication of the Department's view in the matter in time for the meeting of the VEC on 9th June, 1974 at which the selection would be considered.</P>
    <P>The Department replied to the CEO on 30th May, 1974 stating that the <Col N="166" /> first choice candidate was ineligible for appointment as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School.  The meeting of the VEC, at which the appointment was considered, was held on 12th June, 1974 and the report of their selection board, signed only, as I have said, by the four nominees of the VEC on the board was before the meeting, as was the Department's letter of 30th May, 1974.  Two proposals as follows were proposed and seconded for consideration by the Committee:</P>
    <P>The First: &ldquo;That the report of the selection board be adopted and the Committee now approve of the appointment of (the selection board's named first choice) as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School from 1st September, 1974.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Second (an amendment): That (the selection board's named second choice) be appointed to the post of principal, Portlaoise Vocational School as from 1st September, 1974.</P>
    <P>The amendment was put and defeated on a show of hands by eight votes to four.  The original motion was carried by the same majority.  The chairman, accordingly, declared the first choice candidate appointed to the post as principal, Portlaoise Vocational School with effect from 1st September, 1974 &ldquo;subject to sanction of the Minister for Education&rdquo;.  My Department informed the VEC by letter dated 5th July, 1974 that it was not open to the Department to sanction the first choice candidate's appointment for the reason set out in their letter of 30th May, 1974, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In the minutes of the committee's meeting on 8th July, 1974 it was stated that the committee would not accept the fact that the first choice candidate was ineligible in accordance with the terms of Memorandum V.7.  A motion at the meeting that the first choice candidate be appointed as principal teacher in charge was carried by nine votes to two, and an amendment that the second choice candidate be appointed teacher in charge was defeated by the same vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> The next letter from the Department to the VEC in the matter was dated 29th August, 1974.  This letter made it clear that there was not included amongst posts of responsibility in vocational schools a post carrying the title of principal teacher in charge and again pointed out that the first choice candidate was not eligible for appointment as principal of Portlaoise Vocational School.</P>
    <P>The next proposal which my Department received from the VEC following the committee's meeting on 9th September, 1974&mdash;a proposal carried by nine votes to five&mdash;was that the first choice candidate be appointed as acting principal without remuneration as from 10th September, 1974. An amendment that the second choice candidate be appointed to the post of principal as advertised was defeated by the same majority.</P>
    <P>The committee were informed in writing on 18th September, 1974 that this new proposal could not be sanctioned by the Department.  The Department stressed in the same letter that it was essential in the interests of the pupils concerned that the vacant post of principal of Portlaoise Vocational School should be filled immediately in accordance with the provisions of Memorandum V.7 particularly paragraph 12 (b) thereof.  It was stated, too, that the Department considered that as the first choice candidate was not eligible for the post, the candidate placed next in order of choice should be appointed since he was fully qualified and eligible for the post.</P>
    <P>No further progress has been made in the matter despite further correspondence <Col N="168" /> between my Department and the committee.  The central point at issue, which was conveyed by my Department to the VEC in a letter dated 5th December, 1974, is that notwithstanding the availability of the candidate who fulfills the requirements for the post of principal in accordance with the Committee's own advertisement and in accordance with the relevant terms of the Department's Memorandum V.7, the VEC have persisted in proposing that the post be filled in some form or another by a candidate who does not comply with the requirement applicable to Portlaoise Vocational School that the person appointed should have not less than five years whole-time teaching experience.  It has been stated unequivocally to the committee in that letter that while there is a candidate available who satisfies the conditions for appointment as principal in accordance with normal procedures, I, as Minister for Education, will not sanction the filling of the post on any other basis.</P>
    <P>The present position, as I understand it, and I am not informed as to the events of today, which were brought to my attention by the Deputy this evening, is that the County Laois Vocational Education Committee are seeking legal advice as to the propriety of their own actions in the whole matter.  I expect to be informed of the outcome of their inquiries without delay.  When this information is conveyed to me I will then be in a position to make a determination in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 12th February, 1975.</P>
