      <P>As I informed the Deputy by letter on 20th November last, this person had been in receipt of unemployment assistance up to his attainment of age 69 years on 14th September, 1974.  Payment of assistance was then discontinued because it appeared that he was not entitled to either contributory or non-contributory old age pension.  In this connection the position is that the practice in my Department is to continue payment of benefit or assistance such as unemployment assistance pending determination of title to pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned then requested <Col N="14" /> that his title to old age (non-contributory) pension should be reinvestigated. The reinvestigation has since been completed and a recommendation made to the pension committee that he be awarded a non-contributory old age pension at the full rate of £7.30 from 5th July, 1974. In accordance with practice, a pension book has been issued to him provisionally in advance of the committee's decision.  The arrears of pension due, less the transitional unemployment assistance payments, will issue shortly.  I understand that both the person concerned and his wife are already in receipt of British retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's representations, with the exception of the letter of the 7th December, were fully replied to.

      <P>No.  There is no authorisation from the EEC.  As the <Col N="17" /> Deputy is aware, it is primarily a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and is administered by three Departments&mdash;Social Welfare, Health and the Department of Defence. However, the scheme originated in the EEC and unless a decision is made by the Council of Ministers there is no authorisation to continue it.</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary agree that, seeing that it was general knowledge that the scheme would terminate on 31st December, 1974, it is rather late in the day to have it coming before the EEC in the middle of January?  Would he not agree it would have been a much more reasonable approach to this matter to put whatever pressure was necessary on the EEC prior to the termination of the scheme so that people would not be without their butter vouchers in the middle of January?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it was stated specifically in the House when the scheme was introduced that it was an EEC scheme over which this Government, on its own, had no control, and that it was not meant as a permanent feature.  It was introduced because of a number of circumstances which existed at the time.  This matter, I understand, will again be coming before the Council of Ministers, but it is not possible to give any further information pending the outcome of that meeting.</P>

I am aware that two payments of £50,000 each were paid on 3rd and 10th January, but there was a debit balance of £80,000 due to Carlow because the sum which they required in excess of what they had asked for in 1974 could not be cleared by 31st December, but having paid the <Col N="19" /> £80,000 they would still have £20,000 at present without getting the full allocation or anything like it for 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated in this House and elsewhere that a comprehensive review of the rating system is in hands.  In the meantime substantial relief has been given to rate-payers by decisions taken by the Government in relation to health and housing charges and decrees for malicious injuries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Among other promises made, the Minister, I think, promised to abolish ground rents.  Is there any reason why, having lifted that item from Fianna Fáil policy, he would not also lift their policy on the abolition of rates on private dwellings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to discuss the matter I <Col N="26" /> shall be only too delighted to discuss it. The question related to private dwellings only and did not include small businesses or anything else.  If Deputy Andrews has another look at it I think he will find it was not exactly what he meant.  Let me say now that, because of what this Government have done, the average amount by which rates in the £ will be struck for 1975 will be £4 less than they would have been if Fianna Fáil were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of that fraudulent reply would the Minister not tell the truth to the House?  When does he intend to abolish rates on private dwellings?  If he goes to any householder in any part of the country and tells that householder the rates position has been improved he will be kicked out the front door.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <P>The Dáil will have learned with deep regret of the death of two senior Members during the Christmas recess, Deputies Michael F. Kitt and John Geoghegan.  The circumstances of their deaths were particularly distressing in that they represented adjoining constituencies, North East Galway and West Galway, and neither of <Col N="42" /> them was old by contemporary standards.</P>
    <P>The two Deputies had a long and impressive history of dedicated service at national and local level.  Deputy Kitt was a member of the 13th Dáil from 1948 until 1951 and again entered the Dáil in 1957 where he served until his death.  Deputy Geoghegan entered the 15th Dáil in 1954 and represented the constituency of Galway West ever since.  They both served as Parliamentary Secretaries in the 19th Dáil from 1970-1973; Deputy Kitt served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht and Deputy Geoghegan as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare and they each brought their considerable personal talents to bear on these areas of social and cultural development, to which they were deeply committed.  For over 20 years, they represented their constituency areas on Galway County Council and served on a variety of council committees, particularly those dealing with health and educational matters. Both Deputies had a keen interest in educational and cultural affairs, and Deputy Kitt was actively associated with various Irish cultural organisations and with the Gaelic Athletic Association.  He was a vice-chairman of the Galway/Mayo Development Board, a director of the National Rehabilitation Board, and a member of the Governing Body of University College, Galway.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> The main purpose of this Bill is to provide improved protection for young persons and children by regulating their conditions of employment. In setting the minimum age for entry to employment at 15 years, the Bill sets out to remove an anomaly whereby the existing minimum age for entry to employment is 14 years although the school-leaving age has been raised to 15 years.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of the Bill, those in the 15 to 18 age-group are regarded as young persons and those under 15 as children.  The term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in the Bill relates to both categories.</P>
    <P>This is the first piece of legislation to protect young workers for over 30 years.  The effectiveness of this legislation will be monitored closely and in this respect the enforcing inspectorate will have a role and if facts are disclosed that amendments should prove necessary I will not hesitate to introduce these.</P>
    <P>It must be acknowledged that the full facts of youth employment in this country are not known.  Our statistics do not provide enough detail related to youth.  The Bill, when enacted, by compelling employers to maintain records, will furnish for the first time hard facts in place of present surmise. While the worst exploitation of child labour occurred in the 19th century, it would be naïve to think that all traces of the unscrupulous use of the labour of children has disappeared.  My Department officers have received complaints about the use of children over long hours for low wages, with the complicity of parents or guardians in many cases.  Often, too, the local community do not question, indeed in some instances approve of, young persons working over long hours.</P>
    <P>If the worst excesses of exploitation of child labour belong to another century, we must not close our eyes to new forms of exploitation which, superficially, might appear attractive in money terms to young people.  I have in mind here the vast expansion and changes which have occurred in the distributive trade leading to the establishment of large supermarkets, off-licences and liquor stores requiring <Col N="45" /> personnel who are not concerned unduly with long hours of work and low hourly payments.  Many young people fall into this category.</P>
    <P>Generally in our system of employer/employee relations the trade union organisation is expected to provide the organisational shield to safeguard individual and collective rights in the workplace.  In the instances I have mentioned, however, trade union organisation has not kept pace with the proliferation of these new distributive forms.  I do not wish to suggest that the young people working in these areas are all victims of vicious exploitation but I would indicate that on the facts available, we have received numerous complaints respecting employment conditions in supermarkets, publichouses, catering establishments, petrol service stations and the services industrial sector generally.  A large proportion of the young people in such work are girls.</P>
    <P>When we consider the question of youth employment, by which I mean all those at work under the age of 18, we find the great class division in our society asserting itself.  The children of parents below a certain income depart for unskilled employment trained for no specific purpose and lacking the skills necessary to ensure a future career with security and adequate remuneration. That is why I have been so anxious to expand the national training programme so as to alter this sad scheme of things.  Great strides have been made during the past two years in expanding our direct training capacity but the need to be met remains a vast one.  The children of the parents I have mentioned in Ireland find little institutional assistance, certainly no assistance commensurate with the effort required to break from the fate ordained for them by virtue of their parents financial and social status.  The children of the unskilled remain unskilled.  The culturally under-privileged of one generation belong to the same category in the next.  It would be a gross underestimation of the size of this problem to suppose that this Bill faces up to these issues.  The Bill simply confronts some of the problems posed when <Col N="46" /> young people leave school for industrial or other work, establishing certain minimum conditions which must apply.</P>
    <P>Like the rest of us in the consumer society, young people are subject to the same pressures designed to make them addicts of the values of the acquisitive society.  They are urged to emulate the mistakes of their elders to become hooked on a gadget-obsessed society.  Under the guise of rejecting that society and its values the pop prophets of the consumer-orientated youth culture preach a new set of possessions, the gadgets and props of their alternative order.  At any rate it can be said that many young people are coerced into over-spending and in the event are not concerned about the hours they work or the conditions attached provided there is some financial reward.</P>
    <P>The enforcing agency will be the inspectorate which during the past year I have increased by an appreciable number.  As indicated already, further legislation may be considered in this area when we are in full possession of all the facts since up to now we have not specifically addressed ourselves in legislation in this Parliament to the question of young people at work.</P>
    <P>The passage of the Bill should cause us to think once more of the problems of our young people at work in foreign countries either on a permanent basis or during school holidays.  While net emigration has virtually ceased in recent years, an alarming proportion of the outflow has constituted a consistent proportion of young people, girls and boys under the age of 18, many from rural parts of this country. While great credit must go to the many voluntary agencies working on questions related to this in England, one is left with the impression that under present arrangements the possibility of great hardships being undergone by young people working for long hours in England is still with us. Even in the case of those who have not left education permanently, one is left with the impression that students, whether at secondary level or university, in their efforts to obtain as large <Col N="47" /> a sum of money as possible during the holiday period are forced to work abnormal hours which must have serious adverse consequences both on their application to study and their health.</P>
    <P>I have asked our labour attaché, appointed by me, in London to report on this aspect of the situation.  The Committee on Emigrants attached to my Department have also examined it.  Outside England in this connection I have had thorough examinations carried out of, for example, on the working conditions of potato-pickers in Scotland and of our trainee hotel workers in Switzerland.  Generally, a reform Government must examine all areas of potential improvement.  Up to a relatively recent date young people were considered to be cared for adequately if sufficient swimming-pools or recreation areas were provided, not that these have been provided adequately either.  While there have been improvements in this area and while this aspect is important, it would be true to say that the requirements of young people at work were not considered.</P>
    <P>Our decision to give votes to young people at 18 must lead to a more serious analysis of young people in our society, their needs and how our laws must serve those needs.  We live in a country which has more young people living within the State's boundaries than at any other time in the State's history.  It is not realised that a revolution in the age composition of our population is taking place. Whether our institutions are facing up to this changing pattern is an open question.</P>
    <P>I had been considering proposals for an Hours of Work Act which would have regulated the working hours, rest intervals and other conditions of most employees, irrespective of age.  Extensive consultations about those proposals were conducted with employer and employee interests.  Due to the diversity of employment patterns throughout various sectors of the economy, many problems arose in trying to reconcile the views of all interests in one piece of general legislation. <Col N="48" /> Since it would take a considerable time to resolve these problems, I became concerned that the implementation of the provisions dealing with the protection of young persons might be further delayed.  I felt, therefore, that effect should be given quickly to those parts of the original proposals which deal specifically with the interests of young persons in employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill reflects both modern trends in employment conditions and various international standards designed for the protection of young people.  The enactment of the Bill will represent a significant innovatory step in this area and will enable three International Labour Organisation Conventions to be ratified by Ireland. These are the conventions relating to night work of young persons both in industrial and in non-industrial occupations and the Minimum Age Convention.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will have very wide application and will cover young persons in almost all forms of employment.  Limited exceptions are proposed in respect of a few categories of workers, where the nature of their activities would pose serious problems of application.  These are confined to young persons employed as fishermen, lighthouse keepers, seafarers and members of the Defence Forces.  I am taking power to bring excluded categories within the scope of the legislation if this appears desirable at a future time.</P>
    <P>While statistics do not exist which could be related directly to the scope of the Bill, it has been estimated that roughly 65,000 young employees in the age groups 15 years to 18 years, would be covered by its provisions. Many of these have already had the protection of the relevant provisions of the Conditions of Employment Acts 1936-1944 and the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts 1938-1942. However, approximately one third of this total will be brought within the scope of this protective legislation for the first time.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 of this Bill, the employment of children under 15 years will be generally prohibited.  I recognise that for young people at <Col N="49" /> school some familiarity with the working environment can be an important educational experience.  As an exception to the minimum employment age of 15, children of more than 14 years will be allowed to do light non-industrial work for up to two hours a day outside school hours and up to seven hours a day during holidays subject to a maximum of 35 hours per week, provided the work is not harmful to their health or normal development. Neither must it prejudice their attendance or performance at school.</P>
    <P>There were suggestions that the employment of children under school-leaving age should be regulated by a licensing arrangement but I believe that this would merely serve to create a cumbersome bureaucratic arrangement which, in the context of my proposals, would relate to but one year's employment between 14 and 15 years.  The conditions which will be attached to the employment of children in that age group will act as adequate safeguards.</P>
    <P>I have considered it desirable in section 6 to take power to specify a higher minimum age for entry to employment in respect of any work which might endanger the health or safety of young persons.  This power, which would only be exercised after consultation with the social partners, gives me a measure of flexibility in dealing with special situations.  The provision is in line with the thinking of the International Labour Organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 5 requires employers to obtain proper evidence of age before they take children or young persons into employment.  They are also required to keep records of ages, working times and rates of pay.  These requirements have been strengthened to facilitate enforcement.  Contraventions by employers and complicity by parents or guardians will be offences. I expect that the application of this provision will enable me to monitor the conditions of employment of those concerned and should the need arise further corrective measures will be taken.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 deal with maximum working hours for young persons <Col N="50" /> and section 9 covers their normal working hours.  The main point to which I would like to draw the attention of Deputies is the more favourable provisions under both headings for young persons under 16 years.  I consider that these young people, undertaking their first experience of full-time employment, are deserving of special consideration and these provisions will help to assist in their transition into the working environment. There are provisions in sections 7 and 9 for averaging hours within the over-riding limits in accordance with the terms of collective agreements, employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements but I have not made any such provision in section 8 because it would, in my view, be inappropriate for young persons under 16 years.</P>
    <P>Intervals for rest are specified in sections 11 and 12.  Following a period of five hours' work, an employee must be allowed an unpaid half-hour's break.</P>
    <P>Before commencing overtime expected to last more than 1½ hours, an employee must get an unpaid break of half an hour.  This particular break may be varied by agreement provided the revised break is not less than 15 minutes and is paid for.  In addition, an employee who works more than five days in a week and more than three hours on a Sunday must be allowed a 24-hour break, without pay, every seven days.</P>
    <P>There are restrictions in sections 13 and 14 of the Bill on the employment of children and young persons at night.  The enactment of these provisions will enable us to ratify the ILO conventions on night work to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the provisions of this legislation, if passed, would fall to the inspectors of my Department. Section 26 gives them the usual powers for this purpose.  Sections 21 to 23 deal with prosecutions and penalties.  Read together with sections 5 and 25, which relate to evidence of age and the keeping of records, I think that my intention will be clear that this law should be observed.  While I have referred to the formal provisions <Col N="51" /> related to enforcement, I would welcome the co-operation of all sections of the community in ensuring that the very necessary provisions of this Bill will be observed in both the letter and the spirit of the law.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that this legislation, as a flexible instrument of social reform, can be adjusted in accordance with the special requirements of particular sectors of employment, I have taken powers in the Bill to give exemptions by regulations.</P>
    <P>This would follow consultations with the appropriate workers' and employers' organisations.  I should make it clear that such powers of modification would be used only in cases where I am convinced by the evidence presented that special measures are essential.  There is also a requirement in section 27 that drafts of orders in relation to major alterations in the sections which deal with the non-application of the Act, maximum hours and normal hours, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with a view to securing their approval by means of affirmative resolution.  In this way, it will not be necessary to introduce amending legislation on each occasion when a major change under any of these headings is being made while ensuring at the same time that the Oireachtas retains full control over such changes.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the wider scope of the Bill as compared with existing legislation.  This is a major improvement in itself.  In addition, various standards laid down in the Bill have also been improved in favour of the young employee.  Compared with the Conditions of Employment Acts, 1936-1944, which cover mainly industrial work, there are changes in relation to minimum age, maximum and normal working hours of young persons under 16 years and in night work restrictions.  The changes favourable to employees are more marked when the provisions of the Bill are compared with the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Acts, 1938-1942, covering employees in shops, hotels, restaurants and similar establishments. <Col N="52" /> In this case, the changes relate to minimum age, maximum and normal working hours for all young employees and night work restrictions.  It will be noted from section 19 that where hours of work have to be reduced in order to comply with the provisions of the Act, there would be no reduction permitted in the remuneration due to the employee.</P>
    <P>Taking the Bill as a whole, the House will, I hope agree that its provisions represent a positive legislative advance in the conditions of employment of children and young persons. It is also a straightforward piece of legislation which will afford flexibility for modifications in appropriate cases. For these reasons I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the speedy passage of all its Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will get the support of my party.  Nevertheless we are disappointed the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to make greater progress in this vital area.  This legislation falls far short of what is required.  The Minister indicated that there were many problems and not everybody's view would be covered. He said that the matter would be kept under constant review and, at a later stage, additional legislation would be enacted.</P>
      <P>This was a valuable opportunity to introduce comprehensive legislation. Like many other Acts which have passed through this House, this legislation falls short of what is required. I hope in the future it will not be necessary for the Minister to bring in another Bill to prop up this one.  Due to the change in circumstances, of attitudes in industry and the raising of the school-leaving age, it is necessary that legislation be introduced now to cover this vulnerable section of the community.  It is regrettable too that it has taken 30 years to update this situation.  After such a long time, we should have a comprehensive measure to protect this section of our society, which is the most likely section to be exploited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this Bill goes through the various Stages it is my hope that it will be improved by amendments which the <Col N="53" /> Minister will accept.  In the past there was a very serious situation of baby farmers who took advantage of the child-labour situation.  The passing of the Apprenticeship Act and the setting up of the Apprenticeship Board controlled that situation.  There were other ways in which young people could still be exploited, as were set out in the Minister's brief.  It is necessary that we eliminate as far as possible the tensions and pressures on this section of our society.</P>
    <P>Young people starting at the bottom rung of the ladder can be very easily exploited because many of them do not know their rights and have not learned how to protect themselves.  They are vulnerable and it is necessary in this regard to have something more positive and more comprehensive than the present legislation.  Economic and other factors force young people to take up employment.  Steps should be taken to ensure that young people are enabled to avail of the educational opportunities that exist.  They should not be forced by economic or social pressures to take up employment&mdash;economic and social pressures which could be relieved by Government policy.  This is a separate matter but if it had been tackled the necessity for this Bill might not exist to the same extent as it does at present.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, it is mainly the children of working class families who go to work.  I hope the Minister can indicate clearly that the Government are taking action to remedy the problems of young people who now seek employment and that we will have a more comprehensive measure in this field.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (1) (c) defines &ldquo;industrial work&rdquo; as &ldquo;work in the transport of persons or goods&rdquo;.  Does this apply to messenger boys?  The Minister explained that the Bill does not apply to young persons employed as fishermen, lighthouse keepers, seafarers and members of the Defence Forces. A little further explanation is necessary here.  Does the Bill apply to boys in the Army bands, for instance?</P>
    <P>Section 8 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Subject to the provisions of this Act, an employer shall not permit <Col N="54" /> an employee who is a young person under the age of sixteen years of age in his employment to work for him for more than (a) nine hours in any day, or (b) forty hours in any week.</P>
    <P>We know that the maximum becomes the norm.  An employer who wants to exploit an employee under 16 years of age can have him work nine hours a day and 40 hours a week although a person over 16 is allowed to work only eight hours a day and 40 hours a week.  This section should be closely examined.  We will be moving quite a number of amendments on Committee Stage and we are at present assembling additional information which we will have by then.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>When an employee is employed by an employer to work on more than five days in a week and the employee is also required to do more than three hours work on a Sunday, the employer shall ensure that the conditions of employment of every such employee are such that the employee will have at least twenty-four consecutive hours rest without pay in every period of seven days.</P>
    <P>That is a very generous section.  It should be tightened up and it should be more to the advantage of the employee.</P>
    <P>Section 17 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Any sum of money due to an employee from his employer under any provision of this Act shall be recoverable by the employee from his employer as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>(2)  Proceedings for the recovery of any sum due by an employer to an employee under any provision of this Act may be instituted and maintained on behalf of the employee by his trade union.</P>
    <P>Does this mean that a young person of 14, 15 or 16 years entering employment must join a trade union?  Is this to be a recruiting section for trade unions?  If not, who will pursue their legitimate claims?  This section should <Col N="55" /> be tightened up and we should ensure that young people who are not members of trade unions will have a way of ensuring that their just claims are met.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with the fixing of wages.  Who fixes the wage rates or how are they fixed?  What agreements does the Minister refer to?  Is there a special agreement made when a young person enters employment?</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the powers of inspectors.  Subsection (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on an inspector by subsection (1) (a) of this section shall not be exercisable in respect of a private dwelling house unless the Minister (or an officer of the Minister appointed for the purpose) certifies that he has reasonable grounds for believing that an offence under this section in relation to an employee has been committed by the employer, and the inspector in applying for admission to the house produces the certificate.</P>
    <P>How are young people who go into service affected by this?  Does this section refer to them and, if not, why? We would like to know, too, how the Minister proposes to deal with child actors and entertainers.  Are they covered by this?</P>
    <P>This legislation was necessary because of the change in the school leaving age, apart from anything else. I hope the changes that will be brought about will be effective and will have the desired results.  I believe the Bill falls far short of what is required.  The Minister had a wonderful opportunity to eliminate exploitation. One field in which it has been suggested that there has been a considerable amount of exploitation as regards young female workers is the clothing industry.  Perhaps this is one of the areas the Minister has in mind. He also mentioned supermarkets and off-licence liquor stores.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister particularly mentioned the off-licence liquor stores.  We know of the problems that have arisen in many areas because of the sale of liquor to young people.  As we have seen on television, if certain <Col N="56" /> liquors are taken with drugs there may be considerable problems.  Some measures should be taken to tighten up this area.  The Government should carry out an overall examination regarding the employment of young persons rather than introduce the simple Bill now before the House that only deals with the number of hours worked, time off for meals and other minor matters when one considers the variety of problems not touched on.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Generally in our system of employer/employee relations the trade union organisation is expected to provide the organisational shield to safeguard individual and collective rights in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I agree with this but my concern is about all workers.  I do not think the Minister intends that people must become members of a trade union immediately they start work.  It is implied that if they are members their rights will be protected but their rights should be protected irrespective of whether or not they are members of a trade union.  It is regrettable that in an area where the trade unions have a responsibility there should be this doubt.  The Minister mentioned the doubt and I also thought there was this problem when I read the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated:</P>
    <P>In the instances I have mentioned, however, trade union organisation has not kept pace with the proliferation of these new distributive forms.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to ensure that throughout the work force every aspect will be covered for all the people who are employed, whether or not they are members of a trade union.  We may have a considerable amount of discussion on this matter on other Stages.  The Minister referred to catering establishments and petrol filling stations.  These are areas in which there has been some exploitation and it is possible we may be able to alleviate or remedy some of the problems that exist.  The fact that a young person takes up employment can broaden his outlook and can be <Col N="57" /> of great importance to that person. It can expand his knowledge and can help the young person to attain the goals he has set for himself.</P>
    <P>No one underestimates this immense problem and it needs the sympathy, consideration and assistance of all groups.  The National Youth Council and other groups can be of great assistance to representatives and to this House with regard to supplying information.  I assume the Minister has met the groups concerned, has listened to their views and, where possible, has incorporated them in this legislation. I have no doubt that he has taken heed of the views of the groups concerned with regard to the employment of young people.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the potato pickers in Scotland and hotel workers in Switzerland.  These people are working in places far removed from our country and it is good to know the Minister is paying special attention to them and that he has instituted an examination of the conditions under which young Irish people are forced to work abroad.  I am quite sure that many young, and indeed old, people here would not work under the same conditions that Irish people have to endure abroad.  It is gratifying to know that the Minister has given consideration to their problems so that these people may be properly advised.  It is heartening to know that the special labour attaché whom he has appointed is working on this important matter and we wish him every success.  I hope the information that comes back will be of benefit.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be accused of holding up this Bill.  As we consider it we will ask questions about insurance cover for young workers, whether they are covered by insurance, what form it will take, if it will be the same as in the past or if there will be more comprehensive coverage.  We will ask the Minister questions regarding the holiday situation and many other aspects that affect the lives of young people who are entering employment for the first time.  It is very important that young people have happy memories of this part of their lives. <Col N="58" /> rather than the rather unhappy memories of many of our youth who were exploited in the past.</P>
    <P>At the moment the exploitation of people is not nearly as great as it was in the past.  The Minister referred to exploitation in the 19th century when young people and adults were not treated in a fair manner.  Indeed, into the 20th century there was exploitation of workers; there was sweated labour in our own country as well as elsewhere. It is good to know that an effort is being made to improve the situation.  We are disappointed that the Bill is not more comprehensive.  Even if it meant more time, we would be better off in the long run if we had a more comprehensive measure.  It is true that when a matter is left in abeyance other issues get priority but it is not good enough to deal in a half-hearted manner with a problem of the workers.  If it is necessary to support a measure by additional legislation at a later stage we are not doing a good job.  It is a stop-gap way of dealing with the matter and it is not good enough.</P>
    <P>However, we wish the Minister well and hope that the House will give this legislation a speedy passage.  The Minister must be prepared for the substantial number of amendments we shall be putting forward to improve and expand the Bill to cover a wider area.  I hope the Minister will be tolerant of us; the fact that the suggestions come from us should not induce him to impede the passage of the Bill.  I can assure him that we will be as reasonable as possible in our efforts to deal with this matter to ensure that it is implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am surprised it has taken such a long time to bring legislation on this matter before the House.  Obviously when the Opposition were in Government they did not give it much consideration but I am glad they have been converted and accept that this legislation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister has pointed out, there is not the exploitation of children at work that existed in the last <Col N="59" /> century.  However, the coming of the affluent and the consumer society meant that many young people were thrown into the labour market at an early stage to serve the needs of society.  One can see in supermarkets, in filling stations, in lounge bars and other places many young people who are working long hours for low wages.</P>
    <P>It is welcome to see this change. The Minister said today that the type of labour covered in this Bill comes basically from the less well-off section of our society, the underprivileged. This Bill will ensure that long hours are not worked by those young people but I do not think it will really tackle the main problem, which is education. Most of these young people go to work at a very early age.  They leave school at 14 years of age and do not go on to further education because they are anxious to work.  We should do something about rearranging the educational programme.</P>
    <P>Many employers give time off to young people to attend classes but many of them do not do so.  It is important that we encourage young people to continue their education. Many of them work in dead-end jobs. They come to a <i>cul-de-sac</i> when they reach 18 years of age.  Their employers do not wish to pay them higher wages and they are let go without any training. Those young people should be encouraged to take up some form of training.</P>
    <P>In this Bill we are talking about raising the living standards of our young people, but ensuring that they work a few hours less each week is just not enough.  It is stated in this Bill that young people under 16 years of age should not be permitted to work more than ten hours a day or 50 hours in any week.  Ten hours work a day is long for young people, particularly if they are pursuing night courses.  Employers might well go on the basis that this legislation says young people can work for ten hours a day and decide they should all work that length of time.  Could it not be eight hours a day?  Those young people may want additional money and might be prepared to work for <Col N="60" /> ten hours a day.  They might decide not to go ahead with night courses. This could have a bad effect on them later on.</P>
    <P>Fishermen, lighthouse men and the Defence Forces are omitted from this Bill.  I do not know why the Defence Forces are omitted, although I realise they have a different role to play.  However, in the Defence Forces we have the training of young people and they should be made to conform with the standards laid down in this Bill.  I hope the Minister will have a look at this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>How are people working in small family businesses, and perhaps drawing only a small sum of money or none at all, affected under this Bill? Many young people are employed in small family businesses.  They should be covered under this Bill.  I should like some clarification from the Minister on this.</P>
    <P>Section 23 states that &ldquo;a person who commits an offence under this Act shall be fined £25 in the case of a first offence.&rdquo;  That is ludicrous.  We have the same situation in the Planning Bill, where the fine was £100.  I have an amendment down to make the fine £500 and Deputy Molloy has one down to make it £1,000.  When such legislation is brought in we should ensure that the fines are large enough to discourage people breaking the law.  We should make the fine £100 in the case of this Bill and in the case of a continuing offence a fine of £20 for every day on which the offence continues.  That would be a great deterrent to people who might think of breaking the law.  When the fine is large enough they are less likely to break the law.  This would ensure that people who break the law are punished.</P>
    <P>This Bill is long overdue.  It is most important that it goes on the Statute Book at an early date.  I should like the Minister to have some printed matter made available from his Department for employers to give to young people when they go into employment. Those young people would then know the procedure in regard to complaints. Some employees, for fear of losing their <Col N="61" /> jobs, or because of intimidation might not want to complain.  At least the employee should have some place to report his grievances, and those grievances should be reported in confidence and the inspection should be done in the same way.  The employee should be informed of the hours he is entitled to work and of the contents of this Bill, not necessarily the whole Bill but in broad terms the conditions laid down which would normally affect him.  If we do that we shall be going a long way, because if the employer has to give this out, he is clear in his own mind that he is open to inspection at any time and liable to a heavy fine if he is convicted.  That will deter him from breaking the law, and from using young people for his own profit without any consideration for the young person.</P>
    <P>Again I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill.  I shall be speaking on this subject again on Committee Stage.  In regard to amendments, I would ask the Minister to consider the educational opportunities for younger people, particularly those who would be most in need of this assistance, even if it means giving employers an incentive to release young people.  The title of the Bill is the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, and there is no better way of protecting young people today than by broadening their minds, giving them ideas, giving them a sense of wanting to do something better.  If that involves finance it will be money well spent.  It will tend to lift our whole society up to a higher level. Our overall educational system is quite good, but for some young people because of their background and their upbringing, education is not a priority; they tend to be in this twilight zone until they go to work from sixth class in the national school.  If we encourage courses in various aspects of development, I believe this Bill will be well worthwhile.  Again I commend the Minister for bringing it in.</P>

      <P>Like the two previous speakers I also would like to welcome this Bill.  Any legislation which will provide protection for <Col N="62" /> young persons in employment, as this Bill sets out to do, is to be welcomed, and I would hope, as the Minister has hoped, that it will get a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>There are certain criticisms that have already been voiced by Deputy Dowling and that I do not intend to go over again.  I hope the Minister will be forthcoming and generous in his approach to the various amendments which will be put down by Deputy Dowling.</P>
      <P>I have one main criticism, that instead of a Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill we should have before us an hours of work Bill not just for young people but for people of all ages.  The Minister has indicated that he is considering such a Bill and I would ask him to press forward with the negotiations that are taking place between the employer and employee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just coming back to it.  I would ask him to bring this legislation before the House as soon as possible.  There are two categories of young people to be considered, those in permanent employment and those in temporary employment. It would be wrong if the message went out from this House that we consider employers to be modernday slave drivers.  The vast majority of our employers, most of them being family men themselves, are more than aware of the problems facing young people going into employment and are considerate and attentive to the needs and requirements of young people in their employment.  There is always a small section of black sheep in any community and these are the people this Bill is aimed at.  I agree with Deputy O'Brien that for these black sheep, for the employers who unscrupulously misuse the services of the young persons in their employment, a £25 fine is ludicrous.  I would appeal to the Minister to increase this fine considerably for any employer found abusing the rights of young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> In regard to the section dealing with young people engaged in temporary employment in the catering trade, the bar trade or, as the Minister himself described it, the lounge bar society, this provision is to be welcomed.  Any legislation is to be welcomed that will stop the employment of young people of 15 or 16 years of age in public houses, in establishments serving liquor up to 11 at night or, in summertime, up to half past eleven, or in hotels, when functions are being held, up to 12 midnight or after it.  It is not a healthy environment for any young boy or girl.  One of the great scourges of Irish society is that of alcohol. Employing young people of either sex in lounge bars is to be abhorred and I am glad this legislation will put a speedy end to this practice.</P>
    <P>There are many spheres in which young people can be gainfully engaged. I know many parents who are anxious that their children should get some experience of the normal working environment through the medium of some sort of part-time employment, not necessarily for the sake of the money that may be involved but for the sake of the experience gained, because this kind of occupation can give young people a sense of responsibility. This is a valid argument and it is an aspect on which the Minister might comment when he comes to reply. Surely the Government could evolve some scheme of tasks suitable for young people?  There are many things that can be done for the aged, the infirm and the less well-off, tasks which are now done to a great extent by charitable organisations.  Nevertheless there are still gaps to be filled as between what is being done and what could be done.  Surely the Government could establish a youth corps somewhat similar to the Peace Corps in the USA some years back?  Young people could paint and decorate for those incapable of doing these tasks themselves without in any way infringing on the employment potentialities of qualified painters and decorators.  The people for whom they would do these tasks would never be in a position to employ painters and decorators themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> Recreational facilities are vitally important for all sections of our community. This Bill is designed to protect young workers.  All workers should be protected.  The Minister has asked for a speedy passage for this measure and I shall certainly facilitate him in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the introduction of this Bill.  It augurs well for the future. After almost 30 years of stagnation in this area a start has at last been made in legislation for the protection of young people, a start designed to bring legislation here into line with modern thinking and good christian and social practices.  There have been widespread abuses and there has been maltreatment of young workers. Fortunately that has occured in only a minority of cases.  Sometimes it is very difficult in such cases to get the facts.  Sometimes it is even difficult to get people to believe the complaints emanating from this minority area.</P>
      <P>I would stress that, although 30 years have elapsed without any significant change, nevertheless conditions of employment generally have been freely negotiated through the trade union movement between employers and employees.  These freely negotiated conditions and terms of employment have by and large provided some measure of protection for young workers.  As a previous speaker pointed out, those young workers who are outside the scope of the joint labour committee orders made over the years, had absolutely no protection and it would appear that very few people, particularly legislators, over the last 30 years worried very much about the situation.  The trade union movement and the employer organisations are to be complimented on the way in which in their areas of responsibility they filled the vacuum left by the legislators in that they provided a great number of young workers with conditions of employment giving them a fair amount of protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But it still left many others, who were not in the fortunate position of being members of a union or who were not included in a Labour Court <Col N="65" /> order, completely at the mercy of the exploiters.  Fortunately there are not many exploiters but the whole country should be ashamed of the ones we have.</P>
    <P>This Bill divides young workers into three categories.  The youngest group are the children between 14 and 15 years of age in employment. The next group are the children under 16 years of age and the third are the young people over 16 years. The provisions of the Bill differ in relation to the three categories in some respects, as they should.  The years from 14 to 18 are very impressionable and the way in which these groups are treated by legislation is very important. Perhaps on Committee Stage or on Report Stage the Minister could include a section to amend the Holidays (Employees) Act.  As I recall, the Act and the amendment which was made to it, refer only to employees under 18 years.  Whether an employee is 17 years or 15 years he must work the same number of hours to qualify for entitlement under the Holidays (Employees) Act, as amended in 1974, I think.  As we have three categories under this Bill we should have some amendment of the Holidays (Employees) Act to provide three categories there, so that a worker under 16 years would qualify for holiday entitlement with a smaller number of hours than a worker over 16.  At the moment workers under 18 years need not have the same number of working hours to qualify for full normal holidays as workers over 18 years.</P>
    <P>I was shocked to learn from the Minister that there is an almost complete lack of statistics officially available and that this is one of the difficulties which the Minister has to face in legislation in this field.  I suppose the absence of statistics and details on what has been the position in the absence of legislation of this kind, is understandable.  In most instances where young workers suffered in one way or another, they were afraid to make a report or to tell anyone in case it resulted in the loss of that employment.  The employment and the meagre earnings he or she might make are very important.  In my work <Col N="66" /> as a trade union official I found that in this area it was very difficult to get information about exploitation of young people.  They were afraid to tell anyone about their problems or to discuss their problems with anyone, and particularly with anyone who might convey back to the employer the fact that his young employees were complaining.</P>
    <P>The Bill might go a little further and make it necessary for employers in addition to keeping a register, to supply a list of the names of young people to the Department, and particularly in the case of the category under 16 years.  These lists would help the Minister and the Department to get the statistics they so badly need to proceed with further legislation of this kind.  In the main, this legislation refers only to hours of work and limits on them.  Many other matters require to be covered by legislation for the protection of young people in employment.  It would not be a big obligation.  It would not entail very much because the employer will be obliged to keep a register under section 5 of the Bill.  All he would have to do would be to send to the Department the names and the changes made from time to time.  This would keep the local officers of the Department informed of the number of young people in his employment.  The Department also would know at any time how many people were in employment.</P>
    <P>This would also help the inspectorate. One of the problems about providing an inspectorate service in this area is the reluctance of quite a number of people to make reports. People will speak generally or anonymously, but I find from experience that they are very reluctant to make a report, not because they are doubtful about their facts, but because they fear some act of revenge by their employer.  To ensure that the provisions of the Bill are being implemented it would be a good thing if each inspector had a list of where young people are employed and how many are employed so that he would not have to waste his time going to firms where these categories of workers are <Col N="67" /> not employed.  They could regulate their work to pay occasional visits to these places even though there was no reports of violation of any of the provision of the Act.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters I should like to see in the Bill.  It is important that a Bill of this nature should not be complicated.  It should be kept as simple and as straightforward as possible.  I feel sure that when the Minister receives reports as a result of the operation of this Bill he will, as he stated earlier, bring in amending and additional legislation as the need arises.  I accept the Minister's undertaking in this regard.  I believe that if any Deputy, or any organisation catering for workers, brings to the attention of the Minister the need for amendments in this legislation he will meet their wishes.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with hours of work and type of employment.  It may be perfectly in order for a young person to work ten hours per day in a certain type of employment while it may be extremely bad for that young person's health to work more than six hours per day in another type of employment. Some of the sections in relation to this aspect of the Bill can be discussed better on Committee Stage.  In relation to section 4, which deals with the minimum age for employment and sets out that an employer may employ a child who is over the age of 14 years to do light non-industrial work which is not harmful to the health or normal development of the child, I should like to know who makes the decision in this regard.  I am aware that subsection (7) of section 4 states that the Minister may by order revoke or amend an order under this section including an order under that subsection.</P>
    <P>I interpret that section to mean that the Minister has power if a question is raised in relation to a particular employment being harmful to an individual person.  Must an employer, before he employs such a person, make application to the Department of Labour and satisfy the Department that the type of work he intends to <Col N="68" /> give to the young person is in order? What type of criteria will the Department use to reach a decision on a matter of this kind?  Who decides the harmfulness, or otherwise, of work?</P>
    <P>On reading some of the sections I have come to the conclusion that the young person can be liable to a fine if he or she is a party to contravening any of the provisions of the Bill.  Subsection (2) of section 15 states that whenever an employer employs an employee in contravention of this section, the employer shall be guilty of an offence and the employee shall also be guilty of an offence.  Does that apply in many instances or is it to be confined to that particular section?  In my view it would be too severe to impose these fines on the young person.  I should like clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>This legislation is very necessary.  It is long overdue and some harm has been done to young people not alone because of bad working conditions but because of severe action by employers on them at such a young age.  When young people are treated badly in employment their attitude to employment, and employers generally, will be one of hostility throughout their adult life.  This has been the case in a number of instances.  In my view this legislation will prevent such a situation occuring again.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for having introduced this legislation.  I would urge him to take into account the many other matters that it might be necessary to have incorporated in this legislation.  I know they cannot all be included at present.  I hope the Bill will have a quick passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence my few remarks by welcoming the Bill and indeed in congratulating the Minister on some of its proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first paragraph of his brief he mentioned that he was removing an existing anomaly under which the minimum age for employment was 14 years even though the school-leaving age was 15 years.  This, perhaps more than anything else, epitomises the confusion existing as regards the employment and general problems of youth.  I would urge the Minister&mdash;between <Col N="69" /> now and the Final Stage&mdash;to request the Government to give us a more comprehensive Bill than this one, which would be the product not alone of the Minister for Labour but also of the Ministers for Education, Industry and Commerce and Health.  I feel there will be need for this Bill only in the poorer section of the community&mdash;the children of the lower-paid workers.  We may say we will protect such youth in employment but it will be the lucky ones only who will get employment.</P>
    <P>When this Bill becomes an Act I am sure the Minister will enforce its provisions very strictly.  I would suggest to the Minister that we are not tackling the protection of young people, even in employment.  We are adopting legislation here which may improve matters and which may remove some of the guilt we feel for what we are not doing for these young people.</P>
    <P>I would recommend the Minister to read the latest report of the school attendance committees of this city, which would disturb anybody no matter how hardened he might be.  In that report the Minister will find suggestions for the improvement of the conditions of children about whom I speak.  I can understand the Minister's point when he refers to this gadget-obsessed society that we have.  I congratulate the Minister on the concern shown by him but I do not think this Bill will effect any great breakthrough towards a better social charter for our young people.  The Minister referred to children employed by supermarkets and publichouses but we must face the fact that for many a family the income derived from such employment is of very great help.  One can say that the conditions in most supermarkets are good; they are clean, airy and well ventilated.</P>
    <P>Publichouses employing young people to carry drinks around are generally of the lounge bar type with all modern conveniences.  Lest we should feel we are doing anything to improve the conditions of youth by recognising that that type of employment exists, in trying to protect young people from working too long <Col N="70" /> hours, or ensuring that their employers will not abuse a boy's or girl's service in any way, I do not think the employers are any more avaricious than are we careless.  I deplore seeing young boys carrying drinks around in publichouses because, when we allow young people to engage in such employment or when we tolerate conditions which force children into such employment then we are to blame and not the employers.  I am sure such employers treat these young people well, but there is something seriously wrong with the thinking of anybody who feels that the way to start training a boy is to give him part-time employment in a publichouse.  I wonder how many of us here would allow our sons to take up such employment.  But our society does allow this.  I give the Minister credit for showing concern in this respect.  He is doing something which may remove the guilt we feel about the neglect of these young people.</P>
    <P>The Bill is entitled Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Bill, 1974.  The Minister should introduce a Bill entitled something like Protection of Young Persons in Certain Categories Bill.  Anybody experienced in social work in this city or who has read the report I mentioned will know of the asphalt jungle existing for these youngsters.  Even more disturbing is the fact that they come from a certain category of our society. There are many young people who will never be forced into working in a publichouse or supermarket and of this we are glad.  I am thinking of the young girl or boy coming from a disturbed family background.  He or she may not want to continue going to school but rather want to take up employment.  They take the first job that comes along and after a few years they are too old for it.  They are then too old to enter into apprenticeship. Probably they have not even attended a school up to the group certificate level.  At present there are many young people being reared who will be misfits in our society practically all their lives.  It has been proven by sociologists&mdash;as quoted in the report to which I have referred &mdash;that very few children are bright of <Col N="71" /> their own initiative.  Rather it is the environment in which they live that shapes their characters or thinking. For that reason we cannot cast aside the boy or girl who may appear to be dull or not very intelligent.</P>
    <P>We cannot condemn them to go through life as unskilled workers in the lower paid categories just because we have failed to create the conditions in which those children can properly educate themselves.  I accept the fact that we cannot all continue to third level education.  I accept the fact also that there are plenty of people who do not want to go on to third level. But it is our duty to ensure, if they do not continue into third level education and if they cannot even obtain gainful employment, that they will have a proper course of training available to them so that when the economic situation improves these young people will be able to take their place either on the industrial or on the commercial scene.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of the emigration of young people.  We all know that very often our emigrants work long hours and in poor conditions but when they go away our law cannot protect them. We cannot prevent people from going away but we should make every effort to prepare them for emigration.  It would be worth the Minister's while to broaden the whole scope of this Bill.  While what is proposed may prove effective in relation to what is intended by the Minister, I do not think it is going far enough in ensuring adequate protection for our young people.  I believe the Minister to be genuinely concerned with the problems of youth but there is required in this sphere more than is proposed here.  A young boy may work in, say, a publichouse for ten hours each day but the chances are that he will spend the remaining 14 hours in a deprived and disturbed home.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes for a speedy passage for this Bill.  It is not our intention to delay the Bill but I would remind the Minister that before we can boast of having done anything <Col N="72" /> for our youth and while we are awaiting the various reports on the various aspects of youth, we might well get in touch with the education authorities and, in particular, with the school attendance committees in the city.  These people are in a position to give the Minister the benefit of a wealth of information which they have acquired from their experience in dealing with young people.  The Minister may say that I am encroaching on the Department of Education but my answer to that would be that all legislation in respect of young people must be the product of the best talents not only of the Department of Labour but also of all the other Government Departments. Advice should be sought, too, from the many excellent social workers and these members of religious orders who are doing so much to create a better society and to ensure a fuller life for our young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that if this legislation is not seen to be operating satisfactorily, he would have no hesitation in introducing further legislation. If it is not the Minister's intention to conclude the Bill this evening, perhaps, between now and the final Stages he would consider broadening the scope of the Bill. There could be included the provision that before a young person accepts employment there would be an assurance that any such employment would not mitigate against the furtherance of the education of the boy or girl concerned.  In a case where parents might say that they need the money being earned by their child in a supermarket or publichouse, the State should be able to offer help equivalent to that being provided by the boy so that he may be able to continue with his education.  It is for us to develop a society in which our young people will be protected from drifting in the wrong direction.  We cannot say that we cherish equally all the children of the nation but I am not attaching the blame for this on any section in particular. The blame lies as much with me as a Member of this House and as a Dubliner as with anybody else.  We have not done enough in so far as our <Col N="73" /> young people are concerned.  I am thinking especially of the question of part-time employment for our youth. This whole area should be investigated. Every boy and girl should be given the opportunity of either an academic or a technical education.  A well educated youth will not be likely to be the victim of the ills and dangers that are prevalent in any urban society today.</P>
    <P>This Bill indicates a concern for certain aspects of the youth problem and to that extent I welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill but I would remind the Minister of the difficulty that may be encountered in enforcing its provisions.  I say this because of the many categories of youth that are being employed.  For instance, there are the different age groups.  Children attending secondary school may seek holiday employment. As public representatives we often have requests from parents to help in some way in securing holiday jobs for children.  Young people, from the age of 13 onwards are anxious to earn money but up to now there has been no protection for them.  In the past small business places were a breeding ground for Communism.  I say this because the workers, especially the younger ones, had no representation by way of unions or otherwise to protect them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned a very important point: who will enforce the regulations under this Bill?  All these young people cannot be members of the trade union.  There is a danger that the senior members in the department, who are members of a trade union, will be much harder on those young people than the employers.  Youngsters when they start work must do a little of everything.  Often they are kicked around the place by people from the foreman down.  I would not like it if these were the people to decide if the young people are getting justice.  This is a most important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A young boy, who must work to help his parents would be very slow to report this state of affairs.  He cannot depend on these people for justice.  It <Col N="74" /> is only natural that they would try to get as much as they can out of him. I have seen youngsters employed in garages where the foremen were determined to get as much out of them as they could.  The young people were often doing a little of every job.  We could not expect the employer to say that they were overworked.  We must be very careful about this and ensure that this Bill is enforced properly.</P>
    <P>Young people in rural Ireland have been brought up in a very nice environment. I am opposed to bringing too many of them into towns because there is a danger that there is not enough to occupy their time after school.  In country areas they will be able to help the farmer bring in the cows.  I want to make sure this Bill will not stop this man from giving employment to these youngsters for fear that he will not be carrying out the regulations under this Bill and so could be summoned.  How will we ensure that employers are giving justice to young people?</P>
    <P>I am 100 per cent behind the Minister in bringing in a Bill to do away with the slavery of young people.  Many young people for various economic reasons, or because they do not like school, must go to work.  I have heard from many of these people that their first few years in employment were hard years and nobody cared about them.</P>
    <P>There is not much we can do about young people going abroad.  The majority of our students like to do so. Many of them ask their Deputies to get them holiday employment.  Who will determine the proper wage for them?  During the summer holidays many of them are employed at a very low wage.  This must be gone into very carefully.  We must not jeopardise their chances of casual employment and at the same time we must ensure that they are not expected to work for a slave wage.</P>
    <P>I foresee many difficulties in ensuring that the spirit and the principles of this Bill are carried through.  No honest man, or any man with a social conscience, could disagree with this Bill, but it will be very difficult to enforce justly.  It should be studied <Col N="75" /> very carefully on Committee Stage. Every Deputy will agree that this legislation is needed.  I regret it was not introduced 40 years ago when it was even more necessary.  Very few young people nowadays would tolerate those conditions.  Nowadays if a young man was not employed under reasonable conditions he would tell the boss he was going home.  That is good.  As I said before, there may be the odd young person who for economic reasons must work.  A periodic inspection should be undertaken.  Not every young person will report his employer. Suppose such a person reported to an inspector that three men in his job were asking him to do everything.  If the men heard of that they could make things even tougher for him.  I sympathise with the Minister in trying to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>We are all very good at making grand statements of principle but it is very difficult to implement them.  This Bill will be very difficult to implement. It will be difficult to ensure that justice is done to everyone.  Every Deputy will give the Minister every assistance possible during the Committee Stage to ensure that the principles of this Bill are enforced.</P>
    <P>There are many types of employment in rural and urban Ireland. Nobody wants to see a young lad employed in a pub until 11 o'clock at night.  That is not fit employment for any young boy.  There are certain jobs which will take one or two hours an evening and are very good for young fellows.  Of course, he should be paid a reasonable amount for this casual labour.  I would not like to see a section in this Bill which would prevent a man from giving casual employment to a young lad.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  I also congratulate Deputy Dowling who made some very good points which I had intended to raise. This Bill which states in plain language what it intends to do, is needed, but I appreciate the difficulties involved in implementing principles in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their reception of this Bill.  Deputy Callanan <Col N="76" /> was right when he said that it would be a difficult Bill to enforce.  It is a first step and attempts to deal with a problem on which we have not had any legislation for many years.  This is an area in which we do not have statistics. We do not know the full extent of the employment of young people, the categories of age groups involved. Therefore the Bill is subject to criticism from both sides.  One side claims it does not go far enough and the other side claims it goes too far.</P>
      <P>I should like to reassure Deputy Callanan on the question of the employment of youth in rural Ireland. There is power given to me in section 16 to make exceptions.  Deputies are correct in saying that this is a Bill that requires more attention on the Committee Stage.  I propose on Committee Stage to go in greater detail into some of the questions raised here.  If there are amendments put forward which would strengthen the general direction of the legislation I will have no hesitation in accepting them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the fines and said they could have been made more severe.  I will certainly have a look at this point again but I would remind Deputies that the fine of £25 for a first offence can be multiplied by continuing fines for recurring offences and there is the provision for a second offence fine of £50 and thereafter at a rate of £10 per day.  Of course it will be open to the courts to give such fines, to impose such fines in respect of each individual employee.  However I will have a look at the question of the penalties once more.</P>

    <P>It is my intention shortly to publish a booklet on workers and their rights. It will be a short booklet that will explain the legal entitlements of a worker on entering a job, the things that are his right under conditions of employment and factories legislation and the surrounding industrial relations legislation.  This booklet will be available to the worker on application. We also have in mind, on the enactment of this legislation, to produce a small <i>précis</i> of the legislation to be made available to youth organisations.  Indeed there is reference <Col N="77" /> in the legislation to consultation with the social partners.  The Bill was circulated on the day of the conference of the National Federation of Youth Clubs in Gormanston.  I took the opportunity of announcing there that I had circulated the Bill on that day to Deputies.  I made it clear to that organisation of youth clubs that copies of the Bill were available for discussion and I took the opportunity to distribute copies to the delegates present.  I would be very happy to hear any representations from any youth organisations on the aspect of this legislation which they consider could be improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien said that the hours per day mentioned appeared to be too long in view of the training courses in which young people might be involved.  It must be remembered that a training period would be included in the hours at work.</P>
    <P>Deputy Patterson asked who would decide under section 4 that non-industrial work was not harmful.  I would have the job of declaring whether work came into that category and obviously I would have to have the advice of people skilled in this area before coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke mentioned the question of temporary employment.  I would remind him that it comes in many and varied patterns and durations. Some forms in public houses may be undesirable on health or indeed on moral grounds, but section 6 gives me power to set a higher minimum age, and this could be coupled with stricter enforcement based on more stringent requirements on the evidence of age.  Deputy Pattison asked that we should have a requirment placed on the employer that full records of the young people in his employment should be sent on, as he said, to the local labour office. However, we do not have departmental offices in that sense.  He may have in mind referring it to the local manpower office.  I will have a look at that idea of transmitting such details to some central section.  One of the besetting problems in starting legislation in this area is the absence of information on the extent of the problem.  One may only rely on the <Col N="78" /> complaints available to one.  I am not suggesting that employers in certain areas I have mentioned are generally guilty or even that a majority are guilty.  I do not think that is the case, but I would say that on the number of complaints we have received there is cause for unease in certain of the areas I have mentioned.  I think Deputy Pattison mentioned the Holidays Act.  I do not think, on first reception of the idea at any rate, that the idea of having different qualifying hours under different Acts for people under 15 and 16 and 16 to 18 years would be in the best interests of our legislation.  However, we will have a look at that again.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore mentioned school attendance officers.  We have been in touch informally with the Dublin school attendance officer and we looked at some of the reports available from the school attendance officers around the country.</P>
    <P>We had a useful debate on this proposed legislation.  Many of the points made are interesting for their own sake and I will consider whether these suggestions can be incorporated to strengthen the legislation on the Committee Stage.  As I said, there are two views on legislation of this kind. One school of thought is that it does not go far enough and another is that it goes too far.  Although legislation has existed in the past partially covering certain of these areas&mdash;the hours that were laid down under that legislation are longer than those set down here&mdash;legislation which has been in existence for almost 30 years, we can refer to this as a new area for social legislation.  Therefore I would be inclined at this stage to say that we should wait until records become available, to see the inspectorate enforce this legislation over, say, a year and then see what amendments are suggested in the light of experience whether new legislation is necessary and whether we need an extension of what we have here.  I have given myself ample powers here to extend it in certain areas, with of course the approval of the House, if we find in the light of experience, that those changes and extensions are necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> This Bill is merely a first step in regard to the employment of young people.  When all the facts I have mentioned become more readily available and when we have the possibility of analysing records which become available to us I would envisage further action being taken.  Of course, I can vary the standards concerning working hours.  I have given myself that power in this legislation.  In the case of important changes I would be required by section 27 to place draft variation orders before each House.  In this way or through the introduction of a new Bill I would be willing to make any changes which would be warranted.  Generally I feel that in making desirable changes which would have the genuine support of the entire community a Minister must assess the current situation and propose reasonable advances on it.  It is apparent that legislation in this area, if it does not enjoy general community support, will be to no avail.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements for young employees in shops, hotels and restaurants are being made.  This is the first step forward and when we, as a community, act fully within the letter and spirit of the law we can embark on additional improvements in minimum standards with regard to conditions of employment.  It may be that after a year's working of this legislation, if passed, we will see that improvements should be made in certain of the joint industrial committees attached to the Labour Court relating to areas where young people have been overworked.  Perhaps that may be the avenue we will choose after a year's experience of the operation of this legislation.  On Committee Stage I would be quite happy to consider, on their merits, any amendments brought forward by Deputies opposite.</P>
    <P>In my opening remarks I said that while our system of employer/ employee relations generally accepts the position of unions to be the shield of working people's rights I also made the point&mdash;which may have been misunderstood by Deputies <Col N="80" /> opposite&mdash;that in the new, proliferating distributive forms which have come into being in many of the new centres recently union organisation is not strong.  The point I was making was that since union organisation is not adequate in these areas, it behoves the public authorities to step in with legislation to protect the exploited. We do not have final statistics on the extent of this social problem, we only have the complaints made and the experience of youth officers throughout the country.  There is also the general desirability to have legislation in this area when we consider that almost 30 years have passed without any intervention by the public authorities.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 25, after &ldquo;&lsquo;trade union&rsquo;&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, save where the context otherwise requires,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a technical amendment arising from inclusion in the Bill of the new section 16 which provides that British-based unions may not hold or be granted a negotiating licence unless they have a decision-taking executive located within the Thirty-two Counties.  It will be noted that section 1 provides that &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; has the same meaning as in the Trade Union Acts, 1871 to 1971, that is, &ldquo;any combination, whether temporary or permanent, the principal objects of which are under its constitution statutory objects, namely the regulation of the relations between workmen and masters or between workmen and workmen or between masters and masters, or the imposing of restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business and also the provision of benefits to members.&rdquo;  Deputies will note the archaic language of the old legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 refers to a trade union under the law of another country. <Col N="81" /> The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear that &ldquo;trade union&rdquo; in the context of section 16 means a trade union recognised under the law of another country and does not mean a trade union within the meaning assigned to it in section 1.  It is a technical amendment arising from that change on the legislation.</P>

      <P>In page 3, line 21, after &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and the voting shall be by secret ballot&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that voting on instruments of amalgamation and transfer shall take place in secret.  During the Committee Stage I agreed to a request from Deputy Dowling that the Bill be amended to ensure that voting on amalgamation or transfer should take place in secret and the amendment provides accordingly.  It was our understanding from the draftsman and from the Bill as originally drafted that this voting would be in secret but Deputy Dowling was not happy it really meant voting in secret.  To meet him we inserted the provision in that form.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b) every member of the union shall be entitled to vote by post where his circumstances so warrant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I had some communication with the Minister in relation to this amendment when he indicated he had confirmed that section 3 (1) (c) would permit unions to arrange for the holding of postal votes.  Section 3 (1) (b) states:</P>
      <P>every member of the union shall be allowed to vote without interference or constraint and, so far as is reasonably possible, shall be given a fair opportunity of voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that postal votes will be provided where circumstances so <Col N="82" /> warrant.  However, this implies a right by the union to decide on the postal vote.  It is our main concern that the member will have an opportunity of availing of postal voting where his circumstances so warrant.  The Minister agreed with regard to a previous amendment that an advertisement would be inserted in the newspapers approximately a week before the meeting was to take place.  There are many out-workers who may notice the advertisement in the papers indicating an important decision is about to be made and, if they are unable to return to base, it is logical they should be able to apply for a postal vote to record their vote with regard to amalgamation.</P>
    <P>As the Bill stands it implies a right to the trade unions to decide on the postal vote but it does not give the member the right to insist on a postal vote if his circumstances so warrant. The member must have this right.  The Minister was reasonable in relation to a large number of amendments.  If he gives this matter some consideration he will realise it may happen that members may be far removed from the area where voting will take place. They may be working on the Aran Islands, or Rathlin Island or in some other outpost and I am sure the Minister will appreciate that our amendment is logical when one considers this possibility.</P>
    <P>If the member has the right to obtain the vote there would not be the situation where he could say afterwards he did not have the opportunity to record his vote.  Notwithstanding the best will of the union to try to meet all the problems in relation to voting procedures by endeavouring to notify personnel, the movement of people from one area to another complicates the issue in so far as movement may have taken place before receipt of the ballot paper or of written instructions.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to ask that if the member indicates that he will be at a particular place and wishes to obtain the necessary ballot paper to record his vote he can do so.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  The union has the right but the member has not. We are concerned that the member's <Col N="83" /> right be fully safeguarded, irrespective of what the union executive may decide to do.  Members who are far removed from the scene of activity of the union meeting will see the newspaper advertisement and will have the right to demand a postal vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of Deputy Dowling's amendment would be to provide that every member of a union would be entitled to a postal vote where the circumstances warrant it.  That question was raised by him during the Committee Stage debate of the Bill and I indicated then that I believed the Bill already made adequate provisions in this regard.  I pointed out that section 3 (1) (c), which states that the method of voting shall consist of the marking of a voting paper by the person voting, would permit trade unionists to arrange for postal votes.  That provision must be taken in conjunction with 3 (1) (b), which states that:</P>
      <P>Every member of the union shall be allowed to vote without interference or constraint and, so far as is reasonably possible, shall be given a fair opportunity of voting.</P>
      <P>That would mean that under the provisions of the Bill it would be obligatory on a union to afford an opportunity of postal voting to those members who for one reason or another were unable to be physically present at the voting centre.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may recall that I confirmed to him by letter in December, when transmitting a copy of a Report Stage amendment relating to secret ballots which I was considering moving to the Bill, that the Parliamentary Draftsman has confirmed, as I had thought when speaking on an earlier Stage of the Bill, that postal voting would have to be provided for where circumstances warrant it.

Despite the best efforts of the executive to contact such a man, it might be impossible to get him.  That man might know his own movements within a week but the executive will not know them.  Such a man should be able to say that he wishes to avail of a postal vote because he will be at Tory island, Rathlin island or some other outpost at the time the voting is to take place. His voting paper would then arrive. The onus would be on the particular member to make it known that he wants to avail of the postal vote.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 31 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the union shall cause to be published in at least one daily newspaper published in the State notice (in such form as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under section 12) of the holding of the vote.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage debate on the Bill the following amendment was moved by Deputy Dowling and was accepted by me:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), between lines 22 and 23, to insert a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e) not less than seven days before voting on the resolution begins, the union shall cause to be published in the daily morning newspapers notice of the holding of the vote.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The affect of this amendment would be to require a trade union to publish in the daily newspapers notice of the holding of a ballot on a resolution approving an instrument of amendment or transfer.  We discussed this with the Parliamentary Draftsman <Col N="86" /> and he has suggested that Deputy Dowling's amendment should be replaced by that set out in this amendment here.  This revised amendment does not differ in substance from that of Deputy Dowling and the changes contained in it are mainly designed to ensure that the notice of the holding of the vote may be published in a daily newspaper published in the State.  This is very important.  It also ensures that the notice will be in a form which will be prescribed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regulations to be made under section 12 of the Bill.  In this way it will be possible to ensure that the notice will contain sufficient information about the holding of a vote on an amalgamation or transfer.  I think this meets what the Deputy sought.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following subparagraph.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where the Registrar is of opinion that a complaint is not frivolous or vexatious, the complainant shall be exempted from the payment of expenses or costs under subparagraphs 1 (a) or 1 (f) of this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We dealt at great length with this on Committee Stage.  If a union member is entitled to pursue a claim which he believes is a valid one, even if the court decides against him, that person should not have to pay the union's costs.  This would deter people from pursuing a valid claim.  A person should not be denied his rights because of a penal clause such as we have here.  To quote from the Schedule, on a complaint made under section 9 the registrar may:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(e) order the whole or any part of the expenses of hearing the complaint, as certified by him, to be paid <Col N="88" /> either out of the funds of the trade union or by the complainant; and</P>
    <P>(f) order the trade union to pay to the complainant out of the funds of the union, or the complainant to pay to the union, either a specified sum in respect of the costs incurred by the complainant or the union (as the case may be) or the taxed amount of those costs.</P>
    <P>I can understand the Minister wanting to safeguard against frivolous complaints, but the bulk of complaints will be responsible ones, and the registrar would be able to decide which complaints were frivolous and which were not.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that people who feel they have a legitimate case can pursue their claims without the threat, if the cause is lost technically or on a marginal basis, of having to foot the Bill.  Under the Redundancy Acts if a person pursues a legitimate claim, the costs are paid out of the redundancy fund.  In this case he has to dip into his own pocket in pursuance of a just and valid claim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraph 1 (e) provides that the registrar may order the complainant or the trade union to pay the costs of the hearing of an appeal, and paragraph 1 (f) provides that he may order either the trade union to pay to the complainant his costs or the complainant to pay to the trade union concerned the expenses incurred by the union.  The effect of Deputy Dowling's amendment would be to provide that the registrar may exempt the complainant from paying any expenses incurred by him under paragraph 1 (e) or 1 (f) provided the registrar is satisfied that the complaint is well founded.</P>
      <P>The Bill as it stands would enable the registrar to meet the point raised.  He has complete discretion in the matter of the awarding of costs. Deputy Dowling's amendment would seek to remove that discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling made the point on Committee Stage that paragraphs 1 (e) and 1 (f) would mean that members of trade unions would be afraid to appeal to the registrar as they might face a substantial bill for costs awarded against them.  The reason I <Col N="89" /> would urge Deputy Dowling to reconsider this amendment is that I believe it would be inappropriate here.  It would be unthinkable that the registrar, as we said earlier in another part of this Bill, a barrister of at least ten years' standing, would award costs against a person who lodged a genuine complaint.</P>
    <P>In addition, the registrar when hearing a complaint, since he has this discretion I referred to, enjoys a position somewhat similar to that of a judge, and it would not be appropriate to interfere with his discretion in the matter of the award of costs. In fact, the guides laid down here and the occupation and standing of the person involved in the hearing ensure that costs will be awarded where justice requires them to be so awarded.  In other words, the provision which Deputy Dowling seeks to have added to the legislation is there already in substance in the Bill, with the one exception that the registrar has discretion in the legislation as we have it here.  Obviously discretion must be exercised in the direction of a person pursuing a genuine complaint.  I would ask Deputy Dowling to bear that in mind. I am not rejecting his amendment simply because I am too attached to the existing sections and subsections. I have already given evidence of being able to accept amendments from Deputy Dowling and I trust I shall continue to do that when desirable but in this case there is really no valid reason for accepting this amendment.  I can understand the Deputy being attached to his amendment but I have considered the amendment diligently and I can see no grounds for the fears he has expressed about the complainant being discriminated against by the registrar unless this amendment is accepted.</P>

      <P>The problem here is to ensure that justice is done and that justice is seen to be done.  The man with the genuine complaint is protected.  Deputies will appreciate <Col N="90" /> that in this area we do not wish to see the interests of perhaps a few thousand people held up because of legislation giving to a vexatious complainant the chance of holding up the entire desirable development.  There are no grounds for any fear than any individual with a genuine complaint will be discriminated against.  We certainly do not want to write into legislation that any and every individual will, with complete assurance on the most trivial objections, be subsidised out of public funds for holding up desirable developments.  I believe that opinion is also the opinion of many of those concerned in this area.</P>

      <P>This is a question of a trade union and a member of that trade union.  Where does the cost come in?  Surely the matter must be pursued to a conclusion.  If the Minister provided that the complainant in the case of vexatious complaints would have to bear the costs we would accept that.  That would be fair enough but why should a person have to pay the trade union expenses?  This is a matter between the trade union and a member who believes he has a legitimate complaint and has the right to pursue that complaint in accordance with the provisions of this Bill.  His trade union can apparently claim expenses against him although he believes he has a legitimate complaint and although he believes he is right.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8 between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Where the Registrar is of opinion that a complaint is not frivolous or vexatious, the complainaint shall be exempted from the provisions of the preceding subparagraph of this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Clause 2 of the Schedule provides:</P>
      <P>A person who, on the application of any person, is required to attend before the Registrar as a witness in proceedings on a complaint under section 9 shall be entitled to be paid by the person on whose application he is so required&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such sum in respect of loss of time and travelling expenses as he would be entitled to on being served with a summons to attend as a witness in the High Court, and</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="92" /> Will this debar a complainant from calling a brother trade unionist to substantiate his claim?  Not alone will the complainant have to pay the costs of the trade union but he will also have to pay the costs of any witnesses he calls.  This is quite wrong.  Surely it is the job of the registrar to listen to complaints and one should not be victimised by being called on to pay compensation in respect of loss of time and travelling expenses.  Surely that would be most unreasonable. The Minister has put it on record that in certain circumstances a person pursuing a legitimate claim will not have to pay, but this is a completely different situation.  The calling of witnesses may be all-important in the pursuance of a legitimate complaint and the fact that one is not on his own and has the support of brother trade unionists can boost a complainant's morale.  The Minister must surely accept this amendment as a reasonable amendment.  It refers to legitimate complaints rather than vexatious or frivolous complaints.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment I am afraid we will have to differ from him in the division lobby.</P>

      <P>The point here is that if the complainant had a legitimate case there would have to be payment for expenses involved in calling witnesses.  We have not got any kind of free legal system here and, therefore, Deputy Dowling's amendment is not quite of a piece with the rest of the legislation.  In the normal course of a case of this sort going to court, witnesses' expenses would have to be paid.  I would ask Deputy Dowling to understand that this amendment is unnecessary, as I see it.  If a person with a genuine case calls a witness, the registrar can compensate him for calling the witness under 1 (f).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two systems here.  The Labour Court has a slightly different system of arranging things from that of a court proper.  In a sense the registrar is the entry to the court proper.  We are already, if not at the portals of the court proper, in the precincts of the court proper when we are in the presence of the registrar.  In a genuine case cited the registrar will have no hesitation in seeing that the complainant is not at a loss.  There is <Col N="94" /> no doubt about that.  Under 1 (f) if a person is in pursuit of a genuine case, payment will have to be made for the calling of witnesses.  Therefore Deputy Dowling's worries do not apply.  The Bill will ensure that no complainant with a genuine case will be at a financial loss.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>If a complaint is made to the Labour Court and there is a sitting of the Labour Court as a result of that complaint, the person who pursues the complaint is not liable for any expenses, witnesses or otherwise.  If a person makes a complaint under the Redundancy Act certain courses are open to him and he is not liable for any expenses.  In this case if a person pursues what he believes to be a legitimate claim and if he calls a witness, he is under the threat of having to pay that witness's expenses in addition to the other expenses he might have to incur.  The registrar hearing the case will be able to enforce any type of penal clause such as we have here.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  It is necessary and desirable that a person should be able to call his fellow workers as witnesses in what he considers to be a legitimate claim.  It is unreasonable to have embodied in the legislation a section which could or could not be enforced at the whim of the registrar. I accept that he will be a very responsible person and that he will carry out his duties in accordance with his instructions, but he is a human being and he may or may not decide on the toss of a coin whether he will impose a penalty, taking into consideration the attitude of the person. This may be an aggressive attitude because he believes in the claim he is pursuing and he believes he has been hoodwinked by his union.  This would apply mainly to small unions rather than to big ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that this aspect should be eliminated from the legislation so that witnesses could be called freely. If it was a frivolous complaint the <Col N="95" /> registrar would not allow a large-scale hearing to develop and there would be no necessity to call witnesses or bring forward union officials to answer charges.  We should have this protection for a person pursuing a legitimate claim.  The Minister does not want frivolous claims.  He wants to ensure that the legislation in no way impedes mergers.  We are of the same opinion, but in the last analysis justice must be done.</P>
    <P>Everybody should have a reasonable opportunity.  If people are given rights under the Bill they should be able to pursue them to the end without fear of incurring financial obligations.  We are all with the Minister on the question of frivolous or vexatious claims. Nobody wants to see a person trying to impede an amalgamation or a merger.  The registrar has the necessary mechanism to deal with the person who has not got a legitimate claim.  It would have gone through a rather lengthy process before one would have to call witnesses and bring in union officials to deal with the matter in a lengthy and detailed way. If that was necessary there is no reason why the registrar should say that the decision is against a person and that that person will have to pay not alone his own costs, the costs of the trade union and the witnesses involved.  That is unreasonable.  It is a clause that would stop people from pursuing what they regard as a legitimate claim.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to imply that the Minister has deliberately inserted this into the Bill to ensure that people would be impeded, but it has this meaning.  I ask the Minister to be reasonable and accept this amendment so that one can freely call witnesses in their own defence of the claim they make.  That is not unreasonable. There are expenses which have to be met otherwise and the onus would be on the individual to meet them, but to specify in the Act that he must pay would impede people from pursuing a legitimate claim.</P>
    <P>A claim may be 99 per cent correct but, because there is that slight doubt, the person pursuing the claim <Col N="96" /> is liable to all this expense.  That is grossly unfair and it is an injustice to the trade unionist.  It is a penal clause that will prevent people from pursuing their legitimate claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has already debated section 9, and Deputy Haughey's amendments thereto, at some length.  Before the adjournment of the debate, I undertook to put down Report Stage amendments so as to extend the range of interests covered by the section and so as to provide for a declaration in writing by a board member when a matter in which he had an interest came up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="97" /> Deputy Molloy, who had not put down any amendments to section 9, then raised the question of applying to board members a provision on the lines of the new section which it is proposed by amendment No. 75 to apply to local councillors.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to stress, as I did the last day, that the proposed provisions in relation to local councillors are of an interim nature.  For that reason, and because the matter is being dealt with in the context of the Planning Bill, it was proposed to provide only for a register of those interests of councillors which would be relevant to the functions exercised by them under the Planning Acts or in relation to the acquisition or disposal of land by a local authority.  While it is true that councillors may, through the use of section 4 of the 1955 Act, occasionally intervene in planning control matters, the interim provisions are related primarily to their functions of plan making and variation, land-use zoning and reservation, land acquisition and disposal.  These functions are not on all-fours with the functions of the board.</P>
    <P>Despite what I have just said, I undertook in the light of the points made in the debate&mdash;and I repeat that undertaking now&mdash;to put down a Report Stage amendment to apply a provision on the lines of the new section 28 (Amendment No. 75) to board members.</P>
    <P>This raises the question as to whether we should go further and include similar provisions in relation to the staff of the board and the officers of planning authorities.  The attitude which I expressed at the time was that it would be preferable to wait for the general legislation which is in preparation when all aspects of the matter could be dealt with.  I felt that the position of these people would be better considered in the general context.</P>
    <P>I have since given the matter very careful consideration.  We may be dealing with the matter in a somewhat piecemeal fashion but, other than that, there is no great objection to the application to board and planning authority staffs of provisions similar to those in section 9 and in amendment No. 75.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> Accordingly, I should like to make it clear that I have no objection in principle to such provisions.  It will be appreciated, of course, that some adaptation of the provisions will be necessary and that there may be complexities in existing local government law which will need to be examined.  Deputy Molloy has already put down amendments which are generally in line with the sort of thing which I have in mind but I am aware that he did not have much time in which to prepare these amendments.  I hope that he will not take it as a reflection on his drafting if I suggest that we should have the matter examined with the Parliamentary Draftsman.</P>
    <P>In any event, it is now too late to put down for discussion on Committee Stage the amendment to section 9 which I promised to introduce on Report Stage.  I would suggest that the more sensible course is that, on Report Stage, we should consider together amendments to deal with the proposal for a register of interests for board members, and for a register of interests and for restrictions in respect of employees of the board and of planning authorities.  We shall by then have had the advantage of our discussion on Committee Stage on amendment No. 75.  Taking it that the amendment will be accepted, I shall put down the further amendments for Report Stage and I envisage that we should then have no difficulty in reaching agreement.</P>

      <P>Our thanks are due to the Minister for meeting the point we were making the last day, but the issue I was putting forward was that, whatever restrictions or obligations are to be laid on members of local authorities as regards declaration of their interests, the same type of restrictions and regulations should apply in the other two areas, the members of the board and the county manager. The Minister seems to be meeting our point of view and suggesting that he will put down an amendment on Report Stage to cover this.  But we still have, on Committee Stage, the Minister's amendment No. 75 which deals with the members of local <Col N="99" /> authorities.  Would it not be better to withdraw that amendment and debate it in full on Report Stage with the other two amendments the Minister is suggesting he will bring forward?</P>

Then we will know better what we are all thinking of and it will afford us an opportunity of deciding what will be inserted.  As we are all aware, discussion on Report Stage is restricted. It would be much better if we could insert it on Committee Stage so that we can discuss it across the House and find out if there are the weaknesses which Deputy Molloy suggests.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle is exactly the same.  I made clear at the outset, and I want to make clear again, that this not the be-all and end-all.  This Bill deals with planning.  I see no reason why this type of principle should not apply all round if the House so feels.  At the outset I said I was prepared to accept reasonable amendments.  I still believe we can have a very good Bill if we follow that line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as we have the Minister's assurance that he will try to introduce something that will cover them all equally.  Leaving all that aside, there is the other point that if the Minister is coming forward with a Bill, which is obviously going to be a very important one laying down provisions obliging persons in public life and public employees to make declarations of interest, in a general sense, in areas other than planning, would the Minister not again consider it foolish going ahead with this piecemeal amendment which deals only with the whole planning field?  Would it not be better to discuss this whole thing globally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think it would be foolish to go ahead with a Planning Bill leaving out certain things which we all feel should be included and then at a later stage introduce a Bill which would cover them.  If we were not contemplating the other Bill at all everybody would agree to put them in planning.  The other is coming along but that does not alter the fact that we need this in planning and therefore we should put it in.  Deputy Molloy accepted the last day that it was necessary that this be included and he suggested that it should be included for officers as well as elected representatives.  I have now accepted that that is a line which should be followed.  I propose to proceed with this Bill, including whoever is likely to be affected, so that when it is passed it will be legislation which can stand on its own.  What we do afterwards is a different matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making the last day was that if the Minister was determined to introduce his amendment No. 75 and all that that implies for members of local authorities our concern was that there would be seen to be equal application of these types of restrictions and rules on persons involved in planning other <Col N="101" /> than merely public representatives.  It was on that basis that we agreed to this.  But we do feel it would be wiser to have a general debate under the Bill the Minister proposes bringing forward because there are very important principles involved and this House is giving them very little thought.</P>
      <P>It is a major change in the traditional obligations and responsibilities that have fallen on members of the Dáil, Seanad and local authorities down through the years.  The Minister now wants to write into legislation things that were accepted as a code of honour.  I wonder if the insertion of an amendment in the middle of a Committee Stage debate is the wisest way to do this.  Would not it have been better to wait and discuss this whole question in very great detail on the general Bill which the Minister proposes introducing later on?  That would seem to us to be the sensible, proper and best way to do it.  It would afford the House an opportunity of understanding exactly what the Government are doing in this respect.  But if the Minister is not prepared to withdraw his amendment and withholds debate on this whole question until such time as the general Bill is brought forward then we must stand over our position in seeking equal application of those types of restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to reinforce what Deputy Molloy has said in this regard because I took the same attitude the last day we discussed this here.  It seems to me that this is a comprehensive and complex piece of legislation in so far as it concerns planning as such and that it is difficult enough to deal with in that way. What we are now introducing, on the side as it were, is almost an equally major subject.  That is, the whole question of disclosure of interests and the responsibility to be placed on elected representatives and public servants of one sort or another. The Minister and the Government are taking the right approach when they say they will bring in one comprehensive <Col N="102" /> piece of legislation to deal with everybody and everything.  I think that is right and the way it should be done because, as Deputy Molloy has said, it is a new departure; it introduces an entirely new principle into our public life.  Therefore, it is correct and fitting that it be dealt with in one comprehensive piece of legislation which will cover everybody and all aspects of public life; that we get away from the notion that has become prevalent in recent times that planning is something corrupt, dangerous and suspect and that attention must be directed specifically to planning matters.</P>
      <P>Therefore I would very strongly urge the Minister to withdraw the whole thing; to withdraw the provisions in regard to public representatives, in regard to local government officials and in regard to the members and staff of this new board and cover everybody in the new comprehensive legislation. I want to express appreciation with Deputy Molloy, of the way in which the Minister is meeting us in this regard.  But if the Minister is going to proceed in the way he suggests and introduces fairly major changes in the public service into this Planning Bill, and then has subsequent comprehensive legislation dealing with Deputies, Senators and public servants of all sorts, we will be left with a sort of legislative mess.  We will have half the law governing these matters in this Planning Bill, where they do not really belong, and the remainder in a comprehensive piece of legislation.  The whole thing would be, to say the least, untidy.</P>

    <P>In addition, there is the important principle to which Deputy Molloy has adverted, that these changes which the Government and the Minister now contemplate are fundamentally important. Therefore, it is important that they should be discussed by the House and be recognised as being the important change they represent.  While agreeing with Deputy Molloy and welcoming the way the Minister is meeting us in this restricted sense, I would very strongly urge&mdash;as I did the last day&mdash; that the whole matter be left over to the comprehensive legislation the Minister <Col N="103" /> tells us the Government have in mind.</P>
    <P>Having said that I would like the Minister to clear up one further matter. This concerns section 9.  As I understand it, we are to have what I shall call the register provisions which are incorporated in amendment No. 75. These provisions are related to the elected representatives of local authorities but the Minister intends now to bring in provisions of a similar type in regard to public authority planning staffs and to the members and staff of the board.  All this is to be incorporated in this Bill.  In addition, is section 9 to remain and will it be changed along the lines which the Minister indicated on the last day or will the section be subsumed into these new amendments which he proposes to introduce on Report Stage?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we had fairly general agreement between us as to the way in which we could recast section 9 but that was in a situation where the Minister's amendment No. 75 was to be applicable only to elected representatives of local government. Will these new proposals in regard to the board and their staff eliminate the need for section 9 or will the section remain in the way in which we agreed it should be amended?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, we reached agreement on the last occasion on a certain form of words which he suggested.  The principle of the section will remain the same.  We will have to include the suggestion put forward subsequently by Deputy Molloy.</P>

      <P>This Bill replaces the previous one.  The big change here is the setting up of a board to replace the Minister in dealing with planning appeals.  The Bill has been on the way for a long time.  Prior to its publication a good deal of Press publicity was given to the question of rezoning.  In regard to rezoning neither the board nor the Minister will have any say in so far as appeals are concerned but in respect of a planning appeal the Minister can contravene the development <Col N="104" /> plan or the zoned areas which are determined by the planning authority.</P>
      <P>While it is good that this whole question of the interest of elected people, whether they be members of the Dáil or of local authorities, be tidied up in a future Bill, I think it was the Press publicity to which I have referred which prompted the Minister on this question of determining planning appeals to introduce the provision for the declaration of interest.  So far as the board and the appeals are concerned the question of zoning does not arise.  Elected members of local authorities do not have very much say either in this regard. Therefore, I agree with the other two speakers who have advocated that the Minister should not deal with this matter in piecemeal fashion.</P>
      <P>While there is agreement on both sides of the House on the question of declaration of interest on the part of members of local authorities and of all those dealing with planning and, indeed, all those dealing with other spheres of activity, we must assume that it is being included here in a rushed manner as a result of the Press publicity given to rezoning in Turnapin Lane and in other areas.  I am not against Press publicity.  It is only right that matters such as this be aired publicly but in this instance I suspect that the Minister was influenced by the publicity.  Therefore, we can take it that in the absence of any such publicity the Bill would have been introduced without this section especially since there is promised a Bill dealing with the interests of those involved in public matters, whether at local or at Dáil level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer that this item be removed from the Bill and that it be included with the other matters which are to be dealt with in a comprehensive piece of legislation so that Members of this House who are interested not only in local government but in all spheres of activity concerning elected Members would have a say in regard to all these matters and that they would be able to study the proposals in that Bill.  It may well be that when the comprehensive Bill is being debated we may wish to change whatever <Col N="105" /> we do in this connection now. Therefore, it would be wise to withdraw section 9 from this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in reiterating what was said the last day.  There seems to be a difference of opinion in that so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned I should not include in this Bill the section dealing with declaration of interest and that we should wait for the subsequent Bill which will be coming before the House, first, when it is ready and, secondly, when it can be taken in the House.  On the other hand the Government want the provision of a declaration of interest included in this Bill.  For a number of reasons we believe that it is essential to include that provision here.</P>
      <P>Listening to the Deputies opposite one would get the impression that never before was there passed legislation which was followed quickly with further legislation.  We know that time and again sections of one Bill are covered by sections of a subsequent Bill or that they are nullified by subsequent legislation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham referred to the newspaper publicity given to the question of rezoning.  That is fair comment. I suppose that that publicity had some bearing on the measure proposed here in so far as I decided to take certain action in view of certain matters that had come to light.  I do not like the type of newspaper publicity where apparently it is all right for named or unnamed scribes to say terrible things about a politician or a member of a local authority.  It is well known that politicians do not come out too well out of courthouses.  After a lot of annoyance they may win and even get a small amount in damages. For that reason some statements published in the newspapers are not challenged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All this can be avoided so far as planning is concerned.  We should lay down regulations in this Bill making it an offence to do this.  I believe that elected representatives, no matter to what organisations they belong, are honourable men and women.  I also believe it is wrong that people throughout the country should try to claim that they alone are pure and <Col N="106" /> everybody else belongs to a gang of crooks, especially those engaged in politics.  The only way we can ensure that this is stopped is to put down the score in black and white.  Then, if somebody wants to have a go it will be easy to deal with him because this legislation covers the rules of the game so far as planning is concerned. I am sure my colleagues across the floor agree that we should lay down these rules.  Having done so, all this nonsense which has been carried on for some time will be stopped.  Therefore we must include in this Bill the section I have put in.  The other Bill will be introduced later.  I told Deputy Haughey that I was an anxious as he to have this Bill passed quickly.  I think we agreed on the end of June, if possible.</P>

      <P>If the Minister tells us that he will stick to amendment No. 75, and we assume he has the vote to put it through, we feel this question would be better dealt with under the general Bill, which will cover every aspect and not single out and make a separate case for planning. If the Minister goes ahead with the amendment and will not accept our advice to withdraw and discuss this new principle under the general Bill, we must insist that our amendments be incorporated in some way in his suggested amendments on the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>There is not much point in delaying for very much longer on section 9, if the Minister is adamant and will not accept our wise advice.  It would be better for Parliament if this were not discussed in a sleight-of-hand way.  It came in after the Bill was published and was put in as an amendment which we have shown to be lopsided. This area could be greatly improved by an examination by way of debate in the House.  As I said, if the Minister is adamant in going ahead with the amendment we will accept his assurance to bring in his amendments on the Report Stage which will apply the same principle to members and staff of the board, to the county and city managers and planning staffs in the local authorities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 4, line 44, to delete &ldquo;such and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the moment the section reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall appoint such and so many persons to be employees of the Board as the Board, subject to the approval of the Minister, from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>I am concerned here with the question of the approval of the Minister.  As the section stands, the Minister would have to approve of the person appointed by the board.  The effect of including the words &ldquo;such and&rdquo; in line 44 would be that the Minister would have to approve of the particular person the board wish to appoint.  I do not want that and I am sure the Minister does not want it either.  It is intended that the Minister should approve the number of persons the board should appoint. That is desirable.  The Minister responsible for a board should have control over the number of persons employed by that board.  I think we would all agree with that principle but the inclusion of the words &ldquo;appoint such and so many persons&rdquo; in the section would infer that the Minister could say &ldquo;I do not approve of Mr. X&rdquo; and that is what I do not want.</P>

I can partly understand that but he should know that this is a common form which has been followed in section 14 of the Higher Education Act, 1971 and section 26 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The phraseology is the same and it has a definite meaning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was around and I think his feet went in a certain direction.  The appointments are subject <Col N="110" /> to the approval of the Minister and this means that he will require to be satisfied as to the method of selection and the type of posts being filled and this is how it is interpreted in previous legislation where it has been put in. There is no question of the Minister having any right to say whether the individual person is right or wrong. That does not come into it.  This is established practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only look at the words as I see them and it seems to me that a simple, straightforward reading of the section would result in the following interpretation.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>The Board shall appoint such and so many persons to be employees of the Board as the Board, subject to the approval of the Minister, from time to time thinks proper.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that that clearly and definitely implies that the Minister must approve of the particular individual appointed.  I doubt whether the Minister, by sheer force of logic, can dissuade me from that point of view. If he leaves out the words &ldquo;such and&rdquo; we will be left with the perfectly valid situation where the Minister will be able to say to the Board: &ldquo;You can appoint ten planners and six clerical officers&rdquo; but not to approve of the appointment of a particular individual. As the section now stands that is the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Deputy Haughey's point but I still do not agree with him. It is necessary that the persons who are appointed to the board shall be selected in a certain way and this is the only thing that comes in because there might be, if this is left out, the question of some entirely irregular method of appointing people to the board and the Minister, who would be the only person in authority, would not have any right to say: &ldquo;That is an irregular appointment.&rdquo;</P>

I asked the Minister to consider writing such a guarantee into the Bill.  Since then the Minister has introduced amendment No. 23 which does empower the board to engage such consultants or advisers as they may consider necessary for the discharge of their functions.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be quite clear to the House what I am getting after in this amendment. We are concerned in section 12 with the situation where an employee of the board, for one reason or another, becomes a member of either House of the Oireachtas or indeed a <Col N="113" /> member of a local authority.  I am concerned with the position of persons who are employees of the board who become members of either House of the Oireachtas.  As section 12 stands at the moment there is an inherent contradiction in its terms and it is wrong in principle.  Where members of the Seanad are concerned it deals with the situation where a person is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  When a person is nominated as a Member of Seanad Éireann he is immediately a Member of Seanad Éireann.  But when we come to Members of Dáil Éireann the section visualises that an employee of the board should cease to be in such employment when he becomes nominated for election to Dáil Éireann.  That is wrong.  An employee of the board should not be asked to give up his employment simply because he is nominated for election to the Dáil.  I am perfectly prepared to accept that he should give up his employment when he is elected to the Dáil but it is entirely wrong and against recent trends in these matters that an employee who is lucky enough, or unlucky enough, to be selected by a convention and nominated for election should have to give up his employment.  He may not be elected but he would have to give up employment.  We should be quite clear on the principle involved here. The principle should apply both to Members of the Seanad and Members of the Dáil, that it is necessary to give up employment with the board only when one is actually elected to either House.</P>

In fact, a system was decided on in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1973, that a member of the Public Service Advisory Council would cease to be a member on being nominated as a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas.

      <P>The House passed that legislation and the Deputy cannot ignore that fact, whether he supported the legislation or otherwise.  All of us must take responsibility for it.  When I consider some of these matters I spoke against in this House that eventually were passed it causes me some worry, but there is nothing much I can do about it.  I must take my share of responsibility, as must all Members. I think the Deputy will agree that we must ensure there will not be a conflict of interest.  The proposal included here is a sensible one.  As the Deputy has pointed out, it is only a matter of a few weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned with the employee of the board who is nominated for election.  The trend, both by this Government and our party when in office, was towards making the Houses of the Oireachtas more accessible to everyone who has a genuine interest in coming into them.  This is a principle to which all of us subscribe.  Employees of the board should be facilitated in every way in becoming Members of either House of the Oireachtas if they are so inclined and if they have the ability and capacity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way the section stands at the moment it could act as a deterrent, so that a likely and suitable person might not go forward for election, and I want to avoid that.  If such a person is nominated for election but fails to be elected he would be deprived of <Col N="115" /> two or three weeks' salary and allowances, which could be important.  I do not think that impediment should be placed on any person.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from recollection but I think the whole trend in this regard in recent times is that Members of either House should not be members of State company boards and similar boards.  That is a perfectly valid and desirable principle and one that should be adhered to.  However in other pieces of legislation&mdash;apart from the instance quoted by the Minister, of which I am not aware&mdash;we have stipulated that the disqualification of membership of boards applies from election only.  Perhaps we could leave this matter over and check on it but, speaking from recollection, I am sure we have been adhering to the principle that it is only when a person is elected to either House or nominated to the Seanad that he is no longer eligible to be a member of a board. That should apply to members of this board also.</P>
    <P>I do not think either the Minister or myself would be especially concerned with the employee who is nominated for election and is subsequently elected.  That person is not in the same position but I am much more concerned with the person who is nominated for election but who, in the event of his failure to be elected, stands to lose salary and allowances for the two or three weeks of the campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The argument of the Minister with regard to Deputy Haughey's amendment is difficult to understand in view of the strong case he made with regard to the election of clerical officers to local authorities. We argued they should not seek to be elected and become members of the local authority.  The Minister is now saying that a member of a board who <Col N="116" /> is dealing with planning appeals should not be allowed to be a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy misunderstands me.  That is not so.  I have no objection to a person being a candidate but while he is a candidate he should not be allowed to work on appeals that have gone before the board.  That is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it the other way round.  When he is working on appeals he should not be a candidate &mdash;that is what the Minister is saying. During the debate with regard to election to local authorities we tried to convince him that clerical officers were not suitable to be elected members of local authorities but the Minister pushed legislation through which permits a clerical officer working in the planning section and dealing with applications on a much wider scale than this board&mdash;the latter will be dealing only with planning appeals&mdash; to become an elected member of the local authority.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's amendment seeks to allow a member of the board to be a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas.  If he succeeds he resigns as a member of the board.  At the very least the Minister should allow a person to have a run at it.</P>

      <P>I would hate to start going back over all the arguments we have had in this House but Deputy Cunningham is repeating an argument he made during the Second Stage on this Bill.  He again seems to have missed the point.  He was talking about clerical officers.  They do not make decisions on planning.  I am talking about the members of an appeal board who not alone make decisions but make decisions on a planning appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Employees of the board. They would be people doing work which would specifically deal with <Col N="117" /> recommendations for decisions.  Clerical officers do not make those.  They are planning officers and engineers. They do not make the recommendations on which the decisions are taken finally.  It is like putting a battery into something.  If you push the battery in the wrong way round it does not work.  Deputy Cunningham's suggestion that I was stopping people from standing for election if they were employees of the board is wrong.  Of course they can stand for election.  I am saying that when they are standing they cannot take part in the appeals procedure. I do not think any of us would like to go into an inquiry over a planning appeal and find that the man who was taking the evidence, taking the decision and making the recommendation, was our opposite number for election to Dáil Éireann in our constituency, let it be Donegal, Dublin, Galway or Meath.</P>

      <P>Before section 13 to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) It shall be the duty of an employee of the Board to give to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government a declaration in the prescribed form, signed by him and containing particulars of every interest of his which is an interest to which this section applies and for so long as he continues to be an employee of the Board it shall be his duty, where there is a change regarding an interest particulars of which are contained in the declaration or where he acquires any other interest to which this section applies, to give to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government a fresh such declaration.</P>
      <P>(2) This section applies to the following interests, namely:</P>
      <P>(a) any estate or interest which an employee of the Board has in land situated in the State,</P>
      <P>(b) any business of dealing in or developing land in which such an employee is engaged or employed and any such business carried on by a company or other body of which he, or any nominee of his, is a member,</P>

    <P>(a) in case the person is such an employee on the commencement of this section, on such commencement,</P>
    <P>(b) in case the person becomes such an employee after the commencement of this section, on the day on which he becomes such an employee,</P>
    <P>(c) in case there is a change regarding an interest particulars of which are contained in a declaration already given by the person or where the person acquires any other interest to which this section applies, on the day on which the change occurs or the other such interest is acquired.</P>
    <P>(4) For the purposes of this section an employee of the Board shall be regarded as having an estate or interest in land if he, or any nominee of his, is a member of a company or other body which has an estate or interest in the land.</P>
    <P>(5) The Secretary of the Department of Local Government shall for the purposes of this section keep a register (which register is in this section referred to as the register of employees' interests) and shall enter therein the particulars contained in declarations given to him pursuant to this section.  The register of employees' interests shall be kept at the office of the Secretary of the Department of Local Government and shall be available for public inspection during office hours.</P>
    <P>(6) Where a person ceases to be an employee of the Board, any particulars entered in the register of employees' interests as a result of a declaration being given by the person to the Secretary of the Department <Col N="121" /> of Local Government pursuant to this section shall be removed, as soon as may be after the expiration of the period of five years beginning on the day on which the person ceases to be such an employee, from the said register by the said Secretary.</P>
    <P>(7)  Subject to subsection (8) of this section, a person who fails to comply with subsection (1) of this section or who, when purporting to comply with the requirements of the said subsection (1), gives particulars which are to his knowledge false or misleading in a material respect, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds, or at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(8)  In any proceeding for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the defendant to prove that at the relevant time he believed, in good faith and upon reasonable grounds, either that there was no matter as regards which he was then required to make a declaration under subsection (1) of this section or that the matter in relation to which the offence is alleged was not one as regards which he was so required to make such declaration.</P>
    <P>(9)  In this section &lsquo;company&rsquo; means a company within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act, 1963, or a company incorporated outside the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The principle incorporated in my amendment will be incorporated in an amendment to be brought forward by the Minister on Report Stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but as the Minister knows, Opposition Deputies do not have parliamentary draftsmen available to them.  What I am trying to convey in this amendment is that the board shall appoint these people only after open competition and that it shall keep a list of all these consultants so appointed and shall publish the remuneration paid to such persons in its annual statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is feasible.  It is easy enough in regard to people appointed to the board who would be &ldquo;regulars&rdquo;, but it would not be so easy when you come to the out of the way ones.  As changes in technology occur more complicated appeals will be coming before the board, and I do not think there should be an open competition for a person who might be required only once.  It would be reasonable and necessary to give the board discretion and flexibility. For instance, in regard to the atomic energy plants, it might be necessary to attract a consultant with special knowledge in a particular field. The requirement that the board should publish all remuneration of each consultant would put them in a very disadvantageous position relative to competitors, including the public and local services, where such a requirement does not apply.  By virtue of section 8 (2) of the Bill the Minister can <Col N="125" /> require the board to supply him with information as to payments to consultants and, in addition, the accounts prepared under section 7 will include the remuneration paid to consultants, and the Minister could indeed require that they be prepared in such a form as to show separately the total payments to consultants.  That should be sufficient.  We are out to set up a board which will work and work well. If we hamper it too much it can completely destroy the whole object of the board, and I would ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw his amendment, as it would not help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This board is a wholly new creature arriving on the scene. It will have very elaborate powers, and it does not have to answer to Parliament in the manner in which the Minister has to answer.  At present the Minister is the person charged with carrying out the function of deciding planning appeals. When this board is established we, on behalf of the people, will have very little facility to, if you like, get at this board to be satisfied that it is operating in an open and fair manner, bearing in mind the importance of the work it will be undertaking and the effect its decisions can have on development in this country and the influential position it will hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board when appointed is to be allowed, as the Minister suggests, to appoint consultants to advise it on certain matters which it considers necessary for the discharge of its functions, we shall be allowing a State board which is not answerable here directly to hand out very well paid jobs to certain professional people in this country and possibly even at times from abroad.  I do not see that it is any great encumbrance on this board that it should be obliged to place an advertisement in the newspapers inviting the persons who would have the type of expertise and knowledge it is seeking to apply for the position, to consider their credentials and consider which one they should appoint. Also I do not see why such persons should not have their names retained on a list to be published in the annual report, and whatever moneys are paid <Col N="126" /> to them by this board should be made public.</P>
    <P>I think the amendment is a very reasonable one.  We are attempting to close as many loopholes as we can. In creating a new board of this nature we are hoping that all that is contained in the Bill will work efficiently and satisfactorily.  The Bill is based on practical experience and a certain amount of reasonable hope as to how this thing will work; in fact, we do not know how it will work. The personalities appointed to the board will very much set the trend for the future work of this board.  I would be anxious to see that they are tied down as much as possible, especially in matters where they would not be answerable directly to the House. I do not think the requirement of the amendment I have put down is a very great encumbrance on the board or would in any way interfere with the availability of expertise and advice to the board in its operation.</P>

      <P>It is rather amusing. Deputy Haughey made a comment a few minutes ago that surely it was not necessary to spell this thing out and I said it was not but we felt it was well to copperfasten it.  But it just goes to show that if you try to be too perfect you run into all sorts of trouble.  If the amendment was not in the power would be there to do this, and in fact successive Ministers have been using specialists dealing with appeals since the 1963 Act came into operation without this requirement, and there is provision under other legislation for the appointment of these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is other legislation under which boards have the authority to employ specialists.  The argument was in favour of getting the board away from the Minister for Local Government and his staff and putting it on a different plane.  Having put them there and having hedged them round <Col N="127" /> with many restrictions, I am not sure whether Deputy Molloy is happy about the situation now because he has referred to the fact that the board will not be answerable as the Minister is.  That would seem to me to be going perhaps too far in our efforts at trying to copperfasten this.  Deputy Molloy's amendment is simply not reasonable because if we do what he suggests then something will have to be done that is not being done already and there will have to be a special reason for it. As I said, there will be provision under which certain information can be available. I believe this is entirely different from the special consultants.  They are different from the part-time staff engaged to decide planning appeals, retired local authority engineers, and so on, and they are dealt with under section 10.  These are a different breed altogether.  I do not think this amendment should be accepted.  Special consultants have been engaged in the past by successive Ministers.  Deputy Molloy himself had that experience.</P>

The Minister is handing this responsibility over to people who will not be responsible to the public, as the Minister is; if the Minister does something wrong <Col N="128" /> he has to go before the people.  Here he is handing over this responsibility to a board, an allegedly independent board.  I do not know anybody in this country who is completely independent. The Minister will give these people authority to appoint experts. This is a word that annoys me.</P>

I do not think that would be reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be as concerned about this question of open competition as Deputy Molloy is, but I see his point.  I would be more concerned with keeping a list of consultants and publishing the remuneration paid to them in the annual statement of the board.  This is a very important matter.  I am sure the Minister is as well aware as I am of a story in current circulation; it has a certain background which I shall not recount to the House for reasons of delicacy and good taste.  The point of the story is that, when one can no longer do it oneself, one becomes a consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> To some extent in recent times, in the public service and elsewhere, we have all become victims of this consultancy mania.  Nowadays when a problem crops up, instead of getting to grips with the problem ourselves and accepting our own responsibilities and bringing our own common sense, experience and intelligence to bear on it, we rush to bring in consultants.  Very often in many different aspects of trade, industry, commerce and the public service, we find people masquerading as consultants who, on closer investigation, turn out to be people who have failed miserably in their own particular trade or profession prior to establishing themselves as consultants.</P>
    <P>I say this because I am concerned that the board should employ only proper, worthwhile, useful firms of consultants and the only way in which we and the general public can be satisfied in this is if the consultants engaged by the board are known, their names published and also the fees paid to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>And their cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And their cost.  In this House from time to time Deputies, usually on this side of the House, put down questions to the Taoiseach or the Minister for Justice about the counsel employed by the State over a particular period and the fees paid to them.  That information is disclosed to the House and to the public.  In other areas too the fees paid to professional firms, experts and consultants are fully disclosed to the House and to the public. In certain other areas they are not. The Minister and Deputy Molloy have been seeking for a generality to apply and to have any restrictions, limitations or compulsions imposed apply to everybody.  There is a great deal to be said in favour of having published in the annual report of this board the names and qualifications of the consultants and certainly the fees paid to the consultants.  I would press that aspect of Deputy Molloy's amendment very strongly.  It would, perhaps, be even more important that these consultants should only be employed through a process of open competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once we knew who the consultants <Col N="130" /> were, what their standing was, what their reputation was and what fees were paid to them, we would be in a much safer position to ensure that these very important matters were decided on the basis of really expert specialist advice and not on the basis of advice or opinion submitted by&mdash;and they do exist&mdash;serious firms of consultants.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister again to deal with the matter of Dáil Questions. In regard to the activities of the board, would Deputies be entitled to put down a question to the Minister about the employment of consultants by the board?  Would he or his successor in office be prepared to give information about this aspect of the board's activities? If he says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, we should press very strongly to have this sort of information included in the board's annual reports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we should not confine ourselves to open competition for consultants or advisers. We may come across problems.  Take a smelter for example.  We may have many advisers on a panel who may not be equipped to deal with such a complex problem and we may have to go outside the country.  We should always keep our options open on the the type of advice we get, depending on the type of development going on. The same would apply to oil refineries and we might not have the expert opinion or the environmental expertise to deal with them.  Perhaps if we had consulted people, we would not have the farce we have in Bantry Bay today as a result of wrong decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we should be open-minded. We should not have a panel.  I would not be terribly concerned about whether the money paid should be made public. I am concerned that we should appoint people with the proper expertise and that we should get value for our money. We cannot pay a good man enough but we can pay a bad man too much. I would not have any regard for what I would see about fees in the paper. I am concerned that the consultant should give us the right advice.  We should not confine ourselves to panels. We should select experts for the job <Col N="131" /> we want done.  I am easy about fees so long as a good job is done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We were debating this at a very reasonable level.  Quite honestly I believe we are moving away from that now.  I would not like to say that Deputy Haughey seems to feel consultants are an abomination, but he did not seem to think a heck of a lot of them.  McKinsey and Buchanan come to mind.  This Government did not employ those consultants.  I am not even talking about consultants of that kind now.  Supposing it is decided that an atomic energy plant is to be erected. We have to get experts.  We have to get somebody who really knows how it operates and what its effects will be. Is it seriously suggested by the Opposition that we should have an open competition before we employ someone to give us that advice?  Let us be reasonable about this.</P>
      <P>Of course the names can be listed in the annual reports.  I would be a bit doubtful about whether the fees should be made public.  It might be possible to get somebody to give advice for a fee but, if he thought a rival of his would be given information about how much he charged and this could be used against him at a later stage, he might not be too happy about giving his advice.  We are not talking about the generality; we are talking about really expert people who are top class in their field.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is very much in the amendment suggested by Deputy Molloy.  There is no reason why we should not give the names.  I am doubtful about the wisdom of including fees for publicity purposes.  I would most certainly oppose the idea that we should have an open competition. Having an open competition for somebody like this is completely ruling out the use by the planning board of certain types of specialists who would not come to this country for a job if they had to sit for an open competition before they were employed.  This is not reasonable.  It is bordering on the ludicrous to suggest that they should be asked to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Molloy was putting <Col N="132" /> down his amendment, maybe he did not advert to this sort of thing.  Maybe he wondered whether we should insist on getting the best inside the country.  I would be with him there but, after that, we should depend on the planning board.  The planning board should have the full confidence of the House and therefore the confidence of the country.  I cannot understand why we should be asked to hedge them around with so many restrictions that it would be exceedingly difficult for them to work.</P>
    <P>I believe the amendment is not wise.  I ask Deputy Molloy to withdraw it.  There is no reason why we should not give a list of the people employed.  I will have a look at the question of the fees.  I think open competition is completely out.  It would cause too many complications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister has been saying, in rejecting the full amendment&mdash;he now seems to be accepting part of it&mdash;he laid great emphasis on the word &ldquo;specialist&rdquo;. He even pulled up Deputy Callannan for using the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;not expert, specialist&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the word &ldquo;specialist&rdquo; in the Minister's amendment which authorises the board to engage consultants or advisers.  It does not mention the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;specialist&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Being a wise board they will only consult specialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We could debate whether we can have good legislation by assumption or by writing into the legislation exactly what we mean.  I would be in favour of ensuring that the Bill was as detailed as possible and with as many built-in safeguards <Col N="133" /> as possible against the type of suspicions which the Minister and others have cast on those who were involved in making planning decisions.  If this board are to carry out that onerous task, we should ensure that they know exactly what their job is.</P>
      <P>To reject the amendment on the grounds that it is confined to specialists, which it is not, and to build a case around some large oil depot, or refinery, or some such dirty industry of a large nature, is tending to use emotionalism to justify the rejection of the amendment.  The powers of the board are quite simple.  They are not confined to engaging specialists when they are considering a major dirty industry such as a smelter or a refinery. They can appoint consultants or anybody they consider can advise them at any time.</P>
      <P>I can foresee a position in which the board may feel that the pressure of work on them is unbearable, that they have inadequate full-time staff to deal with the number of cases coming before them, and decide to engage outside persons as consultants or advisers to enable them to clear a backlog of planning appeals.  They are quite free to do that under the terms of the Minister's amendment which empowers them to do it.  In such cases we are creating another type of sinecure, something equivalent to the powers of the Attorney General handing out briefs to senior counsel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This board will have power to hand out briefs to consultants or to persons whom they consider are in a position to advise them. This could be done on a large scale and could be quite remunerative for those so appointed.  All I want is this safeguard written in, if they are to be the distributors of much largesse to certain persons, professional or otherwise. They should be obliged to publish the list of the names of persons so appointed.  It would be much fairer and more acceptable in the <Col N="134" /> public eye if in seeking persons to help them carry out their function they inserted advertisements stating that they were open to receive applications and that these would be considered.</P>
      <P>If that is not written in the members of the board will be allowed to operate a form of closed shop which is not a very good principle to be writing into a new planning Bill.  I am opposed to such a move.  In order to keep this in the open so that everyone can see what the board are doing it would be a simple obligation to require them to state it in the advertisement and to publish a list of those appointed. They should tell the taxpayer also how much they have paid such persons.</P>
      <P>If the Attorney General issues a lot of briefs to friends of his own at least the names of those persons and the amounts paid to them are published if the information is sought by way of parliamentary question.  However, as I understand it, we will not have the power to obtain this information from the board by way of parliamentary question.  We will be told by the Minister of the day that under the Planning Act of 1974&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We can be told if we ask such a question that it is a matter for the board and we will get no information. However, if the board are obliged to publish it in their annual statement, the Members of this House, and the taxpayers, will be happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thought this suggestion was unreasonable, but I cannot see how he deems it so.  It is one of the most reasonable suggestions I have made during the course of the debate on this Bill.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his stand on this matter. I accept that, in hinting he may be prepared to publish a list and that he may be prepared to publish in a very <Col N="135" /> vague form the amount paid, the Minister has gone a bit of the way. The Minister has stated that he is not happy about the open competition, but surely he can see that the board will have the power to issue briefs to certain persons without any obligation to consider others who may be much greater specialists in the particular field.  Because of this the board may decide to appoint people who are second best.</P>
    <P>If those interested in doing the work had the opportunity of offering themselves and the board was then obliged to make a decision between those who offered it would meet our case.</P>

Deputy Molloy said he was surprised that I found his form of amendment unacceptable.  Not alone was it unacceptable to me but it was unacceptable to Deputy Haughey who said so tonight.</P>
      <P>We can make this unworkable if we want or we can be serious about appointing a board which will do a good job.  When I started tonight I was under the impression that new year resolutions had been made by the Fianna Fáil Party to co-operate and make this a good board.  Deputy Haughey has stuck to that but I get the impression that Deputy Molloy has broken his resolution and has gone back to the old story of obstruct, obstruct, obstruct.</P>

Deputy Molloy is talking as if we were talking about an open competition for all people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It can.  If Deputy Molloy checked he would find that under the present Minister a lot of people who were employed under him when he <Col N="137" /> was Minister, and his predecessor, are still in that employment.  The idea is to get the best possible advice.  It appears that Deputy Molloy has satisfied himself that the people who are to be appointed to the board will either be terribly crooked or a lot of nincompoops who will not be able to do anything right.  That is terribly unfair. We should realise that this House has agreed that a board should be appointed and, having agreed to that, there is no use attempting to put into the Bill regulations which would prevent that board from working properly. I am not prepared to accept that there should be open competition for consultants.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether or not briefs are handed out to people, senior or junior counsel or anybody else, I do not know the way such things are done.  I have heard stories down through the years about how various Governments do these things.  A lot of it is sheer imagination.  Apparently if one is getting something from a Government it is all right, but if somebody else is getting it then it is all wrong.  In this case we are attempting to set up a board which will be independent no matter what Government are in office and which will attempt to deal with planning as we believe it should be dealt with.  But there is still an insistence that some ridiculous regulation be inserted which would prevent them effectively from looking outside for an expert if they needed one because I am sure that even Deputy Molloy would admit that one would not get here an expert on, for instance, atomic power.  While Deputy Molloy has said that I am referring only to the dirty industries and so on, there are plenty of people here to advise on ordinary things.  It is ludicrous to suggest that some of those people who are real experts on such subjects, living in countries where they operate already, should first come over here and sit an open competition before being appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore I am not prepared to accept that section of the amendment. I am prepared to agree that the list should go into the annual report and I am prepared to consider whether or <Col N="138" /> not the question of remuneration could be included&mdash;perhaps not individually&mdash;but in such a way that we will at least know what is being paid to them.  That is as far as I am prepared to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not lay stress on the point the Minister brought out in his last few words about experts coming over here and sitting an open competition. If that is what the Minister thinks I have in mind perhaps we could have a meeting of minds on this issue by further discussion.  Could the Minister give me an assurance, in some form, that the board would be obliged, in appointing persons to advise it, consultants or otherwise, to make it known in some way so that those who wanted to offer their services could do so and that a choice could be made from that group?  I do not want to tie people down to an open competition.  That is not really what I had in mind at all.  But I want to get away from the closed shop idea such as we have seen operating in regard to the Attorney General's relationship with senior counsel.  That is what we are setting up here&mdash;that this board can hand out briefs to consultants, engineers, planning experts, all types of people.  It should be made open in some way.  It should be made known, through some trade magazines or Government publication, that anybody interested in offering their services for this work should do so now, or establish a panel on to which people would be allowed write their names, such as happens with a combined purchasing arrangement.  In that case, I think manufacturers offer their names to the combined purchasing section of the Department of Local Government and tender their various prices.  It is done on an offer basis and decisions are then taken, perhaps on a price basis or others, such as quality and ability to deliver the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to get away from the idea that the board can hand out briefs to this wide range of persons without being obliged to do so in an open fashion.  They can have their pals.  The Minister chose to talk about atomic <Col N="139" /> stations, smelters, oil refineries.  The Minister seemed to deny that what I was saying would in fact happen, but I think it can unless the Minister can show me to the contrary.  Under the amendment the Minister proposes here, which we have accepted already, the board can appoint the type of persons to whom I have been referring&mdash;doctors, engineers, persons with planning qualifications, scientists, any kind of skilled person who can be of assistance at some point in a planning appeal. Those people could be resident in Ireland. One could have one firm of planning consultants set up here getting all the business from the new State planning board.  I would not agree with that at all.  We would be wrong to allow a Bill to pass here without referring to such a happening and without trying to close that loophole.  That is all I want to do.  From my experience and knowledge of the Minister's work and of his thinking I feel that deep down the Minister would agree with the argument I am making.  I am surprised that the Minister has not seen my point of view in this respect.  Perhaps we could get away from this idea of a form of competition if there was a panel established.</P>

      <P>As far as the question of appointment is concerned, what happens&mdash;and has been happening for years&mdash;is that somebody is required to give advice and such people are not so easy to come by; they are not queueing up for a planning appeal to occur so that somebody would ask them to advise.</P>

I am sorry to revert again to the question of the smelter and the atomic energy plant, but they are the exceptions where we would be trying the planning board if we were not careful. <Col N="140" /> If I remember correctly, in the smelter case, there were two experts only available in England.  One of them was taken up on one side and the Department of Local Government engaged the other.</P>

I do not want to tie their hands.  I would be prepared to consider the question of having some kind of an advertisement inviting applications by those who might be interested.  But unless we are going to have political interference&mdash;and by that I mean interference by the Minister and the Department of Local Government &mdash;the planning board will have to make the decision themselves as to who they should appoint.  There would have to be room for an exception, when required, to go outside for experts required to do the job.  I would go that far with Deputy Molloy if we could agree on some form of words to meet it.  But &ldquo;open competition&rdquo; is not the form of words that would be acceptable at all because it would tie things up too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Open competition&rdquo; for a specialised job.  For instance, the Minister speaks about oil refineries and smelters.  We managed to get only one expert here.  I regret the use of the word &ldquo;experts&rdquo; because I do not believe there are any experts.  I mean somebody who would know a little more about the subject than would the Minister himself.  But, if we are looking for that type of man we will have to go outside for him.  There might be two or three countries abroad experiencing the same type of problem.  A competition could be held among them.  But I am talking about the general type of consultant we have in this country&mdash; for instance on the subject of what <Col N="141" /> is and what is not an amenity.  They are a crowd of cranks who, if employed by the board, would not allow anybody to build anything anywhere. They would go along and say: &ldquo;You cannot put a house here.&rdquo;  Then you would get another consultant who would say: &ldquo;A house there would improve the amenity.&rdquo;  That is the type of consultant which has this country ruined.  Such people were consulted in regard to many buildings here and, to my mind, they destroyed the countryside. Any man with common sense would have made a better job of it. I would recommend a competition of that type within the country.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not turn down the question of publishing payment. The country is entitled to know how much this new board will cost the Exchequer.  That is why I feel it very important that this House be supplied with that information.  I have strong views on that subject.</P>

Surely it is not suggested that such people be asked to take part in periodic open competitions before being considered, because that is what the amendment says?  I would agree that in so far as possible within the country, everybody who wished to apply would be given the opportunity of so doing. But in regard to the question of people from outside, we would have to find some way whereby the board would be allowed to seek people from outside if the necessary extra expertise was not available here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 39 and 40, before subsection (8) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  The Board may in determining an appeal under section 26 or 27 of the Principal Act decide to grant a permission or approval even if the proposed development contravenes materially the development plan or any special amenity area order relating to the area of the planning authority to whose decision the appeal relates.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 26 (3) (a) of the 1963 Act provides that:</P>
      <P>A planning authority shall not, in a case in which the development concerned would contravene materially the development plan or any special amenity area order relating to their area, decide to grant a permission under this section save with the consent of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to put beyond doubt that the board will have full discretion and would not be similarly limited.  The problem will not arise in the case of appeals to the Minister because he has the power to consent to a development plan.  He has power also under section 22 (3) of the 1963 Act to direct a planning authority to amend their plan.  These powers are not being transferred to the board.  If the amendment were not adopted it could be argued that the board had no more discretion than the planning authority have under section 26, subsection (5) (b) of the 1963 Act, as amended by section 13 of the Bill.  The board are required to determine an application as if it had been made to them in the first instance. They are required also to have regard to the same criteria as is the case in respect of the planning authority and as set out in sections 1 and 2 of the 1963 Act.  What we are doing is giving to the board a right which the Minister has.  I think this meets the question raised by Deputy Molloy on Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the <Col N="144" /> Minister for meeting that point and for clarifying the powers of the board in relation to decisions which contravene development plans.  We welcome the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (8), to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, on appeal to the Board, the decision of the Board in granting a permission would materially contravene the development plan or any special amenity order relating to the area, the Board shall call upon the planning authority to show cause why the Board should not so decide and after consideration of such submissions as the local authority may make, the Board shall then make its decision.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My own amendment is an important one.  It proposes to insert before subsection (8) that where, on appeal to the board, the decision of the board in granting a permission would materially contravene the development plan or any special amenity order relating to the area, the board shall call upon the planning authority to shown cause why the board should not so decide and after consideration of such submissions as the local authority may make, the board shall then make their decision.  What is intended here is clear.  If the Minister intends accepting the amendment, there is not much point in my making a case in favour of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  I do not know whether the Deputy realises that what he wants to do here is to give a second bite of the cherry to the planning authority.  This would be unfair. When submitting documentation to the board in connection with any appeal the planning authority will make their case with due regard to the provisions of any development plan or special amenity area order relating to the proposal on appeal.  If the planning authority were to be <Col N="145" /> given a second opportunity of making their case, the situation would be inequitable and it could be argued in such circumstances that the appellant should be given an opportunity to comment further.  The acceptance of Deputy Molloy's amendment would result in a further delaying factor in the appeal system and would put the planning authority in an advantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the appellant.  I think that on consideration the Deputy will agree that this matter is dealt with adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment would apply only in the case where the planning board were indicating their intention to contravene the development plan.  Much emphasis has always been placed on the role of the local authority member in the making of a county development plan.  Under the 1963 Act he is the authority that adopts that plan.  The involvement of the community in planning is carried out through the elected local representative, much more so than at ministerial or at board level.  To a very great extent this has contributed to the ready acceptance of planning since the coming into operation of the 1963 Act. That was an Act which introduced a whole restrictive area in development. Public reaction to it could have been very strong.  Many people would agree that the ready acceptance of that Act resulted from the close involvement in planning of the elected local representative. If the importance of the elected representative thus highlighted was legitimate, the decisions have a very great importance within the whole sphere of planning.  If the board intend contravening the development plan adopted by the locally elected members of the community, then a major decision is being made here.  If the Minister makes the decision, there is Question Time in this House and other ways of putting questions to him. Generally, he is answerable in one way or another through the media and elsewhere because of his public position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a board of faceless men which, on balance, we all agree is a better idea than having one single political figure making the decisions. We are anxious to ensure that as many <Col N="146" /> safeguards as possible exist for the smooth efficient operation of this board. They will also contribute to public acceptability of this board, which will be a very great factor.  If the board in their deliberations intend making a decision which is completely contrary to that adopted by the local councillors in the local development plan, which applies to all citizens and to those interested in carrying out developments in their county, borough or city area, then such a decision should be highlighted. Advance warning should be given to the local planning authority that such a decision was to be made. That advance warning should enable them to consider fully the reasons offered by the board for their decisions and, in turn, they can offer their own valid reasons why they should or should not do what they intended in relation to contravention.  These extra safeguards are required because of the board.  The most important and significant decision to be made by the Minister at any stage is where he contravenes the local development plan in a serious breach of what the local elected representatives intended.  The board should be required to do what is laid down in the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always understood, under the old planning legislation that, when the Minister made the decision, the local council was the planning authority.  Unfortunately, under the Act it was interpreted at local level as the county manager.  This is wrong. The interpretation of what contravenes the plan is important.  In my county I have seen on numerous occasions where our interpretation and the official interpretation differed. I always understood, when we got in touch with the Minister that his decision was that it did or did not contravene the plan.  I do not think he ever said: &ldquo;I know it contravenes, but I am granting it.&rdquo;  I thought it was a question of the Minister having a different interpretation from the county manager.  Obviously, I did not understand the Bill.  Now all this is being handed over to a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the local representatives draw up a plan they have certain ideas in their minds.  In my opinion they should <Col N="147" /> be the final interpreters of what contravenes that plan, and not the county manager, because they drew it up.  If we appeal to the board they have the power, as I understand it, to decide against our plan.  This board will consist of faceless men.  Everybody in this House, with the exception of myself, agrees with this.  As a party man I must go along with my colleagues, but if I were boss I would not agree.  I am speaking now as an individual.  We can spend hours on a plan and submit it to them.  On appeal they can then ignore us and not even send a notification. In my view that will be the end of democracy here.  It will be a waste of time electing people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Molloy's amendment.  In doing so, I direct attention to the special amenity order aspect.  It is important, if this board, as successor to the Minister in these matters overrules a development plan, that the planning authority should have the right to argue the case for their plan before the board take a decision to upset that plan. Deputy Molloy's amendment seeks to give the planning authority the right to be heard before the decision is taken.  It does not seek anything more than that for the planning authority which made the development plan.  It merely asks that the planning authority should be entitled to show cause why the board should not upset this plan.  In my view that is a reasonable proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> I readily visualise&mdash;and I agree with Deputy Callanan&mdash;situations when the development plan would have to be upset by a decision of the board.  As a general rule that need not worry us a great deal.  Many development plans are couched in fairly loose terms.  In the County Dublin development plan, the one I know best, there are large areas &ldquo;zoned for the future development of agriculture&rdquo;.  Everybody looking at the plan knows that the planners could not care less about the proper development of agriculture in County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham is listening very carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>But it is a handy, omnibus phrase which they use to describe all the areas they do not want at present to plan in detail.  They write them off as &ldquo;zoned for the future development of agriculture&rdquo;. It is perfectly legitimate that from time to time plans are drawn in that general way.  We all know that because of the constraints on planning authorities they must leave large areas of their planning areas in a loose situation. Therefore it is legitimate that the board in considering a particular matter would vary the objectives and zonings laid down by the local planning authority.  It is equally fair and legitimate that in such a situation the planning authority should have a final opportunity of endeavouring to persuade the board not to upset their plans because they have perfectly good and valid reasons why the plan as originally propounded should be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that with regard to the development plan in general but in the case of special amenity area orders it is much stronger indeed.  If it were my own personal decision I would have argued strongly against the board having the right to upset a special amenity order at all.  In the case of a special amenity area order there is no question of the planning authority having used some omnibus phrase to describe a particular part of their area for which they had not got any particular detailed plans or specifications. <Col N="149" /> Here the planning authority have obviously carefully considered some particular aspect of their area of responsibility and have come to a specific decision that a special amenity area order should be made in relation to a particular place or thing and in those cases the right of the board to upset such a special amenity area order should certainly be very seriously looked at before we give them the right <i>ex parte</i> to over-rule such an order.  I want to argue very strongly in the case of a special amenity area order that the planning authority should certainly have the right to be heard before such an order would be upset by a decision of the board.</P>
    <P>I will be talking later in this debate on the Minister's new proposals in section 31 about this aspect of planning and I shall be giving voice to some very serious doubts and apprehensions about what the Minister is proposing.  Mark you, I am not a great believer in the value of planning at all. I have very serious doubts about whether in totality planning is a good thing or a bad thing.  That is something that could be very validly argued.  However, we have planning and all we can do when we have a planning apparatus is to try to make sure it is as good and as effective as we can make it.  Although some of us may have fundamental doubts about the value of the thing at all if we are to have it let us have it as perfect as we can make it.</P>
    <P>If there is any aspect of modern planning that appeals to me it is the right of a planning authority to make a special amenity order.  That, I think, is a useful and valuable protection of our natural heritage.  There are a great many things done in the name of planning that I do not agree with and which I do not think are for the benefit of the community ultimately, but here is one area where I believe valuable and important work of preservation and conservation can be achieved by planning authorities.  It would be wrong and dangerous if this new board could, without advancing any reasons to anybody, upset a special amenity area order.  What Deputy Molloy proposes is of great <Col N="150" /> value in this regard apart from the generality of the situation.  Definitely before the board would be entitled to give a decision to upset one of those orders the planning authority who made the order, and who would clearly have made it for very good reasons, should be entitled to come forward and say: &ldquo;Gentlemen, please do not upset our special amenity order for this area.  We made it for these perfectly valid reasons and you will do very serious damage to our whole conservation programme if you upset this order.&rdquo;  I would urge very strongly on the Minister to accept Deputy Molloy's concept in its entirety but particularly it is important that he should accept it in relation to these amenity orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow what Deputy Haughey has been saying I would like to give some examples.  An Foras Forbartha carried out a coastal survey.  It was an excellent job and they should be congratulated on it. They supplied the result of that survey to everyone concerned, to the Department of Local Government and through that Department to the various planning authorities.  This is something which had the backing of the Department of Local Government and I know that some of the local authorities, those which were in the process of revising their local authority development plans, incorporated the detailed and scientific information which was made available from this source and which planning authorities could not on their own have done as well, in their plans.  Here we are with a scientific survey of the whole coastline, the information made available and with local authorities having based their development plans, so far as they affect coastal areas, on this and on whatever information they have from their elected representatives and from the officials of local authorities. In this Bill the Minister is continuing a provision of a very much older Bill and allowing the board to contravene the development plans of local authorities based on the best information that a subsidiary of the Department of Local Government can give.  This is wrong.  It is running a coach and four <Col N="151" /> through something which the Minister's own Department have decided to do.  I hope that later a national survey will be made in respect of mountain and other scenic areas, that the global information will be made available to the local authorities concerned and that the expert advice given will be incorporated in their development plans.  To give a board the authority not alone of contravening the development plan but of contravening the best advice available to the Department of Local Government is wrong.  The emphasis seems to be, in all debates on planning, on preserving our amenities and so on.  The most important asset this country has at this moment and in the forseeable future is the agricultural land and I hope we will soon have a survey of the agricultural land which should not be mutilated by development of any kind.  I must compliment the Dublin County Council who have done a fairly good job in this respect.</P>
      <P>It could be an example to other development authorities because they have designated areas that are suitable and should be preserved for horticultural and general agricultural purposes. I was very disappointed recently to hear the Minister had contravened part of the county development plan in this regard and had granted planning permission for development on land the Dublin County Council had zoned as agricultural land.  I should like more information on this matter, including details of the number of acres involved.  The Minister was wrong to take the action he took. Equally it is wrong that he continues the provision in the old legislation. The measure now before the House should not contain that provision.  The proviso that elected members of local authorities could set aside the Minister's decision was a safeguard.  I understand this clause is not contained in the Bill before us and I should like the Minister's advice on the matter.</P>

      <P>This has been a most interesting debate because of the various viewpoints put forward. <Col N="152" /> During the discussions when Deputy Haughey was speaking I said Deputy Cunningham was listening very attentively but I was wrong.  The Deputy was not listening at all because what Deputy Haughey said about planning in County Dublin was the direct opposite to what Deputy Cunningham said.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear there is a little bit of freedom on the opposite benches.  Deputy Haughey said he was not sure if planning was a good thing and, if I took him up correctly, he thought the designation of land to be retained for agriculture was rather foolish, particularly around Dublin where land is badly needed for housing and other projects.  Deputy Cunningham complimented Dublin County Council for not allowing any building in the county area and for retaining all the land for agriculture.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey agrees they were not exactly wise in many of the decisions they took.  In fact, they were areas that had been built on and it was only right they should build on them.  I am one of the old-fashioned people who believe that the most important thing is to ensure that people have somewhere to live.  I get a little annoyed when I hear people in the country talking about the necessity to preserve first, the mountains, then the seaside areas and, finally, the agricultural land.  Are these people suggesting everyone who wants houses should move into the cities and the towns?  I do not agree with that.  While I agree with Deputy Haughey that it is necessary to preserve amenities, I do not agree that a mountain or some seaside areas are harmed in any way by the erection of very beautiful houses in which families can live.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with planning appeals from Donegal and I know how progressive they were when <Col N="155" /> Deputy Cunningham was in office and how progressive they are in my time. We will leave it at that.  As far as the drawing up of the plan is concerned, the local authority members are responsible for that and the interpretation of what they drew up is done by the officials.  One of the weaknesses in Deputy Molloy's amendment is that while he says he feels it should be referred back to the elected representatives the wording of his amendment says:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (8) to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where, on appeal to the Board, the decision of the Board in granting a permission would materially contravene the development plan or any special amenity order relating to the area, the Board shall call upon the planning authority to show cause why the Board should not so decide and after consideration of such submissions as the local authority may make, the Board shall then make its decision.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The planning authority make their case.  They are entitled to make a full case and they are entitled, as they are now, to revoke a decision if they are not satisfied with it.  The planning board will have the right to reverse it again and we can have this ping-pong backwards and forwards. The provision is there and will be in this Bill so it is not such a terrible thing.  We must avoid long delays in this whole question of planning.  We could have a situation where a local <Col N="156" /> authority were asked for their comments when in fact the planning board had made up their minds that a certain decision should then be given, and they then asked the local authority.  There is no provision made in Deputy Molloy's amendment for how long the comments could be made.  This could last for six months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very big point if you are waiting to build a house and the planning authority wait for six to eight months before they give their considered comments.  I do not see how this suggestion will improve the Bill.  The situation is that, as at present, the planning authority get the right to make a submission.  It goes to the Minister at present and the decision is made.  If they are dissatisfied they can reverse it.  The person who is dissatisfied with the reversal can come back to the Minister again.  This situation can continue under this Bill.  It is a very good safeguard which is being retained.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey says he is not sure if planning is a good thing.  The 1963 Act was an experiment in this country because until then, as Deputy Molloy said, there was no control and when planning was first introduced it was an entirely new concept.  I would not agree with him that it is because the local authority members had the right to do or say certain things that it worked so smoothly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  I think the local authority did not draw up a plan except in certain counties where there was difficulty with the manager and section 4's were as common as the days of the week.  In most cases officials dealt with planning.  Until the review came along there was no interference or question of discussion by the local authority representatives. Deputy Molloy is as aware of what is happening as I am.  I do not believe it is necessary to introduce this because I do not think such a safeguard is necessary.  As it stands it simply means that the officials who have already given their opinion will be asked to <Col N="157" /> give it again.  If that is so, should the planning board give the right of appeal to the person who has appealed, and give the information they have got from the local authority, as they must do at present, and pass this backward and forward so that the merry-go-round goes on and on? I do not think that is right.  The provision in the Bill is the right one.  I cannot see any merit in this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I give the Minister an example?  If Dublin Corporation make a special amenity order for part of the land surrounding Dublin Bay and an application is made to their planning authority for the erection of an ore smelter within the area of the special amenity area order Dublin Corporation, having made the special amenity order in relation to this area, would naturally refuse such an application.  Those who read the application could exercise their right under the Act to appeal to the board when this Bill is passed.  The board may decide they wish to contravene such amenity area order in relation to Dublin Bay and could say they intended granting planning permission for the smelter.  In such circumstances my amendment would require the board to notify the planning authority of their intended decision.  The planning authority would then have the opportunity of discussing it and the public would be made aware, through public discussion, of the board's intention. They could make their final submission to the board before such a decision was arrived at by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not see the necessity for this requirement if it was a political figure making the decision because the Minister, in making the decision, would have to satisfy himself that he could defend his decision publicly. This board will not have to defend any of their decisions publicly because they will be independent and faceless persons who will not be expected to answer to the public for their decisions.  If the people saw such a decision being made and they understood this amendment it would be considered a reasonable requirement to be included in the amendment to the 1963 <Col N="158" /> Act when the board is established.  It is not an unusual procedure and there are precedents for it at local authority level.</P>
    <P>In my local authority the facility is offered to members of the planning authority, where they require advance information as to the intended decision by the manager in relation to any particular planning application, that the manager provides the information generally one or two weeks before the date the decision must finally be made, which is normally at the end of a two-month period.  The member in my planning authority receives this information.  If he disagrees with the intended decision he may then seek support from his colleagues in placing a section 4 under the 1955 City and County Managers' Act requiring the manager to give a decision contrary to the one he intended to give.  If that section 4 is passed by the majority of the members of the planning authority the decision is binding on the manager and he must comply.</P>

      <P>I am well aware of amendment No. 70a and I shall have quite a lot to say on that when we arrive at it.  What I am asking the Minister now is to accept this amendment. I have given him an example of the case where an amenity area order might be contravened, and I would refer to Deputy Fergus O'Brien in saying this, because he is the Deputy on the Minister's side of the House who before he was elected here was a very vocal advocate of the making of a special amenity area order for Dublin Bay.  Could I ask the Deputy to let the House know whether he would be greatly disturbed if, having had such an order made, a board such as this decided to flout the wishes of the elected members of Dublin, the views of the citizens of Dublin and the planning authority, and allow a smelter to be erected there despite the wishes of the people?</P>
      <P>Our amendment will not stop them making the decision, but at least it will warn the public as to the pending decision.  It will give adequate notice of their intention and will ensure that full public debate takes place on the issue.  There is no need to suggest that this should happen in all cases.  We only require that to be done where the development plan or the amenity area orders have been contravened. I have quoted a precedent.  The local authorities are already giving advance information of intended decisions, and I do not see why this board should not be required to give advance information of their intended decisions where they propose contravening development plans and amenity area orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go along with <Col N="160" /> Deputy Haughey with regard to the amenity area.  What I would like to see here is that, if we make an order preserving an area, it would be made for a period of time and that it could not be contravened.  Obviously these special orders would not be made for every area but only for special areas. Deputy Molloy mentioned Dublin Bay. However, I am a little at a loss to understand why Deputy Molloy is pursuing this, because if a local authority turns down a decision and there is an appeal which goes, if it did go, to the Custom House, if it was something serious there would be an oral hearing. I attended two hearings not so long ago, one in which the corporation refused permission and the other in which they granted permission.  Both sides were represented by counsel. Their senior planners were there and they stated quite cogently the reasons why they made the decision in both cases.</P>
      <P>I believe there is no conflict here. The planning authority will have representation and will make their plans. However I would not agree that just before a decision has been made they will say they are going to make this or that type of decision.  The case should be made at the hearing, and if there are people there who can make the proper case there is nothing to worry about.  If the case is as serious as Deputy Molloy would make out, I would have no doubt that a responsible board would react and turn it down. Deputy Molloy's amendment is asking that the planning authority would be able to lay their cases before the board.  There is no problem there. They can do that.  I would like to ask Deputy Molloy why he is pursuing something that is there already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  As has been stated by other speakers here, the general run of things is that the decisions are made by the officials, and if the officials refuse permission and it moves on to the planning board, the elected members of the council have not been involved at any stage in the <Col N="161" /> making of that decision.  It would be unreasonable to expect members to attend every oral hearing in case some serious decision is made contrary to their development plan or amenity order.  I wish to quote from the explanation section of the 1963 Act, subsection (2) of which states quite clearly:</P>
      <P>In this Act &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  in the case of a county exclusive of any borough or urban district therein, the council of the county,</P>
      <P>(b)  in the case of a county or other borough, the corporation of the borough, and</P>
      <P>(c)  in the case of an urban district, the council of the district.</P>
      <P>These people are not consulted in the making of the decision by the local authority.  The manager makes that decision.  What I am suggesting here is that the board send notification back to the local authority that that notice be brought to the attention of the elected members at their next meeting or at a special meeting, and that it there be debated and that the views of the elected representatives be made known to the board before they make their final decision.</P>

      <P>As a member of a planning committee in the corporation I can say that any major planning decision to be made comes before the committee of which I am a member and is fully discussed.  Admittedly it is a managerial function, but the manager listens to the debate and will take into consideration our viewpoints. It is his decision, but when it comes to a serious situation the local representatives have a say and when it goes to appeal the people who know what they are talking about and who can put a cogent case to the board make it.  The planners instruct counsel to make a case for them, I am quite happy with that, and when it comes to a major decision by the Dublin authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As far as planning is concerned, the plan is drawn up by the local authority elected representatives <Col N="163" /> and, under the 1963 Act, the decisions are made by the management.  If the information were to be passed back to the planning authority then it would be passed back to the manager.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>To the manager.  There is no reference whatever to the elected representatives.  It is to the manager the information would go and it would then go to the officials, as it does at the moment, and they comment.  The elected representatives do not come into the picture and the amendment does not give the elected representatives any right to be told anything.</P>
      <P>In Dublin there is an arrangement whereby the planning committee are given certain information, are allowed to discuss matters and make a recommendation. Whether or not that is accepted by the officials is something they decide.  There is no question of the elected representatives being able to make a planning decision.  It is, of course, very important that the elected representatives should do everything they can to ensure that the plan they want is the plan adopted and not a plan to which they did not give enough attention and subsequently, if the plan fails to turn out the way they think it should, blame the officials.  The same right will be there in future as is there at the moment.  The local authority, when they find out what the decision is, will be able to reverse it, if they so desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred twice to something on which I should like some clarification from him; he said this was for the purpose of ensuring that the people would know.  I do not know exactly what he means.  Is he suggesting that we are in this Parliament in some way setting up a planning board and that, when the planning board makes a decision, information should be given about that decision before the decision is actually finalised?  What use would that be?  I want this planning board to work.  I want them to have a certain standing. I do not want to have them sabotaged at this stage by putting in something <Col N="164" /> which would or could result in having pressure being brought to bear on the board when they are making a decision.  I believe people should make decisions without pressure being put on them.  I am satisfied the present regulations allow the local authority to reverse a decision and that situation will continue under this legislation.  I do not, therefore, see merit in the amendment.  Secondly, it is not really important.  Quite frankly, it will do no harm and neither will it do any good. Even if it were accepted the local authority representatives would still not know what is going to happen in order that they could add their voices. The manager, if he is doing his job, will already have made the strongest possible case with all the information available to the planning board.  I cannot see why the amendment is necessary and nothing said so far has convinced me that there is some merit in incorporating this amendment in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and I should like to suggest to him that there is something very important in what Deputy Molloy is endeavouring to get at in his amendment.  Briefly, I shall refer back now to what I said about planning in general.  I am still not convinced that planning is on the whole worthwhile and beneficial to the community, judging by the way in which it has worked out.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and I have had some discussions about cost/benefit analyses as used by his office in a different context.  Some day I should like to see a cost/benefit analysis in an economic and social sense applied to planning as it is operated here and, indeed, in other western European countries.  I would be very interested in finding out whether the ultimate result is a plus or a minus when all the relevant factors are taken into consideration.  That is something that is involved here, though not perhaps primarily, but nevertheless involved in Deputy Molloy's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Molloy and I have had experience of administrative decision taking, of the sort of situation <Col N="165" /> involved in a planning appeal coming before us in which we have had to take difficult decisions.  I have and, I am sure, Deputy Molloy and the Minister have been in the same situation and possibly the Minister will agree with me that there is frequent resort to a particular kind of mechanism. Where one is taking a decision against an individual or an organisation and one has more or less made up one's mind that this is the decision but one also knows that the decision will cause loss, hardship or concern to a person, before one finally puts one's pen to paper one calls in the person and tells him that the decision will be such and such, that it will be adverse to him and, before finally implementing it, one would like to know if there is any official argument the individual can advance before the decision is finalised. In justice, one feels this opportunity should be given.  It is a very good safety valve.  I have used it and I am sure so have other Ministers and administrators.  This is more or less what is involved in this amendment. I see a difference in what Deputy Molloy is trying to get at here and what Deputy O'Brien suggested he is trying to get at.  We all know the mechanical procedure.  The planning authority take a decision.  Those affected by the decision appeal to the Minister.  In future they will appeal to the board. The board will send a notice to the planning authority saying they have this appeal against the decision and asking the planning authority what they have to say about it.  It is a routine mechanical sort of operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

The board notify the planning authority that the appeal has come in and briefly ask the planning authority what they have to say about the appeal.  That is a pretty routine mechanical operation.  In the normal course of events, the planning authority give a stock reply to the effect that it was turned down because it contravened their development plan or some other pretty general observation of that sort, not really, I suggest, getting to grips with the specific merits of the particular application.  That is the normal way these things operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy saw them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course I did. All over my constituency people apply for the simplest little additions to their houses or garages.  At the moment I have on hands a case where the local boy scouts have applied for permission to erect a scout den and the planning authority, in their wisdom, have turned them down, if you do not mind.  I do not want to talk too much about that, because it will be coming before the Minister eventually.  That <Col N="167" /> is the sort of situation we are dealing with.</P>
      <P>As I say, up to that point it is a pretty routine, mechanical sort of operation by the planning authority. What Deputy Molloy is concerned with here is where the decision of the board would materially affect the development plan.  I am not so much concerned with the development plan in general as I am with the special amenity order.  In those sorts of cases there is a different situation now obtaining.  The board have now decided that they will upset either the development plan or the amenity order.  It has come to a positive decision-making situation.  At that point it is no longer a routine matter.</P>
      <P>The board will take a decision which upsets the pre-ordained preconceived plan of the planning authority either as a general plan or a special amenity order.  Then it is perfectly legitimate that we should enjoin upon that board the necessity, before they finally take that crucial decision to upset the planning authority's concept, to call in the planning authority for one last word and say: &ldquo;We are going to upset you on this.  We are going to rule against you.  Have you anything to say before we come to our final decision in defence of your particular plan or your particular amenity order?&rdquo; That is a very sound administrative principle.  That is what is really enshrined here in Deputy Molloy's amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey has made quite a good case but I do not see many stock answers coming into the Custom House.  When the local authority make the case they usually go into quite a lot of detail and they usually give very good reasons.  There may be local authorities who do not do that but normally they do.  It is their job to do it.  The county manager who is making the case&mdash;or it is made in his name anyway&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When they send the notice to me I am quite sure they will go into great detail about the effect it would have on the neighbouring houses and that sort of thing.  They will build up a case.  They usually make a pretty strong case.  Deputy Molloy and Deputy Cunningham are aware of this.  I cannot see where the merit comes in.  We have discussed this fairly fully.  Obviously the Opposition are very adamant that there is merit in it.  So far I can see no merit in it.  I believe it is already adequately covered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy made a case for going back to local authority elected representatives.  This is not specifically stated even in the amendment.  I will have a look at it&mdash;I will not promise anything&mdash;and see if there is something which could be done which would strengthen it.  Every protection should be given but, if something is being done, we would want to ensure, number one, that it is the elected representatives, for whom I have the greatest respect, number two, that there is a time limit.</P>
      <P>As I say, as of now I can see no merit in it.  When I have had a look at it, and when the officials have checked over it, we may find some thing which I have missed.  So far I have not heard any case which would convince me that I should amend this. I am prepared to have a good look at it, and if it is considered necessary.  I will put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If we have succeeded in directing the Minister's mind, and the minds of his experts, with due respect to Deputy Callanan, we may have succeeded in making some progress. Why does the Minister feel that the amendment, as worded, would not allow for the matter to be brought before the elected members of the council?  How does he suggest I should have worded the amendment in order to provide that the proposed decision would be brought to the notice of the <Col N="169" /> elected members?  The Minister will appreciate that, in putting down amendments, the Opposition will always try to convey what they want changed in the Bill, and we can elaborate on it in the course of debate.  If there is some fault in the construction of the amendment on technical grounds, that is not a great obstacle. I think the Minister understands the point we are getting at.  The elected members having being charged under the Principal Act to adopt development plans, in courtesy and for good social and community reasons, should be informed where a decision is being made.  Whether it is considered big or small in relation to development it is still a major decision when a board decide to contravene the development plan or to contravene the special amenity order.</P>
      <P>The Principal Act states that a reference to contravention of a provision in the Act includes, where appropriate, a reference to refusal or failure to comply with that provision.  If there is a refusal to comply or a failure to comply with the general planning principles incorporated in the development plan adopted by the local representatives, it is proper and correct to request that they be so informed in advance, bearing in mind that they are not the people who dealt with the original application.  All local authorities do not have the facility of a planning committee such as Deputy O'Brien's local authority have.  Even if they did, there is still the weakness that some official, a principal officer or otherwise, has to make a decision as to what cases will be brought before the planning authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
