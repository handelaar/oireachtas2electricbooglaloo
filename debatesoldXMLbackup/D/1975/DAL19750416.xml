    <Title>Trade Union Bill, 1974: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider an amendment from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 9, the following new section inserted:</P>
      <P>9.&mdash; Where, in the case of a body of persons which is a trade union under the law of another country and has its headquarters control situated in that country, a majority of the members of that body who are resident in the area comprising the State and Northern Ireland so decide, the members of that body who are so resident may, in accordance with this Act, amalgamate with or transfer their engagements to another trade union and shall, from the making of such a decision. be a trade union for the purpose of section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment would be to permit the 32-county membership of a British-based union, if they so wished, to amalgamate or transfer their engagements.  The Bill, as drafted <Col N="1680" /> and as we had it before this House, facilitates the amalgamation of two Irish unions or the amalgamation of an Irish union with a British-based union but would make it next to impossible for the Irish branch of a British-based union to amalgamate with another Irish union or with another Irish branch of a British-based union.  We believe that the Bill as it stands, on a 32-county basis, could be improved to permit the amalgamation of Irish members living in Ireland wherever the headquarters of their parent union might be.  Certain legal and constitutional difficulties as well as consultation difficulties prevented us including this in the Bill before this House.  We have now included it to facilitate the possibility of Irish unions amalgamating with branches of British unions or branches of British unions amalgamating with other Irish unions with headquarters in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, as drafted, if an Irish branch of a British-based union wished to amalgamate with another trade union, whether Irish or British-based, a majority vote of all members of that union resident in the State, Northern Ireland and Britain, possibly aggregating to millions of members, would be necessary to enable the amalgamation to take place.  That would mean that it would be very difficult to achieve.  The amendment seeks to overcome this problem by providing that the 32-county membership of a British-based union may amalgamate or transfer their engagements. That is the purpose of the amendment&mdash;to facilitate Irish members coming together with other Irish members wherever the constitutional headquarters of the parent organisation may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this party I welcome and support this amendment.  It now appears that the Trade Union Bill would be inadequate legislation without this amendment. It gives the opportunity to the Irish members&mdash;meaning 32-county Irish members-to decide their own destiny within the structure of a British-based union.  It is important to recognise the 32-county nature of our union structure <Col N="1681" /> and legislate to maintain it and it is also important that this opportunity be given to Irish members of a British-based union who are more familiar with the economic and social situation existing in our own community to decide on their future.  It is probably fair to mention the record of our Irish-based unions, particularly the major ones which are Irish-based, and their responsible approach to the economic growth and development of the country.  I should like to see this amendment as an encouragement rather than just a facility.  I appreciate that the Minister would probably have difficulty in introducing legislation directed so that members of a British-based union rather than become members of another British-based union in this country, would be encouraged or directed into an Irish-based union. I appreciate there are probably constitutional or legal difficulties in this respect but I would welcome any way in which such a development could be encouraged.  It is important, especially at present, that our economic development should be for the most part guided by groups of people working from an Irish base whose primary concern would be the growth of the Irish economy and concern for it, groups which would not be directed from abroad by headquarters abroad.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that this section is fundamental to a Bill to improve trade union legislation.  It is rather surprising this provision was not already included in the Bill.  One would imagine those concerned would have taken into account the views of trade unions in this regard.  However, I am glad it is now being made part of the Bill because it is fundamental to it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment for the reasons stated.  I would prefer to see some inducement, encouragement or enticement in the amendment so that in the event of an amalgamation of that nature they will be encouraged to amalgamate with an Irish union.  If it is possible within the framework to give such encouragement, in my view, that is something that the Minister for Labour in an Irish Government should consider seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> In the past, as our links with Britain were of a historical nature, it was only natural that many of our trade unions would be joined with the British-based unions.  I do not wish to decry membership of such unions because they too have played their part in our economic development. Our aim in future should be, particularly in a European context, to look on Ireland as a unit.  Irish trade union legislators and trade union officials have done an excellent job.  They have played their part and shown that they can hold their own with any trade union official of any country. At this stage of our economic development I hope the Minister will consider ways and means of encouraging amalgamations with Irish unions.  I use the word &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; for the reasons stated.  I can appreciate that there may be difficulties where it cannot be made compulsory but, in my opinion, some form of encouragement would be very welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment.  In doing so I would like to go back to the Second Stage debate.  I indicated then that an effort should be made to bring about a situation such as this.  I said that institutional freedom, in conjunction with political freedom, was important. Political freedom without institutional freedom is of no value because the dictates could come from outside.  The Minister told us he did not think this could be done.  I am very glad to see that he, his Department and the trade union movement have moved along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House accepted our views in relation to the decision-making executives being Irish-based.  I am not referring only to British unions but to all foreign unions.  We can have a multiplicity of situations because of our entry to the EEC, some visible and some invisible.  Nevertheless, I compliment the Minister on this movement towards our suggestion on Second Stage and our amendment on Committee Stage.  Of course, the Minister brought in his amendments which superseded ours and we were glad to support them.  On this occasion I am glad to support this amendment. <Col N="1683" /> We have gone a long way towards solving the problem which existed in the minds of many trade unionists over the years that there was and could be dictation from outside forces on trade union affairs and decisions by people who had vested interests in certain fields.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to mergers is not as satisfactory as one would wish.  Nevertheless, under this Bill a substantial move forward has taken place.  Again I would like to compliment the Minister and the trade union movement.  One man in the trade union movement who has spoken about this loud and clear for some considerable time is Mr. Denis Larkin, leader of the Workers' Union of Ireland.  He made many contributions seeking this break and we are very pleased to be associated with it.</P>
    <P>It is only proper that Irishmen should have the right to make their own decisions in their own way.  We do not want dictation from outside. Our trade union officials and organisations are as efficient and effective as those in any other country.  We have our problems but so have they.  We have problems in our trade union movement.  I do not agree with every aspect of policy of the trade union movement.  We feel the political levy would be an impediment towards amalgamation and mergers, because some people might have deep-rooted convictions in that respect.  I hoped this Bill would have eliminated all the existing problems and irritations and be a Bill of which we could all be proud.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has met us to a large degree in many of the amendments he put forward, nevertheless there are still areas where these irritations exist.  I hope the day is not too far distant when they will disappear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Deputy does not deviate from the amendment under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling.  There are ever-changing conditions taking place in the trade <Col N="1684" /> union movement.  It is important that we have the facilities to meet the modern needs of members.  The educational facilities which must follow from mergers are an important factor. Larger trade unions can offer their members educational, social and other facilities.  The Irish Transport and General Workers' Union are in a very creditable situation because they offer assistance to their members by way of educational, social and other facilities. They give a greater degree of assistance to their members than many larger unions in England and elsewhere. We have a progressive outlook and progressive leaders.  I do not always agree with what they say.  We could have the greatest third force necessary and desirable in a country such as ours, independent of politics. Unfortunately, as I said, there are problems and pressures which we will have to examine at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is an effort to meet the present situation.  As Deputy G. Fitzgerald said, this party supports the change in attitude to the amendments since the Bill was introduced. We welcome this Bill and hope it will be the success the Minister anticipated.  A substantial contribution has been made in this House to the evolvement of mergers and take-overs. I, as a trade unionist, and my col leagues as party members will do everything to ensure that there will be full co-operation.  When possible I will influence people who are thinking in terms of mergers so that Irishmen can have a voice in relation to their own affairs.  The Minister indicated on Second Stage that this was not possible. However, we pursued the matter on Committee Stage and we are happy to accept this amendment.  I am glad the Minister has been advised this is the proper course to take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice to that of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, our spokesman on labour matters, and that of Deputy Dowling in welcoming this amendment.  I do not want to take any credit from the Minister but I <Col N="1685" /> want to state that Deputy Dowling very strongly urged this line of action. At the same time I want to thank the Minister for taking heed of the pleadings made by this side of the House.  I realise this is a most sensitive area as anything which affects North and South of the country is.</P>
      <P>This is a tremendous step forward and one which must win universal support in trade union and other circles.  I do not want to read any more into it than what is in the amendment which gives Irish men and women an opportunity which they did not have in regard to amalgamations of trade unions.  It is also a step nearer the time when the trade union movement in Ireland will be autonomous so that when the great amalgamation takes place the voice of Irish trade union people will come from this part of the country or when we are united from any part of the country.</P>
      <P>I remember feeling very humiliated some years ago when some members who allegedly stepped out of line by taking a certain political action were summoned to attend a hearing in London by an English trade union. They did not go but, nevertheless, the fact that a writ was issued to these men was totally unacceptable to us.  Now we have an amendment in the Bill which will be regarded as a major step forward.  I would like to join with Deputy Dowling in paying tribute to men like Mr. Denis Larkin, who advocated the step and also, to go back a few years, to a member of the Seanad, the late Senator Jimmy Dunne who was one of the visionaries of the trade union movement who advocated these steps.  I feel we are reaching a far better atmosphere as regards the trade unions which are very powerful when we have the national parliament meeting the wishes of practically every Irish member of a trade union.  This is something this side of the House have advocated. I hope the Minister will not leave it there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Bill is publicised to the very fullest extent because we pass much legislation which goes on the Statute Book and its effects may not be generally known.  The Minister has <Col N="1686" /> a fairly good publicity arm so I hope he informs all trade union members of the passing of this Bill and this very important amendment.  I look forward to the day when he brings in a really comprehensive trade union Bill and when, as a result of the present Bill, he will be able to give us a new charter in this field.  Now that we are in Europe and are willing to co-operate with other European trade unions, we should do the same as the trade unions of the other eight nations who jealously guard their individuality. This Bill and this amendment will enable the trade union movement in Ireland to become much stronger and to become one of the leading trade union movements in the nine members of the EEC.  The Minister, as Deputy Fitzgerald stated, will always have the full co-operation of this side of the House when we see progressive legislation introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to welcome this amendment from the Seanad and also welcome the Minister's acceptance of it.  As one in whose constituency there are many workers who work in Northern Ireland and also workers from Northern Ireland who work in Donegal, I feel this is something which will be appreciated by trade union members because it is looking at Ireland in a 32-county context.  This is as it should be in the context of a nine-country European community.  Workers in Northern Ireland have been members of Dublin-based trade unions and workers from Donegal, who work in Northern Ireland, have been members of British-based trade unions so this Bill will lead to the time when in a 32-county context we will have a strong trade union movement representative of all the workers in this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister on having the common sense to accept this amendment. He is prepared to listen and if there is anything good he is prepared to accept it.  Some Ministers, when they bring in a Bill, are not prepared to accept anything except their own view.  Deputy Dowling <Col N="1687" /> pressed this matter very strongly and I believe it has improved the Bill.  I also want to give credit to the Minister for listening to the views expressed by this side of the House and where there was any merit in our amendments he was prepared to accept them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank Deputies for their comments on this amendment.  It is true that certain suggestions along these lines were made by Deputy Dowling, Deputy Fitzgerald and others during Committee Stage.  I was not unmindful of the things they said but my main problem was the possibility of achieving this both on the legal advice available to me and the consultations which were going on with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>I believe the passage of any legislation through the House should, as much as possible, be a creative exercise whereby as it goes through the House we seek to improve it where there is any means of doing so.  It is a misreading of the importance of both Houses of the Oireachtas to do otherwise.  I did not delay the introduction of the original Bill, because of complicated consultation which had to be undertaken in the Attorney General's Office and the constant consultations with the Irish trade unions, in either House of the Oireachtas until we could include the amendment. I thought it better to proceed and continue with the consultations and discussions in the intervening period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the desirability of directing and guiding union members into Irish unions. This is a very difficult and, perhaps, not too desirable a course to adopt.  The relationship of the legislators to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is not one of guiding and directing; our whole approach to legislation in this area is to help towards agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; was the word that might be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1688" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point, but we must be careful to preserve this relationship of help and assistance because to do otherwise would be counter-productive.  Although we have the legal means to give union members who wish to avail of it the opportunity of coming together, there is scant possibility of this taking place if union members in the North carry about a stereotyped image of union members in the South.  It must not be forgotten that the term &ldquo;Irish worker&rdquo; includes loyalists, and unless that message goes home in the South there can be little progress on this kind of amendment.  Very often the impression is given that Irish workers are all Roman Catholics and Republicans. This, of course, is not true. It is instructive to note that the organisation which has preserved unity in the country, and I refer to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have preserved it on a 32-county basis by tolerance for the various political views of their constituent unions and members. The constant identification of the trade union movement down here with a particular form of political unity of the entire island will not facilitate the coming together of workers North and South.  We should appreciate that Irish workers include loyalists as well as those of a different political view and tradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always taken that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only making the point that here we have a legal means whereby union members may come together, but there will be no coming together where there is a strident declaration of political opinions or if the feeling is prevalent among the majority of union members in the North that we are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is better not to raise these hares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there is no place for loyalists in the trade union movement.  As I say, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have preserved unity in a 32-county framework only by a scrupulous respect for the varying political opinions of their members, by <Col N="1689" /> refusing to ram the nationalist opinions of members in the South into the constitution of that all-Ireland organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but there was an attempt to break that unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the trade unions will avail of the facilities provided in the Bill.  There is the need to rationalise their structure, which they appreciate themselves.  At present an ILO survey is proceeding in the trade union movement.  We hope to see the results of that survey very soon and that the results of that survey will enable the trade union movement to make further plans for its own better organisation.</P>
      <P>Again, I wish to thank the Deputies for their comments on this amendment. This legislation has had the benefit of the views of all sides in the House, and we have sought to harmonise those views in the various sections where improvements could be made.  However, as I said at the outset, legislation in this area is a product of consultation.  We cannot, either as a Government or as an Oireachtas, seek to impose our views on free association of citizens like trade unions.  Under our Constitution the right of free association is guaranteed to all citizens.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure is that we deal only with this amendment.  We pass it or decline to pass it, and we inform the Seanad accordingly.  The Deputy will appreciate that this Bill has already passed through all Stages in the Dáil, and we are now confined to debating the amendment and informing the Seanad of the outcome.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his observations, and he can rest assured that any legislation affecting his Department which helps to rationalise the trade union movement will always have the support of this party, the progressive party in this country, the party who have been responsible for our economic and industrial growth and job creation.  This party have always believed in the 32-county structure of the trade union movement which gave opportunity to Irishmen of all classes, creeds and denominations.  Many of our Ministers are too prone to talk about the different classes of people that constitute the population of our island.  When discussing such an amendment as this which gives the opportunity to members, north and south, to take a decision which will affect their own destiny within the trade union movement, it is enough for any Member of this House to say that this right is embodied within the Act for all people.  Perhaps, in the past difficulties were created by the existence of the different denominations within the trade union movement but the less such a situation is highlighted the better is the opportunity for goodwill within the movement and for the progress that we all wish for so dearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has given a lot of latitude in respect of a widening of the discussion. This morning Standing Orders oblige us to deal only with this Seanad amendment.  Therefore, I cannot allow a widening of the debate or a reference back to what the Bill contains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to a majority of members of the trade union movement who are resident in the area comprising this State and Northern Ireland.  Forgive me if I have gone outside the scope of the amendment but if I have done so it was in the interest of the trade union movement generally.  It should be sufficient for any Member of this House to realise that there are all classes and creeds within the trade union movement and that participation with each other should be encouraged with a <Col N="1691" /> view towards other developments which I shall not elaborate on now.</P>
      <P>I got the impression that a certain type of lecture was being delivered across the House.  This was not merited.  Bodies such as the trade union movement which have a 32-County structure have always had my greatest admiration and support. There are a number of sporting bodies that have succeeded admirably in bridging denominational gaps.  Any such involvement on the part of trade unions or business could lead only to a better Ireland.  This view has always been held by this party.</P>
      <P>As a businessman and before becoming involved in politics, I rarely wished to read what was contained in Bills being introduced and I think that would be the attitude of most people not concerned directly with legislation.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to set out in simple language the basic terms of the Bill.  I am not advocating elaborate day-to-day advertising but I would recommend that, if possible, the main points of the Bill be published in some of the Department's periodicals or in the various trade union magazines.  This would give trade union members the opportunity of seeking further information on the legislation, if they so wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to express my disappointment with the Minister's reference to the political views or affiliations of trade union members.  I have worked with voluntary organisations that had occasion to cross the Border from time to time but, regardless of which part of Ireland we came from, we were merely Irishmen and there was never any question as to what were the views of anybody concerned.  I do not consider it right that the Minister should introduce this question of political affiliation.  Trade unionism is about people whose views may differ widely coming together to discuss their own business.  That is why I am sorry the Minister introduced this red herring.  If anybody is claiming to own the trade union movement, it is the Labour Party but there are people within the trade <Col N="1692" /> union movement who do not support any political party.  They are concerned only with ensuring that the workers get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>It would be a bad day's work if it were to go out from this debate that there was a danger in this Bill of its not being capable of being put into practice because of the differing views of the people who constitute the trade union movement both in the North and in the South.  We are dealing here with the right of workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister who introduced this subject and I am only endeavouring to emphasise its irrelevancy.  Whether a trade union member be a loyalist or a republican is a matter of indifference and to say otherwise would be to defeat the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As a trade unionist, I am disappointed that the Minister should introduce a political element into the Bill.  In replying to Deputy Fitzgerald the Minister said rightly that even to encourage unionists to do certain things might be a bit strong.  However, his statement is a lecture to unions to the effect that they must respect the views of loyalist workers.  Is this necessary?  I do not know why the Minister should have said it.  Union members are noted for their respect for all political and, indeed, religious opinions.  Therefore, this statement of the Minister's was unnecessary and I am disappointed that he introduced the subject.  The trade union movement is one organisation that does not require any lecture on the rights of workers, whether they be human, political or religious rights.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cunningham that the Minister could well have omitted his remarks about the political aspects of a trade union. I should like the Minister to tell me whether, after this Bill has been passed, it goes to the ILO.  In other words, will it be given any international recognition?  Do we have to register?</P>

      <P>If we had to it would another good place to publicise the matter.  In regard to the Minister's remarks concerning unity I should like to state that we never refused recognition to the Congress of Trade Unions but it was only in the last eight years that the former Stormont Government recognised the congress after trojan work had been done by a great northerner, Lord O'Neill.  That man never got the credit he deserved for his part in having the Congress of Trade Unions recognised in the North.  If one read his autobiography one would appreciate the difficult time he had in having a simple thing approved such as the recognition of the congress.  That was a major step forward.</P>
      <P>While Lord O'Neill only saw the need for this recognition in 1965 we had seen the need for it all the time.  If we followed Larkin and Connolly we would realise that they did not want unity just as a political mark.  They wanted unity because it would have made the trade union movement more powerful and effective.  Lord O'Neill saw the same thing and he wanted industrial peace there.  We always recognised that the definition of an Irish worker was a person working in Ireland, whether he was in Derry or Cork. Despite all our faults this is one matter we cannot be faulted on.  We have always welcomed the worker from Queen's Island or anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the position of the Chair but we did not start <Col N="1694" /> this trend this morning.  I should like to emphasise, in order to counteract the remarks of the Minister, to the people of the North who have always recognised their Irishness in this aspect, that we welcome them and we look forward to their co-operation in every aspect.  They will not find us wanting in this matter.  I discussed this matter with the ordinary working people in the North and I pointed out that I did not want unity to be an end in itself.  I want to make the trade union movement more effective.  I should like to praise Lord O'Neill for the steps he took to get recognition in the North of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Successive Governments here always recognised that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies opposite may be over-sensitive.  I was not addressing any lecture to them; I was simply talking about how this section may be most effective in practice. After all, this House is passing this amendment and we would hope that the amendment would facilitate a greater coming together in an Irish union structure of workers with differing political views.  To make this truly effective we must be very sensitive on the conditions for its success. We hope that this amendment will have its beneficial effects elsewhere. I was not criticising any members of the Opposition who took part in the debate; I was talking about conditions necessary for its success especially when one considers that it is coming from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is to succeed we must not confuse political unity with trade union unity.  If we fall for this confusion it does not serve the cause of either.  Introducing professions of political unity in the trade union context endangers the co-operation so dearly won on a 32-county basis between the trade unions.  The Congress of Trade Unions are aware that the majority of trade unions in Northern Ireland do not share the views of the majority of members in the Twenty-six Counties on the desirability of political unity.  If the Congress in the 32-county context were to come down on one side or the other <Col N="1695" /> of this political debate the present congress organisation would be endangered in their 32-county aspect.</P>
    <P>Since the amendment is going through this House it behoves all of us to see that we address our remarks to strengthening the unity of the trade union movement.  It is in that spirit that I appreciate the way this House approached this section which requires the assent of those whom it is designed to serve.  That assent will be won only by the exercise of discipline and constraint in our remarks in the political sphere, of unity of a political kind.</P>
    <P>The necessity for information on this section and its effect being made available to union members was mentioned by Deputies Fitzgerald and Cunningham.  Congress have drawn up an explanatory leaflet which I looked at.  To me it appears clear cut and simple and congress are distributing this to their constituent union members. In my view that will suffice in putting the information across adequately. The relationship of the Legislature with unions is one, in so far as possible, of meeting their wishes in the sphere of trade union law.  I have never been of the opinion that the Houses of the Oireachtas in our system can, without consultation, bring in what may appear to be a wonderful plan for the trade union movement but not a plan which meets with their assent or accords with their views on how their organisation should be rearranged. The more healthy way forward and the one which better ensures their support and co-operation is to have consultation with them and based on that consultation an improvement in the legislation before the House.</P>
    <P>Before this Bill the position was that trade union legislation in this area was a positive impediment to the coming together of trade unions.  We have removed that impediment but we have done no more than that. When we pass the amendment we will have removed the impediment which prevented Irishmen, north and south, with a will to come together&mdash;that is the important thing&mdash;from doing so. <Col N="1696" /> That amendment will only be effective where the union members coming together have no suspicion or need to fear that their coming together in a trade union context necessarily means any surrender of their political attitudes. Deputies will appreciate that if we have a model, as we have in the Congress of Trade Unions, of a working unity over the entire country that must not be endangered.  We have had a working unity, a unity of working people north and south over the years and that is a precious form of unity in an island which has few experiences of it in any sphere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I was amazed when the Minister replied earlier.  I do not think the words we heard were the views of Deputy Michael O'Leary, the Minister for Labour.  I would say the words were inspired and passed on by somebody else, possibly somebody not a Member of this House.  Up to now the Minister has been careful to protect this unity within the trade union movement.  When we speak of the trade union movement we mean everybody. Over the years it was our view that a strong and viable congress was necessary to ensure the progressive development of the trade union movement.  The Minister singled out one group of workers.  I shall not repeat it because to place it on the record again and again would suggest that there is some situation here that might isolate a certain section of workers.  These are brother trade unionists, all within the one group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was rather regrettable that a certain section of workers was singled out whose political and other views might be different from ours in this House. Everyone understands that, just as the trade union in the North understands the situation, but, nevertheless they all come together in congress to discuss problems affecting workers as a whole. This is very important.  It is rather regrettable that such mention was made here.  The Minister knows the group to whom I am referring.  I shall not write it into the record again.  I hope the Press will disregard the reference made by the Minister because publication of it could do substantial damage to the Bill and to the trade union movement <Col N="1697" /> in general.  While we here and people in the North and elsewhere have political differences, we have to agree to disagree when it comes down to basic and fundamental matters such as the trade union movement, which embraces workers and their problems as distinct from politics and the political arm of political parties.  Therefore, I would hope that neither religion nor politics would be referred to in this debate. Such reference can do irreparable harm to the Bill and to our whole attitude in relation to what we hope to achieve.</P>
    <P>I am quite positive that Irish workers in general, irrespective of their religious or political convictions, understand fully the necessity and desirability of having decision making bodies within Ireland in relation to their problems in Ireland.  This is common to all trade unions.  I speak to trade unions from the North and from the South and sometimes you find bad trade unions in the South just as you do elsewhere.  We have a common desire to rectify within our own congress our own problems in relation to the affairs of workers, the improvement of conditions and to ensure that we have a strong, viable organisation.  I do not think that there was ever a suggestion from people outside that we were trying to dominate them in any way. They play their part fully and well.  Members in the North have been presidents of our congress here and have played a very credible part in the development of the trade union organisation.</P>
    <P>The singling out of any group was fatal on this occasion.  I am positive that the words spoken by the Minister were not a projection of his personal viewpoint.  Somebody has passed him somewhere along the line a few words to pump into the situation here.  It is rather regrettable that he rose to that bait.  I do not think he has done justice to the House or to himself. I think it was somebody outside.  I do not think people in the Minister's own Department would have advised him on that score.  They are too responsible.  They fully understand the problems and the meaning of the situation in relation to legislation and they know what the desired effect is, <Col N="1698" /> that we have a common bond as trade unionists, wherever we work, in ensuring our own betterment.  If there can be a question of adjustment within the trade union movement as a whole, I do not think that anyone has any problem.  When presidents are elected from a particular sector of the country, be it North or South, there is no objection on the part of trade unions either North or South.  It has been the common desire and the common purpose so to strengthen congress as to make it the viable institution it deserves to be, with the absolute support of trade unions North and South working for the common good of Irish workers North and South or in the areas where they have control.</P>
    <P>I would hope, in the first instance, that the Press would disregard the reference that has been made because, if it gets publicity, irreparable damage can be done.  I am sure the Minister did not mean it in the way it came across.  I am quite positive that they do not represent his personal views. If he was prompted by any outside group to make this statement, it is further regrettable.  I do not know how it came about because the Minister has been most careful in dealing with the problem and in guiding us and in guiding me in relation to the discussion that took place on various sections to ensure that we kept within reasonable bounds and that there was no suggestion whatsoever that any sector would be pin-pointed in relation to the development of the organisation.</P>
    <P>I would hope that there will be no further references or attempts made to isolate any particular group as having different views in relation to the common desire for the good of the trade union organisation and that political or religious matters would not be a factor.  They have not been a factor up to now and I do not think they will be in future.  If we continue to pursue a course where we will pinpoint a particular group on occasion here and write it into legislation and into the record of the House, it will be a bad day for the unity of the trade union movement.</P>

      <P>I have spoken on nothing else.  I welcome what the Minister had to say about the union issuing this broadsheet or this information sheet to its members.  That is certainly one aspect of publicity that I mentioned.  It should not be solely confined to union members as such. There should be an effort made in the Department through some publication by the Department to widen that advertising somewhat.</P>
      <P>The Minister's lapse was disappointing. His apology to Members of the House regarding over-sensitivity was unecessary.  We fully realise that he was not lecturing to us.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment covers all trade unions comprised of members in this State and in Northern Ireland.  There is no qualification to that membership. They can come from any group or any walk in life.  Let us as Members of this House dealing with trade union regulation, dealing with an <Col N="1700" /> amendment to the Trade Union Bill, 1974 or, indeed, dealing with any worker or any trade union regulation, primarily concern ourselves with the rights and conditions of workers.  It is, of course, very welcome that these workers come from places as far apart as Cork and Kerry, as Deputy Moore or some other Deputy said. This makes it all the more desirable to us.  Let us refer to them as trade union members, again emphasising from all walks of life.  There is no necessity for me or any other Member of this House to lecture to trade union members that somebody is acceptable or somebody must be accepted.  That is not necessary for any Irishman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say very briefly that, of course, I was not lecturing to the trade unions or trade unionists who, after all, are the people who brought about unity of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They are in no need of lectures from me or anybody else.  I was simply pointing out certain requirements that must be met in our general attitudes and expressions in political areas if this amendment is to be successful.  Simply because it is being passed through a House of the Oireachtas it is necessary to make that point.  That is the only point I wish to make, that there should be that general approach on all our parts if the amendment is to succeed.  It must not be forgotten that in the Twenty-six Counties we have many trade union members who would regard themselves&mdash;this is on the point about whether Irish trade unionists would like to be in Irish unions and Deputy Dowling knows as well as I that there are many such trade unionists in this part of the country&mdash;as politically completely orthodox but who prefer to remain in membership of unions with head offices in Britain.  That is an extraordinary paradox but it exists around the country.  Men who would certainly regard themselves as very high up in the patriotic league insist on remaining members of unions with head offices in Britain.  We all know that it happens.  It happens in Cork.  Kerry and elsewhere.  There is this paradox of Irishmen wishing to retain their <Col N="1701" /> membership of unions with head offices in Britain and who would resist very strenuously, indeed, any decision of this Oireachtas, any legislation passed here, which would compel them to give over their membership of such British-based unions.  It is that kind of paradox and situation Members of the House would need to bear in mind when we speak about the possibility of the effectiveness of this or any other amendment of this legislation.</P>
      <P>One would need to appreciate that there will be a long road ahead of us in ensuring that this amendment assists in the achievement of the result that all spokesmen on this debate would like to bring about, that is, a trade union movement, and I believe that the best form of trade union for Irish workers is one based in Ireland, in the Thirty-two Counties, which gives them service in this island, adequately staffed.  I believe that can be brought about only by the trade union movement itself, reorganising itself, drawing up plans, and they are in the course of doing that.  But we do not bring that possibility nearer by pretending that political problems do not exist.  The main task before us is to ensure that we gain support for the kind of amendment we have had before the House this morning.</P>

What he has been saying is irrelevant because there are people in this country who are in British trade unions and who would not leave them and who would lecture one on their honour of James Connolly.  This means that any mention of it is irrelevant because people of differing views exist in all trade unions.  Trade unionism is a matter of doing one's business, not airing any political opinions one may hold.  That is the reason I do not think it should be brought up here at all.  One could not expect&mdash;and we do not expect&mdash; people in Belfast to forget their past.

      <P>We regret that Deputy Tunney our spokesman on this matter is ill and unable to be present.  I was asked at very short notice to take his place.  During the course of the discussion on this Bill which, if my memory serves me correctly, increases from £40 million to £60 million the amount of money which can be used for the purpose of land bonds with which to purchase land the base was widened very much. Indeed, the Minister in his concluding speech dealt not only with land bonds but also with the pension scheme, commonages, enlargements of holdings and the farm modernisation scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was pointing out that a necessity existed in regard to the enlargement of farms.  However, I do not intend to range over that wide area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the Land Commission purchase land for the purpose <Col N="1703" /> of redistribution.  The main point I want to make is that when one reaches a situation in which it will cost the recipient of the holding, or portion of a holding, in annuities, anything up to £90, then we will have a serious problem.  This applies particularly when one considers that the main purpose of land acquisition by the Commission is to increase and make viable non-viable holdings.  We may reach a stage when this will have to be looked at and alternative measures found.  From my knowledge of people who are refusing now to accept an addition to their holding, it has been intimated to them&mdash;here I am talking about uneconomic holdings, very small farms&mdash;that this is the sort of figure.  Indeed, the figure involved in the cases with which I have dealt has been £30 per acre.  I am sure the Minister will refer to the point I have made and deal with it from experience gained to date in his Department.</P>
    <P>Is it possible in respect of holders of land bonds which carry a low interest rate and are at a very low quotation, especially deserving cases, especially those who sold land to the Land Commission, to have any scheme which would enable them to get out and enable the Land Commission to take the land bonds from them? In the main they are poor people; they are old.  They would like to get even the par value of those bonds because the interest and the market value are of absolutely no use to them.  We must also consider that this land was bought 30 or 40 years ago at a very low price.  Would the Minister deal with those two points?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister might bring in an amendment on the question of guaranteeing the bonds.  Speaking on Second Stage I made a suggestion and the Minister turned it down because of the cost of <Col N="1704" /> the sinking fund.  This would be money well spent.  If land is acquired compulsorily it must be paid for by land bonds.  The new bonds are good but the trouble is that they do not carry a guarantee.  They have downgraded the 12½ per cent issue and the 9¾ per cent issue.  I have been repeating this constantly.  When you issue a bond with a high rate of interest you immediately downgrade the lower issue and the people who have those bonds are absolutely robbed.</P>
      <P>The man who gets land should not be charged extra per acre.  He is penalised enough.  The State should guarantee those bonds, redeemable at par.  This would solve the whole problem.  It is all right to say that we can phase them out but we cannot phase them out.  We have not got the money to phase them out.  It annoys me that we are not practical here. We have not got the money to continue land settlement because the only land for which we can pay in cash from now on will be land under the retirement scheme and that does not include any land set at the moment. The land which is set and not being worked is the land we would like to acquire.  I can see no way of acquiring that land because people will not sell voluntarily for land bonds and therefore it has to be acquired compulsorily. According to the rules, land acquired compulsorily has to be paid for with land bonds.  The Minister can contradict me if that is wrong.  Therefore, we are up against the delay of having to go through the courts first to acquire it, secondly to settle the price, and thirdly to get possession.</P>
      <P>As I said before, the recent issue of bonds was an attractive issue but it has annoyed the holders of the 9¾ per cent issue not to talk about those which are as low as 4 per cent and are not worth £30.  Holders of the 9¾ per cent and 12½ per cent issues are angry because their bonds were reasonably good until the 16 per cent bonds were issued and theirs were downgraded. The only answer is on a national loan basis.  I do not want to preach about it because I do not like taking up the time of the House or the time of the Minister by talking for too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1705" /> If a man has £20,000 worth of land bonds today the Government should guarantee them at par at X years.  I do not mind whether it is five, six or seven years or even ten years.  If that were done there would be respect for land bonds but at the moment they stink and everybody knows that. There is no point in the Minister saying: &ldquo;Your party did this or my party did that.&rdquo;  I have been in the Dáil for two years only and if I had been here before I would have opposed this. There is no use in talking about what was done in the past.  We are now talking about 1975.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to bring in an amendment.  If we phase out land bonds we will do away with the compulsory purchase of land for people who do not qualify for land surrendered under the farm retirement scheme.  We are not discussing that at the moment.  Land which the Land Commission should acquire will not be given up because it does not come within Directive 160.  I make this appeal sincerely to the Minister. The people who are getting the 16 per cent are not annoyed and it will be quite a while before they are downgraded. God forbid that inflation would go at such a rate that certain interest rates would go beyond 16 per cent.  What about the people with the 12½ per cent and the 9¾ per cent issues and the people with the older issues? I would ask the Minister to set up a sinking fund and redeem the bonds at par at X years from the date of issue.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In reply to Deputy Cunningham, to date we have not experienced any difficulty in allotting land which we acquired at 12½ per cent.  There is a great demand for that land and there has been no increase in refusals.  We have always had the occasional refusal for one reason or another, for example, people changing their minds. My advice, my knowledge, my information is that there has been no increase whatever in refusals of land offered under the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Cunningham knows, in what I might describe as the poorer counties where the land is not so good and where farmers are small, the <Col N="1706" /> annuities are heavily subsidised.  They are subsidised to the rate of 50 per cent within certain limits.  Up to 1965 the entire country was subsidised.  The Land Act, 1965, took away the subsidies in regard to annuities in all areas except the old traditional districts.  In 1973, I extended the subsidy to the 12 western counties by including Monaghan, Longford and Cavan.  In the old congested district areas, plus the three counties of Longford, Cavan and Monaghan, a considerable subsidy is paid on annuities which means that the annuities are available.  They are reasonable and people are anxious to take the land and pay the annuities. The only complaint I am receiving is that there is delay in allocating the land.  I have done something in that regard by strengthening the outdoor staff of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that there is a conflict between the case made by Deputy Cunningham and the request made by Deputy Callanan.  Deputy Cunningham complained that the annuities were too high and beyond the capacity of allottees to pay and Deputy Callanan requested that land bonds be issued for a shorter term&mdash;in other words, that they would be redeemable after five, seven or ten years.  Were that to happen the sinking fund would have to be increased dramatically and the cost to the allottees would also be increased dramatically.  I do not think that is desirable.</P>

In 21 months from March, 1973, to the end of 1974, the Government provided <Col N="1707" /> £3¼ million for the purchase of land in cash.  Let us be realistic about this.

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Exactly, but the money to finance the scheme does not come out of the trees or the bushes or from Europe; it comes from the Irish taxpayer.  When the former Government did not have to finance the retirement scheme why did they not provide money for the traditional purchase of land? The bald facts are, and no amount of argument will get over them, that the record of this Government in their short term in office in providing cash for the purchase of land is excellent and compares very favourably with the record of the previous Government. Indeed it completely overshadows it.  I am prepared to go on phasing out land bonds and providing more cash each year.  I hope the day will come when all dealings will be in cash but, until that day comes, I do not think this House or Opposition Deputies are doing any service to the small uneconomic farmers by encouraging people not to take land bonds.  By comparison, the present land bond is the best bond ever introduced both in terms of interest and redemption period.  The interest is 16 per cent. Even since this Bill was introduced the interest rate has improved because interest rates in general have come down.  The redemption period is the shortest ever.  It is 27 years, far shorter than the other redemption periods which were as long as 60 years.  Let us sell this bond.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is a gamble but there is no gamble about the 27 years.  I appeal to Deputies opposite to have regard to the 46,000 farmers who can be made viable if they get more land.  I appeal to Deputies opposite not to damage their chances of getting more land by defaming this particular land bond. This is the one with which we are dealing.  I believe it is attractive and I believe it will go well.</P>
      <P>I am glad to be able to say that the retirement scheme is going very well. Ninety cases have reached price stage; 90 cases have been finalised.  The prices have been agreed upon and they cover 3,400 acres.  That is not bad in less than 12 months.  It represents about one-sixth of the total intake of land in the normal year.  This is the first year of the scheme.  Over 20 cases have actually gone through the legal formalities and pensions are being paid.  The land is in the possession of the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>I could make what might be regarded as a provocative political speech about this, but I do not think that would be either necessary or desirable.  I believe it will be possible &mdash;I disagree with Deputy Callanan in this&mdash;to phase out land bonds in the foreseeable future but I also believe the old traditional compulsory methods are still necessary and should be retained to deal with speculators.  I do not want to harp on particular cases but Deputy Lalor agreed there were abuses, especially in 1971-72, when people jumped in and bought land for £70,000 and the appeal tribunal of the Land Commission in the not too distant past fixed the price of this land at £150,000.  That is gross speculation.  I believe payment in land bonds is adequate in most cases and people are being dealt with fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The retirement scheme deals with <Col N="1709" /> the small man who wants to retire. He can sell his land for cash.  Some Deputy mentioned that the scheme does not apply to land that is let.  It does not apply because the directive provides that, in order to qualify, the applicant must have spent 50 per cent of his time in the previous five years in agricultural employment on the farm and must have 50 per cent of his income from agricultural activities. I will be trying to get that directive changed.  It is too soon yet to make a demand for a change because the scheme has not been quite 12 months in operation.  Those who have land let to them do not come within the directive. If lands are let to people living away from them or in other countries there is no reason why the Land Commission cannot go in under, for want of a better word, compulsory powers and acquire that land and pay for it in 16 per cent land bonds.  I would appeal to Deputies to support the 16 per cent land bond in order that their constituents who are in search of land and who require it will be able to get that land.  I know that Deputies in Opposition usually see the blackest side of things&mdash;they seem to wear glasses that produce black images.  I remember an Independent Deputy, who is no longer in the House, in a speech referring to Opposition Deputies saying: &ldquo;Wise guys loves calamities.&rdquo;</P>

The farm retirement scheme is an added method of solving it.  I never decried the present land bond set-up.  If we can make bonds attractive there is no problem in having them as a method of payment for land.  Good land bonds, which these will be, are acceptable to us and I will recommend them to everybody.  However, that does not get rid of the land bond problem.

Would the Minister take a reasonably small sum of money and redeem some of those 4½ per cent bonds at par?  They are worth very little and the people who hold them have not very long to go.  That is a simple request but it would help many people.  An effort like this by the Minister would show that the Government are anxious about this matter, that they want to acquire land for redistribution and for the resettlement of families.  As an earnest of that wish they should do what I am asking.  I would urge the Minister to do something now about the urgent bond cases. The statement that he is going to phase out land bonds implies that the bonds are not worthwhile.  That is not the case.  The Government should indicate that they will deal with any problems that may arise because this will give some security to the people concerned.</P>

      <P>This provision signifies that the Minister has in mind not to phase out land bonds in the next five years.  I should like him to explain why it is so difficult for holders of land bonds to convert them into cash.  Why is it that farmers are told by their financial advisers not to accept land bonds? The old compulsory acquisition system should be retained so that speculators will not be able to buy up land, thus keeping out local congests.  I object to the indiscriminate use of stop notices being issued by the Land Commission. There must be a colossal amount of sales help up at the moment.  Local inspectors should be allowed to decide on the spot whether a holding be acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly one of the major reasons it is difficult to convert the bonds into cash or to have them accepted as collateral is because of the raging inflation.  The Minister said he provided more than £3½ million in a short time for the purchase of land in cash.  However, we should bear in mind that the price of land has increased considerably; during the period 1969-73 it increased in value by 600 per cent.  Perhaps the Minister would explain why farmers are so reluctant to accept bonds and that they only do so reluctantly when the land is acquired compulsorily.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see how it is relevant to the Bill being discussed. If the Minister is determined to phase out land bonds it means he will be doing away with the compulsory acquisition of land.  When we entered the EEC I was hopeful of phasing out land bonds because I thought we would get an injection of capital for land settlement and for drainage. These were the two arguments I used in favour of entry into the EEC.  I am not blaming the Minister for what happened; I am blaming EEC policy.</P>
      <P>The Minister is more aware than I am of what the Exchequer can afford.  A sum of £3½ million has been mentioned; I should like to know how much land that would have purchased ten years ago and how much it would purchase today.  It is irrelevant to talk about conditions ten years ago.  As far as I can ascertain, the Minister said that the present land bonds are redeemable in 27 years.  I should like him to clarify this point because this was not the case with other land bonds.  Even though a period of 27 years is a long period in a person's lifetime, nevertheless it is an improvement on the system that has obtained to date. However, I maintain that period could be reduced by an injection of capital into the sinking fund.</P>
      <P>The Minister was most unfair to me when he said I suggested the charge should be put on the rent of the unfortunate farmer.  Even allowing for the fact that the small farmer is subsidised in some respects, if a man with a family of five who has a valuation under £20 finds that his valuation has increased he loses his social welfare benefits.  When one considers the rateable valuation of the land plus the rent, that farmer stands to lose £500 for ten acres of land.  I never suggested that person's rent should be increased.  Millions of pounds are invested in other industries but an investment of a few million pounds to increase the sinking fund in order to redeem the land bonds at par would be desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I never said the 16 per cent land bonds were no good but I said we <Col N="1714" /> must have sympathy for those who hold bonds that have decreased in value.  The latest quotation shows that the 12½ per cent bond had dropped to 8 per cent.  We might well ask what has happened the 9¾ per cent bond and the 4 per cent bond.  Deputy Cunningham suggested we should start paying the older bonds at par.  This would give some ray of hope to the holders of such bonds.</P>
    <P>It is the injustice of the whole system about which I am concerned. At the time of issue all these bonds were ahead of other interest rates. The Government issued 4 per cent land bonds when other interest rates were only 2 per cent or 2½ per cent. They were a good bond on paper at the time of issue but because they were not redeemable at par until God knows when, nobody wanted them. It was hard to get rid of them because they were not redeemable.  If the Minister is as I believe sincere in thinking he can phase out land bonds, how does he intend to purchase them and where will he get the money? Under the farm retirement scheme you can only purchase small farms from farmers who have been working 50 per cent of their time on their land over a period of years. What about the 200- or 300-acre farms which will cost five times as much, which will come on the market? Will you not have to pay for them with land bonds if you have to acquire them compulsorily?</P>
    <P>This is happening all over the country.  Such a farm will attract a large number of potential development farmers.  How will the Minister pay for that? I agree with the Minister but I want to be factual.  If I were shouting at the Minister to phase out land bonds but continue buying land, the Minister would say: &ldquo;You cannot have it both ways&rdquo;.  If the Minister wants to acquire land so as to satisfy to a reasonable extent a reasonable number of people he will have to acquire land compulsorily. He must acquire land that speculators are buying and he must go in for &ldquo;the order&rdquo;.  There may be too much use of orders in the case of <Col N="1715" /> small holdings as Deputy O'Leary says but it is a very important instrument. Much of our land could be bought by speculators but for the order.  We must continue to buy that type of land and it must be paid for by land bonds on account of tax.</P>

As Deputy Tunney said on the first day of this debate, the people from whom the Minister is now getting land are not large ranchers.  I have not much use for speculators; I would not mind giving them any type of bond but a good deal of small pieces of land are being acquired from people who are not very rich and these are the people about whom I am concerned. Previously it was from the big landlords the Land Commission would buy the land.  This is a very important Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I appeal to the Opposition to be realistic and not to be saying things just because they sound popular.  That is not being helpful and will not, in the long run, do them any good in the country.  An impassioned appeal has been made to me to redeem the 4 per cent land bonds at par&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> These bonds were last issued in the 1940s and they have been falling ever since and if the present Opposition felt so strongly about them when in Government&mdash;these bonds were falling year after year&mdash;they could have then <Col N="1717" /> done, when money was more plentiful than it is now, what they are asking me to do.</P>
      <P>If I misquoted Deputy Callanan I apologise to him, but I meant to convery that the effect of his proposal&mdash;I do not suggest he said it should be added on to the annuities&mdash;would be to increase the annuities because in fixing annuities the Land Commission must have regard to the price paid for land.  If the sinking fund goes up the price of the annuities automatically goes up.  The effect of what the Opposition are proposing would be that land bonds which were issued at various interest rates should now be redeemed at par.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to national loans.  I remind the Opposition that national loans were issued over the last 50 years at rates as low as 3½ per cent.  During the term of office of the last Government many of them were issued for terms of 20 years and longer at 7 per cent and 8 per cent.  If unfortunate people now have to raise money on foot of those national loans they will lose a considerable amount. Are Deputy Callanan and Deputy Cunningham suggesting that all those loans that have been issued by various Governments over the years should now be redeemed at par, loans issued at interest rates varying from 3 per cent to 8 per cent and now standing at various figures such as 60 and 70?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The land bonds are redeemable at 27. Many of the Government and semi-Government stocks, such as ESB stock, that have been issued are not redeemable until the 90s.  I want to put on the record of this House, having regard to the trend of this debate, the various sinking dates for all the issues of land bonds created in the past.  The 4½ per cent land bond was repayable in 66 years approximately. The 4 per cent land bond was repayable in 47 years.  The 3? per cent land bond was repayable in 39 years.  The 3 per cent land bond was repayable in 34 years.  The 4¾ per cent land bond was repayable in 64 years. <Col N="1718" /> The 5 per cent land bond was repayable in 63 years.  The 5¾ per cent land bond was repayable in 56 years.  The 6 per cent land bond was repayable in 54 years.  The 5½ per cent land bond was repayable in 58 years.  The 7 per cent land bond was repayable in 50 years.  The 7½ per cent land bond was repayable in 48 years.  The 8 per cent land bond was repayable in 45 years. The 9½ per cent land bond was repayable in 40 years.  The 9¾ per cent land bond was repayable in 39 years.  The 12½ per cent land bond, the first issue by this Government, was repayable in 33 years; and the present issue, the second by this Government, will be repayable in 27 years.  That is a big improvement.  Those are the facts.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is a vast improvement on the previous issues.  It is not possible to redeem bygone issues of land bonds, much of which are not in the hands of the people who sold the land because they are freely saleable on the stock exchange.  If a survey were carried out, I am sure it would be found that the greater proportion of people who got land bonds have sold them.  As a result the bonds have changed hands many times.  Does Deputy Cunningham want me to pay £100 for bonds bought by some speculator at £67, £65 or £60? That is an outrageous suggestion. I am not going to encourage speculation or put money into the hands of people who bought land bonds from the farmers who sold their land.  I do not think the House would expect me to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it then suggested that there should be an investigation into the whereabouts of land bonds with a view to ascertaining if they are in the hands of the original owners of the land, or the people who received them in payment for their land or held by people who bought them? That is neither realistic nor practicable.  Unfortunately many people who invested money in issues of national loans are in the same position as the holders of <Col N="1719" /> land bonds if they have to realise the national loans.</P>
    <P>Deputy J. O'Leary thinks too many section 40 notices are being served.  A section 40 notice was introduced by the Land Act, 1965.  Its purpose was to freeze the sale of land so that the Land Commission could have an opportunity of investigating the land with a view to deciding whether to acquire it or not.  In my view, this is a necessary procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The section enables a stay to be put on the sale of land for three months. If the Land Commission have not made up their minds within that time, if they think it necessary they can extend the freeze for a further three months only.  It would be unwise to do away with that procedure because it would lead to the quick overnight sale of land with the result that they would not be available to the Land Commission for the relief of congestion. I hope that procedure is not being abused; I do not believe it is. I do not want to be personal to Deputy J. O'Leary, but I know it is an irritant to auctioneers and to my own profession, when they get farm land to sell.  They advertise it for three or four weeks and then a notice comes from the Land Commission and the sale is held up.  I did not like this when I was a solicitor and I am sure auctioneers do not like it either. This is still necessary to safeguard the farms which might change hands quickly.  There is a valid argument for this.  As the House knows, the decision whether the land will be taken or not lies with the commissioners, who are independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with all the points mentioned.  I am happy to hear that, while the Opposition complain about previous issues of land bonds, they are happy about this issue and are satisfied it will retain its value.  I hope it will be effective in getting land by voluntary purchase as well as by compulsory purchase.  I repeat that land bonds can be phased out.  The best evidence of this is that I am in the <Col N="1720" /> process of phasing them out.  An amount of £3.8 million is available this year for the purchase of land. Whether it is applied under this scheme or in the purchase of land in the traditional way, it is putting a pool of land into the hands of the Land Commission for the relief of congestion.  That is what Land Commission activity is all about.  If we got to the happy stage where we could carry out all our transactions for cash, and that will be some time yet, we still could have compulsory powers.

He said that Deputy Cunningham suggested that the 4½ per cent land bonds should be paid for in cash at par now. I replied that I did not say that.  During the course of his speech I realised why <Col N="1721" /> he started off on that statement.  Like myself he knows that these bonds and others are held by all kinds of people &mdash;financiers, solicitors, auctioneers and investors of all kinds.</P>

      <P>Yes, and TDs and Ministers.  The exact suggestion I made is easier to carry out than the reputed one which the Minister said I made.  If it is a fact that the 4½ per cent land bonds are held by the type of people he mentioned and others, people who are not in stringent financial circumstances, then what I suggested makes sense.  The people who have held on to their bonds, such as old people, who kept on hoping their value would increase, should be given the opportunity to redeem them at par.</P>
      <P>I do not want to score any political points on this as it is not such a big problem.  It is a problem of hardship cases.  I am sure the Minister in his capacity as a solicitor has met people who have nothing and have not very much longer to live, who have pleaded with him to have something done for the holders of land bonds, which are now worth £30 or £40 each.  I do not suggest that every holder of 4½ per cent bonds should be paid in cash now.  I did not suggest that at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The people I have mentioned now are the people I mentioned about 15 minutes ago and the Minister heard that.  Is an addition of £20 million to the present figure of £40 million sufficient over the next five years to deal with land bonds?  I know the Minister must find more cash for the farm retirement scheme as well as for land bonds.  I do not think he has scored any point by saying that over a great number of years £40 million was spent on land acquisition and that this year £4 million will be spent.  I know a man who offered land to the Land Commission, for whom I made representations that <Col N="1722" /> he be paid quickly.  This man offered his land voluntarily.  There was no question of compulsion or pressure by the Land Commission.  A deal was made for £3,000 three years ago but in the meantime, because he was a comparatively old man, he decided he could not afford to wait.  About a year ago he sold this reasonably small farm for £11,000.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider, against that background, that £20 million increase in the Land Bond ceiling is sufficient over the next five years?  Is £4 million this year sufficient?  I can give the Minister details of this case. Because the Land Commission delayed too long this man was legally entitled to withdraw his offer and sell his land to somebody else.  This is an example of how land prices are going up at the moment.</P>
      <P>We have the Minister for Education saying the Government are giving so much money for education, that everyone should be happy and should thank the Minister.  Last night we had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries saying that the Government are giving so much more than Fianna Fáil gave and the trawlermen on strike should give up because they are all right.  We have all the Ministers quoting figures of what was given while Fianna Fáil were in Government and what is being given this year, but this year is in the context of an inflationary situation.  The trouble with the Government is that they are not infused with the mentality of creating wealth.  The Minister may give very fancy figures for the acquisition of forestry land but he is dropping down in land acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hammering at the Minister's £4 million and showing what it means in the context of land purchase.  I feel the increase of £20 million will not be sufficient unless there is a cutback in this operation.  This is an example of how <Col N="1723" /> useless it is for the Minister to put up an argument that £4 million will do relatively the same as it did some years ago.  The case I mentioned about the Land Commission offering £3,000 for some land three years ago which was sold for £11,000 two years later is widespread throughout the country.  The Minister will not alone need to squeeze more money from the Minister for Finance but he will need to get more bonds to purchase land.  That is why I am in agreement with the 16½ per cent land bonds.  The period is reasonably short and the rate is good.  The Minister will not be allowed to get it across that we are against bonds.  I do not suggest that he should purchase all the 4½ per cent bonds.  I am suggesting that he should, first of all, get the Government's consent to do it and, secondly, indicate to those who are still holders of bonds for land that they sold to the Land Commission or who are hardship cases that the Land Commission would be prepared to redeem them at par.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Making comparisons between the amount of money that was paid in the past and what is paid now is totally irrelevant. I have experience of being an executor to a will when we sold a 30-acre farm at £4,500 for land bonds.  I think it was the 6 per cent and we got rid of them at par because they were always good when they were issued. That holding of land today would be worth £15,000 or £16,000, and that is only a few years ago.  I have seen certain lands sold by public auction. It is not fixed up yet.  The Minister probably knows about it.  It went for £13,000.  It went to the Land Court and was bought at £26,000.  I remember another holding of 30 acres, which was bought for £2,700 20 years ago and sold for £20,000 not so long ago.  This is the way money has gone down over the years as a result of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe I took Deputy Cunningham up wrongly, but I took it for granted that what he was saying was that, if these old bonds were held by the <Col N="1724" /> original owner who was in a hardship position, these people should be considered. None of us on this side would dream of suggesting that the man who bought them at a reduced rate and was a speculator should benefit.  It was only the hardship cases we were concerned with.  It would be wrong, as the Minister says, if a man bought land bonds at a very low rate on the Stock Exchange, at £20 or £30, and could redeem them at £100.  Nobody on this side asked him to do that.  The Minister is still talking about phasing out land bonds.  This is an impossibility unless he phases out compulsory acquisition of land.  To my mind it is essential to keep that going because under the farm retirement scheme you will get only a certain type of land. That scheme in 1975 is not suitable and it must be changed, no matter which Government accepted it.  I would ask the Minister to try to get that directive changed, but until such time as that directive is changed you cannot touch rented land, and that is the type of land we should be trying to acquire. We have to acquire that compulsorily and we have to pay for it by land bonds.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I appreciate that Deputy Cunningham is not now spokesman on Lands and is probably operating under a difficulty; he did not have the Bill with him this morning.  He spent some time putting forward an argument that the £20 million land bonds mentioned in the Bill is to cover a period of five years.  I do not know where he got that information, because there is nothing in the Bill about five years.  The Bill merely permits the creation of £20 million land bonds.  They can be created next month if they are required or they may not be required at all.  Deputy Callanan has just mentioned the retirement scheme again.  I concede that it is not possible under the scheme to purchase land that has been let but I know it is not necessary to remind the Deputy that that land is still vulnerable under the compulsory powers of the Land Commission.</P>

The Opposition are playing politics in suggesting that the 4 per cent land bonds in the hand of an original holder should be redeemed at par.</P>
      <P>If we are going to redeem the 4 per cent land bond, why should we not redeem the 3 per cent, the 3½ per cent, the 4½ per cent, the 4¾ per cent, the 5 per cent, the 5½ per cent, the 5¾ per cent, the 6 per cent, the 7½ per cent, the 8 per cent, the 9½ per cent and the 9¾ per cent&mdash;why would we not redeem the lot that have depreciated to any extent, and why not also compensate the people who invested in national loans over the years, and who find themselves now at a loss and want their capital back? The thing is ridiculous, at a time when the Opposition are telling us that our taxes are too high, that our borrowing is too high, and that our deficits are too high.  I do not think the Opposition are serious, but I wish they would not take up the time of the House in putting forward arguments that are unworthy of a serious Opposition.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to purchase more land for the small farmer, to give me land bonds to acquire more land so that the 46,000 small but potentially viable farmers in whom Deputy Callanan is genuinely interested may be brought up to a viable standard.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been speaking on this amendment which proposes to increase the personal allowances under the income tax code by 25 per cent compared with last year.  I had indicated that this seemed to be the very minimum by which the allowances should be increased if one were to have any hope of keeping in line with the cost of living.  Indeed, the indications are that such an increase will not be sufficient to keep pace with the cost of living.  Because of the proposal in the Bill to increase the allowances by only 15 per cent and since they were not increased in 1973 the condition of taxpayers has been eroded.  In real terms they are worse off than they had been under the last Fianna Fáil budget of 1972.  Unless we adopt this amendment their position will be eroded further and more seriously at a time of increasing inflation, inflation which is reaching a frightening level.</P>
      <P>I have tried also to indicate that the cost of this, calculated by way of increasing the percentage, does not give a true figure as to the cost to the Exchequer and that it would be far more advantageous if we could have a more accurate idea of the real cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an effort to achieve any kind of safeguard for taxpayers, particularly the PAYE group, at this time of galloping inflation and from the point of view of the stimulation of the economy, it would be wise, prudent and just to adopt this amendment. This measure would not present the Minister with a problem of the dimensions he indicated.  His figure is fictitious. I am sure that if the real calculations were undertaken the result as to the net cost to the Exchequer would be very different from the Minister's figure of £16 million, allowing for the different factors involved, such as increases arising from the proposed national pay agreement, the spending of money foregone in income tax, and the collection of other indirect taxes such as VAT.  Taking into account the stimulation of the economy and the consequential increase in income from other taxes, one would find that the net cost of this proposal would not be £16 million.  I believe the cost would be much less although I am not <Col N="1728" /> in the position to give a figure because I have not available the facilities to enable me to make the calculation.  The Minister has these facilities and it would be helpful if he would let us know what will be the approximate cost having regard to the factors I have mentioned.  This would enable us, perhaps, to look at the matter more realistically.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of equity and of benefits accruing to the economy it makes much sense to accept this amendment and to increase income tax allowances from last year by 25 per cent rather than by 15 per cent as proposed in the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out last night, an increase of 25 per cent in the allowances would not be warranted by the facts of the situation.  I warned too of the danger of believing that indexation is the cure for our troubles. Indexation relating to a high rate of inflation is like&mdash;to use an old Dublin phrase &ldquo;scutting&rdquo; on the back of a lorry&mdash;somebody holding on to a vehicle over which he has no control. This may be going faster than his capacity to move and if it changes its momentum at any stage, may cause dire consequences to the person connected to it.  If it goes too fast and does not halt at the time the person hanging on to it may wish, he will be carried much further to his own inconvenience and disadvantage.  If it halts too suddenly the follower is thrown off his course and may be seriously injured.  In 1974 we had a rate of inflation extraordinarily and damagingly high attributable more than 60 per cent to circumstances which were beyond our control.  We would be ill-advised to consider total indexation to such temporary and uncontrollable phenomena.  The overwhelming majority of our imports are for necessities or for materials for further production which in many cases we re-export.  The fact that we have to pay more for imports makes it harder, not easier, to increase domestic incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 1975 the overall situation will be different.  The national wage agreement <Col N="1729" /> will increase the consumer price index by 8.4 per cent.  The increases in domestic profits this year will be 5.5 but the import increases will be only 4.6.  This is a radical change from last year but it means that we have to take a careful look at our own income situation.  Even though it is not pleasant to contemplate, we will have to moderate our expectations and not assume that they can continue to grow at the rate which they grew in the past or, indeed, in the short-term, that they can keep up with our domestic inflation while the rate of world inflation is now diminishing. What we are doing in 1975 is to compensate ourselves to a large extent for inflation that has already taken place. World inflation is now levelling off and in many countries it is now substantially in decline.  We now find our competitive position being seriously eroded.  If, for instance, we have a rate of inflation in excess of 20 per cent we are put at a serious disadvantage compared with a country like Germany, to which we have been increasing our exports, if the rate of inflation there is only 6 or 7 per cent.</P>
    <P>We will have to realise that simple but urgent problem.  It is something that touches us at all levels and will have to influence all our thinking, not merely in respect of wage negotiations but also about tax levels and levels of other benefits which we expect to get from the State.  I again congratulate Deputy de Valera who stands out as a guiding light on the Opposition benches.  He is the only member on the Opposition benches who, while expressing a desire for reduced taxation and for increases in the personal levels of income tax allowances said it was not sufficient to demand tax cuts without also suggesting where alternative revenue could be found. Deputy de Valera acknowledged he was at a loss to say where alternative revenue could be found.</P>
    <P>In my view Deputy de Valera, and his colleagues in Opposition, would really be at a loss to say where the £16 million that is suggested in the amendment could be found.  The process of calculation of £16 million as the cost of the Opposition amendment is <Col N="1730" /> the same as was used to calculate the cost of budgetary concessions of £28 million.  It involves a mixture of calculations, the number of people at work, the rate of wage increases, the adjustments made in the levels, the thresholds, the bands and the rates of taxation.  The figure is calculated objectively in the same way as the budgetary figures have been.</P>
    <P>Last night I said that the Opposition, when in office, increased the number of income tax payers from 195,000 to 700,000.  This works out at a rate of 34,000 people per annum added by them to the income tax bracket.  Since we came to office there has been a significant change.  While Fianna Fáil were in office the number of sur-tax payers went down from 10,000 to 6,600. The figure I give for income tax also includes sur-tax payers.  In our term of office the number of income tax payers including 26,000 &ldquo;sur-tax&rdquo; payers has increased from 700,000 to 730,000.  We have arrested the decline of sur-tax payers.  The number of sur-tax payers has increased from 6,600 to 26,000. This is attributable to a number of causes.  We have brought within the tax net farmers in the larger income bracket several of whom would be within the sur-tax bracket.  We have stopped a number of tax avoidance measures, including the borrowing of enormous sums so that 80 per cent of the cost of borrowing could be set off against other taxpayers.  We have brought within the tax net people who have been setting off non-farming profits against farming profits so as to avoid tax.</P>
    <P>If we take the 20,000 people at the higher rates of tax, who have been added since 1973, from the total number of income tax payers, the marginal increase in income tax payers is something around the 9,000 mark over a period of three years.  There is a big difference between adding 34,000 people to the income tax net every year and adding something in the region of 3,000 to 4,000 per year as we have added.  The 3,000/4,000 annual increases when one considers the increases in remuneration in recent years, represents an insignificant increase. Also when one bears in mind that notwithstanding the rate of unemployment <Col N="1731" /> the number of people at work increased, certainly up to the end of 1974, even at present figures, the number at work has not significantly diminished. The number of unemployed to a large extent signifies the inability of our economy in a time of world depression to expand employment opportunities, to increase the number of opportunities to provide new jobs.  It is not, fortunately, a significant reflection of a reduction in the number of people at work.  Substantially the number at work is the same or above what it was in 1973-74.</P>
    <P>It is clear that we have reversed the process of dragging into the taxation net a vast number of small income earners annually.  The fact that any increase has taken place is mainly attributable to the removal of avoidance measures which were available to people in the top income brackets and to bringing within the tax bracket the more fortunate members of the farming community who had comparably substantial incomes. This justifies our objective; it proves that we have gone some way towards broadening the tax base and relating tax payable to capacity to pay.  The fact that we have done this in a time of great financial difficulty and great economic pressure indicates that whatever the problems of the day may be the Government are keenly anxious to relieve the pressure which direct tax causes people and have been endeavouring to remedy that problem.</P>
    <P>In approaching any budget one must make a decision if new taxation is necessary, as to where the tax is to be collected.  In a time of fast rising costs and of a slowing down of economic performance it is necessary, unfortunately, for the State to increase taxation.</P>
    <P>We were in that position in our January budget this year when we had to choose between increasing taxes on incomes or on expenditure. We did not come to this decision on our own.  Before the budget I had the privilege and benefit of meeting with representatives of the trade union movement, of industry and of employers to hear their wishes in respect <Col N="1732" /> of the budget.  I took the opportunity of meeting them to pose to them some problems which might have to be faced.  I wanted to get their view as to what would be the correct thing to do if additional taxation was necessary or if reliefs could be given. Both groups were unanimously of the view that direct taxation should not be increased but if new taxes were necessary they should be applied in the indirect sphere on the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We adopted that line and the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;, the items which are not essential, tobacco, spirits and beer, were chosen as the items upon which to levy the additional tax.  Since then the same parties who said that the State should tax non-essential items have negotiated an agreement under which they propose to compensate themselves entirely for the taxes on the non-essentials which they agreed the State should correctly tax.  I have seen where one of these organisations has issued a statement criticising the Government for increasing the consumer price index by taxing items which previously they said should be taxed instead of incomes.  We live in a rather unreal world if organisations who seek to influence State thinking, make decisions which conflict with the advice which they have given and then chastise those who have accepted their advice.</P>
    <P>I have argued and the Government have argued&mdash;we set it out in our White Paper last autumn&mdash;in favour of complete consultations with the social partners.  But the traditional pattern in this country has been to exclude Government as the guardian of the common good from negotiations on incomes.  As I said in the budget debate, we are now in a situation where a national wage agreement has far more influence over the economy, over our society, over our future development than anything which the most brilliant Minister for Finance or the most effective Dáil or Seanad can ever do.</P>
    <P>It is not inappropriate that at this stage when we are considering what the levels of tax are on incomes we should offer these thoughts for serious consideration, <Col N="1733" /> not apportioning blame, not saying what was right or wrong in the past, but with a view to having society consider whether we could order our affairs better so as to make more suitable adjustments of incomes and tax liabilities.</P>
    <P>Yesterday a certain amount of time of the House was turned to matters other than the Finance Bill and those other issues all involved additional State expenditure.  One was education, another the fishing industry, another the telephone service.  We had a firm demand this morning for further State cash instead of land bonds.  Of course, every Minister for Finance would like to be Santa Claus and to be able to answer the prayers of all the children of the nation and to make every day Christmas Day.  But gifts cannot be handed out until the money is in the Exchequer bag to hand them out. Money will not go into the bag if people are not prepared to put the money in it.  The State's capacity to put the money in there is limited by the reaction which people have to the steps taken by the State.  I have told the House, and the country is aware without my telling it, what the reaction has been to the additional tax imposed this year for necessary purposes, to pay improved social welfare levels, to increase State benefits of one kind or another and to pay people in the public service.</P>
    <P>I have yet to hear anybody suggest that people in the public service should be paid less than anybody else or that they should have withheld from them the benefits of the national wage agreement. The new national wage agreement applicable to the public service adds £27 million more to the budget deficit.  This is something that has to be met by revenue, revenue generated by taxation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick last night said that the State cleans up in time of inflation and that there would be no need to impose new taxes to meet all the additional demands which are being made upon the Exchequer.  The year 1974 disproves that convenient theory. If inflation runs in single figures and there is tremendous growth in the economy you may get significant <Col N="1734" /> buoyancy which may diminish the need to impose new taxes.  Ireland's growth rate is at present in excess of most other European countries and most countries in the world other than OPEC countries.  Our growth rate this year of 1½ contrasts more than favourably with the growth rate of that great economic giant, the United States of America where there is no growth rate but a decline of 4½ in a year.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation now of comparatively very, very slow growth compared with what we were used to while the demands made for public expenditure are immense because of the high rate of inflation.  In 1974 revenue did not come up to expectations. That was in a year in which we had also a very small growth rate but a terrible rate of inflation and quite a considerable rate of income increase.  The year 1975 at this stage shows a somewhat similar pattern, due in part to factors beyond our control but some of the factors are within our control.  As a society we must get together to acknowledge honestly what is going wrong and to agree on the steps to correct it.</P>
    <P>In the light of the present situation &mdash;to come back specifically to this amendment&mdash;we must accept that with these constraints on the Exchequer regarding expenditure and income the Government have reached a reasonable compromise. They have provided a 15 per cent improvement in the personal tax allowances across the board.  They have also provided a £12 million tax reduction to industry and by so doing have helped to keep people in employment. At a time of great difficulty the most important goal to achieve is to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>A person who is in employment, even with an income which is partially reduced, say to a very small extent only because of a little less than full adjustment of tax allowances, is in a much better position than a person who is put out of employment because costs have risen beyond the capacity of employers to pay.  The budget produced in a neighbouring island yesterday, which many people find unpleasant, was the consequence <Col N="1735" /> of the shortcomings in that society which caused them to fail to come to grips with the economic problem in sufficient time.  We need to come to grips with the inflationary problem here.  The Government have been urging people along the right path. In a democracy it is part of the function of government to give that leadership.  Our leadership unfortunately has not been followed fully. Some of the exhortations which we offered have been taken into account, others have not.  To the extent that people accepted them they will benefit from them.  But we have to go a little further along the road before we start acting sensibly as a community. A little more give and a little less personal inclination to take would get this country over its present difficulties.  That is something we sincerely hope will be achieved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information as to the number of taxpayers in the higher brackets who will be taken out of those brackets as a result of the enactment of section 11?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers will be the same.  The amount they actually pay may be reduced but the numbers will remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is correct. The answer the Minister has just given rather complicates the issue he was talking about, the number of taxpayers brought in and out of the net and the number of payers of surtax&mdash; now the higher rates of tax&mdash;brought in and out of the net under this Government, or previous Governments, because, as he says, the effect of section 11 which reduces the higher rates of tax will not be to take people out of that net but will reduce the amount of tax they pay.  That is true but it clearly indicates that there is more to the argument than the Minister is giving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on the overall question of the number of taxpayers with which the Minister was dealing earlier, I would suggest that the position is, as indicated by the Minister's own figures, in two years the number of income taxpayers is increased by <Col N="1736" /> 30,000.  If one allows for the fact that the increase in the number of unemployed is certainly in excess of 30,000, between now and this time last year, one gets a figure of approximately 30,000, or something in excess of that, new taxpayers coming into the net in each of the last two years.  I do not think the Minister should talk very loudly about the numbers of taxpayers in and out of the net, particularly when one considers that this happened at a time when income tax allowances were increased last year by figures which, as the Minister said, compared with earlier years, were substantial. Of course, the answer is that in real terms they were not very substantial because of the level of inflation from which we now suffer.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about indexation. I was very interested in what he had to say.  The picture emerges even more clearly today.  It was suggested last evening by the Minister and, when talking about it, I said that while the Minister had not said this he implied something which he has spelled out much more clearly today. I do not think the Minister would quarrel with me if I paraphrase what he was saying on this issue by saying that he was conveying the idea that certain taxes, such as those on the old reliables, had been imposed in the budget for the benefit of the weaker sections of the community, with the advice of various vocational groups, such as trade unions, employers and industry, and that it was wrong to try to recompense or compensate for the increase in the cost of living brought about by those taxes.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong but that is my understanding of what he was conveying.</P>
    <P>If one accepts the validity of that argument for the moment, the fact is that the increases involved amount to, I think, 3 per cent.  But the gap between the income tax allowances and the very minimum rate of increase in inflation in this coming year is 10 per cent.  Therefore, there would be a good deal more validity in the Minister's argument if the section provided for an increase of, say, 22 per cent rather than 15 per cent.  I think <Col N="1737" /> it takes away considerably from the force of the Minister's argument when in fact the gap is 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>What was clearly uppermost in the Minister's mind in deciding on these increases of income tax allowances by 15 per cent only was the estimated cost, not the arguments he has been making in regard to people seeking recompense for tax increases which were imposed, in his view, for the benefit of the community and particularly of the poorer sections of it.  Whatever the validity of that argument, I think it has been thrown in as a make-rate. It is not the real situation as regards the level of income tax allowances proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about indexation. He likened it, as he said, in the Dublin vernacular, to &ldquo;scutting on the back of a lorry&rdquo;.  I want to disagree with the Minister on his interpretation of indexation.  I would agree with his interpretation, that it can create a vicious circle, fuelling inflation, when inflation is at a considerably lower level than at present.  But, when it reaches the kind of frightening level now obtaining, then, although in theory the Minister is right, in practice I believe he is wrong, for the reason that when people try to negotiate wage claims in circumstances of galloping inflation&mdash;apart from any question of trying to get a real increase in pay&mdash; what they are trying to do mainly is to keep in line with inflation and not end up worse off.  To do that they have to calculate how much the cost of living will increase in the period covered by the agreement.  They can get estimates of that which frequently turn out to be wrong.  With any reasonable amount of precaution they will add to that because of the fear that inflation &mdash;because it is at an increasing rate&mdash; is going to outstrip their best efforts. As a result of that, the net effect has been that wage settlements have gone beyond what would have been required merely to meet the cost of living if the matter had been left as it was.  But, because they went beyond that, they themselves fuelled inflation and that is where you get the vicious spiral. That has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>When you reach the kind of inflation <Col N="1738" /> we have now, in fact, in practice, despite the theory, you will get a lower level of inflation with indexation than without it.  With the kind of inflation we have now, the primary thing in any wage earner's mind, apart from being able to hold on to his job, is to try to ensure that his position does not disimprove. Full indexation will at least keep him in line with the cost of living, particularly indexation which produces frequent changes, not on an annual basis but on a much more frequent basis.</P>
    <P>When you get the high level of inflation we have now that is the primary objective of most people who are concerned with pay claims and it is best achieved by indexation at this level of inflation.</P>
    <P>When you get the high level of inflation we have now that is the primary objective of most people who are concerned with pay claims and it is best achieved by indexation at this level of inflation.</P>
    <P>Indexation is an important topic. Indeed, it has some relevance to this amendment.  As I understood it in the context of what the Minister was saying, the relevance was that what we were seeking to do in this amendment was to produce indexation in relation to income tax allowances.  That is true and it is primarily for the reason I mentioned, because of the level of inflation now.  The Minister spoke of this as a temporary phenomenon. That is a nice optimistic note.  I hope he is right but inflation of some level or another has been with us for a very long time, and inflation at a frighteningly high level has been with us for too long.  I personally cannot see any indications of a reduction in the rate of inflation to anything like tolerable levels in the short term.  On the contrary, in the really short term I think the pressures will continue upwards.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what happens in the next 12 months to people's pay-packets is of vital importance, and what will happen to people's pay packets in the next 12 months if this amendment is not accepted is that they will be eroded to the extent of at least 10 per cent, and probably more, in relation to the amount of tax being taken in this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister blows somewhat hot and cold on this topic.  He has been telling us for some time the reasons <Col N="1739" /> why we should not try to achieve indexation or complete adjustment of income tax allowances in line with inflation.  He has advanced a number of arguments in favour of this but, when it suits him and he wants to talk about the allowances given in the past, by taking absolute figures instead of the real value of money he speaks as though what he has done and what the Government of which he is a member have done is a very good thing in regard to income tax allowances.  In other words, in so far as he sees that he can find the money to increase income tax allowances that is a very good thing and, in so far as he cannot find it, it is against the national interest that there should be any bigger increase in income tax allowances.  He cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see he did not attempt to deal with the question I raised about the method by which the £16 million which he says this amendment would cost was calculated.  He indicated certain things about how it was calculated, but he did not indicate how it was calculated and I assume from that, that it is true no account was taken in calculating the £16 million of the economic effect and the effect on the yield from other taxes such as value-added tax of reducing the amount of revenue taken by the Exchequer from income tax by increasing the allowances from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>It may be that the results of such calculations are not available to the Minister I except that but, if they are not, at least it should be clear that the calculations which would give the real cost of this amendment are not available and that the figure of £16 million which the Minister has tossed about has no more realism than if I were to say the cost would be £1 million, because neither of us really knows what the cost would be in the absence of those calculations. It is quite possible that the net cost to the Exchequer&mdash;and I freely admit that I am merely speculating&mdash;would be under £5 million.  However, we just have not got that figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> We get back then to the question of whether it is right or wrong in present circumstances of enormous inflation to try to ensure that people's pay packets are not eroded by, in effect, reducing income tax allowances because that is the effect.  By increasing income tax allowances by 15 per cent, as is being done in the Bill, when inflation is at least 25 per cent, you are reducing the income tax allowances by 10 per cent and thereby, of course, reducing the take home pay of the income taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Although he has not said so in so many words, the Minister implicitly acknowledges that is the effect of it and attempts to justify it on two grounds so far as I can see: one, that there should not be any compensation anyway in pay agreements for the taxes on the old reliables and, two, if there is compensation in pay agreements for that he should redress the balance by reducing income tax allowances, which is what he is doing here.  Over and above that, he is arguing that the maintaining of the pay packet value for taxpayers is inflationary and would make our position worse.  All of these propositions are at best questionable assumptions. I have indicated some of the questions which arise, but by no means all of them.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the total approach to the economic management of our affairs, as indicated by the Minister, is the correct one.  I freely acknowledge that the management of the economy is no easy task, that there are no golden rules, and that one has to operate on a very delicate balance. Nevertheless, to approach this problem in a simplistic way by calculating in the manner indicated &mdash;the cost of this is £16 million: where do we find it?  &mdash;is a ham-fisted approach particularly at present because of the delicate nature of all the problems involved in managing the economy.</P>
    <P>It does not inspire too much confidence as to the overall effect of the management of the economy in the Minister's hands.  Indeed, the results which have emerged in the economy as a whole in the Minister's term of <Col N="1741" /> office would bear out the suspicion that there is a ham-fished approach which is, perhaps, doing more harm than good, but which certainly is not improving the situation in the way in which it could have been improved and can still be improved.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the effects of inflation on the one hand and growth or absence of growth on the other hand on the proposition which Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, apparently, which was, that in times of inflation there is a big yield to the Exchequer.  Whatever about the effect of inflation, and the Minister laid most stress on inflation, the key to the whole problem clearly lies in growth, whether there is or is not growth, and that is why 1974 showed and probably this year will show that the Exchequer is not benefiting to the same extent from inflation in balancing income and expenditure.  It is the absence of growth that is causing the problem.  It is the absence of growth that is increasing our difficulties in regard to inflation.  All our efforts should be directed to increasing growth.  That is one of the arguments in favour of this amendment.</P>
    <P>One difficulty I have&mdash;it is the reason why I have referred to the Minister's approach in somewhat derogatory terms&mdash;is the fact that the Minister has not adverted at all to the effect of stimulation of the economy, the effect on growth in real terms of holding income tax allowances as they were as against what the Minister is proposing to do which, in real terms, is to reduce income tax allowances.  The consequences of what he is doing on growth is what I should like to direct his attention to; the money received as a consequence into the Exchequer and how it is spent are important from the point of view of the effect on the Government. Some portion of the money may stimulate growth when it comes out from the Exchequer, depending on the areas to which it goes, but it is reasonably certain that in the case of the vast bulk of taxpayers an additional amount of money in their <Col N="1742" /> pay packets will stimulate growth and our primary objective in the management of the economy today should be to increase growth.</P>
    <P>That has been our major criticism of the Government's handling of the economy; they have failed to grasp the opportunities to increase growth in areas totally, or almost totally, within the Government's control.  In passing, may I give an example of the construction industry which the Government could, quite apart from anything happening outside the country, have stimulated?  It is this failure to stimulate our economy effectively that is responsible for the position in which we now find ourselves.  The Minister has talked on numerous occasions about stimulating the economy and about the effect of budgets he has brought in, but they did not stimulate the economy and results show that. Would anybody contest the view that to leave the pay packets of taxpayers bigger than they will be if the Minister's section is passed would tend to stimulate the economy?  I think it must be conceded that it would tend to stimulate.  Will it stimulate inflation as well?</P>
    <P>This is where the overall management of the economy comes in and this is where we have on many occasions tried to tell the Minister the way in which this problem should be approached so that we would reduce the inflationary effect to a minimum and increase growth to a maximum. That has not been done in the approach of the Minister and his colleagues to the management of our economy.  It is not being done here and, as I said earlier, it is a ham-fisted approach to think solely in terms of £16 million and how it is calculated; we need this for the Exchequer; we must get it and it does not matter if we do not get it, but what will be the effect of that on the economy, forgetting that whole area of the calculation?</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's approach.  It is a simplistic approach and it is not effective in the management of the economy.  As well as that it is leaving taxpayers worse off.  That is the kernel of it and the Minister should not lose <Col N="1743" /> sight of that.  Effectively what he is proposing to do is reduce personal allowances by 10 per cent.  In real terms inflation will be at least 25 per cent and the Minister is increasing the allowance by only 15 per cent.  Again, in real terms, that is a reduction in income tax allowances.  It is unjust.  It will be ineffective in the management of the economy.  The approach outlined in this amendment would be far more effective and I would urge the Minister very strongly to think again about the effect on both the Exchequer and the economy in general.</P>

      <P>The purpose of Deputy Colley's amendment is to highlight the fact that taxpayers are not being kept in line with the increase in the cost of living.  It is refreshing to hear the Minister talk about moderating expenditure, if he is really serious about that.  In his introductory statement on the budget he said that priority was being given to the present economic problems of maintaining employment and preserving living standards. It is to his credit that in the social welfare area there are increases running from around 21 per cent and 22½ per cent upwards.  Deputy Colley proposes increasing the tax relief by 25 per cent as against the Minister's 15 per cent and the Minister's 15 per cent demonstrates quite clearly that the Minister is certainly not living up to the priority of preserving living standards. Deputy Colley has stressed that one of the hoped for results of his proposal would be a stimulation of the economy, apart altogether from the just claim involved on behalf of the taxpayer.  The Minister also indicated &mdash;he mentioned it a moment ago too &mdash;in his budget statement the probable agreement as a result of the employer labour conference and said he was making provision for that at something around 23 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is trying to balance expenditure with revenue.  &ldquo;Trying to&rdquo; is the accurate way of putting it because in his budget statement he indicated a probable deficit of £150 million, which many of us believe will exceed that considerably. If the Minister is prepared to <Col N="1744" /> overspend to that extent in an endeavour to stimulate the economy and to maintain growth, it would seem that Deputy Colley is right in pressing this amendment because after all the Minister's main hope in even approaching the problem of balancing expenditure lies in the productive energy which he wants in the economy from those who are working in it and paying tax.</P>
    <P>I said earlier I did not think the £12 million which the Minister is not collecting for the time being from industry could be regarded as a very serious effort not to stimulate the economy but to maintain it.  I believe the investment which the Minister could have got from making substantial provision for industry by way of rebate of taxation would not alone maintain the level of the economy, of productivity, but there would be a productive advantage through a lower level of unemployment assistance payments which the Minister is called on to pay to those who have been put out of employment because of inflation and liquidity problems.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the increase announced in VAT rates on luxury goods, 8 per cent, in Britain.  It brings the rate to the highest yet in that country, whereas as was pointed out on this side of the House, the rate here on luxury goods has been brought up to the level of 37 per cent.</P>

      <P>One of the causes of our rate of inflation is the policy implemented by the Minister in that regard.  Deputy Colley is right in pushing his amendment not alone from the point of view of justice to the taxpayer <Col N="1745" /> but in the hope that it would help to stimulate the economy.  The Minister has not yet given any idea of the effect he thinks would result from insisting on his own proposal of 15 per cent as against the Opposition's 25 per cent.  I would argue it is something similar to the Minister's proposal at the beginning of the year of a £12 million rebate to keep industry on its feet.  If that figure had been more realistic, the probability is that the Minister's current problem in relation to unemployment payments would not be so great.</P>
      <P>It can be argued reasonably&mdash;I am not one of those in favour of over-expenditure, if it is avoidable&mdash;that if the Minister had set aside a significant sum six months ago to try to retain in employment the very significant number of people not now in employment he would be getting back quite a lot of money or would not have to pay out the money he is now paying in unemployment relief.  The same argument applies to doing justice to the taxpayer.  Of course, the problem of how the Minister does it and of what it costs is his.  If he can see his way, to quote his own words, to &ldquo;preserving living standards for the taxpayer&rdquo; the benefit may return into the economy during the coming 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I have very little to add to what has been said on the amendment by Deputies Colley and Brugha.  Their argument is that the rate be increased from 15 per cent to 25 per cent.  We believe this to be justifiable in today's conditions.  Somebody must take some step in regard to inflation.  The Central Bank and other authorities have told us that within the country we are responsible for 50 per cent of our present inflation.  Who will take the lead?  Do we expect the workers to take it by reduced wages?  Do we expect employers to cut back on profits and go out of business?  The Government are the people who must take the lead as regards inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation has a bearing on inflation. The wage earner is more concerned about his weekly take home packet. He is not fooled when there is talk <Col N="1746" /> about a 25 per cent or a 30 per cent increase because he realises there will be many deductions from his wages. There will be an income tax deduction and he is liable for the increased cost of the social welfare stamp.  The pattern adopted by the Government of transferring the entire contribution to the employer and the employees has put an extra burden on the wage earner.  The social welfare contribution will cost practically £5 per week and there will also be deductions in respect of retirement pension and the pay-related benefit scheme.  All of us know that next year the wage earners will seek an extra wage increase.</P>
    <P>Last year the national wage agreement allowed for an increase of 18 per cent but we know that because of inflation the final figure was approximately 28 per cent.  In the new national wage agreement there is a provision for a figure of 25 per cent but, on the basis of what happened last year, the possibility is the figure will be in excess of 30 per cent.  This will happen unless the Minister takes a positive step to curb inflation.  He should accept the amendment put down by Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that accepting the amendment of Deputy Colley would cost the Exchequer £16 million and he asked us where this money could be found.  It is obvious that before this year is out there will be an increase in wages of 25 per cent for the majority of people.  Quite a number of people are earning in the region of £40 per week and a 25 per cent increase will mean an extra £10 per week for them, approximately £500 per year.  All the Minister is giving back is £75 per year&mdash;at least that was the figure he mentioned in the budget. It is obvious he could easily afford £16 million, especially when we consider that the national wage agreement envisages at least a 25 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>It is practically impossible for a wage earner to live on £2,000 per year, especially if he is purchasing a house.  The additional income will be approximately £500 a year and, taking into account the £75 given back by the Minister in the budget, this will <Col N="1747" /> leave £425 to be taxed at the rate of 26 per cent.  When the Minister considers these figures he will realise that he can afford the £16 million.</P>
    <P>We are in a period of high inflation and workers will receive an increase this year.  The new national wage agreement provisions will barely cover the increase in prices; we all know there will not be any increase in the real standard of living.  If the Minister accepts the amendment put forward by Deputy Colley, he will be taking a step in the right direction in the effort to control inflation.  He will also help industry throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The system operated by the Government means taxation right along the line and it means industries will contract.  When we consider the British budget yesterday we can see there is little consolation for our industrialists in it; it is obvious that purchasing power within the United Kingdom will diminish in the next 12 months.  We will have to look to the EEC countries and to other parts of Europe and America to sell our exports and we should direct our attention now to the question of how we will do this.  We will have to consider how we may reduce our unit costs. Five or six years ago we had an advantage over other European manufacturers because our unit costs were lower but this advantage has been eroded and now we are operating on a par with other advanced European countries.  We should make an effort to keep our unit costs as low as possible and try to diversify our exports.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government must take the lead in the matter of curbing inflation.  The provisions made in the new national wage agreement are necessary if our workers are to maintain their standard of living, but I should not like to imagine what the agreement will be like next year.  Unless the vicious spiral of inflation is checked industries will close and all of us will be affected. There are a number of finance measures now before the House.  The Minister has an obligation to encourage <Col N="1748" /> workers and to help them cope with increased costs in the coming year.  He should take a lead. It will cost the Exchequer only £16 million to accept the amendment put down by Deputy Colley.</P>
    <P>We know that some of the legislation at present going through the House will have a detrimental effect on the economy.  I am speaking in particular of the horrible Wealth Tax Bill which will have a disastrous effect on the economy in the next few years.  The Minister should see the light with regard to capital taxation. He should increase the tax allowance. It is obvious that wages will rise by 25 per cent, that inflation will be at the rate of 25-30 per cent and nobody knows what will be the increase in prices.</P>
    <P>This is the situation we find ourselves in now.  A step must be taken by somebody if we are to bring the economy back on the rails.  The Minister for Finance is charged with the duty of trying to allocate money and devise a proper taxation system. I do not believe we can avoid taxation. I believe it is necessary if we are to have increased social welfare benefits.  However, they are not high enough to keep up with this taxation. There is no hope of continuing with a good social welfare policy if we do not expand our economic arm and create more jobs in the community. There is no good in the Government saying that inflation was 25 per cent last year, that wages will increase by 25 per cent this year and that they will take it back in taxation.  This attitude is not working in England.</P>
    <P>I prefer to encourage people to work.  I do not believe in taking half the wages of workers back from them in taxation.  You cannot hope for a strong economic arm if you have excessive taxation.  The Minister should accept Deputy Colley's amendment which would give the workers some compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to support Deputy Colley's amendment. The Minister should realise the plight of the people generally.  The earning capacity of the middle income group and the worker on the factory floor <Col N="1749" /> has been reduced in recent times. Those people were accustomed to overtime earnings as part of their ordinary earnings but this is no longer available.  I have long advocated having another look at the taxation of overtime.  There is no need for me to do that now because this overtime money is no longer available to those people.  While this has been happening, the increase in the cost of living has been advancing. We have been told that up to mid-February it increased by approximately 24 per cent in the year.  We believe it is rising because the last quarter of the year was the highest quarter.  It will probably be more in the coming year than 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the workers that they have been carrying the taxation burden for too long and that he will give them a break.  He should give the people who are lucky enough to be still in employment the added benefit of the increase suggested by Deputy Colley.  Many claims have been made by the Minister about the redistribution of wealth and its allocation in certain ways.  The workers do not understand what he is talking about because they have not received any material benefit.  Their colleagues are losing their jobs so they should be given some incentive.  The Minister should show those people some of the concern which some of his colleagues claim to show for people.  He should show them the concern which some of his Labour colleagues in Government are not showing for the working people.  The Minister should set a lead by accepting this amendment which would offer some compensation to those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure we have all been critical of the taxation system from time to time.  It has always been too easy to collect the PAYE contributions. Those workers in the good days of Fianna Fáil Government became accustomed to overtime earnings but now that is denied them.  It was an accepted part of employment in the building industry that no man took a job unless overtime was available. This is no longer there so their earnings <Col N="1750" /> are cut.  The State should be seen to lead in a situation like this.  Industry cannot take the further impositions the Minister is imposing on them.  The working-class and middle-class workers are bearing a greater burden than they ever had to bear.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed merely to keep personal allowances in line with the cost of living.  In fact, it may fail to do so. If it is not accepted, section 12 proposed by the Minister will, in fact, reduce personal allowances for all income taxpayers.  That is the reality of the situation.  In real terms it will reduce them because it is proposing to increase income tax allowances only by 15 per cent but we know that for the year involved the cost of living increase will be a minimum of 25 per cent.  In net terms failure to accept the amendment will reduce the pay packets of all those paying income tax.  On grounds of equity that is a <Col N="1752" /> situation which the Minister should not create and we endeavoured to remedy it.</P>
      <P>On the grounds of the economics of the situation and the stimulation of the economy we believe our amendment would assist considerably in trying to get our economy going again.  Since the Minister does not appear to be willing to accept our amendment the responsibility for the consequences of failing to do that lie clearly on his shoulders and on the shoulders of his colleagues. The responsibility involved may be substantial.  It is as well to make it clear that as far as we are concerned within reason and on a conservative approach, we have proposed the increase to 25 per cent.  I say &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; because it is almost certain that the cost of living increase in the year will be more than that.  We have played our part in trying to remedy the situation and if the Minister will not agree there is nothing we can do to force it through.  However we want it clearly set out on the record what we tried to do and what the Minister failed to agree to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will outline the proposals for the financing of Cork Harbour development; and if he will make a statement on the up-to-date position indicating whether the postponing of the Du Pont plans for development will have any delaying effect on the harbour development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Harbour Commissioners have been seeking a grant of the full cost, now estimated at over £9 million, of development works in the lower harbour.  This application has been under consideration in conjunction with the other elements in the overall development plan including the industrial complex at Ringaskiddy.</P>
      <P>A final decision in relation to the scope and financing of the harbour works has not yet been taken but the Government did undertake that necessary infrastructural facilities would be made available in time for the proposed Du Pont plant to go on stream.  The deferment of the Du Pont plant is a consideration that falls to be taken into account in arriving at final decisions about the harbour works but need not necessarily mean a delay in the completion of whatever final development scheme may be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister what proportion of the estimated cost of £9 million it is hoped the Government will contribute towards that development, or are the Government aware of the urgent need for the development of Cork Harbour, in view of possible off-shore developments?  Further, would the Minister take immediate steps to pressure the Government for a final decision on this irrespective of the delay on the Du Pont development there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Cork Harbour Commissioners have requested a grant for the full amount. No decision has yet been taken as to whether the full amount, or any proportion of it, will be given.  I am fully aware of the urgency in this regard <Col N="1756" /> and the Government share that view. What was the last supplementary asked by the Deputy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would put pressure on the Government for a decision, or if the decision is to be his own, when we might expect such a decision from him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that there is no question of my putting pressure on the Government.  The Government make a decision collectively.  I could not say when a decision might be taken; I hope as quickly as possible.  I do appreciate the urgency involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there is no question of putting pressure on the Government.  If it is within the Minister's Department, is it not his responsibility to ensure that adequate finance is provided for this development at the first possible opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not necessarily. The policy in regard to grants for harbours has been that where a specific industry goes to a harbour and the resources of that harbour would not be sufficient to provide facilities, grants are made available. But this is a different case and will involve a new policy because, since Du Pont pulled out, there is no specific industry for which the facilities would be made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether the further examination of the harbour development proposal depends on whether or not the Du Pont development scheme goes ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  I said now that the Du Pont development has pulled out it is being re-examined in the light of no specific industry being there for the facilities proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there is need for an immediate and urgent investment with a view to offshore oil exploration because, if we have not this type of investment to provide the services required, <Col N="1757" /> would the Minister not agree that it will be Milford Haven which will benefit from our exploration off the coast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an enlargement of the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there should be an immediate investment for this purpose without investing in anything else if we are to benefit from the exploration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows that exploration for oil has been going on off the south coast, for oil and gas, for a number of years now without investment.  I could not agree with the Deputy at all that if we do not provide finance, servicing of the exploration will go to Milford Haven.  From my experience on the spot I know&mdash;and I am sure the Deputy will have read about, if not seen for himself&mdash;that the people in the Cork Harbour region are well capable of catering for&mdash;and there are facilities there to cater for&mdash; existing and any future exploration that may go on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that these are services the oil people want laid on when they advance further with exploration works?  They merely take up a telephone and ask for this kind of service; they do not wait until the Government make up their minds to invest in Cork Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he proposes to use his powers, if any, to order the removal of a wrecked ship from the beach in a seaside holiday resort where, in the opinion of the local authority of the area, it is a danger to the tourist industry by virtue of the threat of pollution from oil discharge from the wreck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The removal of a wrecked ship from a beach is a matter, in the first instance, for the owner, who is subject to legal penalties if any pollution by oil discharge from the vessel occurs.  A harbour or conservancy authority, or the Commissioners of Irish Lights, can also remove a wreck if they consider it an obstruction or danger to navigation. I have no statutory powers to remove or order the removal of such a wreck.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say who has such power?  That reply is very vague.  There are wrecks on many of our beaches with the inherent danger of pollution from oil in them. Surely to goodness somebody is responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The owners are responsible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Commissioners of Irish Lights or the conservancy or harbour authority in that area can.  If there is no harbour authority, or no conservancy authority, then the Commissioners of Irish Lights can instruct the owners to remove the wreck, if it is a danger to navigation.</P>

      <P>If somebody salvages a vessel&mdash;I think I know the particular <Col N="1760" /> vessel about which Deputy Kyne and Deputy Kenneally speak&mdash; then he must hand it over to the receiver of wrecks.  If nobody claims that vessel after 12 months the receiver of wrecks can dispose of it and relate some of the funds back to the person who salvaged it.  In the case of the wreck about which the Deputy spoke, there are owners of it and it is their responsibility.  If the Deputies are interested, I can tell them who owns it.</P>

There are owners of the wreck and it is their responsibility to remove it.  If they do not, the Commissioners of Irish Lights can instruct them to have it removed.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the project to which the Deputy refers is held up.  Generally in relation to the building of drilling rigs, one has to balance jobs which are short-term, and they are short-term.  I am anxious that rigs should be built in Ireland but there is an amenity viewpoint and there is also a viewpoint relating to the taking up of labour for which jobs of a more permanent kind could be found.  If I were to impose a rigorous condition in regard to drilling rigs I would create impossible delays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not put it in those terms.  I said that in evaluating any project one wants to consider the effect of taking up a great deal of local labour on short-term jobs.  One <Col N="1766" /> may take up the pool of labour and labour may not be available for permanent long-term employment. Secondly, you want to consider the question of amenities.  Thirdly, one wants to have a rational use of the deep water sites we have and not a completely unplanned use.  There is both gain and potential damage and the reason we set up the group to think about it was because we did not want piecemeal development which would result in damage under a number of headings and which could be avoided by thinking ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people interested in carrying out this exploration and development are very frustrated, indeed, because of the lengthy delays that have taken place so far and, in those circumstances, will he arrange to announce the terms within a matter of days?  We were given to understand last week that the announcement was to be made last <Col N="1768" /> week but for some reason it was put off.</P>

      <P>Has any consideration been given or has the Minister any ideas as to how protection can be afforded to the Irish labour force and to Irish firms to give them the opportunity of doing the development work offshore&mdash;that is, the development work from the oil or gas find to the shore line?  I am seeking some way of protecting jobs in the area for our own people. Can that be done?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the problem raised by the Deputy. There are two constraints.  One is the constraint found in our accession treaty to the Community.  Another is the constraint that certain skills of a very high level and very specialised do not exist here.  Within these two constraints the Deputy can take it that we have done everything we can think of to the limit legally possible to ensure the spin-off in jobs results in these jobs being given to Irish workers.</P>

      <P>I arrived back from Luxembourg late last night and I have not yet spoken to my Parliamentary Secretary and I cannot, therefore, answer now.  In regard to the matter of fabrication, the IDA has been looking at the possibilities offered to it by Continental Shelf Development. I think the Deputy, for a reason I can guess, used the term &ldquo;the adjacent harbour&rdquo; in the singular.  I would have to see that the work was done in the most appropriate place.  That might be the adjacent harbour or it might be somewhere else inside Ireland.  In regard to the cadre of trainees, I cannot be explicit but I understand this matter is in hand in the Department of Labour and AnCO. Planning is going on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the so-called &ldquo;Tokyo Round&rdquo; of multilateral trade negotiations.  These negotiations have only just begun, in accordance with a decision taken at a recent meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee of GATT.  In view of the number of countries participating in the negotiations and of the range and complexity of the issues involved, it is not expected that any real progress will be made before July when the Trade Negotiations Committee meet again to review progress and plan future work.</P>
      <P>The areas of greatest interest to Ireland in these negotiations are agriculture, non-tariff barriers, safeguard measures and tariffs.  In regard to agriculture, our main concern is to ensure that the principles and mechanisms of the EEC's common agricultural policy are maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is our interest to have the greatest possible elimination or liberalisation of <Col N="1771" /> non-tariff barriers.  As to safeguard measures, we will be seeking measures which will allow us to take quick and effective action in cases where difficulties arise due to a sudden increase in imports.</P>
    <P>It is in our interest to have the greatest possible harmonisation of tariffs.  This would mean that the countries with the highest tariffs would make the biggest tariff cuts, giving us a balance of advantage from the export point of view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the steps his Department have taken to provide alternative jobs to replace the potential job loss caused by the delayed development of the Du Pont industry in Cork Harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority are making the Ringaskiddy site, previously reserved for Du Pont, immediately available for other industrial projects.</P>
      <P>An IDA team have visited Cork to carry out a complete review of industrial facilities and progress in the Cork city area and to consider whether fresh initiatives are required.</P>
      <P>Seven new industries with a job potential at full production for about 1,000 jobs will be starting production in the area this year and five of these industries are currently recruiting staff.  In addition, expansions by three other industries will provide some 150 further jobs this year.</P>
      <P>Two other industries approved for the Cork city area and due to start construction this year have a potential of about 950 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In that reply the Minister referred to about 2,000 jobs.  Will he accept that that number of jobs is entirely inadequate for the Cork area having regard to the present unemployment situation and the fear of unemployment that exists in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the employment difficulty in the Cork area. <Col N="1772" /> The Deputy will be aware that it is widespread and is not confined to Cork.  I understand the apprehension unemployment gives rise to, both for those in work as well as those out of work.  I do not agree the level of new job creation is inadequate.  If we think, as so many economists throughout the world are thinking, of a levelling off of the decline, the possibility of improving circumstances in the latter part of this year and in the beginning of 1976, and the movement of existing industries into good times&mdash; in addition to the new industries I have mentioned&mdash;the employment perspective for the Cork region is an adequate one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister knows that a special problem exists in Cork.  It probably exists in other areas also.  I would ask the Minister to do something at this stage to assist the struggling and ailing industries in the Cork area so that some of the jobs now in jeopardy may be preserved.  I would ask the Minister, as a matter of extreme urgency, to discuss this matter with the IDA and possibly with Fóir Teoranta.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <Col N="1773" /> if he is aware of the present unemployment and short-time employment situation which exists in the Blarney area, County Cork; and the steps he is taking to cater for the employment needs of the area on an urgent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the employment situation in the Blarney area. The new Irish Polysacks factory have taken on 47 workers since they started last December and plan to take on an additional 40 by the middle of this year.  A total of 114 are expected to be employed at full production which should be reached by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In Ballincollig, a major new industry &mdash;Data 100&mdash;are already recruiting staff and hope to go into production in June.  They will employ 330 at full production and this should enhance the employment opportunities of the Blarney area.  The area will also benefit from industrial employment opportunities in and around Cork city.</P>
      <P>The IDA are continuing their efforts to attract a suitable project to locate on an industrial site in Blarney which has been brought to their attention by private interests and the authority have also identified a further site for industry in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the unsolicited information regarding the Cork area&mdash;not entirely for my benefit&mdash;can the Minister state how many people will be taken on in the Ballincollig factory initially? The Minister referred to 330 but I should like to know how many will be taken on in June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a precise answer to that.  Production is starting in June and at full production there will be 330 people employed. I estimate that in a factory of this kind full production would be reached in a matter of perhaps three years. I know recruiting is taking place but certainly it could not be for 330 people this year or next year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the progress that has been made since <Col N="1774" /> he indicated that help would be given by the IDA to have a factory located in the town of Balbriggan, County Dublin, in view of the continuing redundancies in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The IDA have had discussions with the Balbriggan Town Commissioners about the industrial situation in Balbriggan and have requested the commissioners to provide them with information about sites available for industry in the area. When this information is furnished to them the authority will promote any suitable sites and endeavour to attract prospective industrialists to locate projects there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that the statement he made is a rather general one.  There is no immediate promise of employment for those unemployed or for people who are facing the prospect of being let go from their jobs.  Could the Minister not make a more definite statement with regard to the commitment he made in January to have the IDA do something positive for Balbriggan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In this matter the Deputy might help me.  Certainly I am anxious to help him and Balbriggan. On 30th January there were discussions between the IDA and the town commissioners and the IDA said they would initiate action on the basis of data to be furnished.  We have not got that data and it would be useful if the Deputy could help in the matter. If we get a prompt reply we will reply as quickly as possible.  While I accept the substance of what the Deputy said with regard to employment, at the moment the most useful thing would be to get the information we requested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that when the town commissioners approached the Dublin County Council they got an assurance that if a factory was provided a site would be made available?  Various areas have been indicated for suitable sites.  Surely the Minister is not trying to say that the blame for the hold up in providing a factory can be laid at the door of the town commissioners, <Col N="1775" /> a reasonable democratically elected body&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not blaming anybody but if the Deputy is aware of the mechanism by which industry is attracted he will know that a firm and certain site is a great inducement. If people have a project in mind and if they are told that when they have the project finalised they will be given a site, they are not as interested as they would be if the site were available initially.  We want that hard information because it will help the area and it will help us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They cancelled because of a downturn in the market for the product of the particular firm, which is not an Irish market.  It is a product for export and they considered that the economic situation in the market area did not warrant building a new factory at this moment.  That is in regard to the one that cancelled. In regard to the one that deferred the downturn is in the Irish domestic market and they intend to resume when the market turns up again.</P>

      <P>While Mr. Benn is the Industry Minister the appropriate Minister in Britain is Mr. Peter Shore, who is the Minister for Trade, with whom I have had contacts.  The circumstance of what Mr. Benn said was in the light of the campaign for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the British Referendum. If the intention for Ireland is to remain within the EEC, then the rules of the EEC must be complied with. Within that we were the first to make approaches to the Commission and we have got things from them, particularly in regard to one low cost area, that no other country got.  I am satisfied that our efforts produced results before other countries made approaches but I am not satisfied with the amount of action the EEC have taken.  This is a matter where we are continuing pressure and we are continuing contacts with the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>Five proposals involving potato processing have been made to the Industrial Development Authority in the past year.  Grant assistance was refused in four of these cases on the grounds that the home market was adequately catered for by existing manufacturers or that the scale of the project envisaged was uneconomic.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if, in view of the closure of Gortdrum Mines, County Tipperary, and the effects that this will have on the west Tipperary area, he will declare the area a designated one and apply the higher rate of grant for a minimum period of one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive approach to the creation of alternative industrial job opportunities in the west Tipperary area is being adopted by the IDA and SFADCO. This approach includes advance factory facilities, increased industrial promotion efforts for the area and the flexible use of grant powers to attract suitable projects to locate in the area. Accordingly, and in view of the industrial progress already achieved in a number of towns in west Tipperary, I do not consider that designation of the area would be warranted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the number of towns in the west Tipperary area that have been developed?  Would he not follow the precedent created by his predecessor in the Ballingarry area where 300 miners lost their jobs and now, where <Col N="1780" /> a further 300 miners are losing their jobs and create a designated area in west Tipperary?  In regard to the advance factory facilities which he referred to in his reply nothing has been done to put any sort of factory there.  Would the Minister like to assess this position now as against the Ballingarry area which is much less populated than the west Tipperary area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are a a number of things to say.  Firstly, what I just said in regard to designation of another area I would repeat. If Deputies want to put down questions for which they insist on answers I will have to answer them but I would rather not put on the record of the House the details of the arguments against designation.  I will talk to the Deputy afterwards and tell him.  If he is not satisfied, well and good he can use the mechanism of the House.  I suggest to him to let me talk to him and to accept that mechanism is more in the interests of the people that he and I are trying to help than it is to have it discussed publicly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Minister that in the designation of the Ballingarry area by the last Government portion of County Kilkenny was also included.  The case for designation of the Gortdrum area would appear to be similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be contrary to the normal practice to provide information of the kind requested by the Deputy in respect of a commercial concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that this is not a commercial concern of the type he is referring to because the State has a major equity stake now, for better or for worse, in it?  A lot of public money is now, directly or indirectly, committed to it and presumably at some time will become involved in it.  The taxpayers have a right to know what they are likly to get from the equity stake which the Minister holds on their behalf in this enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the thesis of the Deputy.  The Deputy is aware that there exists, for example, IDA shareholdings in a number of firms.  These are operated by the normal <Col N="1782" /> commercial criteria and these sorts of projections emanating from an official source in regard to growth profitability for a commercial concern with quoted shares, are contrary to practice for reasons that seem to be good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is a different matter from the IDA taking up shares in an existing company?  This mine has not yet gone into production. The State have now an interest in it, we are told to the extent of 67 per cent, and why is it that we cannot be given this information?  Is the Minister not aware of the likely return over each of the next ten years from the three interests it has by way of equity, taxation and royalties from the mine?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>On the matter of the share, when the Deputy said that the State had a share of 67 per cent he was using words imprecisely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that for the record and not to get into an argument about it.  I say it to indicate my demur at this moment.  I believe it is essential that firms in which the State have an interest operate according to normal and hard commercial criteria. If they are so required to operate in competition with the private sector with internationally quoted shares they are entitled to the same sort of protection accorded to other enterprises operating in the market place by the rules of the market place.  I do not think it is normal practice and I do not think it is advantageous to make the sort of guesstimate the Deputy asked for.  The Deputy must know that over a period of ten years, even if it were the correct practice which I affirm it is not, it would be an exercise in fantasy because there is no way in which one can have answers of the kind requested by the Deputy, especially in such an unstable thing as mining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the position that the Minister made an agreement <Col N="1783" /> with a private company in relation to the future operation of this mine without knowing, even in an approximate way, what return the State would be likely to get?  How can the taxpayer or the public generally judge whether or not this is a worthwhile agreement if the Minister does not know what the State will get?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that through Fóir Teoranta, the ICC, the IDA and so on, the State is entering into agreements involving money and the repayment of money with commercial firms every day of the week and has been for many decades without giving this sort of hard information the Deputy is asking for.  I have called the requesting of that information an exercise in fantasy but none the less competent people make judgments in regard to public and private enterprises without having that sort of hard information and without the possibility of getting it.</P>

Would the Minister not have a further look at this matter so as to be in a position to make representations to Fóir Teoranta and would Fóir Teoranta be in a position to put in a managing director or somebody to take over the firm or at least to have some say in the management of this very important industry in this very important area of Laois/Offaly?</P>

On the other hand, I would not have given the time and directed my staff to investigate all the possibilities if I did not believe that it had the possibility of survival and of being rescued.  I do not think the Dáil is the best place to plan what is most appropriate to effect a rescue in this particular case, which is quite a <Col N="1787" /> sensitive one, as all such cases of difficulty are sensitive, but I want to assure the Deputies that I have met the trade unions and have been very impressed by the attitude which they showed and that Fóir Teoranta and the IDA and my own Department are in continuous contact with this and I was again today in the attempt to resolve the problem and to guarantee the jobs of people.  I understand in a town like Banagher the one industry is the core of the whole employment.  So I do appreciate the difficulty but I cannot give a firm guarantee of a solution to the problem at this moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to secure that the taking of land for grazing livestock will be treated as the occupation of land for the purpose of husbandry.  The section cures a strange anomaly which existed in the law and which caused our colleagues in the Upper House to make hay while the sun shone one day last July by drawing attention to the particular anomaly.</P>
      <P>By virtue of court decisions where farming profits were chargeable to tax under Schedule B land taken for grazing was held not to be occupied by the person taking it and as a consequence that person was chargeable to tax under Schedule D in respect of his grazing profits.  Under the scheme of taxation on farming profits included in the Finance Act, 1974, farmers who occupied land of a rateable valuation of £100 or more became chargeable to tax on their farming profits.  By virtue of the court decisions referred to a farmer who took land for tillage purposes would be regarded as the occupier and the valuation of this land would count towards the £100 figure.  On the other hand, if he took the land for grazing he would not be regarded as the occupier and the valuation of the land so taken would not count towards the £100 figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again as a result of these decisions, a farmer who took land for grazing would be chargeable to tax under Schedule D in respect of his grazing profits regardless of the valuation of the farmland occupied by him and taken for grazing purposes.  Indeed, any farmer who took land for grazing <Col N="1790" /> rather than any other purpose was liable to tax on profits from that grazing.  It is proposed to eliminate these indefensible anomalies by providing that the taking of land for grazing would be regarded as the occupation of land for husbandry, the provisions to apply from 1975-76 onwards.</P>
    <P>The amendment will secure that for the present and subsequent years grazing profits will not be chargeable to tax unless the total rateable valuation of the land occupied by the farmer together with the rateable valuation of the land taken for grazing amounts to or exceeds £100&mdash;or £50 if the farmer is also carrying on another business, trade or profession. On the other hand, the rateable valuation of the land taken in grazing will be aggregated with that other farm of land occupied and in the cases where the total reaches or exceeds these limits the farmer will be liable on his profits.  Such farmer will, however, have the same right to the notional basis of assessment as a person who owns and occupies a farm of land of the same total rateable valuation.</P>
    <P>I am grateful that my opposite number is a lawyer because he will understand the reason for the court decision which led to this anomaly. Any use of the land other than grazing was regarded as occupation. Grazing was not regarded as a use but as an easement and it was not regarded as so substantial as to amount to an occupation of the land and so this strange situation arose in which agricultural profits from not dissimilar activities were treated in a different way.  We propose, as indeed the Seanad recommended last year, that that anomaly be corrected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some questions I should like to ask the Minister. First of all, assuming this section to be in force, what will be the position of the owner of the land who lets it for grazing?  From what the Minister said, I assume that the tenant of the letting can become liable to income tax provided he comes within the limits laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In what way is the income received by the owner of the land from the tenant, treated for the purposes of income tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In precisely the same way as the person who is the owner of farm land would receive a rent in respect of conacre.  Such rent is not a farming profit but is a profit arising out of the letting of a property to another.</P>
      <P>This question was raised also last year in the Seanad, when I drew attention to the fact that a person could occupy office premises in Dublin and pay tax on the profits arising out of the use of those premises, while the landlord of those premises might also have to pay tax on the rent paid by the tenant to him for the use of the offices.  There are two separate activities involved.  After all, if land is let, there are the activities of the letting of land and making a profit from the letting.  That is a profit earned by the landlord.  Then there is the profit arising out of the use or occupation of the land and that is a profit of the tenant.  These are two separate persons.  Therefore, their individual liability to tax has to be measured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But the liability to tax of the landlord in that case is quite separate and distinct from the liability under the farming taxation of profits. In other words farming, by definition, does not include the letting of land.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Minister that that type of land would be doubly taxed?  The man who takes it for conacre could have it added to his valuation for taxation purposes and the income of the person who lets it on conacre would also be taxable.  Am I to take it that that land would be doubly taxed?  I am not clear on it.  Am I to take it that if a man lets a piece of land to a tenant on conacre the valuation of that piece of land would be added to his own and, if it brings him over the valuation of £100, he pays tax?  If it brings him into the tax bracket on a valuation basis does he pay tax on the land he has taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing a man has 100 acres and he lets off 30 to another, he does not escape liability to tax.  He is the owner of £100 rateable valuation.  He would pay tax, if he is liable for it, on such profits as are generated for farm purposes out of the £70 valuation, and he pays tax, as a businessman, on whatever profit he would make out of the letting of the land, that is, the rent.  The rent and the farm profits would be treated in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>That bears out the point I was making.  That 30 acres of land let would be doubly taxed.  It would be added to one man to bring him into the tax bracket and the income from it would be taxed on the man who let it.  Therefore, those 30 acres of land are doubly taxed.  I cannot see how it could be any other way according to the explanation given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no more taxed twice than is, say, office accommodation, where the owner is taxed on the rent which he gets from the tenant and the tenant is taxed on the profit he makes through its use.  If that is double taxation, then the whole world is riddled with it.  But there are two separate incomes&mdash;one arising out of the payment that X makes to Y; Y has a profit and Y pays tax, if liable to tax, on it.  X has the use of the land, generates a profit out of that use and he pays tax on that.  The profit generated out of the use of land obviously would be greater if one was not paying tax to another.  Therefore, one pays more tax.  But if that person has to pay somebody else for the use of the land, the former's profit is depressed accordingly.  Somebody else is making the profit and pays tax on it, if liable to tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, it is.  I could not see it any other way.  If I had 75 acres I would make sure not to take another 25.  I would take 24 leaving me with 99 or I would take what would bring me up to a valuation of £99 but I would not go over that.  Then I could make whatever money I liked on it.  If I was under £100 valuation, I would not be taxable.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy arguing that it is double taxation on a shop if the owner of the shop rents it to a tenant to carry on a retail trade?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is double taxation definitely.  I am merely trying to clarify the point.  As I have said, undoubtedly it would be double taxation on the particular piece of land to which we have been referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we leave land out of it for a moment because there may be a certain emotive approach to the matter?  The principle is that one person lets his property to another and pays tax on whatever profit he makes in respect of the letting, in respect of the rent or service charge, he receives.  Somebody else pays tax only on the profit made from its use. But, before calculation of his profit, if he is on an accounts basis, he deducts from his gross profit the rent he pays to another.  Therefore, there is no question of double taxation.  It is simply a question of two different people paying different portions of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly it is. I am not sufficiently intelligent to see it any other way.  No matter how I toss it over in my brain I cannot see but that that piece of land is doubly taxed&mdash;the man who has taken it and the man who has let it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy accept this?  If the occupier of land had no rent to pay, his profits would be greater?  If the occupier of land was not paying rent on it, he would <Col N="1794" /> have a greater profit than when he is required to pay rent to another?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sole point at issue here.  If he were the sole owner and occupier of the land and was not beholden to anybody else then he would have a greater profit.  But where the profit is shared, as it were, he pays tax only on the net left to him after he pays another, and that other, if he is liable to tax, pays only on the rent he has received.  But one does not pay tax on the same sum twice; one person gets an allowance in respect of what he pays to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that, in that type of set-up, there is the danger of bringing an awful lot of people into the tax bracket who would not otherwise be included.  If a man was under the £100 valuation and took land that would bring him over the £100, he is immediately brought into the net even though his own valuation would not bring him in at all.  Now the man who let the land to him is brought in as well on the profits from the letting of that land.  That is an example of two people who could be brought into the tax bracket who would not otherwise be included in accordance with the £100 valuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 14 and 15 which follow on Financial Resolution No. 12 passed on budget day, are designed to make clear the extent of the application of the phrase &ldquo;an individual to whom section 16 applies&rdquo; which appears in two sections of the Finance Act, 1974.  Under the general scheme of taxation of farmers' profits <Col N="1796" /> contained in Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1974, it was provided that farmers occupying farm land of valuation of £100, or more, were to be charged tax on their farming profits. A farmer who or whose wife was also carrying on another trade or profession or who was a director of and controlled more than 25 per cent of the shares of a trading company and who occupied land of more than £50 valuation was to be charged tax on farming profits on an accounts basis.</P>
      <P>Neither the notional basis of assessment&mdash;section 21 of the Finance Act, 1974&mdash;nor marginal relief&mdash;section 19 &mdash;was to be available to such a farmer who was referred to in the legislation as &ldquo;an individual to whom section 16 applies&rdquo;.  The reason for this special treatment was to prevent evasion of tax which was taking place by attributing business profits to farming activities. It has been rather fancifully suggested that, under the provisions as drafted, an individual to whom section 16 applies, means only farmers who have farms of valuation between £50 and £100 and who or whose wives carry on another trade or profession and that those with farms of valuation over £100 are not covered.  It was, of course, intended&mdash;and no reasonable person could dispute it&mdash;that the provisions were to apply to all such farmers who occupied land exceeding £50 in valuation. While it can be maintained that the provisions do so apply&mdash;and I am satisfied it can be so maintained successfully&mdash;the position is being made abundantly clear by appropriate amendment, with effect from 1974-75, of sections 15 and 16 of the Finance Act, 1974.  The amendments are being made accordingly by sections 14 and 15, respectively, of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I understood the Minister to say he is satisfied that, in fact, the 1974 Act did what he wanted to do and that this section is simply designed to remove any doubts there were, but he has no doubts about it. Assuming that the 1974 Act did not do what he wanted to do, and therefore this section 15 is essential, there are people who have maintained that they are not liable to tax and have not submitted <Col N="1797" /> any accounts.  On the enactment of this section which, by subsection (2), is deemed to come into force and take effect as from 6th April last year, is it the position that such people who maintained they were not liable and did not submit accounts will now be deemed to be in breach of their responsibilities under the 1974 Act in not having submitted accounts and perhaps be liable to some penalties as a result?</P>

      <P>I understand that no case has come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners in which anybody has formally made this claim. The view is expressed in an academic environment as a possible interpretation which could be made and, quite obviously, the matter is one which is better tied up and put beyond doubt. I do not think anybody in the House could seriously dispute that what we are not doing reflects what was the intention of the Legislature last year. It is better to put this matter beyond doubt rather than to put anybody through the process of having to have the matter dealt with by the courts, that is, if anybody even thought it worthwhile to do that.  This is not the first time when, on reflection it was felt that when there was an opportunity to make the intention of the Legislature clear it should be done and that is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>I agree that the intention was clearly as indicated by the Minister.  I have no objection at all to the position being thoroughly clarified. However, I have some doubts. If the Minister is right when he says that really he has not any doubt on this at all, I have some doubt as to the wisdom of enacting this section because certainly the enactment of it suggests at the very least that there was some doubt, if not more than that, up to now.  If that is so, people with valuations of over £100 could, perhaps, argue very strongly that they were not liable last year and that subsection (2) is applying taxation to them retrospectively, a position which could produce problems.  At the very least I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that no penalties <Col N="1798" /> will be applied to any person who is beyond doubt being brought into the net by this section on the basis that he did not comply with the law last year. Subsection (2) is applying this section as from April of last year.  It is important to ensure that, although that may be so for the purpose of assessing a person's tax, and so on, no penalty for non-compliance prior to the enactment of this Bill would be sought to be exercised against any taxpayer.</P>

Nevertheless, if in curing any defect which may exist, we do so by making the section retrospective, we have an obligation to ensure that, while the intention in the Bill last year is carried out, no taxpayer will suffer a penalty by reason of the fact that we are now making clear that he was liable last year.

      <P>This section refers to section 17 of the Finance Act, 1974, which contains provisions in relation to the apportionment of the rateable valuation of farmland where it is owned or occupied by an individual jointly or in partnership with another or others.  The section did not cater for the case where a person occupied the land not in partnership with others but as a tenant in common.  The present section amends section 17 with effect from 1974-75 and provides for apportionment in cases of that kind. Let me say that the amendment with effect from last year operaters to the relief of a potential taxpayer and not to the relief of the Revenue.  Section 17 of last year's Finance Act provides that where farmland is beneficially owned by an individual or his wife jointly with another person or persons and the land is occupied by the individual or his wife in partnership with another person or persons that individual will be deemed to occupy land of rateable valuation in proportion to his share of the beneficial ownership.  Thus, if the total rateable valuation is £150 and his interest is a half share, he will be treated as occupying land with a valuation of £75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point raised in the Seanad last year by Senator Alexis FitzGerald was that if land was owned jointly or as tenants in common and both persons occupied the land, but not in partnership, the apportionment provisions would not apply.  He was, I think, right in that view and it is proposed now to get over the difficulty by inserting the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; after &ldquo;in partnership&rdquo;.  The result will be that section 17 (4) will <Col N="1800" /> now cater for cases where land is beneficially owned jointly or as tenants in common and occupied with other persons in circumstances other than in partnership&mdash;that is to say, as joint tenant or tenant in common, or in any other similar way such as in coparcenership, which is a form we do not often come across today. Coparceners are, of course, females who have an interest in land acquired by inheritance.  There are a number of other strange creatures in the law and strange legal arrangements which would not be true partnership is undersense in which partnership is understood. This will ensure that such holdings are treated for tax purposes as being divided in the same way as if they were partnership interests.</P>

      <P>Speaking from recollection, I think I raised this point on the section last year.  Perhaps I did not put it with the clarity with which Senator Alexis FitzGerald is wont to put his points and he may have made it clear to the Minister, but I recollect expressing some concern on the effect of this provision last year and the doubt that existed.  It is satisfactory that the position should now be clarified.</P>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say &mdash;I may have misheard him&mdash;that this section was in relief of the taxpayer and not of the Revenue and consequently it was intended to operate as from 6th April, 1974.  Where does that appear in the section?</P>

      <P>In page 10, to insert the following section before section 17:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;Section 20 (1) of the Finance Act, 1974, is hereby amended with effect from the 6th day of April, 1974, by the substitution of &lsquo;fifteen months&rsquo; for &lsquo;six months&rsquo; and the said section 20 (1), as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1801" /> TABLE</P>
    <P>20.  (1) Where, for the year of assessment 1974-75, a person is by virtue of section 15, chargeable to tax in respect of profits or gains from farming and would, in accordance with the provisions of section 58 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, be charged to tax under Case I of Schedule D on the full amount of the profits or gains of the year preceding that year of assessment, he may, by notice in writing given to the inspector within fifteen months after the commencement of the said year of assessment, elect to be charged to tax for that year of assessment on the full amount of the profits or gains of that year and not on the full amount of the profits or gains of the year preceding that year of assessment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section does two things.  It continues the notional basis of assessment of farming profit in the year 1975-76 and it also extends to 6th July, 1975, the period within which farmers may opt for the notional basis for 1974-75. Bearing in mind the changes made in the Bill in regard to capital allowances in relation to farm buildings which affect the position for 1974-75, I consider it only reasonable that farmers ought to have a period of some months in which to review their position for that year before deciding to go on the accounts basis or elect for the notional basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that on Committee Stage of the Finance Bill last year, which went on all night, I and my colleagues on this side of the House urged very strongly on the Minister that the right being conferred here ought to be extended and the Minister resisted that argument at considerable length and with considerable vehemence.  It is a matter of some satisfaction to us now that he has seen the light at last.  He will recall that not very long ago in another debate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach accused this side of the House of filibustering on the particular issue before the House and referred back as an example to what <Col N="1802" /> was done in the debate on Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>This particular section and some following sections contain the provisions we were trying to get the Minister then to put in, provisions he refused to accept at considerable length and very vehemently.  If there is to be any question of blame laid on one side of the House or the other with regard to delay in passing legislation, in all fairness the record of this debate on this Bill and last year's should be looked at together.  When it is seen that the Minister is now doing in this amendment what we were then urging him to do it will be appreciated that the hold-up in the passage of legislation last year was not on this side of the House.  The proposal to extend the period is certainly welcome.  It is the kind of thing that should be done. It should have been done last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are being made because we have given corresponding increases on the industrial side and I have always believed in giving a similar tax code to everybody as far as possible and avoiding giving any group special privileges unless there are some vocational reasons for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we discussed this matter the Government have consulted with the National Economic and Social Council on the question of taxation of farm income.  The council issued Report No. 2 and in the course of it it was clear there was a lack of agreement on many aspects of taxation of farm income.  Since then there were representations by farm organisations asking for an independent assessment. The Government would welcome an independent review of this matter because we are anxious to have a code that is not only fair but that is seen <Col N="1803" /> to be fair.  The National Economic and Social Council were requested by me last February to carry out a review. The review will examine the taxation of farming profits, taking account of special circumstances of farming and, in particular, the need to promote investment, efficiency and production while having due regard to the interests of the general body of taxpayers.  I accept that leaves some area of mobility and fluidity in the situation and in that atmosphere, we considered it appropriate to make this extension.</P>
    <P>The reason we were insistent last year on election being made was because of the value of concentrating the mind.  If the matter had been left to an indefinite date in the future, people would not have oriented themselves to the need to examine their affairs and assess their position. It is desirable that people make a decision but there is a natural inclination to postpone doing this.  The fact that there was a date and that many people have observed it has been beneficial to them and to the administration of the tax code.  In the light of the adjustments in this year's Finance Bill, we considered it reasonable to give this extension.  So far as the Government side are concerned, reason has prevailed at all stages in this matter.  Reasonableness is our middle name and it is reflected once again in yet another amendment to the tax code.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the amendment which I put down is out of order because it could involve a charge on the Exchequer and, therefore, it can only be moved by a member of the Government.  Nevertheless I should like to put this case on the section.  My understanding of the position is that expenditure on farm buildings after 5th April, 1974, under the 1974 Act would be entitled to benefit from an initial allowance of 20 per cent and an annual allowance of 10 per cent.  Under this Bill it is proposed to give the annual allowance of 10 per cent in respect of expenditure incurred between 6th April, 1971 and 5th April, 1974.  That applies to expenditure on farm buildings but I understand a similar allowance has applied to market gardeners for a long time.</P>
      <P>I also understand that the allowance is not given where there is expenditure on buildings used for the intensive production of livestock where the activity is not carried out as part of the trade of farming farm land.  I would urge the Minister to follow what seems to be the logical situation and to give the allowance in such a case.  There are other points on the section I wish to raise but it might be better to deal with this matter first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 18 brings within the scope of the farm buildings allowance capital expenditure incurred by farmers on or after 6th April, 1971 on the construction of farm buildings.  Annual allowances will be deemed to have been made for years prior to 1974-75.  The balance of the expenditure will qualify for the annual allowance of 10 per cent as from 1974-75.  An initial allowance of 20 per cent in respect of such expenditure incurred on or after 6th April, 1974, is also being provided so that farmers will have a total write-off of 30 per cent of such expenditure in the first relevant year of assessment and 10 per cent in each succeeding year, that is over a period of eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I understand Deputy Colley's <Col N="1805" /> suggestion, it appears a person should have similar reliefs even though he is not a farmer on the grounds that any unit of this kind is a manufacturing unit and, therefore, qualifying for relief. I know one learned judge took the view that a broiler chicken plant was more like a factory than a farm but the chickens are alive and animal production takes place in the unit.  It is not like the manufacturing of a lifeless object.  I do not think the two are quite the same or should be treated as the same, even though the end product is food.  We are told that mankind may produce food from synthetic fibres although I do not know if it would be very digestible or what would be the consequences.  At this stage it is a little early to start dealing with this kind of a situation in our tax laws.  We would need to know more about them in the light of experience. Certainly I will look at the suggestion of Deputy Colley.  At this stage I would not be prepared to give a definite &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, but neither would I exclude the possibility of making some adjustment in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister has said and perhaps I might clarify my suggestion.  In the case of buildings used for the intensive production of livestock but where the activity is not carried on as part of the trade of farming farm land, it appears under this section that the allowance being given to farmers would not extend to the section.  On the other hand, the allowance that would apply to an industry has not extended to it, nor would it be necessary to give it now.  I understand it has been given to market gardeners.  I appreciate the Minister has to look into the matter and I should be glad to hear in due course, perhaps on the next Stage, the result of his consideration.</P>

I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the reference to section 29 of the Finance Act, 1975, which is this Bill.  Is that a usual form of citation in a Bill, to refer to the Bill as an Act?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The new subsection (2A) provides that where expenditure on farm buildings and other works has been incurred between 6th April, 1971, and 5th April, 1974, an annual allowance of 10 per cent is to be deemed to have been allowed for each of the relevant years of assessment from 1970-71 to 1973-74, inclusive, and it is provided that any such allowance should not be carried forward to 1974-75 or any subsequent year.  In other words, it would be deemed that those allowances had been given and written off because at that time they were not subject to tax at all but the expenditure had already taken place.  The practical effect of this is that a farmer will be entitled to the unallowed residue of qualifying expenditure as set out in the example I will give later.  The new subsection (2B) provides that where, for any <Col N="1807" /> year of assessment an individual is chargeable to tax on a notional basis or is not chargeable to tax by virtue of section 15 (3) of the 1974 Act, that is because the rateable value of the land is less than £100, an annual allowance is deemed to have been made.  If this provision was not included the position could arise in which a farmer with land of £90 valuation in 1974 would be exempt from tax for a number of years in which he incurred capital expenditure of say, £20,000.  After five years he buys a farm of £30 valuation and becomes chargeable to tax in respect of his farming profits.  But for the present provision he could claim to set against his chargeable profits the full £20,000 capital expenditure incurred over the period when his farming profits were exempt from tax.  The present provision ensures that only a balance of such expenditure, £10,000 or less will be allowed since annual allowances of 10 per cent will be deemed to have been allowed for the appropriate earlier years.  The provision also applies where the tax charge is on a notional basis.</P>

      <P>He will still have the residue.  It is only to ensure that he cannot claim the full amount but only the residue.  He will be deemed to have received the benefit during a period when he was exempt from tax.

That was a period when the farmer was not liable to tax. <Col N="1808" /> If the Minister deems him to have received an annual allowance in those years how does he get the allowance, in fact, which the Minister is purporting to give him under this section.

Let us assume an allowable expenditure of £10,000 between 6th April, 1971, and 31st December, 1971, and that the profits for 1971 would form the basis of assessment as they would for the year 1972-73.  Total expenditure would be £10,000.  The allowances which would be deemed to have been made would be for 1972-73, £1,000, and for 1973-74, £1,000.  That would leave a balance then of £8,000 still available from 1974 onwards.  The farmer would be able to claim an annual allowance of £1,000 for 1974-75 and for the next seven years until he has exhausted his £8,000.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the section is, as the Minister says, to extend the annual allowance in respect of farm buildings so that relief is given in respect of expenditure incurred between April 6th, 1971, and April 6th, 1974.  I do not want to labour this but I do not think.  I should let it pass without making the point.  The Minister will recall that when he dealt with this matter in his budget statement he referred to the fact that farm buildings can in certain circumstances become quickly obsolescent, and used other similar phrases.  What I want to draw to his attention is that he heard that argument and those words in this House from this side in the debate on the 1974 Act.  We put forward that argument very strongly.  Again the Minister resisted it and a good deal of time was spent on it.  He is now introducing the allowance.  I think he argued quite strongly against it even in principle&mdash;making a restrospective allowance in this case&mdash;on the grounds that farmers had not been liable to tax at the time.  We pointed out to him that there were other arguments to be taken into account.  He did not listen and a good deal of time was taken up trying to convince him, without success. He and his colleagues went in and voted the other way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose we should rejoice at the conversion or repentance of one sinner. Nevertheless one cannot help pointing out the fact that a good deal of time was wasted trying to convince the Minister of the justice and merit of this case.  He did not see it then but he obviously now sees the light.  I cannot refrain from pointing out that we tried to make him see the light before.  The Bill would have been much better, and the reaction of <Col N="1811" /> farmers might have been much better had the Bill passed last year&mdash;what is now the 1974 Finance Act&mdash;been more reasonable and taken more account of the realities of the farming situation.</P>

      <P>Could we revert for a moment to what the Minister had been talking about earlier?  With regard to these types of buildings which are used for animal production and which can be said not to be directly involved in agriculture, I want to ask the Minister how pig-fattening plants would fare in that regard.  There are a great many such pig-fattening plants throughout the country.  The normal method of procedure is that supplies are obtained from small farmer-breeders throughout the country and then concentrated in the feeding house and finished in a more or less industrial way.  At the same time, although the enterprise itself may not be directly connected with agriculture, a great many small pig breeders use this as an outlet for their product, young pigs.  Could the Minister tell me how businesses like that would fare in the tax exemptions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1812" />
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If such a plant were on a farm, no matter how small the farm, and was being conducted by a farmer, then it would be treated as a farm asset and get whatever relief would be appropriate to farm buildings. The area of uncertainty about it for somebody who is not seen to be a farmer, who sets up in the manufacture of pigs&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; in quotes&mdash;is that so far that has not, under the industrial exemptions, been treated as an industrial activity.  It is in a suspended area for tax purposes for the time being. There have been some judicial examinations of this and I think it is true to say that the judicial assessment of the situation is not yet complete.  One learned judge, as I mentioned earlier, deemed the broiler operation to be an operation of manufacturing food. Perhaps there might be animal lovers who would not describe that activity in that way or, indeed, they might. All I can say at the moment is that it is an area of forensic uncertainty at present and that certainly makes it all the more difficult to treat with it in a final way in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to their lordships I would have some reservations about their competence in this area.  I urge the Minister to consider very carefully the direct link there is between concerns of this kind and small pig breeders. The Minister will probably be aware of the fact that this pig-breeding enterprise is one of the two main activities which keep our smaller farmers in business and not without difficulty under the present Administration. However, it is beyond doubt or question that in small farms generally the main activities are dairying and pig production.  For that reason every effort should be made to keep these plants viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which I would bring to the Minister's attention also.  Buildings of this kind may well be used in the future for the finishing of cattle.  In fact, the evolution of cattle husbandry at present would seem to indicate that the trend in future will be for more concentrated feeding of young stock and <Col N="1813" /> their being finished in a very short time and converted into beef, possibly in semi-industrial undertakings such as this.</P>
    <P>Again, the same implications will be involved for the small producer of store animals, whether they be store cattle or store pigs in the future.  The cattle operation is further back in evolution but, in each case, since it involves small farm producers, who probably themselves in a great many cases would not yet come within the tax net&mdash;although it is beyond doubt that they will come within the tax net in future with the march of inflation&mdash;I would ask the Minister to bear in mind the importance of these two types of projects, especially the pig-fattening projects, in their relation to small farmers' pig production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy I will certainly do so.  I also propose to draw the attention of the National Economic and Social Council to his observations in relation to pig-fattening projects because no doubt these are among some of the matters they will look at in their review of farm taxation.</P>

      <P>Chapter III, now that it has been correctly baptised, follows on Financial Resolution No. 10 passed on budget day which is designed to prevent the deferral of tax by the use of devices to circumvent the legislation introduced in 1963 and amended in 1965 which was aimed at securing the adequate taxation of income arising from all property let in the State. The broad scheme of that legislation was that rents under leases for a term not exceeding 50 years, which are known as short leases, were to be chargeable under Schedule D on the profit rent arising under the lease. With the intention of preventing the avoidance of tax by dressing up leases which were really for terms not exceeding 50 years, as ones for terms exceeding 50 years, the legislation included rules for the determination of the duration of leases.  Likewise, provisions were included aimed at preventing avoidance of tax on rental income by the device of granting leases wholly or partly in consideration of a premium.  In such cases tax was charged on the whole of or portion of the premium.  At the same time, provision was made for the spreading of the tax charge on premiums over a number of years depending upon the terms of the lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A scheme has been evolved under which payment of large amounts of tax can be deferred for many years by dressing up leases to take undue <Col N="1815" /> advantage of the provisions mentioned. The evolvers of the scheme anticipated that the Revenue Commissioners would be likely to take countervailing action and I am glad that the evolvers of the scheme will not be disappointed.  The scheme is operated by the leasing of premises from a subsidiary company to a parent company, so that a large premium becomes immediately deductible for tax purposes because the terms of the lease are such as to make it possible to terminate it on one month's notice, while the same premium because it is expressed to be payable in instalments over a period of perhaps, 40 years is chargeable to tax in the hands of the other company over a long period of years by reference to the instalments paid.</P>
    <P>What can be achieved by this device may be illustrated by an example of a subsidiary company leasing factory premises to its parent company for 49 years at a premium of £195,000 and an annual rent of £500.  The premium can be made payable in instalments and the lease made terminable at one month's notice subject to conditions. The effect of such a scheme taking advantage of the existing provisions is to secure a tax saving in the first year of £96,750.</P>
    <P>The provisions included in sections 19 to 22 of this Bill will close this loophole and will apply to leases granted after the 15th January, 1975, which was, of course, budget day, the day on which the appropriate resolution was passed.  The legislation will also prevent the carry-forward to 1975-76 and subsequent years of any &ldquo;loss&rdquo; caused by the deduction of a large premium in such cases under the previous rules.</P>
    <P>Section 19 tightens up the existing definition of premium in section 80 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, by extending it to include a payment to a person connected with the immediate or superior lessor.  It also brings in new provisions for determining the duration of leases to ensure that an artificial break clause in the lease will not cause the lease to be regarded as a short lease or an ostensibly short <Col N="1816" /> lease which is extendible to be regarded as a long lease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not, I understand, to the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners but, if there were such a scheme, it would have come under notice because it would have involved the presentation of documents in the Stamping Office, and so on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, as far as we are concerned, we fully support any effort to prevent action of this kind. There is, however, always a danger in taking action of this kind that one may go further than intended and for that reason I should like to know a little more, if I could, about the manner in which the insertions to be put into section 80 of the Income Tax Act of 1967, as set out here, differ from or change the existing provisions of section 80.  The Minister referred very briefly to what the effect was. One of the things he mentioned was not allowing an artificial break in the tenancy to change the character of the lease from being a long lease to a short lease or <i>vice versa</i>.  Could the Minister be more specific as to what the additional changes are or what provisions, if any, are being deleted from section 80?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Deputy's opening remarks, he will recall I have said on a number of occasions that if people deliberately bend the law they have no cause for complaint <Col N="1817" /> if the Legislature straightens it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>But I would not like people who are not doing it to be affected.  That is my concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, but the best thing to do, if somebody bends the law, is to straighten it so that it is beyond being bent.  If a person can fabricate leaseholds and arrange them so as to get a tax concession of, say, £100,000, in respect of the first year, this is obviously something which the Legislature never intended and the law must be strengthened to prevent that kind of thing occurring.  We have no information that it has occurred but, if it has been done, it has been done by somebody too clever by half.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) substitutes a new subsection (2) for the existing subsection (2) of section 80 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The new subsection is divided into two paragraphs, (a) and (b).  The existing subsection (2) of section 80 provides for the automatic measurement of the duration of a lease by reference to either a lessor's or a lessee's break clause.  It was designed to protect against the dressing-up of short leases as long ones, which would have resulted in the reduction or avoidance of the tax which would otherwise be due from the recipient of a premium.  It is not effective, however, to prevent long leases from being dressed up as short leases with the object of giving the payer of the premium immediate relief for the whole or the greater part of the premium without adversely affecting the recipient.  The existing subsection also provides that if any of the terms of a lease&mdash;whether relating to forfeiture or any other matter&mdash;or any other circumstances render it unlikely that the lease will continue beyond a date falling before the expiration of the term of the lease the lease is not to be treated as having been granted for a longer term than one ending on that date.  These provisions will now be replaced by those set out in the new subsection (2) being inserted by this section.</P>

I should like to be assured, in so far as I can be by the Minister at this stage, that the amendment of section 80 as proposed in this section will not operate to the detriment of those who genuinely were getting the benefit of section 80 of the 1967 Act and were intended to get such benefit.</P>

      <P>Could I direct the Minister's attention to subsection (5)? It is difficult to cite this because it is <Col N="1820" /> a section being put into another section. I am referring to what is in inverted commas in subsection (5) on page 13, lines 9 to 15 inclusive.  I would like to ask the Minister to have a look particularly at the last few words.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Where an inspector has reason to believe that a person has information relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of a lease in accordance with the preceding provisions of this section, the inspector may by notice in writing require him to give, within a time specified in the notice, such information on the matters specified in the notice as is in his possession.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to have a look at the wording of the phrase &ldquo;on the matters specified in the notice as is in his possession&rdquo;.  It seems that if it stopped at the word &ldquo;information&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the inspector may by notice in writing require him to give, within the time specified in the notice, such information&rdquo;&mdash;that would be achieving what we are trying to achieve.  There is a snag with regard to construction but when you want to say &ldquo;on the matters specified in the notice as is in his possession&rdquo; that is not necessarily related to what is referred to above&mdash;that is the &ldquo;information relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of a lease&rdquo;.  It may be said that it is by implication, but it is not specifically related and it is certainly theoretically possible that the inspector could specify in the notice that he wants information in regard to (a), (b) and (c).  Paragraphs (a) and (b) may relate to the ascertainment of the duration of the lease but (c) may not and as this is worded it seems that he is not obliged to confine his notice to that.  I think the subsection ought to make it clear that the inspector's notice seeking information must be confined in that direction and that the only obligation there is on the recipient to give information is in relation to the particular matter being dealt with in the provisions preceding this clause.  I am not asking the Minister to pronounce on it now; I am just asking him to have it looked at between now and the next Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley that the objective can extend only so far as the information is relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of a lease.  There is case law which states what are the limitations of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners in cases where information is sought.  If the Revenue Commissioners were to seek information which extended beyond what was relevant to the ascertainment of the duration of the lease under this section, the courts would uphold any refusal by a taxpayer to furnish that information. The added words may be unnecessary.</P>

      <P>If these words are necessary, they are necessary by way of limitation.  In other words, the person from whom the information is sought need not give any information other than what is specified in the notice, and if the notice did not seek full information because the inspector had not extended his inquiries far enough, that would operate to the advantage of the potential taxpayer. I will certainly have a look at this in the light of what the Deputy has said.</P>

      <P>As indicated already in relation to this scheme of tax deferral, there is an existing provision entitling the lessor in the case where the premium is paid by instalments to opt for assessment as if each instalment of the premium were payment of rent. This provision is open to abuse in the way in which I have described, where a scheme of the type mentioned is drawn up by having the instalments spread over a period of 40 or so years. <Col N="1822" /> Accordingly, the option is being withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us an indication of the kind of hardship that would be considered by the Revenue Commissioners to be undue hardship, thereby entitling the taxpayer to pay by instalments over a period not exceeding eight years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the payment of tax on the first premium was to cause hardship or a serious loss in the short period to a taxpayer, the Revenue Commissioners might be disposed to allow payment by instalments as, for instance, in respect of estate duty, which they allow to be spread over a period of eight years.  The facts of every case would have to be looked at.  The Revenue Commissioners would take everything into account, including the circumstances of the payer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to hold up the House unnecessarily&mdash;I can check this point in the Income Tax Act, 1967&mdash;but the Minister may be able to tell me more quickly.  With regard to the new subsection (6) proposed to be inserted, does the existing subsection (6) contain the provision about undue hardship and is the change otherwise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same trouble in looking for the actual section as the Deputy at the moment but I can enlighten him to this extent.  By substituting a new section for the existing section 83 (6) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, in effect it repeals the provision allowing the lessor to opt for assessment on instalments of premiums as they arise.  Instead it provides the spreading arrangement of eight years.  The absolute limit of eight years is important since to relate the instalments of tax to instalments of the premium would allow continuation in a somewhat different form of the abuse it is sought to terminate. As I mentioned earlier the estate duty law provided for a maximum period of eight years for the payment of instalments.  It is of interest that a similar period operates in Britain where they also found it necessary to introduce similar legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is the answer to my question.  The old subsection (6) does not contain any reference to undue hardship.  There is a new provision being introduced now. The question I am raising is: Does the Minister contemplate cases of undue hardship and is that why he has introduced this provision?  It is not quite clear how undue hardship would arise in this case.  The example the Minister gave was where the Revenue Commissioners felt that the person would be suffering undue hardship by paying in one year the full tax on the premium which he had received in that year.  On the face of it that would not be causing undue hardship.  One can visualise that it might happen.  However, since there is special provision made for undue hardship I wonder if that is what has been contemplated and if so in what circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly it does not cause hardship but it is as well to anticipate the possibility if not the probability that hardship could arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One further point.  I am sure there is a good reason for this but on the face of it it looks very peculiar.  I refer to the proposed new subsection (8) which reads:</P>
      <P>Where subparagraph (iii) of section 80 (2) (a) applies, the premium or an appropriate part of the premium, payable for or in connection with any lease mentioned in that subparagraph may be treated as having been required under any other lease.</P>
      <P>I am sure there is a good reason for this.  Could the Minister tell us what it is?  I refer to the provision whereby a premium required under one lease can be treated as having been required under another lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the Deputy will be aware that there are many cases where leases import the terms of another lease.  In so doing they form part of the second lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that where they import them but I do not think that was what was visualised <Col N="1825" /> here.  It &ldquo;may be treated&rdquo;, which presumably means by the Revenue Commissioners, &ldquo;as having been required under any other lease&rdquo; rather than having been imported legally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the premium payable for or in connection with any lease so it would only be payable for or in connection with that lease if it so provided, even though it might so provide that it was related to yet another lease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly what he is saying is if where one lease in effect imports another lease that is a situation one can contemplate.  I do not think that is what the subsection says.  I think in effect what it says is that the Revenue Commissioners may treat a premium that was required under lease A as having been required under lease B if they wish to do so.  I think that is what it means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes provision for dealing with premiums where more than one lease is involved and it enables a premium, ostensibly payable for one lease, to be attributed to another if it correctly belongs to that other lease.  Perhaps an example will help to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>Assuming that A grants a one-year lease of a factory to B for a premium of £10,000 at a rent of £10 and under the terms of the lease B's wife has the right to a lease of the same factory for a further period of 55 years without a premium at a rent of £10 per annum.  As B's wife is likely to exercise her right to lease the premises, the duration of the lease will be treated as a lease for 56 years and the premium regarded as payable under a lease of that duration.  Consequently no portion of the premiums will be chargeable on A and no relief in respect of the premium will be deductible in computing B's profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see that.  The thing that worries me slightly is that subsection (8) enables that to be done but it also enables a great deal more to be done.  It does not confine it in that way.  However, I will not pursue <Col N="1826" /> the matter any further.  If there are problems they will no doubt be brought to the attention of the courts if not to the Revenue Commissioners in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with appeals against determinations made by the inspector.  Subsection (2) to which this amendment applies provides that any person to whom a notice is given by the inspector may, within 21 days after the date on which <Col N="1827" /> it is given, object to the proposed determination by giving notice in writing and pursue an appeal.  This amendment is designed to say that any person whose liability to tax may be affected by such a determination can give notice.  In other words, if the inspector has not given the person notice, that should not preclude him from being able to give notice and take part in an appeal procedure.</P>
      <P>It is conceivable that an inspector might, through inadvertence or otherwise, fail to give notice to a person and if he does that should not preclude such a person from exercising his right of appeal, the right of appeal under subsection (2) which is conferred on persons to whom notice is given.  It seems that the acceptance of this amendment will ensure that a person, whether given notice or not, if his liability to tax may be affected by the determination, will be enabled to give notice and pursue his appeal in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Deputy that as a consequence of his amendment which I have just accepted it is now a statutory obligation to give notice.  It is not now a discretionary matter.  That should help to avoid the situation he has in mind.</P>
      <P>The only way a person could know of the inspector's determination would be by receipt of a notice of determination. The amendment would therefore, not be appropriate.  It is assumed the amendment arises from a concern about the possibility of an affected person not being notified, therefore being excluded from the appeal procedure.  The question is extremely unlikely to arise but if by any chance such a situation should arise care would be taken to ensure that such a person was not deprived of an opportunity to appeal in connection with his own liability.  That situation being so the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the only way a person could know that a determination was taking place was if he received a notice from the <Col N="1828" /> inspector.  I am not sure if that is correct.  Somebody could receive a notice of the inspector's determination and could inform somebody else, whose tax might be affected, either wittingly or unwittingly.  In that way a person could become aware of a determination by the inspector without having been notified by the inspector.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Minister says that his acceptance of the previous amendment does place a statutory obligation on the inspector to give notice.  Nevertheless, despite the statutory obligation, it is possible for the inspector through inadvertence or otherwise to fail to give the notice.  The Minister said that if a person is affected and has not received a notice care would be taken to see he was able to exercise his rights.  Can the Minister point out under what provision can such a person exercise his rights?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured that if a person affected by such a determination was not given the right of appeal because, for some reason or another, he had not received notice, the courts in exercising their obligation to ensure natural justice would confer that right of appeal, even if the Revenue Commissioners, contrary to the usual practice, refused it.  When one considers that any notice of determination must determine the liability of a particular person then the notice must be addressed to that person.  It is very difficult to visualise a situation in which a person affected by such notice and named in such notice would not receive notice of the determination.  If that extraordinary event were to happen and a person to be detrimentally affected such person would have a natural right of appeal. If the Revenue Commissioners did not give it of their own volition the courts would not be long about giving such a person such a right and, no doubt, charging the cost of any application against the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably true that such a person could exercise his rights on the basis of natural justice by going to the courts but I do not think we ought to compel him to go to the <Col N="1829" /> courts to exercise his rights of natural justice if we can avoid it.  I do not want to anticipate this too much but if one looks ahead at further subsections one sees that the proceedings having taken place certain determinations are made which cannot be called into question thereafter.  This is what worries me.  If a person is affected and has not received a notice I cannot see why the Minister should object to allowing such a person to give notice in writing of his intention to appeal. Is there anything lost by accepting this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Put it this way, we are not dealing here with ordinary &ldquo;Joe Soaps&rdquo; in their everyday observations, we are dealing with people who are highly sophisticated and whose capacity to conceal their existence knows no limitations.  Of course the lease would normally identify the persons paying or receiving the premiums.  There may be concealed connected persons along the line.  The named persons may be the persons who are liable to be taxed as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned.  Others may be affected because of some relationship which is not disclosed.  I do not want to build anything into the legislation which would allow a loophole to any remote person who was not immediately identifiable.  The fact that there is now, as a result of the Deputy's previous amendment, a statutory obligation on the Revenue Commissioners to give notice ensures this section cannot operate to the disadvantage of any person.  That seems to be the objective Deputy Colley has in mind. I am satisfied that the arrangement of the Act now will ensure that such people will not be disadvantaged in any way.</P>

      <P>I do not want to push this matter too far but I am at a loss to understand how people who were trying to conceal their existence from the Revenue Commissioners would benefit by being given a right of appeal if they chose to exercise it. All this would enable them to do would be to give notice so that they could participate in an appeal.  If they <Col N="1830" /> are trying to conceal their existence from the Revenue Commissioners they will not exercise that.  I do not think there is any danger of a loophole being created there, whereas looked at in reverse if such persons can claim that they may be affected and that they are not given a right of appeal this may provide the loophole the Minister is trying to avoid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last evening both sides of the House are very concerned about the problems of the voluntary schools and their financial problems.  Indeed, had this scheme been introduced with some plan for the future, we would not have run into the problems we have experienced.  Though it was a very laudable scheme at the time, it was not very well thought out. As a result, it has run into financial problems which we must face.  We cannot turn our backs on anything, particularly in the line of education, because our future is dependent on it. Since the scheme was devised the intake in schools has been very high which I consider to be successful.  We can only hope that it will continue.  When the plan was devised this was not given thought.  In Dublin the intake now in secondary schools is heartening, the religious bodies particularly have strained their resources to the limit. Indeed, it is a pity that they did not have the lobby they have now over the last couple of years.  If they had, we might not now be experiencing such problems.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that when the Government examine this problem fully, money will be forthcoming.  In my view it must be forthcoming.  When plans are being drawn up I hope they will be for the future and not just for a year.  I hope that all of the educational structures will be reviewed to make sure that these problems do not occur.  We all accept that money is a scarce commodity today.  We require money for housing, more money for health and more money for social welfare. We require money for all the services. It is important that no one sector of the community suffers as against another.  This is why it is important that the educational field must be looked after and examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> There were accusations from the other side of the House that we would be going back to the old scheme of elitism depriving the less well-off in our society of education.  If we examine the Government's record since coming into power, the one thing we cannot be accused of is not looking after the less well-off section of our community.  We are doing so to the extent that we are being subjected to the taunts of Left-wing, socialist takeovers and so on.  We do not hear them talking about it now.  In my view the Opposition need have no fear that the voluntary schools will be neglected. I am making a case that money must be forthcoming as soon as we can make it available.  I appeal to the Minister to have it structured as soon as possible to allay the fears of the educationalists, the people who are involved, the people who could be running into trouble, and ensure that parents will have no need to worry about the operation of the scheme.  We realise now&mdash;though we did not realise it when the scheme came into operation&mdash;that the whole curriculum must be widened; the general attitude towards education must be broader, which, of course, costs more. When one examines the overall cost one finds it has risen considerably.  It is our duty now to grasp the nettle and ensure that our children will not be deprived of education in any way.</P>
    <P>I spoke last evening of the whole educational system needing restructuring. Indeed, it does right from the kindergarten level to an age of eight or nine and, from there on, up to 15 or 16 years, the school-leaving age. That should be classified another sector of education.  Then there is the secondary and technological sector with, finally, the third level.  The situation obtaining at present militates against many people.  When money is being made available and when the Minister is looking at the whole aspect of financing, I would ask him to examine it in the broad spectrum, particularly at the low level where the voice of the people might not be as loud as in other areas of education, the people who are deprived, who come from deprived homes and whose parents are not interested generally whether or not they are educated. <Col N="1833" /> We have a moral obligation to ensure that every facility, amenity and aid is provided for this sector.  It will cost money but when we spend money on this type of education it will have the effect of giving people in that bracket a greater desire for higher education.</P>
    <P>It would also tend to cut down the juvenile delinquency which we have in our society as a result of children being deprived.  There is a challenge here to educationalists to meet this problem.  I believe it has not been tackled in the past because there was not the vocal lobby which there might be in other areas of education.  We cannot throw anybody to the wolves, throw anybody to one side, because they had not got a pressure group, or vocal group, or because their parents may not be interested.  It would be remiss of us if we neglected these people and did not make moneys available for secondary education. This aspect of education should also be looked at.</P>
    <P>The third level groups are well able to look after themselves and, by and large, they are getting more than their share.  If you compare the figures from the lower level with the higher level you would say there is great social inequality in our society.  Let us not have social inequality.  Let us have equality.  Let us cherish all our children equally.  In the situation which operates at the moment some are cherished more equally than others.</P>
    <P>That operates particularly at third level education where, because of their background, because they had the opportunity, they are availing of the large amounts of money which are being put into education.  At the other end of the scale because they come from socially deprived homes they are cast literally to one side without any consideration whatsoever.  If we are honest, this is another aspect of our education which we must look at.  I would urge the Minister to urge his colleagues in Government to make the moneys available.  I am aware that money is in short supply.  I am involved in a local authority housing committee.  We are looking for money and various people involved in other <Col N="1834" /> aspects of social welfare are looking for money.</P>
    <P>The time has come when we must deliver the goods to these schools which in the past have made it possible for our children to be educated at no great cost to the State.  Over the years they were taken for granted. They do a good job and they do it reasonably.  Now the costs have caught up with everybody and inflation has caught up with us all.  We have now got to face the realities of life and come out with a firm decision to say: &ldquo;Yes.  We want the moneys made available.&rdquo;  I urge the Minister to do this.  If he does we can look forward to a better educational standard in our country.  I know the Minister is conscious of the needs.  Like all Ministers, he obviously is tied to what is given to him.  He must consider the purse strings.  It is up to him now to deliver the goods and ensure that there will be no breakdown in the secondary level education which has done so much for Ireland.  We now have the obligation in this House to do something for it.</P>

      <P>Tá mé chun labhairt thar cheann na scoileanna, na bpáistí agus na dtuismitheoirí san limistéar iartharach den tír ó Thír Chonaill go Corcaí, go dtí an Roinn. Tá áthas orm go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta anseo agus iarraim air, achainím air agus impím air pé cumhacht atá aige a húsáid i dteannta leis an Aire Oideachais ar an Aire Airgeadais sa dóigh go ndéanfar leasú ar an bhfadhb uafásach atá i rí an oideachas sna meánscoileanna agus sna scoileanna a bhaineann an rún seo leo. Bhíos ag léamh na bpáipéirí agus níor shíl mé go raibh an fhadhb chomh mór san Iarthar ins na Gaeltachtaí agus ins na ceantracha cúnga go léir agus atá sí.  Má bhíonn ganntanas airgid san oideachas sa tír, seo an áit is mó a dhéanfaidh sé díobháil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is iad seo na daoine, na tuismitheoirí agus na daltaí go gcuirfidh sé isteach níos mó orthu ná in aon áit eile sa tír mar níl an mhaoin acu ansin.  Tá daoine ar choistí i mbailte in oirthear na tíre agus b'fhéidir gurab é an rud atá an tAire Oideachais ag <Col N="1835" /> dréim a dhéanamh ná é a fhágaint faoi na coistí seo, coistí paróiste, coistí scoileanna airgead a chur ar fáil d'iaroideachas bunscoile.  B'fhéidir nach é sin an rud atá i gceist aige ach sin an rud atá ag tárlú.  Tá tuismitheoirí agus daoine eile nach maith leo an scéal a bheith mar atá agus tá siad &ldquo;ag chipeáil&rdquo; isteach mar adeir siad sa Ghaeltacht, chun na scoileanna seo a choinneáil ag obair.</P>
    <P>Más é sin an rud atá ag teastáil ón Aire Oideachais níl an ceart aige. Tá sé sin ag tárlú i n-áiteacha mar adúirt an Teachta Faulkner mar Dún Dealgan ach ní féidir le muintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na gceantracha gcúnga i n-iarthar na tíre, ní féidir leo scoltacha san áit sin a choinneáil ar siúl agus a reachtáil agus dá bhrí sin beidh neamairt mór á dhéanamh in iaroideachas bunscoile sna Gaeltachtaí agus sna ceantracha seo.  Sin é an fáth go n-impím mar seo ar an mbeirt Airí agus go speisialta ar Aire na Gaeltachta mar urlabhraí don Ghaeltacht. Tá a fhios agam anois ón méid sin litreacha a fuair mé le coichís anuas go bhfuil an fhadhb seo ann agus gur gá don Rialtas, gur gá don Aire Airgeadais teacht isteach agus fóirithint ar na scoltacha seo ar fud na tíre go léir.</P>
    <P>Mar is eol go speisialta d'Aire na Gaeltachta agus don Aire Oideachais fósta agus do chách sé an rud is mó a thug cúnamh agus cabhair don Ghaeltacht an saor oideachas iarscoile agus an saor thaisteal a bhí le fáil ag na daoine ansin.  Go dtí gur chuir Fianna Fáil saor oideachas agus saor thaisteal ar fáil bhí sé costasach ar na tuismitheoirí sna ceantracha seo oideachas a sholáthar dá gclann. Ach tháinig athrú mór ar an scéal seo agus deirim leis an Aire Oideachais gur bhain siad buntáiste agus úsáid as na scéimeanna oideachais a cuireadh ar siúl sé nó le seacht mbliana anuas ach anois tá an dainséar ann. Níl ach fíor-bheagán scoileanna nó pobal-scoltacha ar siúl.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó.  Ins na scoltacha seo atá á reachtáil ag na deoisí, na sagairt, na bráithre agus na mná rialta muna mbíonn airgead ar fáil go gairid agus go leor de beidh dul <Col N="1836" /> siar agus cúlú déanta ar oideachas ins na Gaeltachtaí agus i n-iarthar na tíre.</P>
    <P>Is cuma cad iad na scéimeanna a cuireadh ar siúl agus is cuma cé hiad na tionscail a cuirtear ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht déanfaidh siad feabhas mór.  Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar an scéal.  Chuir an Páirtí Fhianna Fáil monarcha ar siúl i nGaoth Dobhair agus i n-áiteacha eile mar sin agus tá an polasaí sin á reachtáil ag Aire na Gaeltachta anois agus tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé go mór le saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta agus iarthar na tíre a fheabhsú.  Ach seo an feabhas is mó gur féidir a chur ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus mhuintir iarthar na tíre.  Muna mbeidh sé ar chumas daltaí iarscoile oideachas a fháil ins na meánscoileanna atá i gceist againn anseo ní bheidh siad ábalta postanna a ghlacadh sa Ghaeltacht nó áit ar bith eile sa tír agus cuirfidh sé cúl ar fhorbairt na Gaeilge agus forbairt an chultúir Gaelaí.</P>
    <P>Is ceist airgid í seo.  Sin príomhfhréamh na trioblóide.  Tá costaisí ag méadú i n-aghaidh an lae agus ní haon mhaith don Aire Oideachais ag rá go bhfuil an Rialtas, an Roinn Oideachais agus é féin mar Aire Oideachais ag cur £X milliún púnt ar fáil d'oideachas.  Níl ciall ar bith leis sin.  Chuir Rúnaí Párlaiminte an Aire Talmhaíochta agus Iascaigh béim air sin inné.  Dúirt sé: &ldquo;Féach, ní ceart do na hiascairí a bheith ar stailc.  Chuireamar £X milliún ar fáil.&rdquo;  Rinne an tAire Tailte é sin i rith díospóireachta inniu: &ldquo;Féach, tá £4 milliún curtha ar fáil i mbliana do cheannacht talún.&rdquo;  Ní haon mhaitheas é sin mar más fiú £4 milliún inniu, má tá sé ionann le £1 milliún chúig bhliain ó shin ní haon mhaitheas a bheith gcaint ar fhigiúirí airgid mar sin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nuair a thiocfas an tAire Oideachais chun cainte ar an rún seo go mbeidh sé ábalta a rá linn anseo sa Teach agus leis an tír go mbeidh fóirithint thábhachtach á dhéanamh aige agus ag an Rialtas ar an fhadhb seo.</P>
    <P>Is iarscoláire de chuid na mBráithre Críostúla mé féin agus tá a fhios agam go gcuirfear milleán mór ar an Aire Oideachais má ligeann sé an <Col N="1837" /> saghas oideachais atá á thabhairt ag na bráithre agus ag na mná rialta in aer.  Ní ceart é a ligint in aer agus molaim an óráid a rinne an Teachta O'Connell anseo aréir.</P>

D'aontaigh mé le gach focal dá ndúirt sé chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé le Baile Átha Cliath agus leis an gceantar i n-oirthear na tíre ach aontaim leis go bhfuil an scéal go dona anseo, go mbeidh an scéal níos measa anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath agus i n-áiteanna mar sin, ach cibé cé chomh dona agus a bhéas sé ní bheidh sé leath chomh dona agus an toradh a bhéas ar an bpolasaí faoi láthair atá ag an Aire Oideachais.  Muna dtugann sé an t-airgead, má bhíonn sé ag braith ar dhreamanna ar fud na tíre, coistí de gach saghas teacht i gcabhair ar iaroideachas bunscoile ins na ceantracha a bhfuilim a caint fúthu, má ligeann sé dó sin tárlú ní thárlóidh sé.  Na coistí a lua mé tá go leor obair le déanamh acu.  Níl an mhaoin céanna acu agus atá i n-áiteacha eile den tír. Tá siad ag braith ar an Rialtas saor oideachas a thabhairt dóibh.  Má dhruideann na scoileanna seo nó má laghdaítear ar mheán na ndaltaí ins na scoileanna beidh neamairt mhor á dhéanamh in oideachas ins na réigiúin seo.  Tá súil agam go labhróidh Aire na Gaeltachta agus go dtabharfaidh tacaíocht don chás speisialta seo ar son na ndaoine sin.  Mar tá níos mó buntáiste ná buntáiste amháin le fáil as pé airgead a chaithfear ins na contaethe a luaigh mé.  Caithfear an Ghaeilge agus an cultúr Gaelach a choinneál beo agus a mhéadú.  Caithfear an teanga a choinneáil beo agus a mhéadú agus a scaipeadh ar fud na tíre.  Caithfear slí beatha a chur ar fáil do na daoine óga ins na ceantracha seo.  Caithfear oideachas a chur ar fáil dóibh.  Caithfidh siad a bheith ábalta postanna a ghlacadh sa Ghaeltacht, postanna tecniciúla, postanna gur gá oideachas dóibh agus is gá oideachas do gach post eile faoi láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> Fuair mé litreacha ó shagairt agus ó bhraíthre ins na ceantracha sin agus níl dabht ar bith ann.  Níl méadú ann. Cuireann siad síos go beacht ar an sceal atá ann faoi láthair.  Ní féidir leis na múinteoirí na scoltacha a reachtáil.  Níl go leor scoltacha ann. Tá feabhas mór tagtha ar an scéal ach is gá in áiteacha breis scoltacha a thógáil.  Dá bhrí sin impím ar an mbeirt Airí cás a dhéanamh leis an Aire Airgeadais agus gheobhaidh siad gach cuidiú agus cabhair ón taobh seo den Teach.  Na daoine seo go bhfuilim ag trácht orthu bhain siad úsáid ón gcéad lá ar cuireadh saor thaisteal ar siúl agus ón gcéad lá ar cuireadh saor oideachas ar siúl do gach páiste ag fágáil na bunscoile. Tháinig méadú mór ar na daltaí ins na meánscoileanna agus i scoileanna na gceantracha seo.  Dá bhrí sin, tá siúl agam go ndúirt mé go leor chun a leíriú gur ceist thábhachtach í seo agus tá fóirithint ón Rialtas riachtanach. Níl ciall le rud ar bith eile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity which has been afforded to the House to discuss aspects of secondary education. May I say at the outset that to oppose this motion would be like saying that one was against virtue.  That arises from the way the motion is phrased.  As the House has already heard from the Government benches and from speakers before me, we do not oppose it.  To hear the Opposition <Col N="1839" /> speakers one would imagine that there existed just a very simple problem, that it was all of our making and that we could very readily solve it.  So much was this the case that I was not surprised to hear myself invited, in the exuberance of one contribution, to remove inflation.  I only wish I could.</P>
      <P>I can understand this sort of approach in political terms and I can deal with it, much as I regret to see the subject of education and the plight of certain schools made the object of this sort of exercise.  But there was an underlying suggestion of something worse, a suggestion that came above the surface at least twice.  This I want to dispose of immediately.  This was the suggestion of &ldquo;forcing the religious out of education&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Faulkner. Coming from Fianna Fáil this sounded like the expression of a guilt complex, subconscious perhaps but very real at that.  This Government occupy a consistent and unequivocal position in this matter.  I quote from the Taoiseach's speech of 21st February, 1974:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that in the course of the discussions which he initiated in relation to certain functions of the educational administration system, a statement was submitted by the clerical religious representatives who participated in the discussions with which the representatives of the secondary schools in the Protestant sector who considered the statement were in agreement and with which they wished to be associated.  It refers to the need for effective statutory guarantees in regard to such matters as the continued existence of church schools and equality of opportunity for the establishment of new schools, the renovation and extension of existing schools, the availability of teachers for such schools, <i>et cetera.</i> It further refers to the question of guarantees in relation to comprehensive religious instruction formation <Col N="1840" /> and worship in accordance with the rights of parents in all schools. I am in full agreement with the Minister's view that he should discuss these matters with the interests concerned and set about taking such measures as will remove any doubt of confusion in relation to them for the future.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, was no less forthright when he said:</P>
    <P>For my colleagues in Government I give this firm assurance that in pursuing our objective of ensuring the best possible return for money expended in education we will not countenance any diminution of the role which religious guardians played and continue to play in the formation of our youth.  This is a role of immense value.  A nation which claims to cherish all its children equally must ensure not merely equal outward forms of education but equal rights for the parents of such children in the selection of their children's schools.  This involves freedom for parents to choose denominational or secular education, to admit the right of one without denying the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a quotation from a speech made by the Minister for Finance to the Terenure Past Pupils' Union.  I would also like to quote from a recent speech made by my colleague who is present here tonight, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, and who may have the opportunity of speaking later.  When in Tulla, County Clare, recently he said:</P>
      <P>Religious orders have made an immense contribution to the development of post-primary education. I believe they can and must continue to play a key role in the future of Irish education and I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of the Irish people wish them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why were statements by Ministers of this Government necessary?  Precisely <Col N="1841" /> because of the sort of suggestions being made here in this debate.  Why are these suggestions being made? Because, I suggest, of the realisation of where the roots of responsibility for the present situation really lie; in the quite unrealistic arrangements made at the time of the introduction of the so-called free education scheme and in the pressures exerted, unfairly in many cases, on schools to go against their judgment in some cases, in accepting those arrangements.</P>
    <P>I know that the late Donogh O'Malley was fond of saying sometimes that &ldquo;nothing was free&rdquo;.  I remember also the pressures exerted in the terms, including the term &ldquo;Christian charity how are you&rdquo; used by him to describe those whom he knew and who knew themselves that they were being exploited but could do nothing about it.  It was fairly commonly suspected at the time, with good reason, that he did not have the full approval of his Minister for Finance, later the Taoiseach.  We all know that circuit that Taoiseach be-took himself to during the 1969 election and what reassurances he must have had to give.  The only reason I mention this now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Since before the formation of the State the Churches have laid the foundations in education and shouldered the responsibility.  We are <Col N="1842" /> now witnessing the restoration of the responsibility for education and its control to the pluralist community. The people and their representatives are being asked to take direct responsibility.  The Churches are assuming a new, low profile in education and are seeking the right and the freedom to teach Christianity as part of the comprehensive education system.  It is the task of the politician to create the framework for this new partnership between the lay and religious in education. It is the task of the religious to assist and encourage the laity to take greater responsibility, and with it increased authority.</P>
    <P>In the development of a new partnership in education between the Churches and the State, we must preserve the best traditions of the existing system while we promote the new and more exciting systems of interdenominational education, and pass on their management to the laity.  The evolution and establishment of this new partnership between the Churches and the State is one of the major challenges of our time.  It calls for a clear perception of the educational objectives by the politician and a special sensitivity for the beliefs and motivations of his constituents.</P>
    <P>Further on, while it does not have any bearing on this particular debate, he said:</P>
    <P>The denominational nature of primary education north and south of the Border should also be gradually phased out.</P>
    <P>How is that statement to be explained in the context of the appeals made by his spokesmen in this debate for the continuance of the present system and the imputation by Fianna Fáil to the Government today of a desire to get rid of it?  I do not know where the Leader of the Opposition got this message.  It is certainly not the message which is coming to me from responsible authorities with whom I have to negotiate in respect of the educational system.  It does not seem to me to be the message coming to his spokesman on education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I, perhaps, get some enlightenment from Deputy Faulkner, who spoke in such glowing terms of the Christian Brothers' school in Dundalk, terms in which I wholeheartedly concur, as to whether he can identify the &ldquo;pluralist community&rdquo; to which the Brothers are to &ldquo;restore&rdquo;, &mdash;&ldquo;restore&rdquo; mark you&mdash;the responsibility and control of that school?  If that philosophy were to be applied all round, where would I find voluntary secondary schools for whom to increase the capitation grant?  Is not this the kind of philosophy which seemed to imply the propagation of the community school as the only school for the future?  I must reiterate here, for the record and for fear of misrepresentation, that my party were never against the community school idea, where there was consent, but we were, and remain, against any idea that it should be the only type of school.  We were also aware, and I am becoming increasingly so, of the much greater relative cost of these schools and the extent to which their establishment and development eats into the resources made available for education services generally.</P>
      <P>When we were in Opposition we warned the Government of the costs to which they were committing themselves by over-expanding this sector and the expectations to which they were giving rise.  We were not listened to then and now it is being suggested that it is all our fault anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are several aspects to the major problem of the survival of the <Col N="1844" /> voluntary secondary school and the solution does not lie, in my view, in continued increases in capitation grants. May I illustrate this by referring again to the case of the Christian Brothers' school, Dundalk, which was raised by Deputy Faulkner?  By the way, when Deputy Cunningham was speaking in Irish&mdash;I hope I am not misquoting him &mdash;he said that the Minister for Education would be seriously blamed if he lets the Brothers' type of education die. I agree fully with him, but that, it seems to me, does not tally with the quotation I have just read from his leader.</P>
    <P>The school in Dundalk has increased its enrolment between 1968-69 and 1974-75 by only 73 pupils, from 336 to 409.  But its staff has increased by a total of eight teachers and in school salary terms alone this represents an outlay of £3,200 per annum by the Christian Brother community. The point I want to make, as a matter of fact, which has to be taken into account by the State, no less than by the community of religious concerned, is that an important part of the problem stems from lack of personnel in the religious community concerned. There is a limit to the extent to which this can be countered by increases in capitation grants.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make, purely again as a matter of fact, is that in the case of this school, the total staff of 14 in 1968-69 were giving teaching service to the extent of 369 hours per week, an average of 26 hours per teacher.  I stress &ldquo;average&rdquo;. In 1974-75, however, the total staff of 22 were giving teaching service to the extent of 427 hours per week, an average of 19 hours per teacher.  I am not drawing any specific conclusions from these figures.  I simply cite them as a factual background to the demands made in the course of this debate for practically unlimited increases in capitation grants to finance practically unlimited increases in new teaching posts.</P>
    <P>The problems in relation to the financing of schools which I have to face and which I am determined to solve are not of my making and they are not capable of being solved overnight <Col N="1845" /> either.  In the allocation of financial resources for the various services for the different sections of the educational system priorities have to be established in relation to expenditure within the overall allocation of funds available.  In this respect expenditure includes expenses of all kinds, whether on teachers' salaries, equipment, grants and scholarships to students as well as grants to schools, both current and capital.  In our circumstances we continue to have an annual increase in the number of pupils in our schools at all levels, unlike the situation in many other countries.</P>
    <P>A programme of development requires, accordingly, a carefully planned strategy of graduated increases in expenditure over a reasonable period of time.  The educational services may claim a share of public funds both as a long-term economic investment and because of their contribution as a social service to the welfare of the community.  It would, however, be taking an unrealistically narrow view of the role of education in the context of the social services to divorce consideration of the level of appropriate expenditure on it from that of the total resources available for the social services generally.</P>
    <P>I have stated, and indeed other members of the Government have stated on other occasions, that, having regard to the general level of the social welfare and health services at the time this Government took office, it was appropriate that a particular emphasis should have been placed on raising this level to an acceptable standard and that priority had to be given by the Government to bringing about such an improvement in standards during their first two years in office.  There would be no point in burying one's head in the sand and hoping that by ignoring present economic difficulties they would somehow pass away.  The facts of the general economic situation cannot be ignored or gainsaid merely by a policy of pretence or make belief.</P>
    <P>Before the Estimates for the Public Service for 1975 were published there were prophets of doom forecasting <Col N="1846" /> a serious cutback in the overall provision for the educational services. In the event these prophets of doom have been consoled by the fact that there has been an increase of £41 million in the provisions, as they appear in the Book of Estimates, for the relevant Votes.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Education I would, naturally, have wished that the allocation in the Votes for Education would have been greater.  I had allowed an increase in the grant in lieu of tuition fees to secondary schools as from the beginning of the school year 1974-75, the present school year.  I subsequently arranged for the substitution of £300 for the figure of £185 as the relevant limit for the determination of eligibility of boarding schools for the purpose of payment of the grant of £35 in lieu of tuition fees in respect of pupils attending.  In the circumstances I felt that in connection with the provision to be made in the Estimates for expenditure for 1975 particular attention needed to be given to the case of primary schools and my proposals for the introduction of a special capitation grant per pupil was for the purpose of putting these schools on a more reasonable financial basis and thus enable them to meet their commitments to all children, including those who might not have the opportunity of a full secondary and third level education.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that that decision was right though I felt at the time, and still feel, that the situation of the secondary schools also deserves special consideration.  It is not only in relation to current grant support that the position of the secondary schools had deteriorated in the period of office of the previous Administration.  That Administration allowed a successive annual decline in the allocation of moneys for secondary school building purposes.  In 1975 I reversed that trend by the allocation of £2,500,000 for such schools and also £2,500,000 for vocational schools.  I have arranged for a three-year schedule of building projects which, on the basis of present costs, will require an expenditure of £3.8 million in 1976 <Col N="1847" /> and £4 million in 1977 in the case of secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The position at present is that because of the neglect&mdash;if the words &ldquo;deliberate sabotage&rdquo; would be too strong I use the word neglect&mdash;by the previous Administration of these schools, this Government are faced at this time of serious general economic difficulties, affecting all countries and all sectors of our community at home, with the necessity of taking such measures as will enable the voluntary secondary schools to be put on a reasonable financial basis.  I have met representatives of the associations representing the authorities of all these schools both of the majority and the minority persuasion and I had the case which they put to me fully examined. I accept that all the schools in question are in need of assistance but there seems also to be varying degrees of need for different categories of school, apart from the inevitable degree of variations as between individual schools.</P>
    <P>These varying degrees of need for different categories of school are represented by the special circumstances affecting the schools.  There are schools in old premises which have come near the end of their useful life and need to be replaced.  There are those schools which now require permanent accommodation because of an increased influx of students over the years and, to put it at its mildest, because of the lackadaisical policy of the previous Administration of catering for the pupils in prefabricated classrooms. They are all very well in their way and desirable for a limited period provided there is a clear-cut policy for their replacement over a reasonable period.  In the case of both of these categories of school the authorities are finding it very difficult to undertake additional financial burdens for the purpose of securing the required permanent accommodation.  There is another category of school in financial difficulty.  Many of the school authorities who are repaying loans in respect of building work which they undertook in the last few years are finding it <Col N="1848" /> difficult to meet their annual repayment instalments.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to capitation grants and grants in lieu of tuition fees.  The capitation grants for secondary schools have not been increased since 1st August, 1969.  The previous Administration saw fit to make no alteration in these grants despite the understanding at the time of the introduction of the free education scheme that these schools which, for one reason or another, were unable to join the scheme, would not be discriminated against.  I consider that despite the present difficult economic situation, and having regard to the representations received from the associations representative of all the school authorities, the question of allowing an improvement in the rate of the capitation grant should be carefully examined at this time as part of the general review which is being made of the situation as a whole.  This is being done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner, speaking last night made what I thought was an interesting admission which I should like to refer to.  In relation to his attitude towards the schools in question he said that anybody who read his speeches would see that he said he was concerned about comprehensive education and where it was made available was a matter of indifference to him, whether it was made in secondary schools, vocational schools, comprehensive schools or community schools, provided the schools were large enough to provide the wide variety of courses necessary to develop the aptitudes and abilities of all the pupils.  I agree that that was the case towards the latter part of the term of the Administration of Deputy Faulkner.  I put it on the record simply that those who are interested in these matters may advert to the Deputy's statement of his position.</P>
    <P>I have placed the matter of financial support required for the voluntary secondary schools before the Government and it has been and is receiving very full and careful consideration.  I am in a position to state that additional financial assistance will be forthcoming for these schools and I shall make an announcement in relation <Col N="1849" /> to the details of such additional support in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Minister his speech has not brought satisfaction to anyone.  To speak in terms of general review still being undertaken and an announcement to be made soon will not cut a great deal of ice with the representatives of the voluntary secondary schools. Indeed, at a meeting held in Wicklow town last Monday night&mdash;Deputy Timmins will bear me out on this&mdash; the accountant of a school mentioned that they had sent six deputations to the Department.  When faced with this Fianna Fáil resolution the Minister has simply come up with verbiage but no money.  This will be no consolation to them.</P>
      <P>All the schools and the authorities concerned have now left is consideration of the various options open to them.  If we look at these options we find they are somewhat shattering. The debts are great.  I have an income and expenditure account for the year ended 30th June, 1974 for the Dominican post-primary school in Wicklow town which shows a deficit of £13,613, or £44 per pupil.  This school and the other voluntary schools must now consider the options.  They were awaiting the outcome of this debate to see if money would be forthcoming immediately. Before considering these options I should like to comment on the Minister's use of the words &ldquo;practically unlimited increases&rdquo;.  That is not what this motion seeks, it seeks adequate increases without delay.</P>
      <P>I now want to consider the options open to the schools.  Do they embark on a system of voluntary subscriptions? Do they consider total closure? Do they consider closure for part of the year, do they consider opting out of the free education scheme?  Dealing with that last option, schools would be most reluctant to opt out of this scheme.  The case would then arise where the children of the less well-off section of the community would have to leave school.  This would be a complete reversal of the aim of equality of opportunity for all children which we all desire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> There is another option whereby schools might close for part of the year which has become a very distinct possibility.  Heating and light costs are very high.  Possible closure for part of the year might help reduce these costs but it would not be in the best interests of the children and I know the communities would not relish the idea.  The third option of total closure would be even more drastic; in fact they could not carry on at all.  The schools wish to see that avoided at all costs.</P>
    <P>There is then the other option of voluntary subscriptions to try to meet the shortfall which is completely opposed to the spirit of a free education scheme.  Many would rightly consider it as the thin edge of the wedge, as being a retrograde step in education. I have not been satisfied nor do I feel the teachers, management or the parents will be satisfied with the Minister's utterances this evening.  We simply had a &ldquo;scissors and paste&rdquo; attitude but the goods were not delivered. The goods must be and should have been delivered in this forum. This is the place where moneys are made available.  Is it a case of the Minister trying for a double bite of the cherry, a certain amount of publicity now, announcements to follow very soon and perhaps the glory inherent in such announcements?  I would give the Minister the glory of such announcements were they sufficient to maintain schools which we, as parents, wish for our children and we see as an integral part of our way of life.  Management and teachers in schools being completely burdened with the strain of trying to finance these schools is a ridiculous situation. Rather they should be devoting their energies and attention to the factors involved in meeting the ever-growing demands of education.  Unfortunately, this burden is still placed on them.  I regret that the Minister could not see his way to improving these allowances.</P>

    <P>I am very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute even for a brief period to this debate.  Having dealt with the situation in relation to post-primary education in the Gaeltacht which was referred to by Deputy Cunningham, I want to avail of this opportunity to say a few words in general about the attitude of the Government and to make it quite clear and to spell out to this House the attitude of the Government to the question of the voluntary secondary schools.  The Minister for Education very kindly referred to a recent speech of mine in Tulla, County Clare, where the secondary school was celebrating the 25th anniversary of its opening. I referred to the role of the religious orders and to their contribution to the development of secondary education. I said then clearly that we in <Col N="1853" /> the Government fully appreciated the vital role which these people have played in the development of secondary education.  I further said that it was my opinion, and it is also the opinion of the Government, that the religious orders, having played a vital role in the past, have a role to play now and will have a role to play in the future.  Most important of all, I believe that the vast majority of the people of this country wish the religious orders to continue to play this role.  For that reason the Government, and the Minister for Education, fully appreciate and fully realise the difficulties which confront these schools at present.</P>
    <P>It has been implied by some Deputies opposite that this Government are in some way ambivalent in their attitude to the voluntary secondary schools and that we are reluctant to come to their support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has even been suggested that the Government do not regard education generally as an area of priority in the disbursal of public funds.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This Government are committed to the support of our educational institutions, committed to the support of the voluntary secondary schools, committed to the principle of freedom of choice for parents in the selection of schools for their children.  As long as the parents wish to send their children to voluntary secondary schools, then for so long shall this Government honour that choice by ensuring that these schools have the resources to cater for their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education has referred to the international economic difficulties which are hitting the world, and have been for some time.  We realise the impact of inflation and so forth, on our secondary schools.  I am confident, however, that despite the financial difficulties, inflation and so forth, the Government will ensure that provision is made to enable these schools to continue their excellent work.  I base this confidence first on the adequacy with which the Government <Col N="1854" /> have already dealt with the needs of our primary schools.  I believe it can also be seen in the sympathy with which the Government view the difficulties of the voluntary schools and our desire to alleviate them.  More important than that I base this confidence on the determination of the Government to come to the support of the voluntary schools and on the able manner in which the Minister for Education has articulated the special needs of these schools in the Cabinet and outside it.  I am confident that these schools will continue to play a vital role and make a major contribution to the development of education.  I am happy to be a member of a Government which recognises this and will give practical support to those people.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. I was at recent meetings in Walkinstown and Ballyfermot where I listened attentively to the problems outlined by the parents and teachers in relation to the plight of the schools.  The Minister and members of the Government have come to the wrong meeting because apparently they did not speak about the matter which is before the House at the moment.  We have an educational policy, a defence policy, a social welfare policy and a policy for all the Departments.  These Departments must be fully funded.  The educational policy must cope with an on-going problem.  It must be updated. Money must be made available to ensure up-dating and progressive development.  Demands will continue to be made on Governments to meet this ever-developing situation.  That is part of our job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the job of the Minister for Education to ensure that funds are available to meet this on-going situation. We cannot have stagnation.  The call which has gone out to the school managers and to other people responsible is: &ldquo;go back to your bank manager tomorrow and see if you can get an overdraft to enable you to continue until such time as money is <Col N="1855" /> made available&rdquo;.  The nuns and brothers are to be tax collectors.  They are to go around raising funds until the Government wake up to their responsibility.</P>
    <P>It would be inconsistent if backbench members of the Government voted against this motion here tonight. Boloney was spoken here by the Minister. If we want quotes we can go to a bookstall and get a book of quotes. We know all about the situation over the years and blaming someone is no solution to any problem.  This is a practical problem, a definite problem, and a problem which we must deal with here in the House.  Money must be found to ensure the continuity of education.  As Deputy Murphy said, there could be a reduction in teaching staffs, and a reduction in the standard of education, and schools closing for a period.  Is that what the Minister wants?  He should tell us clearly.  The Minister is acting like Santa Claus. Santa Claus will be here next Christmas and the children can be happy then.  That is no use to the people who are running the educational institutions today.  We want to ensure that the Minister will become fully aware of the situation.  Members who have spoken here and, indeed, Deputy Wilson in his presentation of the case, have clearly put the case on behalf of the unfortunate people involved.  The Minister and the Government have a responsibility.  Lip service is no use. The Minister can bring in colleagues to make contributions to the debate but that will not solve the problem. What is required is money.  Plenty of money has been found for Departments that can be described as vote-catching Departments.  We want to ensure that the weakest section is fully protected.  Education is an important Department.  The future of the children is at stake and it is up to the Government to meet their responsibility towards the weaker sections in our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very gratified with the contribution Deputy O'Connell made and to the tribute he paid to the Brothers who educated him and without whom, as he said himself, he <Col N="1856" /> would not have been able to qualify as a doctor because, as he stated, before free education existed at all, they educated him free.  This was refreshing because a major industry in this country is sharpening the tooth to bite the hand that feeds; another major industry, of course, is prating every mongrel theory that comes from elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien complained that the late Donough O'Malley launched his scheme without due preparation.  There is a tide in the affairs of men and Donough O'Malley saw that tide and took it at the flood to the advantage of the country.  I was going to ask one of the ushers to bring in a barrel for the red herrings.  Red herrings were produced all over the place.  The Minister for Education produced some. He was like a conjuror who produces rabbits out of a hat.  The Minister for the Gaeltacht produced his own quota of scadáns.  All we wanted to hear was when he was going to come across with the money.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, on record at Terenure, said he was fully behind the voluntary schools.  It is easy to picture the scene at that junketing, spectacles flashing, the Minister wafting from right to left.  When, however, we ask him for money to maintain the voluntary schools we have no message here that he will increase the capitation grants and grants in lieu of fees. That is the basic demand we are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to reject the adjective put in front of the education scheme &mdash;the so-called &ldquo;free&rdquo; education scheme.  I know in the area from which I come, where the primroses and the blackthorn are blooming now, that buses are taking children to school.  Without that scheme they would not be doing so because there was no school there to cater for children when I was being brought up.  Let there be no mistake about it, it was a worthwhile scheme and we should dedicate ourselves to maintaining it.  It is not true that this party are dedicated to one type of school in our community.  Anyone who has any experience in education will know that variety is one of the great things in education.  We are dedicated to the <Col N="1857" /> development of community schools in certain areas and we would like a little leadership on occasion from the Minister for Education in that regard.  We are not dedicated to interfering with the development of other types of schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister when talking about Dundalk referred to the fact that there were eight teachers costing £3,200 on that staff and he referred to the fall in the number of religious working in that school and indicated this caused the problem there.  In fact, it can be contended, and it can be defended, that even if there are religious there £400 <i>per capita</i> should be available to the qualified teacher working on a staff the same as the lay teachers in a particular school.  I want to pin down ths idea that education is not a social service.  I submit it is the most important social service.  I said this in my contribution last night and I reiterate it now.  It is the social service that carries the greatest burden of responsibility for the future and, if the Minister for Education allows his Cabinet to get away with under-subsidisation of education, that will lie heavily on his conscience.  He has a great responsibility both to the present and to the future.</P>
    <P>Nobody is denying that there is an element of economic crisis, but it is the duty of the Government to establish priorities.  It is the duty of the Government to establish education as a priority.  It is the duty of the Government by careful financing and careful managing of the economy to make money available above all to education.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there was a review going on and he said there would be additional money in the reasonably near future.  I should like if he would now tell the House what he means by &ldquo;the reasonably near future&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>In academic terms, the summer vacation is a bit prolonged so I am taking it that the Minister means before the end of this academic term. The Minister is on record as favouring innovation in secondary schools, as favouring the development of new ideas, new curricula and so on.  If he lets the Department of the Public Service away with imposing a ban on new posts in schools how can the schools innovate?  With what will they innovate? What about the new places? If the Department of the Public Service do not allow the schools to employ extra teachers, say, to cope with 150 new pupils, what about the capitation grants for those 150 new pupils? How is the school going to cope with this serious position?  It is a serious position facing the schools, to quote the Minister &ldquo;in the reasonably near future&rdquo;.  Make no mistake about it. Let the House be fully aware that this campaign for the increase in capitation grant and the increase in the grant in lieu of fees will go on until the schools are not getting any advance but are in a position, when you lay off inflation, that they were in in 1967.</P>

Let him get his men from Marlborough Street behind him.  Let him go to the Minister for Finance and demand the money.  We are not demanding a great deal.  In fact, my figures were £87 and £97, with a difference between junior and senior&mdash;that is taking the grant in lieu of fees and the capitation grant together.  That is precisely the amount of tax that the Minister for Finance takes from a working man who drinks two pints of Guinness per day for one year.  We are not asking a great deal. The Minister has a good case to make. He has not a lot of money to get.  I am asking him in God's name, to go and get it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned I was referring to section 21 (3) and I was about to raise the question as to whether the provision of subsection (3) is really one that we should try to enact in this House.  The section provides that where the inspector has made a determination and no objecttion has been made to that&mdash;I am paraphrasing the subsection&mdash;that determination shall not be called in <Col N="1860" /> question in any proceedings.  The question I am raising is whether in the event of proceedings in court this provision would purport to preclude the court from finding that the determination by the inspector was wrong in law.  If it would purport to do that, it would be a very bad principle to try to adopt, even if it were enforceable. If it does not purport to do that, I think some explanation for the wording of it is called for because on the face of it it would appear to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the Deputy's misgivings about the particular wording used.  The purpose of the subsection is to ensure that if a determination is made and the parties are notified of that determination, and if those parties fail to challenge the determination or object to it, they would not subsequently be in a position to prevent the determination being put into effect by challenging it thereafter.  The situation could arise, such as I was talking about earlier, where there could be some unknown interested party who might wish to challenge such a determination. Such a person could challenge the determination without prejudice to the determination being put into effect while the matter was under-consideration. However, if in the event a decision was come to which showed the determination was an invalid one and that there was a refund due to some person or persons, then the Revenue Commissioners would make that refund.  The purpose of writing it in this way is to prevent what often happened in the past. Some people have a marvellous skill in using every word and comma in financial legislation to avail of delays and difficulties.  I do not think that is right.  This will ensure that any person who is genuinely put at a disadvantage as a result of the determination which is ultimately found to be wrong can have that wrong put right but it prevents somebody using the procedures of challenge of court proceedings to delay the payment of tax which is due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would concur with the intention of the subsection and <Col N="1861" /> that apparently is, as was stated by the Minister, that persons who have been given notice of the intention of the inspector to make a determination are obliged if they wish to object to give notice of objection within 21 days and if they fail to do so they will be bound by the proceedings subject to something I have to say on a later subsection.  I think that is not an unreasonable position.</P>
      <P>However, when we come to the case of the person who may be affected and who has not been given notice, the case we adverted to on an earlier subsection, the Minister indicated the way in which that kind of case should be treated; in my view what he indicated is the correct way in which it should be treated.  But what concerns me is that the wording of subsection (3) could well prevent it being treated in that way because it seems to me to say that if the inspector makes a determination, it shall not be called in question in any proceedings.  That would appear on the face of it to bind somebody who was notified but who failed to give notice of objection or somebody who was not notified and, therefore, could not give notice of objection.  If the determination by the inspector shall not be called in question in any proceedings, that seems to me to be much wider than the intention expressed by the Minister. I think it might be advisable to limit that to the sense that it shall be binding on any person so notified who failed to object.  I think that the wording of the subsection goes further than the intention as expressed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Certainly the subsection here effectively closes the door to any machinations that people might want to engage in for delay or avoidance purposes.  If the case should arise that where some wrong was done to a person by virtue of the tightness of this subsection the Revenue Commissioners would not deprive that person of whatever right he would be entitled to in natural justice.  The courts would soon put the matter right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will look at the wording between now and the next Stage.  I would not be disposed, as I am sure the House will appreciate and will support me in this attitude, to making an amendment which would facilitate avoidance or undue delay in making payment of taxation which would be due or to opening an avenue of opportunity for a third party, at the behest of the people involved, to lodge an objection which could call the determination into question.  I am sure nobody in the House would want to have any of these avenues opened.  If any wording can be used, which would meet the objections which have been raised, I would be only too happy to introduce them as long as they have not got any undesirable consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I would like to add that it seems to me that the purpose entailed in this subsection is to bind a person who is notified of the intention to make a determination and who has not indicated objection.  I think the subsection could be worded to bind a person to those circumstances.  Whatever administrative difficulties may be involved I do not think we should contemplate trying to bind a third party, be he trying to avoid liability for tax or not.  To try to bind a third party, who has not got notice of the proceedings, seems to me to be going beyond the bounds of equity and is not something that this House should try to do.  I am not at all sure if it could be successfully enforced but lest it could be and lest anybody be put to a great deal of trouble and expense in trying to prove it, I think we ought to try to ensure now that we are not trying to bind a third party who has not been notified of the proceedings. I have no doubt at all that when the matter is examined further it will be possible to draft this subsection in a way that will achieve the objective <Col N="1863" /> of binding a person who has been given notice and has not objected to the proposals but not binding somebody who has not been given notice. That I think is what we should be trying to do.</P>

I will have a look at it in the light of what has been said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are liable for tax I suppose they will be paying interest. That is a question on a broader issue which will come up on a later amendment.  I would refer the Minister now to subsection (5); it is brief so with your indulgence I will read it:</P>
      <P>All persons to whom notices have been given under subsection (1) may take part in any proceedings under subsection (4) and in any appeal arising out of those proceedings and shall be bound by the determination made in the proceedings or on appeal, whether or not they have taken part in the proceedings, and their successors in title shall also be so bound.</P>
      <P>I take it that again the intention here is to deal only with those to whom notices have been given.  Admittedly, the point I am about to raise may be remote but the Minister will know from his experience in his legal practice that the kind of case I am about to mention can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the binding of the successors in title.  I understand why it is necessary to try to bind them but there are cases where a person who is entitled to take part in proceedings, be they determination by the inspector or the appeal, does not.  It could be for a number of reasons, including physical or mental weakness, <Col N="1864" /> or there are other circumstances one could visualise.  I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of a rewording in cases where there was a manifest injustice being done to the successor in title, so that he would not be bound.  It may not be a usual situation but neither is it unknown that such a thing can happen.  It would be worthwhile, in the interests of equity to try to ensure that in such a case the successor in title would not be so bound.  Furthermore, I would like to refer to subsection (7) which reads:</P>
    <P>An inspector may by notice in writing require any person to give, within the time specified in the notice, such information as appears to the inspector to be required for deciding whether to give a notice under subsection (1) to any person.</P>
    <P>It is a small point but I suggest that the second line should read &ldquo;within such a reasonable time as may be specified in the notice&rdquo; to give some opportunity to the taxpayer not to be put in an impossible position.  I appreciate that it would be most unusual for the inspector to put the person in an impossible position, but nevertheless such a situation can arise.  If we can cover it here I think we should do so.  I do not know if the Minister wishes to comment on what I have said so far.  I have another point to make on this section which I am trying to locate at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this to be a personal notice to the person to whom the notice is directed?  That does not appear clear from the section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a section later on where the Minister proposes to amend the existing provisions relating to notice, in general all notices under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sometimes wonder <Col N="1865" /> if we are right in this modern day and age in spelling out so much in legislation at all.  Indeed here is something which the courts would regard as being appropriate and inescapable. Successors are, of course, always bound by the same rules as apply to their predecessors.  Successors step into the shoes of their predecessors. It could be argued fairly strongly that there is no need to cite in a Bill that successors are bound by obligations which lay upon their predecessors. They step into the shoes with the same rights and obligations.  However, I understand the reason why the parliamentary draftsman considers it appropriate to use this language to ensure that the situation would not arise in which a company might pass on its interest to a related company which might then proceed to challenge the interpretation which had already been made.  It is to ensure that we do not have a situation in which you have indefinite postponement by passing on interests to successors that the section is spelled out in this way.</P>
      <P>As regards subsection (7) there is the legal principle that the executive is deemed to act in a reasonable way. If the executive were to act in an unreasonable way, if the time specified in the notice was unreasonably short, any person who was affected by such unreasonably short notice would have a very good case for obtaining from the court an order which would require longer notice.  I cannot think of any case offhand but I stand in the presence of learned senior counsel who may be able to bring some cases to mind.  There certainly have been cases where the courts have ruled that unreasonable time had been given to people both in the company law and in the tax law.  I would say that the effect of section 7 would be that if insufficient notice was given, if unreasonable notice was given, it would be open to any offended party to go to court to have the notice quashed. I suggest that might be the best way to leave it.  If we do not do it that way we have to spell out everything in the legislation.  I believe in simplistic legislation rather than trying to produce legislation which covers any and every possibility.</P>

      <P>The next point I was about to raise.  It seems that what Deputy Esmonde says is correct and that there ought to be some provision for extension of time in reasonable circumstances, a provision analagous to those contained, for instance, in the rules of court where time limits are laid down for various steps but there is provision for an extension of time where there is a reasonable ground for getting that.  The Minister is as familiar as anybody else in this House with grounds which are reasonable and which would in equity require an extension of time.  The section as a whole ought to contain such a provision relating particularly to the time limit of 21 days referred to earlier and also to the time referred to in subsection (7).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think a lot of this trouble emanates from the provisions under subsection (1).  Subsection (2) gives a person a time limit in which to do something.  The section could state that the right of the person to do something within 21 days should be spelt out clearly on the notice given under subsection (1).  A lot of people do not read the small print and that would be an ease to the taxpayer and to the general situation.  There should also be the reasonable time extension.</P>

      <P>Subject to there not being any fixed periods of time because when you have that and somebody errs on the time then the question arises as to whether or not it is reasonable to extend the time.  I have always been interested in the capacity of the House to talk about matters which may never arise.  Having regard to the fact that we do not know of any case of the avoidance practice which we are now preventing already having taken place I think in fact we are arguing about a situation which is never likely to arise.  If it does arise it will be dealt with in a reasonable manner and the House may be assured of that.  I am sure that if anybody is harshly treated he will not be long in drawing attention to his plight and suitable amending legislation can be introduced if necessary. As I have said, I think we are dealing with an unreal, unlikely and improbable situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that such a case, as the Minister said, has never arisen so far but there are four sections in this Bill devoted to it.  Therefore, the Minister must consider that the matter is of some importance. Assuming that to be true, I do not think it is sufficient to say that if such a matter arises it will be dealt with reasonably by the Revenue Commissioners. I do not think that, as the Bill is drafted, we are giving them power to deal with it in any way.  In regard to the 21 days I doubt if, under this section, the Revenue Commissioners will have power to extend the time beyond 21 days if for some reason they would in the normal way give that extension.</P>

      <Col N="1870" /> NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>Before section 24 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;24.&mdash;Corporation profits tax shall not be chargeable in respect of the period beginning on the 1st day of January, 1975, and ending on the 31st day of December, 1975.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to do what we had urged should be done before the budget and during the course of the budget debate also, that was, that in recognition of the grave difficulties in which industry and business generally finds itself, difficulties recognised by the Minister in other provisions in the Bill to which he referred earlier as costing the Exchequer £12 million, we ought, as an emergency measure, waive corporation profits tax this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister did recognise the difficulties arising for industry and business generally, difficulties which have led to considerable loss of employment and which have caused a number of firms to go into liquidation and of many others to the verge of liquidation. These difficulties are usually referred to as &ldquo;cash flow difficulties&rdquo;. In effect, what that means is that these firms simply do not have enough money to pay their way.  The reasons for that are fairly numerous but they are tied in with a high rate of inflation, the high cost of raw materials, particularly imported raw materials, some of which had to be purchased to cover a fairly long period so that there was a high stock rate at a very high cost, combined with the drop in demand which meant that not alone were there smaller or no profits to finance business, but the strain on financial resources was even greater than it would be in normal times because these extra large stocks, at very high prices, had to be held for so much longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other factors which have operated to produce this situation.  The fact that such a situation exists is not in dispute at all; it is recognised on all sides that this is so.  The only question that arises is what can be done <Col N="1871" /> about it.  The Minister may say that the provisions he has in his Bill to allow for certain relief in cases of this kind, because of inflation in the value of stock meet the situation.  I do not think they meet the situation at all.  In fact, according to the CII, the sum required last autumn was £63 million; the figure provided for the reliefs proposed by the Minister is £12 million. I do not necessarily agree with the CII figure.  But whatever validity there was in the figure of £12 million being provided by the Minister, that has gone by the board by the action of the Government, subsequently, in increasing social welfare payments and imposing on business generally a bill approximately twice the amount of the £12 million relief that the Minister was purporting to give.  While I believe there was a very strong case for waiving corporation profits tax this year&mdash; as we proposed before the budget&mdash; that case has been immeasurably strengthened as a result of the additional imposition on business arising out of the increased social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>I believe the consequences of doing that would be not alone to enable most of the firms which are in danger to survive and to maintain employment, which is gravely in danger at the moment, but would also give them an opportunity to raise the level of their activities.  This is something, as I said on an earlier section, which is vitally important to our whole economy.  If we are to get growth in our economy these firms have to be got moving.  At present most of them are simply trying to survive from day to day.  I do not say that the waiving of corporation profits tax this year would, of itself, solve all the problems.  Certainly I would not maintain that.  But I do say it is a minimum step required if we are to save most of these firms, if we are to get them moving so as to stimulate growth in our economy, if we are to retain the employment which they are giving at the moment and, hopefully, produce jobs in some of these firms to replace those where staff have been made redundant.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister will say that it will cost so much.  I do not know <Col N="1872" /> what figure he will put on it but I would roughly estimate in the region of £25 million, and ask where are we to find the money?  We are trying to patch up the budget the Minister introduced which, in our view, was wrongly conceived.  Admittedly, a patching-up job is never as satisfactory as one that is done from scratch. We did suggest, before the budget, how this whole thing might have been tackled.  The whole budget framework that we suggested was not adopted by the Minister but part of that framework we suggested is what is involved in this amendment&mdash;the waiving of corporation profits tax this year.  To try to graft that on to the budget framework produced by the Minister is far less satisfactory than if it had been done as part of the overall framework of the budget. Were it done in that way it would not have presented the same difficulties of finding the money.  Nevertheless, the matter is of such grave importance&mdash;in fact it is very close to top priority in economic management of the country's affairs at this time&mdash; despite the cost, the measure has to be contemplated because failure to do so is not alone going to have the consequences I indicated of further loss of employment, more firms going out of business and no move towards growth in our economy, but is going to create the vicious spiral whereby, as these firms go out of business and their employees are thrown on to the unemployment heap, the demands on the Exchequer will increase and the wherewithal to meet these demands will get smaller because the economy is shrinking instead of growing.</P>
    <P>Viewed from any point of view, if we are to get out of the economic difficulties in which we are today and if we are to attempt to combat inflation, we will have to get growth back into our economy.</P>
    <P>Anybody who accepts the proposition that getting growth back into our economy is a top priority will admit that one of the first steps we have to take to do that is what we are proposing in this amendment.  There is an onus on people who do not accept that to tell us how they think <Col N="1873" /> these firms are going to overcome the acknowledged difficulties in which they are.  The case which existed for this before the budget has been strengthened enormously by the fact that the Government have imposed on business generally a bill for increased social welfare approximately twice the proposed relief the Minister intends to give under this Bill.  So the position of those firms is worse after the alleged relief than it was before.  In those circumstances there is no case in logic for resisting this amendment.  I would suggest that we will almost certainly find that if the Minister is not going to accept the amendment, the case he will make will be based on inability to provide the money rather than any argument in logic that it is a bad idea or that it would not assist our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not apologise for refusing to accept an amendment because it would mean a loss of money to the Exchequer when increasing demands have been made upon the Exchequer for more and more money for a multitude of services from the education of children to the catching of fish.  The Exchequer has no source of money other than taxation or foreign borrowing and foreign borrowing has already reached its limits.  We cannot compel the rest of the world to give money to Ireland to service Irish industry and Irish comforts.  It is high time the old attitude that there was something wrong with the Minister for Finance because he said he had not got loads of old cash to hand out was abandoned.  There is nothing disgraceful, in a time when the resources of the western world have shrunk, in a Minister for Finance saying that resources are not as plentiful as they used be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the exception of Germany and Holland.  Several of them will have a decline, including Britain and the United States of America.  Let us come to Deputy Colley's amendment and see how little thought out it has been.  He has put down an amendment which would give the advantage to banks&mdash;and they are not in a loss-making situation; they have no difficulty in making profits even in these hard times&mdash;to insurance companies, to hire purchase companies, to those engaged in entertainment, to those engaged in various profitable services.</P>
      <P>All these would get the benefit of this amendment, people who do not need it, people who are flush, people who have been making considerable profits far above what can be earned currently in the manfacture and construction industry who are the people to whom very properly we have given assistance this year.  In addition to that, a number of foreign concerns here, concerns which operate in this economy and have very useful industries going here, would get the benefit of this exception as far as Irish taxation is concerned, but it would be of no assistance to them because any credit they would get under the Irish corporation tax system would be noted by their home-base in Britain or elsewhere and they would be taxed in Britain or elsewhere.  What we would forego here in Irish revenue would then operate to the benefit of the Exchequer in the home country of the corporation concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly one has to reject this amendment as one which would confer immense tax benefit on people who did not need it and on people who would not generate one new job by virtue of getting the tax concession and by virtue of the fact that the Irish Exchequer would lose while foreign Exchequers could gain.  The yield from corporation profits tax in 1975, before allowing for the stock relief of £12 million which we gave in the budget, would be £28 million.  The stock relief which we are giving in <Col N="1875" /> 1975 amounts to £12 million and £7 million in 1976, a total of £19 million. Deputy Colley suggested that we should give total relief across the board of corporation profits tax to many people who do not need it, as I say, because they are making good profits and they will not generate new jobs if they get tax relief.  Presumably he would also wish to give the relief which we have promised to unincorporated manufacturers, and vintners, and so on, who would get similar relief to that already given to companies.</P>
    <P>Again, that would not be possible except in the way in which we have done it, without involving their whole personal tax position because, in such cases, in the case of individuals, you have to take account of their total personal tax position.  I am sure the Deputy is not suggesting that these people should get total tax relief so, unless you associate tax relief for the purpose of generating liquidity in relation to stocks or for some other hard and calculable business purpose, you enter into a multitude of difficulties which would lead to unnecessary tax relief being given to people who, on receiving it, would not generate any additional employment by virtue of having it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be unfair to Deputy Colley.  I know he intended well by putting down the amendment but I am sure he will see that it would not operate to the advantage of those sectors of the economy which are in difficulties because of inflation in the value of their stocks and general problems in relation to liquidity.  It would operate instead to the advantage of the very sectors which have done best out of the present troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being very blasé in shooting down the arguments in favour of this amendment put down by Deputy Colley.  He opened specifically by saying that as Minister for Finance he felt there was no need for him to apologise for refusing to accept a loss of money to the Exchequer.  There is no getting away from the fact that there would <Col N="1876" /> appear to be a net loss to the Minister and the Exchequer arising from this amendment.  One has to accept that, but in actual fact is that the position? The case in support of this amendment is the likelihood and the possibility that by excluding this corporation profits tax during the calendar year this would enable a number of firms to increase their liquidity and to generate further jobs.</P>
      <P>The creation and maintenance of employment is the motivation behind the submission of this amendment. The Minister very conveniently picked out the particular institutions which are fair game in this respect, banks and insurance companies, to give the impression that Opposition spokesmen were trying to save the big fellow.  I have had many discussions recently with people in various sectors of employment who are fearful for their continued employment.  At present they are working on a three-day week and reduced employment.  In all cases, the firms paid corporation profits tax last year and a number of them are seeking Government aid under one heading or another at present, mainly from Fóir Teoranta.  If the Minister thinks that it is good economics to collect this money for the purpose of passing it on the ICC or to Fóir Teoranta in order that they will hand it out to keep institutions going that is a false economy.  By that I mean that it undermines the confidence in a number of those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally have not been approached with a view to getting Fóir Teoranta to assist any of the banks or insurance companies.  The Minister referred to them as multi-nationals. If we are to continue the maintenance of existing employment or generate new employment, then the companies on which we rely for this employment should not have to pay corporation profits tax this year.  It would be a great boost to the propaganda of the IDA, who are trying to attract new industries into the country, if they could say that the Government in their wisdom have decided to forego corporation profits tax this year.  I do not accept what the Minister says in regard to this amendment being intended to provide <Col N="1877" /> a relief for people who do not need it. When one endeavours to introduce a relief in any instance it is very easy to point the finger at some institution or group of institutions who would not appear to need this relief.  Even taking the example of banks, which are not a popular institution to which to give a relief, the existence of additional moneys in the coffers of the banking institutions might make it easier for the general public and the small employer to continue in business and tide them over a rough period.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the distributive trade.  The &ldquo;distributive trade&rdquo; is a very broad heading.  I doubt if anyone in that trade is making a great deal of money at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not at the retail level.  It is the supermarkets, which can take in goods at one end of the day and hand them out at the other, which would get corporation profits tax relief under the Opposition proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear we are wasting our time in trying to get a message across to a Minister who has his eyes and ears shut to the existing situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I mention the distributive trade the Minister thinks immediately in terms of supermarkets.  I know there are very few others in the retail distributive trade from whom he will collect any appreciable amount of corporation profits tax because the situation is that the people at the retail distribution level in what was traditionally known as the family business, are worried about the delay on the part of the Department of <Col N="1878" /> Social Welfare in introducing some scheme of social welfare benefits for the self-employed which was promised but on which no progress has been made so far.</P>
    <P>The difficulty is that the Minister pictures in his mind's eye in relation to this amendment and to the section as a whole a specific institution.  He says: &ldquo;I am not going to let them off the hook&rdquo;.  That is what Deputy Colley's amendment is about.  The Minister forgets that behind that picture he has of a particular individual who, as he put it, does not need the relief, there are a great many people who are giving worthwhile employment thereby enabling people to pay income tax, which I fully appreciate is required in order to keep the country going.  The point I am endeavouring to make&mdash;obviously I am not getting it across to the Minister&mdash; might be best explained by reference to statements made on a programme recently on the motor assembly industry in which I participated.  The trade unionists on that programme drew attention to the fact that an injection of £1 million from the Exchequer into that particular sector of the motor assembly industry would keep the workers in employment, enable them to pay their PAYE and help to keep the country going.  That £1 million would recoup a large amount of the money whereas because of the non-injection of that sum 900 people would go on the unemployment list and would have to receive social welfare benefits and they would then gobble up, in a non-productive way, that £1 million.  I am not suggesting that that is the ideal solution but it is an example of what I am endeavouring to illustrate as the motivation behind this amendment.</P>
    <P>There is an old maxim that a stitch in time saves nine.  We can talk about a figure of £25 million or £28 million but I believe, with the way business is going, it is one estimate which will not be exceeded in any case.  The projection of figures which would have gone to the Minister for Finance in relation to the out turn of corporation profits tax will not be underscored this year.  If the Minister maintains his <Col N="1879" /> attitude in this regard we will achieve the figure of £28 million about which he has been speaking.  On the other hand I feel that by foregoing that figure of £28 million, or more likely £20 million, he could be generating more employment and this in its own way, through the PAYE and other channels, would bring in money.  I am satisfied that if he gets £20 million, or £24 million as Deputy Colley says, when he does his sums eventually, he may find that the loss of revenue from income tax from the workers who will have been disemployed and the payment of unemployment benefit to the people who will be affected will more than exceed the amount of money he thinks he will get out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the objections I have raised have been adequately answered.  There is a huge variety of companies which are not engaged in the manufacturing and construction industries, who have handsome profits and are not in need of tax relief but who would get tax relief under these proposed amendments. There is no justification for that.  Deputy Lalor argued well saying they would hand it back but that is not the way people who make profits usually perform.  They do not suddenly become benevolent and hand back all the extra profits they have made.  It does not happen that way.</P>
      <P>Maintaining the corporation profits tax on people who are making profit without hardship, difficulty or disemployment, means the State is in a position to provide assistance for industries which are in difficulties.  We are providing this year more exceptional assistance for industry than has ever been provided before both on the capital side in making future investment and on the provision of the loans and other aids to help them over their current difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State's capacity to render such help would be diminished if it were to relieve from tax people who do not require that relief.  Do you give tax relief to people who do not need it, who are not in difficulties, who are generating considerable profits?  I do not think you do.  I do not think it <Col N="1880" /> would be right.  I would have the greatest objection on moral, economic and social grounds to giving tax relief to people who did not need it or to giving tax relief to concerns which are not Irish-based.  The consequence of giving Irish tax relief to them would be that they would lose the credit in respect of Irish corporations tax and would have to pay more tax to a foreign exchequer.</P>

      <P>It means the giving of blanket and indiscriminate relief without regard to the difficulties of concerns.  We have given relief to people in manufacturing, construction and related companies; this would include people like builders' suppliers who may have considerable stocks.  That would be one of the interests who will receive relief from our recommendation.  There are two measures which are pertinent.  First, the Confederation of Irish Industry agreed that relief under this heading should be selective and of benefit to the groups and sectors that were in trouble.  We did that.  Secondly, when we did that we were congratulated on the speed with which we had given it.  It was in the newspapers the morning after the budget.  As the Deputy will know, public comment the morning after any budget has little inclination to be generous.  The papers congratulated us the morning after the budget on the relief which we had given to business in respect of profits and liquidity.  That happens to be the remarks of those who are best in a position to judge, those people who are in the field, who have an intimate understanding of the problems.</P>

      <P>I am like anybody else and the day that I am not enthusiastic I would see a reason to worry. I am sure the Deputy would not blame me for that.  These are the realities. I would refer the Deputy to the business page of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16th January last where we were commended for the speed with which we had provided this relief and the nature of the relief given.  May I say, the commendation came from somebody who has an interest in banking circles.</P>
      <P>It was recognised by him that relief had been given to the areas that needed it and further relief would not be warranted.  If in the light of experience we find that further assistance is needed in different sectors that relief will be forthcoming.  Fóir Teoranta have given relief on an unprecedented scale to a number of firms in difficulty this year.  It may be necessary for them to give relief beyond that which had been anticipated in the budget and such relief will be given.  That is the way to do it.  You do not proceed to provide life-savers for everybody who goes for a swim in the ocean.  You have a number of life-savers available to save anybody if he is drowning and that is what we are doing.  We are providing an adequate number of life-savers and we are also providing enough money to train people to swim properly in the commercial and economic sea.  We are providing the kind of support that is necessary without engaging in the irresponsible act of giving tax relief to those who are in a very strong position indeed to bear the tax which they are being asked to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all situations there are people who do better than others.  There are some groups in business who, in times of difficulty, can make exceptional profit and we have such groups at the present time.  The amendments <Col N="1882" /> proposed by Deputy Colley would give relief to all these groups making unusual and exceptional profits by any standards, and certainly in comparison with profits at the moment.  This relief is not warranted and if given would only diminish the capacity of the State to come to the assistance of those really in need.  I accept that the amendment was tabled in good faith but I would ask the Deputies to see the pitfall into which they would have fallen had I not warned them of the dangers into which they were proposing to jump.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic case the Minister is making is that the amendment proposes to use an instrument which is a blunt instrument and is not sufficiently refined to help those who need it.  That is the basis of what he is saying.  It is very significant that he is not disputing the need for this assistance to some of those who pay corporation profits tax and what he is concentrating on are those whom he says do not need it.  Let us have a look at this situation.  Is the Minister saying that the bulk of those who pay corporation profits tax do not need relief, and are not in the difficulties which I described earlier?  I doubt if he would attempt to assert that.  In fact, he should know that the bulk of those who are liable for corporation profits tax are precisely the kind of people I have been describing.  I will develop that a little more in a moment.  I want to put it to the Minister that if this amendment is a blunt instrument and is going to give relief to those who do not need it, then to apply corporation profits tax is a very blunt instrument indeed and is going to try to collect corporation profits tax from the bulk of the taxpayers involved who do need relief.</P>
      <P>If we are dealing with two blunt instruments, the one we are proposing is far less blunt than the one the Minister is proposing to apply, which is to apply corporation profits tax to people, the bulk of whom are in dire need of assistance, assistance, which they are not getting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality of the situation is that if you are running a business and are suffering from liquidity problems and you will get some relief as a result of the budget&mdash;certain sectors will get it.  Let us assume the relief in the case of your firm amounts to £10,000.  If you find within a few weeks that added to your ordinary outgoings is an additional bill of £20,000, what is your situation then? Will you say, &ldquo;Well, yes, I am getting relief anyway.  I do not need anything under corporation profits tax.  I am getting this nice, refined, selective, relief given in the budget&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Does this bear any relation to reality?  So far as those firms are concerned their position is now worse than it was when the Minister announced the introduction of these so-called refined reliefs.  Is it not true that in the case of corporation profits tax the bulk of the people affected are those who need assistance, who have liquidity problems, people who have laid off employees or who are trying to hold on but will be forced into laying off employees if something is not done about this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has really grasped either the enormity of the problem for those who are affected by it or the extent of it.  I think this because, in the reliefs that he proposes in another section he is confining them to certain sectors, broadly speaking, industry, building, construction and there is a third sector, those <Col N="1884" /> who are engaged in related industries. They are the categories.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Lalor was speaking the Minister intervened to suggest that people in the distributive sector are not affected.  The fact is that wholesalers are at their wits end at the moment.  One of their problems, as I am sure the Minister is aware because I am sure they have been making representations to him, arises out of the payment of VAT every two months and being forced by the present economic climate to extend credit for three, six and more months.  The situation has got much worse as regards the period of credit that now has to be given as compared with what it was a few years ago.  It is a reflection of the economic difficulty.  These people are, therefore, in a far worse liquidity position than they ever were before and some of them are in an acute situation.</P>
    <P>There are a number of people at the retail level who are in grave difficulties for the same reason.  The whole downturn in the economy is causing this.  It is displaying a failure to grasp the extent of the problem for the Minister to suggest that the sectors really concerned are those mentioned in the sections later on in the Bill where it is proposed to give some relief.  The extent of the problem, I suspect, is not realised by the Minister. It extends throughout the whole economy.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of what the Minister said that disturbs me.  When he talked about banks, insurance companies and others he was, as Deputy Lalor said, being selective in trying to pick out the big people and suggesting we were trying to get relief for them.  There is more to it than that. I strongly suspect that the Minister has not realised the contribution which the service sector of our economy make to employment and to growth in the economy.  It is very important that this should be understood.</P>
    <P>Industry and manufacturing is very important but make no mistake about it the service sector is vitally important. If that is in difficulties that is reflected immediately in unemployment, in the contribution made to the Exchequer from taxes and in the overall <Col N="1885" /> absence of growth in our economy. It is important that it should be understood and it is vitally important that it should be understood by the Minister first, that the parts of the economy affected by liquidity crises are a major portion of our whole economy, spread throughout the whole spectrum and, secondly, that in many cases the problem is absolutely acute and the people are at their wits end to know how they can deal with this.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I did not think that this amendment would solve all the problem.  The problem is far worse than that.  It could not be solved just by this step.  I believe, however, that this step would make a very considerable contribution towards solving it.  The Minister has referred to the kinds of business which would not need relief.  I accept that and I recognised it when I put down the amendment but I also recognised that the collection of corporation profits tax this year would do far more harm than would be done by giving relief to a small part of the body involved who do not need such assistance.</P>
    <P>In so far as there is any validity in the case made by the Minister the reverse side of that argument operates against the Minister far more strongly than it operates against this amendment. The consequences of doing this and the consequences of not doing what we are proposing are worth considering a little more.  If we do not apply this amendment the Minister can be as sure as he is sitting over there that more people will be thrown out of work.  I cannot put a figure on it but there will be a substantial number more thrown out of work.  A substantial number of businesses that are basically viable will be closed down and will never open up again.</P>
    <P>This is an emergency situation and it requires emergency measures.  I do not pretend that waiving corporation profits tax is the kind of thing that one could contemplate in a normal situation but we are not in a normal situation. We are in an emergency such as we have not experienced in this country certainly since the last Coalition were in office.  It is a real emergency situation with 103,000 unemployed. <Col N="1886" /> The Minister has referred to a growth rate of 1½ per cent, but we will not see it unfortunately and to the extent that we will see any real growth in the economy this year it will largely come from recovery in agricultural exports.  In the rest of our economy the situation is not heartening.  It is anything but heartening and it is getting worse.  That is why in this emergency situation emergency measures are needed.  It is not sufficient to say if you do this some sectors that do not need relief will get it.  By all means, if the Minister can devise a method that will prevent such people getting it, but will give the relief to the bulk of corporation profits taxpayers who need it, we will go along 100 per cent with that. The Minister should not try to tell us that his proposals further on in the Bill are doing this.  They are not.  They are too restrictive.</P>
    <P>The real shot in the arm that is needed is the waiving of corporation profits tax.  The Minister should not think small in this matter.  If he cannot devise and if we cannot devise a more refined instrument for doing this is he going to throw away the benefit of it and the shot in the arm for the economy and the effect it can have on employment?  Is he going to throw it away rather than allow some people to benefit who should not benefit?</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot afford to be niggling.  He has to take the broad view of the economy and get it moving. This is what is wrong.  We are not doing anything to get our economy moving.  We are tinkering with the situation and saying that this group or that group might get benefit when they are not entitled to it when the whole sector involved is at its wits end.  We have to devise emergency measures to get the economy going.  This amendment will not perform a miracle.  We would not claim anything like that but it is the kind of action that is needed and the kind of action the Minister should be taking. I urge the Minister to realise the extent and acuteness of the problem, the grave urgency and necessity for emergency action&mdash;not tinkering and <Col N="1887" /> holding back because some small groups would gain when they should not.  That is not what we can measure now.  What we have to measure is can we get this economy going; can we get these firms on their feet again creating employment.  That is what we have to measure it against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the people who complimented him last September and December on the action he had taken but a number of firms have gone out of business since that period and unemployment figures have risen from around 77,000 in September to 103,000 today.  He should not be complimenting himself; he should be taking action to get firms going.  An acceptance of this amendment is one way he would be helping the firms to have the liquid resources to keep going.  Firms who go to Fóir Teoranta are being told they have no money to help them.</P>
      <P>We heard at Question Time today about a firm they were trying to rescue in Offaly.  That firm had been to all the financial houses to try to keep going.  Deputy Colley is to be complimented for bringing in an amendment like this to help firms in need.  It will give them the resources to try to keep going.  They cannot increase production because of the amount of money that is required. Any increase demands a big amount of capital and in most cases this is borrowed capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he was giving relief under section 33 where they have not to pay tax on increased stocks for two years but he is still asking for the money.  In many cases firms could be showing a good profit but it would be on stocks.  When there is inflation at 25 per cent the normal stocks of a firm of about £100,000 have gone up £25,000 in the past year. That is a good margin of profit; it is the same amount of material that is there but the value is £25,000 extra. It is the same with a farmer who still has the same number of cattle on his land but their value is much higher at the end of the year.  It looks grand on paper that he is worth a lot more and made a great profit but in terms <Col N="1888" /> of real profit it amounts to very little. He will need money to keep this extra value of stock going.  Firms are finding it hard to get this extra money. We should be giving them a shot in the arm, encouragement and confidence. We should indicate to them that the Government do not want to tax everybody out of existence. A Government needs money to keep going but we must ensure that industries and businesses have sufficient money.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that some businessess and industries would be making colossal profits and they would be getting away with murder. The civil service should be able to devise some way that the wealthy firms that are making big profits would pay the corporation profits tax at a certain level.  He should make sure that the business is viable and that there is no great risk in taking this corporation profits tax.  I am sure the Revenue Commissioners would be able to devise some amendment that would do that.  The bulk of our industries need encouragement, incentive and help to keep going.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has a heart when he sees the unemployment figure rising.  He may say it is static but it is at 103,000.  Every day more industries close down, and businesses are in difficulties.  In every publication of <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> two pages are devoted to firms going into voluntary liquidation or ordinary liquidation. In the <i>Evening Herald</i> this evening I read that 200 assembly workers would lose their jobs.  This is common. This amendment would help industries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley has put forward a very genuine amendment that would do something for the economy, for those firms and give them the encouragement to try to keep going, bringing down the present unemployment figures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps this discussion which has now become wideranged might be more appropriate to section 31 where we provide the relief announced in the budget to concerns in difficulty, relief which would apply <Col N="1889" /> to Irish resident companies engaged wholly or mainly in manufacturing, construction or farming, or in the sale of machinery and plant, or goods to persons, companies or individuals for use by those persons for the purpose of trading activities falling wholly or mainly in these sectors of manufacturing, construction or farming.  Those are the areas that require relief.  It is instant relief, relief that became available to companies in January of this year and they have already taken it up.  The amendment here would not provide relief for anybody until 1976.</P>
      <P>We have had a lurid picture of collapses from the other side of the House attributed to lack of tax concessions in 1975.  A tax concession is useful only to a person who has made a profit and is liable to tax.  It is no use in a loss-making situation.  What is of use to companies in a loss-making situation, about to be in a loss-making situation or which would be in a loss situation because of tax liability, is the kind of help that we gave on the 1st of January of this year and applicable to people who have to pay corporation profits tax during this year.  The amendment here would apply to companies from 1975 onwards.  That is of no use.</P>

We see no virtue in giving help where it is not needed, to companies that are making profits.  Their accounts are available for anybody to read.  Many of them are public companies, the kind of companies that Fianna Fáil would like us to assist.  They have announced their profits; their full accounts are known.  What is the use of giving relief to those companies that are making profits?</P>

      <P>The kind of situation <Col N="1890" /> mentioned by Deputy Crinion&mdash;I do not want to mention the name of any firm or identify its locality&mdash;is the kind of situation which requires a cash injection.  That means the Exchequer requires money to put a cash injection into companies which have not made a profit but have made losses.  Let us look at this in a business like way rather than from the point of view of making political speeches which have little association with reality.  We have given relief where relief is needed in the sectors where difficulties arose because of liquidity problems.  We are not giving the relief where the relief is not needed because, were we to do so, foreign exchequers would benefit, companies that are making handsome profits in no difficulty would benefit and the Exchequer would have so much less to provide cash for the companies that are in difficulties. There are companies in difficulty because of the depressed world climate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in our pretending here that we can take dramatic action to roll back the tide of world recession. In so far as we are members of the European Economic Community we have been pressing vigorously for reflationary action on the part of our European partners who are in a position to take it.  As president of the Finance Council of Ministers I will be going to the United States of America shortly on a similar mission to encourage reflationary action and from there to other countries to encourage those who are in a surplus or healthy situation to take reflationary action.  All of that may seem rather remote from a factory in the middle of the provinces that is meeting difficulties because it is unable now to engage in exports or to find a sufficient market at home but it is a lot more useful than giving away tax concessions to Irish companies that are in a generous profit-making situation, not affected by the world trend or giving tax concessions to British or American-resident companies which will be of no assistance to them because whatever credit they got at the expense of the Irish Exchequer would be taken away from them by the Exchequer of their home <Col N="1891" /> country.  The reality of the situation, whatever may have been the intention of the Opposition, is that their amendment is of no assistance to the areas that need it.  It would provide assistance in the areas that do not need it and it would provide it in 1976, by which time the world will be on an up-swing of economic growth and they will be less in need of it then than they are today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To recapitulate, the bulk of the firms affected by this are firms that are in difficulty.  The Minister has not denied that.  He has tried to dwell on those which are not in difficulty but he knows these are a small minority.  The relief he proposes in another part of the Bill is too little, is too restrictive and the Government have taken it all away again by imposing approximately twice the proposed reliefs in the form of increased social welfare payments. The requirements of an injection, and, indeed, an injection not just of cash but of confidence is the major requirement of our economy today. The Minister in what he has just said illustrated one of the major problems with which we are faced, with him and his colleagues in Government, that when faced with the real difficulties of a situation they tend to depend on international action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>International action is, of course, important and will affect us very considerably but there is action open to the Minister and to the Government within the bounds of this country and one of the actions open is provided in this amendment.  He will not take it. He is now going to wait to see what the EEC and other people will do to get him out of the difficulties.  That <Col N="1892" /> is not good enough.  He has a responsibility, as the Minister charged with the economic management of this country, to take action himself where it is open to him.  He is abdicating that responsibility.  The point he is making about benefit accruing only next year is, of course, a technical point.  He knows very well that we would not be in order in putting down an amendment applying earlier than this because it could involve repayments. But it is quite open to the Minister to do that and we would fully support him if he wanted to do it.  He has made it clear he does not want to do it.  If that is the way it is we will not waste the time of the House any further on it.  It is important that it should be noted that when the Minister has a chance to benefit so many firms, the bulk of which are liable to corporation profits tax, he does not take it.  He purports to benefit some of them in a restricted way under another section and then he takes the good away by imposing higher social welfare charges.  He is talking about realities.  The realities of the situation are, for any firm in difficulties, their position now and after they get these alleged reliefs is going to be considerably worse than it was before the budget.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to enable notices and other documents relating to income taxation to be served on a company by leaving them at its registered office or place of business.  It also makes specific provision for the service of such documents by post.  The reason for this is that often the registered office is the part with which the company has least connection.  Sometimes notices are served there and it is considered desirable that notices should be served at the place of business.</P>

      <P>Notices issued by the Revenue Commissioners do not necessarily have to be sent by registered post but assessments are, as a matter of practice, issued by registered post. The registered office here is the registered office of a company which is on record in the Companies Office and quite often it can be the office of the solicitors or accountants who were originally associated with a company and I am sorry to say they are not always changed as frequently as people might change their accountants or solicitors.  Sometimes the notices are received at the offices and are not sent on to the company as expeditiously as they might be.</P>

      <P>I would not like to reflect on the post office, but the fact that something is sent by registered post does not necessarily mean that it is delivered either.  I agree there may <Col N="1896" /> be some record of a document being initialled and received, but on the present system the mere fact that a document would be received at a registered office of a company might not in practice mean that the document would come to the notice of, say, the secretary of the company, who might be far removed from the professional office listed as being the registered office.  What we are doing here will be of more practical assistance than operating the old system. The only case where registered post is used is where there is reason to doubt that the document may be received.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what this amendment does and in what way does it change the situation.  As a Deputy in a rural area I often come across the situation of a self-employed farmer or somebody who has never paid income tax, the character that very often the Minister for Finance is endeavouring to get after.  Basically he will not pay any income tax because he never feels he has made enough money to make any return.  Never having paid income tax, the situation is that when he gets an assessment from he ignores it and eventually he gets the sheriff's notice.  At that stage he gets alarmed and goes to the local Deputy, who is not an accountant and the Deputy looks into the matter, which involves writing to the sheriff and then taking it up with the inspector of taxes. People move around more freely in a city and it may be more difficult to trace them.  If a person neglects his business and if it deteriorates he has the option of appealing and substantiating the fact that he is not liable for the £100 income tax which has been demanded.  Subsection (2) (a) states that any notice, form or other document may be delivered to the person or left at the person's usual or last known place of abode or place of business.  The explanatory memorandum says that section 25 amends the provision relating to the service of notice and other documents relating to income taxation.  I would like the Minister to tell me in what way does this change.</P>

      <P>At present the notices served on a person may only be served at his last known abode.  A notice may be served at the person's abode or place of business.  If the Revenue Commissioners have any reason to be worried that a person is at either or both addresses they would take precautions to serve it at both. Many people dislike receiving notifications from the Revenue Commissioners at home and they prefer to receive them at their place of business. A company only receives notices at its registered office, the office which is recorded as the company's official office.  Even though the company may have a huge plant and office in some well-known street hitherto the Revenue Commissioners could not serve a notice at the offices where the company carried out their work.  In future they may do it there or at the officially registered office.  It extends the places at which notices may be served, and to the extent that it is in the taxpayer's interest that he should be notified what the Revenue Commissioners intend to do, this should operate for the benefit of the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>If the Revenue Commissioners have constant correspondence at a particular address that would remain the address but if they have not frequent correspondence or do not get an answer from one address then they serve the notice at the other.  If the person had been communicating with the Revenue Commissioners from his place of business and the Revenue Commissioners were not getting a reply from there, they could then send it to the home address. It is a matter which is best left to the Revenue Commissioners who, like anybody else in the ordinary course of correspondence, want to reach the person at the other end, and they will deal with this in a pragmatic fashion.</P>

      <P>Following Deputy Lalor's remarks about where people do not reply to communications and the sheriff comes along, I wonder if it would be possible to have some stereotype letter attached to indicate that a person had not replied to the previous communication.  If a reply is not received the next procedure is the sheriff.  This applies in particular to people who are new to an area. Deputies have experience of constituents coming to them who are worried that they may get a notice from the sheriff.  This is because they have not replied to any communication.  It would be a help to put a slip into the letters being sent to people who have not replied to the previous demand. It could save the Minister and those people a good deal of worry.  When it goes to the sheriff it is quite difficult to get an agreement.  In a number of cases they would require the money to be paid and after that an agreement would have to be made with the Revenue Commissioners as to the correct amount of tax.  Then there would be a refund.  This can prove difficult, particularly in the self-employed category, where only the normal rates of pay obtain.  I know of a family of 13 children whose father was self-employed and we can imagine how he felt when he heard the sheriff was coming.  That is why I am dwelling on this point.  A person could see from the file if there was a reply to the last demand.</P>

Notifications as regards appeals are not sent out by registered post.  Quite often in many business houses a lot of post is mislaid.

      <P>I think by the time the sheriff calls the average person is perfectly well aware of what is involved.

      <P>Could I, first of all, support the suggestion made by Deputy Crinion for examination by the Revenue Commissioners.  I know that the returns when the case actually goes to the sheriff may not be as satisfactory as would be desired.  I think Deputy Crinion has touched on a very interesting psychological point when he says that a defaulting taxpayer when warned that the next move is the sheriff will think about his position before the neighbours.  This will operate very effectively in the interests of the Revenue Commissioners.  If it has reached the stage of the sheriff going in he has not all that much to lose.</P>
      <P>Further to the point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick, I was going to ask the Minister what is the practice where notices are served by ordinary post and the matter proceeds on that basis?  In the case in which the taxpayer contends that he did not receive the notice, what is the practice in such case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that the addressee has received the document.  However, if he is in a position to establish that he has not received it then, if the matter has reached court stage, it is up to the court to decide whether he had or not.  In the ordinary course of events, as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, if they are satisfied that the notice has not been received they will treat it as a case in which that factor has happened.  Such claims are very rare indeed.  We know in the ordinary course of business that letters are issued and receipt is a very important matter.  Sometimes if receipt cannot be proved quite substantial loss can ensue or gain may fall to somebody else.  The position is no <Col N="1901" /> different in tax law.  It is no different to the ordinary laws of posting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points I want to raise.  I am not quite sure that it is correct to state that there is a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that the letter was recived.  I am looking at section 542 of the 1967 Act which says in subsection (v):</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> evidence of any notice given under this Act by the Revenue Commissioners or an Inspector or other Officer of the Revenue Commissioners may be given in any proceedings by production of a document purporting to be a copy of the notice.</P>
      <P>I think that means evidence of the notice itself, not evidence of its service. That is why I raised the question as to what happens in practice.  However, the Minister says that such cases do not normally arise, but I would remind him that in the ordinary course of business, it is true as he says that letters can go astray but most people, if the letter is important and substantial business depends on its delivery, will make certain to be in a position to prove delivery of the letter, either by registered post or by hand, with somebody prepared to swear to that. However, if it is not a problem that arises I do not want to raise too much fuss about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister might elaborate a little more on the reply he gave to Deputy Lalor as to what new provision is being provided.  On the perusal of the new provision compared with the old it seems to me that the former relates to service on companies.  There is no specific reference to companies in the two subsections proposed to be deleted in the 1967 Act.  There is a reference to regulations by the Revenue Commissioners which may cover companies.  Under the 1967 Act, an individual may be served by a <Col N="1902" /> notice, either delivered to him or left at his usual or last known place of abode:</P>
    <P>Provided that any notice or other document to be given, served, sent or delivered to or on an employed person may be served by post at his place of employment.</P>
    <P>That does not appear to be a new provision. The new part appears to be the part relating to companies.  I wonder could the Minister elaborate a little more on what the difference is between the two?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>This section is a result of Financial Resolution No. 11, passed on budget day.  It amends section 9 of the Finance Act, 1968, so as to ensure that in cases where it is necessary to serve formal notices of estimates of PAYE tax due from an employer at the end of an income tax year interest will become payable with effect from nine days after the end of the year in question.  This is achieved by treating the amount found to be underpaid as if it were tax due for the final month of the year, that is, the month ending on 5th April.  The new provision applies to notices issued after 15th January, 1975, which was budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of notices relating to underpayments for the current income tax year, these will not issue until after 14th April, 1975, the date by <Col N="1904" /> which the return for the final month of the year is required.  The provision applies only to PAYE underpayments, which are the subject of a formal notice under section 9 of the Finance Act, 1968.  In a case where an underpayment is ascertained and agreed in the normal course without recourse to the section, interest is payable with effect from the end of the respective months to which the underpayment relates.  The effect of the new section would be to bring those cases which are the subject of formal estimates more closely in line with the normal treatment so far as the payment of interest is concerned.</P>

      <P>In the ordinary way PAYE payments have to be forwarded by an employer within nine days of the end of the month in which the deduction is made.  These deductions are not the employer's money; it is the employees' tax liability which the employer withholds and he is then under an obligation to forward the money to the Revenue Commissioners.  It is not an intricate process.  In normal cases an employer will have a weekly record of payments made and of tax deducted.  At the end of the month it is merely a matter of the addition of the amount of tax deducted, filling it in on a free cheque book which is issued by <Col N="1905" /> the Revenue Commissioners to the employers and forwarding the amount. Nine days is an adequate period and I do not think this is an undue imposition.</P>

      <P>Like many sections of this Finance Bill, it is difficult to understand.  The explanatory memorandum says this section provides that where notice is served on an employer after 15th January, 1975 specifying the amount of PAYE tax which is estimated to have been unpaid in respect of an income tax year, interest on the unpaid amount will run from the last income tax month of that year.  I should like to know whether it can be said in relation to this section that it has retrospective effect.  If not, does it mean that it becomes applicable only from this month, because this is the first tax month after the last tax month of the income tax year?  How does this relate to notice served after 15th January?  As I see it, it is interest on unpaid amounts from the last income tax month of that year.  I assume, when we talk of &ldquo;that year&rdquo; we mean the year of assessment, the tax year, which is the last month of the tax year&mdash;March.  I cannot understand this reference to notices served on 15th January, unless it is for retrospective purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be tax due in respect of the year 1973-74.  If the notice was sent out after 15th January, 1975, in respect of PAYE tax which was overdue from that period then the interest would run from nine days after the end of the 1973-74 year.  But if the notice had gone out before the 15th January, 1975, then this provision would not apply.  Perhaps I should explain further what the 1968 Finance Act provides. Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1968, provides for the serving on employers of notice in respect of amounts of PAYE tax due from them when it is estimated they failed to pay for a particular income tax year whatever was the appropirate tax.  It also makes provision for an appeal against such estimates. Section 9 of the Finance Act, <Col N="1906" /> 1968, applies to tax recoverable under such estimates, the interest provisions contained in section 129 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, but provides that such interest will apply only with effect from the end of the income tax month during which the period of 14 days after the service of the relevant notice expires or, if an appeal is lodged, from the end of the income tax month in which the period of 14 days after the termination of the appeal expires.  Section 26 of the present Bill provides that, regardless of when a notice issues, or whether an appeal is lodged, interest will apply as if the tax, found to be underpaid for any income tax year, was tax due for the final month of that year.  It is a reasonable provision because, unless we make this, it means that a person can withhold PAYE tax for prolonged periods and get exemption from interest until such time as notice is served.  If a person withholds PAYE, I think the person knowingly does so. The purpose of this section is to encourage people, who have PAYE tax which is not belonging to them, to pay over the tax and to pay it over rapidly or, if they fail to do so, run the risk of having to pay interest on it.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that if a notice under this section was served on, say 16th January this year in relation to 1973-74 or an earlier year, say <Col N="1907" /> even 1972-73&mdash;I am sure there is plenty of tax still due from 1972-73&mdash; the interest on it at this penal rate which it is proposed in a later section to impose on arrears, would become payable from April of 1973 up to the present time.  Indeed, potentially, there might be people who for one reason or another owe tax back to 1969 or thereabouts.  There is nothing to stop them now being asked for six years' arrears of interest at 18 per cent per annum which appears now to be the going rate in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners even though nobody else in the world is able to get that kind of interest.  A person could be asked to pay six years' interest at 18 per cent per annum.  In my calculations that would amount to more than the original tax itself.  As a matter of principle, is that not wrong?  There is nothing here which appears to limit how far back the Revenue Commissioners can go.</P>

      <Col N="1911" /> The net effect of this amendment is to insert in section 28 references to sections 20 (2) and 50 (2) of the Finance Act, 1971, which should have been included.  Section 20 of the Finance Act, 1971, imposes an interest charge in back duty cases where there has been fraud or neglect in the case of income tax and surtax.  Section 50 imposes a similar charge in the case of corporation profits tax.  The rate of interest specified in sections 20 and 50 is 0.75 per cent.  This should, of course, now be raised to 1.5 per cent in conformity with the increases made under section 28 in the other rates.  The amendment provides for this by including references to sections 20 and 50 in section 28 of the Bill.

      <P>This amendment is designed to fix the rate of interest chargeable by the Revenue Commissioners on unpaid tax at, in effect, 12 per cent per annum, as against the 18 per cent per annum proposed by the Minister.  If I may just briefly refer to another amendment I put down to this section, the total effect would be to provide that all tax which is liable to interest would be liable to interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum but that would be the rate payable by the taxpayer on unpaid tax and that would be the rate payable by the Revenue Commissioners on over-paid tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry.  I understand this is out of order because it might impose a charge on the Exchequer.  However, the point involved in that amendment will, in any event, be argued on the section.  On the question of the rate of interest which should be chargeable on a tax, I do not think that the Minister can avoid the charge of attempting to be extortionate and usurious in trying to charge 18 per cent per annum interest since there is, in particular, a downward move in interest rates.  I do not accept that interest chargeable on unpaid tax should be in the nature of a penalty akin to a fine resulting from a prosecution.  I do not accept that, because there are remedies open to <Col N="1914" /> the Revenue Commissioners, apart from the interest, which they are entitled to use.  I believe that the rate of interest should be so fixed as to make it unprofitable for a taxpayer to withhold his tax but it should not be so fixed as to operate as a purely penal rate, a rate that is unconscionable.  I do not think there is any other fair way of describing a rate of 18 per cent per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a previous discussion on this topic the Minister said something to the effect that he did not see why the State should act as a banker to taxpayers. That, I think, is a misunderstanding of the position if only for the reason that, if somebody borrows from his bank, first of all, it is most unlikely that he will be paying a rate as high as 18 per cent and, secondly, he will, subject to certain limitations, be entitled to charge that interest against his income tax liability, but there is a specific provision to prevent him charging any interest payable to the Revenue Commissioners against his income tax liability.  In practice, therefore, a rate of 12 per cent per annum is considerably higher than he would be paying if he were borrowing from a bank or some normal source. It is quite misleading to try and compare these two things and to speak as though the effect of this proposal would be to put the State in the same position as a banker.  It is in no such position.  I repeat that the rate of interest should be such as to make it unprofitable for the taxpayer to withhold his tax.  I think that 12 per cent per annum, non-deductible for income tax purposes, is such a rate; 18 per cent per annum non-deductible for income tax purposes is far in excess of such a rate and is a rate which is merely a substitute for the other methods and weapons open to the Revenue Commissioners to recover tax.  I do not think that it should be applied in this way.  Engaging in this kind of extortionate extraction of interest on money overdue is a very bad headline for the State to be setting.  In cases where there is a clear and indefensible default by a taxpayer, apart from paying interest at 12 per cent non-deductible for income tax purposes, there are other remedies <Col N="1915" /> open to the Revenue Commissioners, and they should use them in such cases.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary case of tax outstanding&mdash;remember, we are not dealing only with income tax here&mdash;a common difficulty arises in regard to value-added tax and it can arise sometimes in quite good faith.  I tried to indicate in an earlier discussion the difficulties that are arising for quite a number of people in regard to value-added tax at the moment because of the credit they themselves have to extend.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of this, but there are people who have been prosecuted and threatened with prosecution by the Revenue Commissioners for non-payment of value-added tax, people who were owed more by the State and State companies than they owed the Revenue Commissioners. They were liable to value-added tax on this money.  In such cases the Revenue Commissioners also demanded interest.  I must say, in all fairness, in one particular case I concerned myself with, the Revenue Commissioners waived the interest, rightly in my view.  Nevertheless, it is proposed here to increase the rate of interest involved to an absolutely penal rate.  If the Minister will stand back and look at this for a moment he will realise that this is really an indefensible provision and he should accept this amendment to provide for a 12 per cent per annum rate of interest on overdue tax non-deductible for income tax purposes.  In the bad cases which, no doubt, he will want to talk about, there are other remedies open to the Revenue Commissioners and they can use them.  I would strongly urge the Minister to accept this amendment bearing in mind that what is involved here is not merely income tax but other forms of tax&mdash; corporation profits tax, value-added tax and so on.  In some cases we are dealing with people who, because of the economic climate at the moment, simply do not have the money to pay. To add to their liquidity difficulties by imposing an extortionate rate of interest is bad economics.  I do not think it is true, as far as the Minister is concerned, to say that if this rate is <Col N="1916" /> not charged it will cost the State money in the sense that money is borrowed by the State; if he does his sums he will find that it does not work out quite like that.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to say that the amount of tax arrears is now about 30 times greater than it was ten years ago.  If Deputy Colley's arguments are valid now they were equally valid in 1960 when his party introduced the interest charge of 1 per cent on PAYE tax which was overdue.  That was 1 per cent per month equivalent to 12 per cent per annum, when the overdraft charge was 5.75.  The penal element in the interest charged was first introduced by Deputy Colley's Administration and it was 6.25.  Today the overdraft charge to an ordinary borrower is not less than 13½ per cent and in certain cases it can rise, if it is on term loan, to 15½ per cent.  That is on the basis of bank lending rates from the 8th of April, 1975.  On any calculation then our element of penalty for non-payment of income tax is no more than 4.5.  On the basis of what lending rates they could get it is a great deal less, and it is significantly less than it was in 1960 when the charge was first introduced. Of course no Minister for Finance relishes imposing a penal element at all, but what I said about the State not being a lender of money applies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley suggested that if people could get in certain circumstances a set-off in respect of their borrowings from the bank for tax purposes they would not be tempted to use money due to the State, but that is not the full picture.  Up to now they could borrow money from the State at 12 per cent by not paying their taxes and they could use that money by lending it to various financial institutions, some of good reputation and some of doubtful reputation, and it could certainly earn anything from 6 to 8 per cent.  That is precisely what has happened.  We know this; the information is available. People have withheld money from the Revenue Commissioners properly due to them and that means the State had then to go and borrow money at 15 to 17 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it would. The point was made here that people could borrow from a bank and get the interest set off against income tax. They could do that at one time without any limitation whatsoever, but since January, 1974, I closed that loophole simply to bar the personal borrowings which involved interest of not more than £2,000.  That particular facility was closed off to several people and some withheld money from the <Col N="1918" /> Revenue in order to make profits elsewhere. It has been proven that there was a very great increase in arrears properly due to the State.</P>

      <P>The amount of interest is now three-and-a-half times greater than it was sometime ago.  I will check on that before we resume. The fact is that this abuse has been growing.  If it was proper when this process was first introduced to charge a penalyt of 6.25 per cent, I do not think it is inappropriate that in this day of very high interest rates and dear money there should be some limit by way of penalty on interest rates on arrears of tax particularly when, unlike 1959, people can now get very rewarding rates of interest on money which they withhold from the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
