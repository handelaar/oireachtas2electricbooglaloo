    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>A surplus of ryegrass seed in the international market, which has caused prices to fall, has presented difficulties for the Irish grass seed industry and I have taken steps already to prohibit the marketing here of certain classes of ryegrass seed of non-EEC origin.</P>

      <P>I have taken all the steps that it was possible for me to take.  If it had not been for our strong opposition in relation to the recent price discussions, there would be a serious drop in price next year. We got away with this only on the grounds that it takes two years to produce a crop of seed and that, consequently, the people in the industry require notice of changes. There is an over-supply situation throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he has any proposals for the provision of landing facilities for fishermen at Doonbeg, County Clare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for the provision of landing facilities at Doonbeg <Col N="605" /> have been under consideration in my Department for some time.  I must, however, point out that suitable construction works at Doonbeg would be very costly in relation to the existing level of fishing activity there and along the coast of County Clare in general, and, having regard to the fact that improved landing facilities are at present being provided a short distance away at Seafield, I am not persuaded that the development of Doonbeg as a landing place is warranted at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister further investigate the potential of the area, bearing in mind that recently boats have been purchased and young fishermen are desirous of engaging in that way of life and that a Clare development committee is to be formed. Bearing all that in mind, will he now further investigate the possibilities there and will he ask his inspector to contact the local fishermen who deserve a proper landing place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that a short distance away, at Seafield, there is such accommodation.  I am aware that a reasonably good case has been made for this development but the cost is very heavy.  It is well in excess of £100,000.  The cost of land, and so on, would be £10,000 or £12,000 more.  It would cost £600 a year to keep it maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the distance they would be expected to travel to Seafield, by road, from where they reside, Doonbeg, is between ten and 12 miles?  It is not reasonable to ask them to avail of the facilities at Seafield which is far removed from their own residences. Would he further consider making available some facility, no matter how small, to encourage local fishermen?</P>

For example, with effect from September, 1971, the minimum qualifying employment period for a redundancy payment was reduced from four to two years.  In April, 1974, the redundancy scheme was further improved by the inclusion of non-manual workers earning over £1,600 per annum.</P>

In 1974 the improvements included the extension of duration of weekly payments to workers over 51 years of age and the raising to 100 per cent of pre-redundancy pay of the limit of the total of weekly redundancy payment plus social welfare benefits.</P>

      <P>Statistics of the characteristics of persons on the live register are compiled on a regular basis by the Central Statistics Office. The Deputy will find a list of such publications in Appendix B of the publication <i>The Trend of Employment and Unemployment</i> which is published annually by the Stationery Office.</P>
      <P>My Department, through the manpower information section of the National Manpower Service, monitor this information and, together with certain other information made available to them by other Government agencies, a continuous watch is being kept on development in the trends of employment and unemployment. AnCO, the Industrial Training Authority, works closely with this section.  Plans for retraining and reemployment are based on the needs of the workers concerned as shown by these studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the expense of compiling information and the necessary time lag involved in producing detailed breakdowns, the information referred to by the Deputy is not yet available. I am however confident that every effort is being made by AnCO to retrain the maximum number of unemployed workers.  I would refer the Deputy to the financial statement of the Minister for Finance in which is announced an increase of £3 million in the grant to AnCO making a total provision of £5 million which, after matching grants from the European Social Fund, will mean that AnCO will have a total of £9 million for current expenditure in 1975.  This provision will enable an extra 2,000 adults to be brought into training in 1975 and will bring the total number of adults in such training to 5,000. <Col N="614" /> In addition about 1,000 apprentices will be trained during the year.  This increase in our training capacity, which is the largest ever increase in this area, has been warmly welcomed by both sides of industry.</P>

    <P>During the past two years I have doubled the field staff of the manpower service and I plan to expand it further, by one third, in the current year.  I hope also to increase the number of manpower offices throughout <Col N="618" /> the country to 25 during 1975 and so bring the facilities of the service to more people in the regions.  The figures I have quoted show that an increasing number of job seekers and employers alike are using the service and suggest that there is satisfaction with the work it is doing.  The placing of people in jobs is more important than ever in the present difficult employment situation.  I have, therefore, directed the service to intensify its efforts to seek out all possible vacancies and I take this opportunity of appealing to employers to give their full co-operation by notifying any vacancies they may have to the service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question I would point out that it is the Government's policy to create employment at home and remove the need for involuntary emigration. In the context of our membership of the EEC, however, the manpower service is obliged to co-operate with the other EEC manpower authorities in facilitating persons wishing to work in other member states in accordance with the regulations governing the free movement of workers.  These regulations provide that vacancies which were notified to the national manpower authorities and remain unfilled after 18 days must be circulated to the manpower authorities of the other member states so that nationals of those countries may have an opportunity of applying for them. The service is also obliged to assist, on request, employers from other EEC countries who wish to recruit Irish workers.  In addition it provides advice and information on living and working conditions in other EEC countries to people who request it.</P>
    <P>However only a small number of Irish people have approached the manpower service with a view to migrating to other EEC countries and I have no plans therefore to expand this side of the service.</P>

Of this number over 800 are boys who first registered in 1973 and who, when contacted in 1974, opted to remain on the register in the hope of getting an apprenticeship.  The situation about placement in apprenticeships in the latter half of 1974 was of course adversely affected by the unfavourable employment situation.</P>

      <P>At present AnCO are providing training in a range of skills that will be in demand for the development of off-shore oil and gas resources, for example, welding, metal fabrication, fitting, instrumentation.</P>
      <P>AnCO estimate that, depending on the pace of development, off-shore exploration and drilling could by 1978-79 provide employment for professional level downwards for 1,100 persons and on-shore activity for 600 persons.  Indirectly generated on-shore demands for specialised services, such as helicopter transport, could involve a further 600 personnel.</P>
      <P>The 1,700 jobs that would be generated fall into two broad categories:&mdash;</P>

    <P>(a)  those for which training is already provided in Ireland, such as mechanical and electrical engineers and technicians and other <Col N="620" /> engineering personnel, geologists and surveyors, and</P>

When the objection came forward for hearing it was indicated that two of the congests had inherited land and the third was no longer interested in obtaining the addition.  Therefore, the commissioners were satisfied that an area of 87 acres would be sufficient to bring the deserving congests up to standard and they acquired that area.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is correct but there are other factors as well as the age group.  I should like to repeat that it is a condition of Community subvention of the annuity that the area released by a retiring farmer is allotted to a development farmer with a land requirement or for afforestation, recreational activities, public health or other public purposes.  Where land is purchased by the Land Commission subvention will only arise when the lands have been allocated for one or other of these purposes.  It follows from that that until the lands which we have purchased are allocated for one or other of those purposes it would be impossible to say whether or <Col N="633" /> not we would get any subvention from the EEC.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Any farmer with a plan from the advisory services requiring more land to reach the stage of development farmer would qualify.

    <P>Provided further that whenever a disposal <i>inter vivos</i> results in the payment of Capital Acquisitions Tax, no Capital Gains Tax shall become payable on such disposal <i>inter vivos.</i></P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy O'Malley.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have pointed out that what is sought in this amendment is that in the case of a disposal <i>inter vivos</i>, where it results in the payment of capital acquisitions tax, no capital gains tax would become payable on the same transaction.  What we are proposing is what was stated in the Government's White Paper as being what would happen but the Government went back on that in this Bill. We sought reasons from the Minister for that and towards the end of the discussion on this amendment on the last occasion the Minister gave as one of the reasons for going back on what was stated in the White Paper the fact that the thresholds in the Capital Gains Tax Bill had been raised and the rates reduced as against those specified in the White Paper.  I asked the Minister to tell us the basis on which he decided to apply both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax to the one transaction having regard to the change in the rates and in the thresholds&mdash;in other words, did he have calculations which would show the effect of the changes in the rates and in the thresholds on the <Col N="651" /> revenue expected and did he, as a result, have calculations to show that the application of both capital gains and capital acquisitions taxes to the one transaction would recompense the Exchequer for the loss envisaged in the changes from the White Paper.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not indicate, in the short time he had available to reply, that he had figures but I should like to pursue this a little further and find out if he has estimates of the consequences of the changes announced. If he has, I think the House is entitled to get them, estimates though they may be, but if he has not got them, it does not seem to me that the application of capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax to the one transaction has any bearing on the matter at all.</P>
      <P>It would seem then that it was done blindly without any knowledge of what the result of doing it would be. We are entitled to ask the Minister which is his position on this.  Was it done on the basis of estimates with a reasonable knowledge of the consequence of what he did in changing from the White Paper or was it done blindly, not having any idea of the consequences of what he was doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have pointed out again and again that one of the greatest scandals of the capital taxation position was that it enabled people to avoid paying any form of capital taxation.  Any person who cleverly enough anticipated death by making a suitable arrangement, by giving a gift more than five years before death or by setting up a trust, could avoid capital taxation altogether. As a consequence of this, Ireland is unique in the western world in not having an adequate record of the holdings, transfer and distribution of wealth because a great deal of the wealth in the country has never come within the knowledge of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one gross imperfection in the present system and it is also an injustice because under the present system of taxation some people with holdings of wealth of many millions of pounds have not to pay any tax <Col N="652" /> whatsoever on such holdings which can generate for themselves certainly a much better quality of life than is available to persons who have not got such holdings, whereas persons with incomes of as low as £700 or £800 a year could find themselves obliged to pay tax week after week.</P>
    <P>Such a situation is I believe an inequitable one.  So that the time certainly has come to make a change in the system.  It will be some time before one can say with certainty what would be the yield of these new taxes but one thing must be clear, that is, that if massive holdings of wealth which previously escaped any taxation are in future subjected to capital gains tax and wealth taxes and capital acquisition taxes they must generate a new source of income for the Exchequer which will then be passed on for the betterment of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>The donor of an asset is giving away not only the asset at its cost at the time he acquired it but also the enhanced value of that asset during his period of ownership.  So, the gift therefore is of an asset at its original value plus the capital gain and the tax under the capital gains tax system is chargeable at the point when the donor makes a deliberate decision to part with a valuable asset to another and at the time of making the decision to part with the asset the donor would be in a position to assess what capital gain had been made on the asset during the period of ownership.  So, to that extent this tax is a voluntary tax.  If a person does not wish to pay the tax or does not wish to make a gift, so be it, no liability to tax arises.  If, however, with the law stated in an Act and with an assessment of the capital gain made during the period of ownership, a donor decides to part with an asset by way of a gift it is not unreasonable that the donor should at that time pay a tax related to the gain on the asset during the period of ownership.</P>
    <P>Whatever a joint donor gets out of making a gift is surely represented by the full value of the gift at the time of making it, not merely through its original cost.  It is logical, therefore, to <Col N="653" /> regard him as having made a gain at the time he makes a gift.  This is done by treating as consideration for the disposal its market value at the time of the gift.</P>
    <P>It is also logical to tax the beneficiary as he has received value without any sacrifice on his part.  The person who receives a gift not only improves his social position but also has his economic power enhanced to the extent of the value of the gift.  In the case of the recipient of the gift he will be charged to capital acquisitions tax in those very rare cases where thresholds are exceeded.</P>
    <P>One would think listening to the Opposition that there were many people in this country now being put at the risk of new taxes whenever they receive gifts from their parents.  Of course, that is a totally unreal position. So far as capital gains tax is concerned there is, for instance, no question of liability to capital gains tax of a cash gift and most gifts from parents to children are in the form of cash and in cases where the assets take other forms the exceptionally high threshold arrangements under the proposed capital acquisitions tax and the thresholds also of exemption to capital gains tax will mean that well over 90 per cent, at least&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;well over 90 per cent at least will not find themselves charged in future to tax.  But today if the holder of such assets were to die without having been clever enough or wise enough or prophetic enough to make advance arrangements to avoid the tax, the donees will find themselves subjected to horrific rates of tax which we propose to abolish. I suggest to those who are criticising us and delaying the progress of this Bill that they are not doing a service to the people whom we are out to relieve by the abolition of death duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should also be noted that where a person acquires property he is treated for capital gains tax as taking the asset at its market value.  This value will be the base for calculation <Col N="654" /> of a capital gain in the event of a future disposal.  Capital gains tax will be allowed as a deduction in computing the amount on which capital acquisitions tax will be charged if, of course, the donee has to pay the donor's capital gains tax.</P>
    <P>There is also good reason for this treatment from the point of view of preventing avoidance.  If gifts were not to be charged, all sorts of manipulations could take place to mask disposals. A gift of an asset could be given with a subsequent reverse gift in money by the recipient or the first gift or mutual gifts of assets could be arranged.  If this were to happen the gain inherent in the enhanced value of the asset would escape taxation in the hands of the donor who had originally gained.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the amendment proposes that, where capital acquisitions tax becomes chargeable on the recipient, there should be no capital gains tax charged at all.  This would cut across the whole principle which I have been speaking about.  The amendment suggests that the mere payment of capital acquisitions tax by a beneficiary should exempt the donor from capital gains tax chargeable to him.  It does not seek in any way to differentiate between the different situations which may arise and I should like to give a few illustrations.</P>
    <P>If a gift of value £10,000 is made which carries a capital gain of £5,000 the tax on the donor will be £1,300 and if capital acquisitions tax of a mere £5 is payable by the donee it is suggested that the capital gains tax of £1,300 should be discharged from assessment altogether.  If another donee were charged with capital acquisitions tax of £1,000, the same treatment would apply.  Therefore, the amendment would not make any effort to treat these cases differently. If a person were to get total exemption of £1,295 because of the £5 capital acquisitions tax, a person who was involved in a capital acquisitions tax of £1,000 ought to get commensurate relief and not merely relief of the same sum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> This amendment, like many others from the Opposition, would frustrate equity, would multiply anomalies and would produce such a complex system that on the one side the taxpayer would be driven insane trying to get around the complex code while on the other side there would be so many avenues of avoidance that the whole tax would be a nonsense.  Time and again I have stressed how narrow is the area in which there is likely to be a charge for capital gains tax on the donor or on the donee for capital acquisitions tax.  There are very generous thresholds in respect of gifts within a family which ensure that the pictures of difficulty painted by the Opposition will have no reality in so far as the mass of people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Many disposals, including gifts, do not give rise to capital gains tax charge.  The most obvious one is money.  Consequently, ordinary everyday money gifts will not be subject to a capital gains tax charge, no matter how large the amount.  Neither will the gift of a house which has been the donor's principal private residence nor its contents give rise to any capital gains tax.  Various forms of tangible movable property up to £2,000 in value are exempt also and Government securities are not chargeable assets.  Also free from this tax are wasting assets, regardless of their value.  These would include boats, motor cars, caravans or animals. Combining these exemptions with the £50,000 and the £150,000 exemptions for farms and businesses could well exempt a set of gifts of up to £100,000 in value in a non-family case and to £200,000 in a family case.</P>
    <P>I am confident that 95 per cent of our people have nothing to worry about in so far as these taxes are concerned.  However these Bills are not intended to be tax exemption Bills.  We have never offered them as such.  The tax exemption Bill this year on the capital front will be the Finance Bill which will exempt from death duties the estates of persons who die from April next.  This Bill, together with the Wealth Tax and the <Col N="656" /> Capital Acquisitions Tax Bills, are designed to impose tax on people who are fortunate enough to have very substantial property other than their principal private residences.  A home and its contents are the only wealth the majority of our people can ever hope to acquire.  So far as the majority of people are concerned, too, business properties are exempt and for others the taxes payable will be much less than anything that will be paid by way of estate duty.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House again that within families there can be tremendous transfers that would not attract tax.  A father with three sons could transfer his estate of £450,000 without there being any liability to capital acquisitions tax.  Only those who are lucky enough to have property of substantial value will be asked to pay.  It can be said truly that lucky is he who has wealth enough to be called on to pay capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax or a wealth tax.</P>
    <P>Apart from those in farming or business, others can gain gifts and assets in any form embodying a capital gain of up to £500 so that up to £15,000 could be acquired by way of capital gains during a period of 30 years and be exempt from tax.  That would represent value of £30,000 or more, and if gifts by way of cash or national loans were added it is clear that the gifts could be very much greater and be exempt.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the provision relating to the £50,000 or £150,000 in sections 26 and 27 should be removed. Any law can be changed but it is not our intention to remove the exemption we are granting.  For so long as the recipient retains a farm or business and passes it on on retirement, the whole exemption process will continue. What is said in section 27, subsection (3), is that if any of the assets forming the original disposals are sold within ten years there will be a charge based on the original donor's cost.  Therefore, if all the assets are disposed of within ten years the exemption will not apply, but if there is a part disposal within that time there would be only a partial availability of <Col N="657" /> the exemption.  If a sale were made outside the ten-year period, the charge to capital gains tax would be by reference to the amount paid or, in the case of a gift, the market value at the time of the acquisition.</P>
    <P>I have said here and elsewhere that the thresholds or exemptions will be adjusted from time to time in the light of experience.  This shows a most reasonable approach on the part of the Government, an approach which indicates a thorough understanding of holdings of family wealth and the way in which they are used.  It shows a proper appreciation of what is a sound social and economic policy. The objective is to free the majority of moderate sized farms or businesses from a charge of capital gains tax when they are transferred to members of the immediate families.  The thresholds and exemptions we are providing ensure that this goal is achieved.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that the relief is not a deferment, as suggested by Deputy Colley and Deputy O'Malley, but that it is a real and permanent benefit.  It is likely that that benefit will continue through generations of farmers and businessmen and will apply to more than 95 per cent of transactions of this kind both now and in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised why gifts should be treated differently when made <i>inter vivos</i> and on death.  The reason is obvious.  Gifts are a matter of a deliberate, conscious and voluntary choice made during a life time. They can be arranged; they can be manipulated; they can be adjusted. The donor is aware of and can use the increase in the value of the asset and dispose of it as he wishes.</P>
    <P>Normally, thanks be to God, death is not really a matter of choice.  With the new treatment of gifts as compared with estate duty, there will be no scope for manipulations in anticipation of death.  I emphasised that at the beginning and I repeat it now. That is the proper course to take. There are also tax advantages in distribution before death in so far as the capital acquisitions tax on gifts <i>inter vivos</i> will be at a rate 25 per cent below what it would be in the <Col N="658" /> event of death.  In addition, the very generous exemptions from capital gains tax of £50,000 and £150,000 to which I have referred so often, and cannot refer to too often, go a very long way towards encouraging people to transfer their property well before death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have listened to the Minister now for the best part of half-an-hour.  I do not think anybody listening to him could possibly suspect that what he was doing was arguing against what he and his colleagues said in the White Paper they were going to do.  That is what this question was all about.  This amendment seeks to do what the Government said they would do in the White Paper. What the Minister has said is an argument against what he said he was going to do in the White Paper. It can be seen in perspective when one realises that.</P>
      <P>The Minister has chosen suitably selective examples and has ignored the fact that, in the case of gifts benefiting from the exemptions proposed in this Bill, what is involved, despite what he says, is a postponement.  The only way it would not be a postponement would be if the property concerned passed on from father to son from generation to generation.  Once the property, or any portion of it, is disposed of either by way of sale or gift then, of course, the liability arises and that liability is related back to the date on which it was first acquired.</P>
      <P>In other words, a farmer who got a farm either by purchase or by inheritance, say, 40 years ago, would find that the property was valued as at that date 40 years ago, and the gain would be estimated from that date up to, perhaps, 30 years hence when his son, having got it from him, disposed of the property.  At that stage the liability would arise.  There is no use in the Minister saying this is an exemption. It is a postponement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I come back to the question I asked the Minister and to which he did not reply in all he said?  It is a fairly straightforward and simple question.  When the Minister decided <Col N="659" /> to go back on what was said in the White Paper, and to apply both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax to the one transaction, at that stage did he have any estimate of the consequences of doing this and any estimate of the consequences of the changes he made in the Capital Gains Tax Bill in the rate and in the thresholds? Did he have any estimate or did he not?  That was the question I put to him and on which he spent such a lot of time in replying, without actually giving the answer and, in fact, arguing against his own proposal in the White Paper.  Could I ask the Minister to answer the question now?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered the question very explicitly. The piece of the answer which Deputy Colley does not like is that there is a huge hunk of wealth holdings which never came within the taxation net because they avoided tax.  Nobody knows the size of them and I can only assume from the protests coming from some quarters that they must be quite sizeable.  The vast majority of holders of wealth who came within the capital taxation net in the past and the estate duty net will be exempt under the code we are now offering.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a very simple question and it is somewhat significant that he refuses to answer it.  He says he answered it explicitly.  If he calls what he said just now an explicit answer, I am afraid I cannot agree with him.  The question is: did he or did he not have estimates of the consequences of what he was doing?  It is implied in what he has just said that he did not have estimates.  Is that what the Minister is saying&mdash;that he did not have estimates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I announced in the budget this year that we were making a provision of £3 million in relation to capital taxation.  There is no knowing what is outside the net of the capital taxation code because vast property holdings have completely escaped liability to capital taxation in the past.  Nobody knows <Col N="660" /> the size of them.  I have said that for over a year now.  The venom of the protests from some quarters would appear to indicate that there must be substantial holdings there.</P>
      <P>We will be exempting the vast mass of the people.  Under the existing estate duty code a very large proportion of the assets which are caught at the time of death are the family home, money in the bank, personal property, furniture and things of that nature.  They will be exempt under the packet of taxation we have, so it seems that the majority will be exempt.</P>

At least, if words mean anything that is what he conveyed to me. He was saying that there were vast hunks of wealth of which nobody knew anything and, therefore, they could not be estimated.  That is my understanding of what he was saying.  If I am correct, he is saying he did not have estimates.

      <P>Clearly the income from capital gains tax in the initial stage will be very small because there has to be a period during which the gain is made before the gain becomes significant.  We have said that.  It was said in the White Paper in February, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister is losing sight of the reason why this question is being put to him.  Let me refresh his memory.  He told us that one of the reasons why he departed from what was in the White Paper, and what is proposed in this amendment, was that, because he had reduced the rate of capital gains tax and altered the thresholds, there would be a reduction in yield and, therefore, he would apply both capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax to the one transaction where that applied to counterbalance that.  That is why I am asking him did he have an estimate.</P>
      <P>You can see, Sir, how difficult it is to get any kind of an answer out of the Minister on that question.  I am putting it to him, through you, Sir, that if he has an estimate we should have it, and he should tell us what he thinks the effect was of the changes he made, and to what extent they are being counter-balanced by the Minister refusing to do what is provided in this amendment, and what he said he would do in the White Paper.  Either he has some estimates on this or he has not.  Would the Minister say, if he has the estimates, what the figures are, and what are the consequences of doing what he did and what he proposes to do now?  Could we get that right?</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Deputy was not but, if he were listening intently, he is now trying to pretend he did not understand.  I have said very clearly that estimates cannot be accurately forecast because these accumulations of wealth have never been on record here.  Although <Col N="662" /> every other European country has them on record, we never had.  Added to that, we do not know what the pattern of behaviour will be.  Capital gains tax will probably change the pattern in so far as holding on to wealth is concerned.  It will also change the pattern where the purchase of wealth is concerned.  Those tempted to engage in speculation to make a quick gain may decide not to so engage in future because of the tax they will be called upon to pay. As far as gifts are concerned, many gifts in the past were made for the purpose of avoiding death duties; they were made by people in the prime of life and in the whole of their health who decided they should anticipate their passing on and prevent any portion of their accumulated wealth going to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, this was never on record here but we know for a certainty that the better off made these decisions and thereby avoided paying tax.  They were entitled to do that since it was quite legitimate under the unsatisfactory law that existed.  We have no way of forecasting, and I have said this repeatedly over the last year, precisely what the income from these taxes will be but, on the basis of the best information available to the Revenue Commissioners and published in their annual reports of such accumulations of wealth as are known, we anticipate that in or about £3 million will be the income this year from these new taxes.  If the figure is greater than that it will be because estates which escaped tax in the past will be now caught in the net.  If it is less it will be because we made an overestimate of the likely impact of the new taxes. What is particularly difficult is knowing what will be the pattern of behaviour in the early years of the operation of these new taxes.  If one looks to the experience of other countries one finds a similar difficulty existed in assessing what the tax would produce by way of revenue.  It is equally impossible to anticipate the pattern of <Col N="663" /> property acquisition and transfer because the new régime will be bound to affect people's disposition towards property holding and property creation.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is that in the situation visualised by Deputy Belton there is a specific provision excluding allowance for interest and it is also a fact that this does not apply in Britain.  Interest which is properly capitalised is allowed, as any logical view of the situation would provide, and in regard to Deputy Belton's query, I do not think there is any dispute.  The answer is that it is not allowed and therefore the question of electing whether one will set it off against capital gains tax or income tax does not arise.  It is perfectly easy for the Minister to provide that one does not have the election but the Minister specifically excludes any allowance for interest.  We will be dealing with this matter again on a later section and I hope to pursue it further then.  I do not know if Deputy Belton wants to pursue it further at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like now to come back to what I was asking the Minister earlier.  He said a great deal and I must confess I was reasonably sure from what he had said up to the last <Col N="665" /> time he intervened; I was reasonably sure that what he was saying was there were no estimates available but, in view of what he said on the last occasion, I am not sure now if he said there is an estimate of £3 million. But there is not any estimate.  Perhaps I could break it down a little further. He said that when he changed the proposed rate of tax and the threshold this had an effect on the amount of revenue expected.  Can he now indicate what effect it did have on the amount of revenue expected?</P>

      <P>If we had an obligatory census of property holding in this country then we could say with greater precision what the result would be.  We cannot say with complete precision because we do not know what the pattern of behaviour in the future will be.  Therefore it is not possible to determine with precision what the result of the taxes will be.  It will take a number of years' experience of the taxes before we can get positive accuracy into our forecasts.  This has always been the experience of people in the introduction of taxes of this kind.  The same problem no doubt faced the originator of estate duty. It could have been related to the pattern of deaths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could to some extent, on the basis of vital statistics, expect so many people to die, but unless you happen to know their possessions of wealth at the time they die you cannot say with certainty what the result of any particular rate of estate duty is going to be.  We know, in the light of the experience of the past, what the income has been from estate duty and the annual report of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="666" /> spells out the percentage of estates above and below certain figures and the amount of receipts which came from estates of different size.</P>
    <P>All that is known.  To the extent that that is a guide it has been used as one of the bases on which the Revenue Commissioners have made their assessments.  In the absence of any record of the age at which people hold wealth, the age at which they accumulate wealth, the age at which they transfer it voluntarily <i>inter vivos</i> and so forth, there is no possibility of making the precise forecast one would like to make.  Clearly if, as we did, we adjusted the thresholds so as to remove from liability people who were previously in it, that meant a minus quantity as far as income was concerned, but in so far as we generated a liability to capital gains tax as well and in some cases a liability to capital acquisitions tax, there was likely to be a plus.  We could not say with any absolute precision what the precise adjustment would be in respect of the removal of one liability and the creation of another.</P>

      <P>The Minister seemed to be trying to take both sides at the one time but I think finally he came down in favour of the statement that he does not know and could not know what the effect would be of reducing the rate of tax and increasing the thresholds.  I am accepting that that is what he is saying.  If that is so, I am now asking him why, not knowing what the consequences would be, he decided to apply capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax to the one transaction having stated in the White Paper that he would not do so.  It would appear that he does not know what the effect was of reducing the rate and increasing the thresholds but he advanced as an argument for not doing what is in this amendment the fact that he had done so and had to counterbalance this by putting capital <Col N="667" /> gains tax and capital acquisitions tax on the one transaction.  I am asking him now, in the light of what he has said, why did he do this when he does not know what the effect is.</P>

      <P>I answered the question and the Deputy did not like the length of it because I answered all the questions that had been posed, including one of the reasons we changed the outline as indicated in the White Paper.  The Opposition would love to crucify the Government and nail them down to some passages in the White Paper but in regard to other ones they say we were right to move from the original outline and in other ones they say they will do their damndest to make sure we move either from what was in the White Paper or what is in the Bill.  Apparently there is some strange virtue about preserving an exemption which would confer considerable benefit on the comparatively well-to-do.  Fianna Fáil, the latter day converts to capital gains tax, want to preserve this exemption for the comparatively well-to-do, showing what we suspected all along&mdash;that they knew the tide of public opinion was against <Col N="668" /> them and they resolved at their Ard Fheis last year to have a capital gains tax.  Therefore they went through the face-saving exercise of pretending that they were now in favour of it but they are doing their damndest as far as this debate is concerned to ensure that the whole capital gains tax system is watered down to become a nothing.</P>

      <P>The Minister appears to want to prolong this discussion and if that is the way he wants it that is his business.  We are not trying to hold up the passage of this Bill although we want to discuss it in detail.  In view of the fact that the Minister simply becomes politically abusive when he is asked to answer a specific question, and when one remembers his political abuse is directed at a proposal which he made in the White Paper, one can judge the sincerity of that abuse.</P>
      <P>I am going to ask the Minister the question once more and if he wants to get on with the Bill I would ask him not to go off on other tangents. Will he answer the question, which is a straightforward one?  In view of the fact, as he has told us, that he had no worthwhile estimate of the consequences of reducing the rate of capital gains tax and increasing the thresholds, why did he depart from the White Paper and apply both capital acquisitions and capital gains taxes on the one transaction as a counter-balance from the point of view of revenue?  That is one of the reasons he gave us and I am only dealing with that.  On what basis did the Minister decide to apply the two taxes to the one transaction as a counter-balance to the loss of revenue estimated by reason of the changes he made in the rates of tax and the thresholds?  That is a simple, straightforward question and it does not require political abuse to answer it.  It is a simple question, if the Minister is genuine in the reasons he is putting forward.  If he is not, of course, we can expect more political abuse instead of an answer.</P>

Does the Minister agree he said that?  Does the Minister deny he said it?  We may take it quite clearly that the Minister cannot deny he said it.  He knows as well as I do that he said it and now he is being asked to explain it.  However, he became abusive and finally he comes back to another reason that he gave, namely, as an anti-avoidance measure. It is true he said that and we discussed it before but I made it clear I was simply asking him about the other reason.  Once more I am asking him if he will answer the question?  He gave that reason to the House and will he now tell us on what basis did he decide to apply the two taxes to the one transaction as a counter-balance to loss of revenue, having regard to the fact that he does not know what is the loss of revenue?</P>

It is no answer for the Minister to say it is on the record, that it is an anti-avoidance measure or anything else.  That does not answer the question.  If we are to make any progress, at least we must have some slight regard to logic.  Will the Minister answer the question?

In fairness to the Minister I want to make it quite clear it was not the only reason he gave.  However, one reason he gave was that it was a counter-balance to the loss of revenue involved in changing rates of taxes and increasing thresholds. It now emerges he does not have any idea of what the loss of revenue involved could be and, on that basis, I am asking him why did <Col N="673" /> he decide to put the two taxes on the one transaction as a counter-balance. How did he arrive at this, what figure did he have?  If he had no figure, will he agree he did it having no figure in mind?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that in the nature of things it is not possible to get a precise estimate but that is not what I am asking the Minister.  Since he put forward as one of the reasons for refusing this amendment&mdash;an amendment that is seeking to do what he said he would do in the White Paper&mdash;the fact that he was counter-balancing the loss of revenue involved in changing the rates and increasing thresholds, what was the basis for that action in the context of counter-balancing revenue when he did not know what revenue was involved either by way of loss or gain?  This is a simple, straightforward question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy expect there would be a gain of revenue as a result of the application of the two taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem on the face of it that to apply one tax only to a transaction would yield less than to apply two taxes.  Would the Minister accept that proposition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have said from the beginning.  If the thresholds <Col N="674" /> of exemption are increased the revenue goes down and if one increases liability the revenue goes up. I have set my plus and minus but perhaps the symbols were not understood by the Deputy.  I said that 20 minutes ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the first time since the Minister made the point he is now directing his mind to the point.  He could have saved a great deal of time if he had done this at the beginning. What seems to be emerging from what the Minister is now saying is that yes, he did expect there would be an increase of revenue by doing this and on the other hand there was going to be a loss of revenue by reducing rates and increasing thresholds.  Is the Minister not also saying that this is a general proposition and that he did not know how much loss or gain of revenue would be involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying also that the mesh has been made smaller by these changes and the opportunities for avoidance are less and that also increases yield.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making slight progress.  We now have established that one of the reasons why the Minister did this was to counter-balance the expected loss of revenue but he had no idea of the amount of revenue that would be lost or of the amount of revenue that would be gained by applying the two taxes to the one transaction.  I accept the fact that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to have any accurate estimate of the sums that would be involved.  I never argued that they would be available but the Minister implied that they would be in what he said, that he was counter-balancing one against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am coming to in the context of the argument the Minister made is that the application of the two taxes to the one transaction is not just a watering-down or a peripheral change in the proposals in the White Paper; it is a pretty fundamental change.  The White Paper states that only one tax would be applied to a particular type of transaction and to <Col N="675" /> say now that two taxes will be applied cannot be dismissed by the Minister as a minor change.  It is a major change, indeed, it is a change in principle. It now appears that it was done not with any accurate idea or even remotely accurate idea, of what amount of money would be involved. In fact, I doubt if that reason given by the Minister had any bearing on the matter at all although it has taken us a long time to establish that he did not know what was involved in the way of figures and, therefore, it could not nor should not have had any real bearing on it.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to do what the Minister proposed to do according to the White Paper.  The change the Minister has made is a fundamental change in principle and we can now accept, in view of what we have extracted from the Minister, that the reason about revenue is totally irrelevant.  The Minister's real reason for doing this is because he believes it is an anti-avoidance measure, that it is necessary to do this so as to prevent avoidance of liability. I have certain doubts as to whether it is necessary for that purpose.  If it is so, it was so when the White Paper was published and when the Minister proposed to do precisely what is sought in the amendment.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if there has been any change in the situation since the White Paper was published or was this something which was overlooked at the time of the White Paper, that this would provide a loophole for escape, or why does this change come about now?  The only cogent reason the Minister has put forward for what he is proposing to do is anti-avoidance.  Even the Minister will agree that in view of the fact that he proposed in the White Paper not to do this we are entitled to ask him what has changed since.  Is it that it was not known at the time the White Paper was issued that this would provide an avoidance loophole?</P>

We only got an answer to the question&mdash;which I put to him when this debate started today&mdash;in the last few minutes, although the Minister might have thought he was answering the question up to that.  I put it to the Minister that he has not replied to the questions I put to him. Would the Minister reply to these questions now, briefly?  I have no desire to hold up the House on this; I am simply seeking an explanation.  If there is delay in dealing with this Bill it is largely due to the Minister's unwillingness or inability to answer straightforward questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Restraining myself somewhat, could I ask the Minister if he would oblige the House by repeating, very briefly, his answer to the question as to what has changed between the issue of the White Paper and the issue of the Bill?  Is it a fact that this possibility of a loophole here was unknown to or not adverted to by the people who drafted the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper was a broad outline and never professed to be anything more than that.  In the course of consultations we made several amendments.  Those in one direction were apparently welcomed by the Opposition and those in another were not.  It would be extraordinary if there was only gain for some people and no disadvantage in any direction at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the question of whether changes from the White Paper were welcomed or not is irrelevant to this issue.  The fact is that the White Paper proposed what I submit is a fundamental matter, that two forms of tax would not be applied to the same transaction.  The Minister has now departed from that and the only reason given is that he regards that as providing a loophole for avoidance.  In my view it is reasonable to ask, if that is so, has there been a change in the situation which <Col N="677" /> would create a loophole between the issuing of the White Paper and the publishing of the Bill?  Alternatively, was the position always the same but not adverted to in the preparation of the White Paper?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 95 per cent of all cases of transfer of property here no question of liability to both taxes will arise.  That is a fact under the Bill as it now stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that as a fact.  That has nothing to do with the question I put to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the balance of cases the additional liability in cash will, in the overwhelming mass of cases, be negligible and if there is a departure from a hope or an intention expressed in the White Paper in effect it is negligible so far as the effect of the new tax package is going to be.  We have a situation now in which we spend hours and hours of wonderful debate for those who love to see gladiators in the ring taking strips off one another but it does not help to produce an equitable, efficient system of capital taxation such as we intended to bring in.  I suggest that if we regard that as our objective we could proceed instead of trying to score debating points based upon phrases and sentences in a White Paper which at the time it was offered was offered as a broad outline for discussion and consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has a remarkable capacity for refusing or being unable to answer a straightforward question.  We have heard what he has just said as a reply or a purported reply to a question I put to him, had anything changed between the issue of the White Paper and the issue of the Bill which produced a loophole situation.  I also asked him if the explanation for the departure from what was in the White Paper in this instance was that the possible lophole was not adverted to.  It is a simple question and it does not require the Minister to go around in circles in the way he has been doing. Would he please answer the questions and we will get on with the job?</P>

      <P>If that is the way the Minister wants it, that is the way he will get it.  He has the choice.  I have assured him that we have no desire to hold up this debate but if he thinks he will get away with this kind of nonsense and contempt for the House he will not.  I am not so stupid as to expect that this Minister will listen to reason and actually accept amendments which would improve the Bill; that is expecting far too much: all I am asking is that he will direct his mind to the points put forward and answer them.  We had an example today&mdash;not by any means the first either in this debate or from this Minister in other matters&mdash;of the waste of the time of the House by the refusal or inability of the Minister to answer straight questions.  When it ends in the contemptuous treatment the Minister is now trying to give us, if there is delay in the passing of the Bill, the Minister can know well where the fault lies.</P>
      <P>I shall now ask the Minister once more: will he please say&mdash;I shall break down the question to make it simpler &mdash;first, has there been any change in circumstances between date of issue of the White Paper and the date of publication of the Bill which would make acceptance of this amendment provide a loophole for evasion or avoidance?</P>

In case he forgets I shall repeat the question for him: has there been any change in the circumstances arising between the date of publication of the White Paper and the date of publication of the Bill which would as a result provide a loophole if this amendment were accepted?

      <P>The Minister seems to be in a great hurry to have a division. We shall have a division when we want it and when the time is appropriate in relation to the progress of the Bill.  The Minister is being asked to answer a simple question &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; and he need not think he will avoid his responsibility by trooping <Col N="680" /> the Government Deputies through the lobby.  He is simply acting in a childish manner.  I will restrain myself. I will not add another epithet as I was going to do to describe his activities. I am asking a simple question. Why does the Minister refuse to answer?  He is refusing to answer.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to pursue the line he has being pursuing and take a long time to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo; as he did before, he can do that.  We will eventually get to the answer.  But it is a straight, simple question.  Would he say whether there has been any change in the circumstances arising between the date of publication of the White Paper and the date of publication of the Bill as a result of which acceptance of this amendment would create a loophole?  Will the Minister answer?</P>

      <P>The Chair will appreciate that the House is entitled to get relevant information from the Minister and I submit that where there is a very substantial, not to say fundamental, change in the legislation brought in by the Minister from that proposed in the White Paper we are entitled to ask the reasons for it.  One reasonable question in regard to that is whether there has been some change in the circumstances as a result of which what would not have been creating a loophole at the time of the White Paper is now creating a loophole because that is the reason the Minister has given for this change. That is a reasonable question and the Minister is totally unreasonable if he refuses to answer it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest the Minister has not answered the question but he need not waste any time of the House; all he has to say is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the question: have the circumstances changed?  Why is the Minister refusing to say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; to that?  Very well, I shall take the second part of the question.  Perhaps the Minister will think better of it. I rather suspect his reason for not answering is that he knows what the second part of the question is.  It is this: at the time of the preparation and publication of the White Paper, was the fact, as alleged by the Minister, that acceptance of this amendment and acceptance of what is in the White Paper would provide a loophole overlooked or unknown to the Minister and his advisers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is very disedifying. It also illustrates the attitude of the Minister and a number of his colleagues to the House.  The fact is that we are now discussing an amendment which proposes to do what the Government proposed to do in their White Paper.  The only real reason advanced by the Minister for not doing what he said he would do in the White Paper and for not accepting this amendment is that to do so would provide a loophole for people to avoid liability for tax.  If that is the reason, I submit we are entitled to ask whether the existence, or the possible existence, of such a loophole was known at the time of the preparation of the White Paper.  If it was known, then one set of circumstances arises.  If it was not known, we are entitled to be told it was overlooked or not adverted to in the preparation of the White Paper if that is what <Col N="682" /> happened.  Why can the Minister not tell us this so that we can get on with the job and understand what we are talking about and why we are doing what the Minister is proposing to do.</P>

I have also asked whether, as a result of the change and the reason given by him for this change from the White Paper, which is not to provide a loophole, that this was so at the time of the White Paper and was overlooked, inadvertently or otherwise.  This is very relevant to consideration of whether this amendment is justified and the proposal in the White Paper was justified, or, alternatively, whether we should accept what is in the Bill.  I can assure the Minister that if he would answer these questions, and he can answer them very briefly with a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;, we will make progress.</P>

      <P>Our best efforts to devise suitable anti-avoidance measures came to naught because there were so many avoidance avenues open that no suitable anti-avoidance measures could be devised.  In order to prevent the Bill becoming unworkable by allowing systems of avoidance in the future, as existed in the past in respect of estate duties, we had to drop our wish not to make transfers of this kind subject to a capital gains tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be under the impression that what he has just said is an answer to my question. He said that a long time ago and thinks I am ignoring the answer he gave but that is not so.  I am well aware of the reason he gave&mdash;the real reason he has given for departure from the White Paper is that to fail to do so would provide a loophole for avoidance.</P>
      <P>I accept that is the reason he has given but that is not the answer to the question I have been asking him. One of the questions I have been asking is: &ldquo;Has there been a change in the circumstances since the White Paper was issued which at the time of the White Paper would not have provided a loophole and now provides one?&rdquo;  Does the Minister appreciate that is a different question from the one he answered?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister can be very stupid and very obstinate when he wants to be.  I am not sure if he is stupid at the moment.  I rather think that in the longer term, he is, but he is certainly being obstinate.  It is not an answer to either of the questions I put to him to say that this change was made as an anti-avoidance measure.  Of course it is an explanation why the change was made.  It is on the basis that that is the reason for the change that I am asking the Minister the question: &ldquo;Was it known when the White Paper was issued that to do what was proposed in the White Paper would provide a loophole?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was believed we could devise a suitable system to close them off.  As I said already every effort made to devise an anti-avoidance measure was frustrated by there being other avoidance avenues open.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time the White Paper was issued, as the Minister knows, it was proposed not to apply the two taxes to the one transaction. The Minister says to follow that through would provide a loophole. I am asking him: &ldquo;Was it known at the time of the White Paper that to follow that through would provide a loophole?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was clearly apparent in certain circumstances it would. No country has exempted the transfers, which we have been contemplating exempting.  The reason they have not done so is that they found it is not possible to devise anti-avoidance measures.  Our wisdom is no greater than the collective wisdom and experience of the world, including many parts of the world that have been operating these taxes for a long time past.  We do not pretend to be superior to these people in wisdom or experience but we have learned by their experience We have endeavoured <Col N="688" /> with all the skills available to us, to devise anti-avoidance measures. It is simply not possible to produce anti-avoidance measures.  As I have said again and again the liability of the two taxes will fall on only a tiny fraction of people.  The additional tax burden will be negligible in relation to the very substantial holdings of wealth these people will have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister said at the end about the small number affected but I will not pursue that.  Accepting that what he says is correct, that other countries have found the same problem and no way around it and that he similarly is unable to find a way around this possible loophole, is it not a fact that all that was known at the time of the White Paper? Therefore, at the time of the White Paper was it envisaged that this loophole would be allowed or was it envisaged it would be closed in some other way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making a little progress.  Could the Minister indicate what way it was proposed to close the loophole?  The reason I am asking this, in case he thinks I am simply trying to waste time on it, is that I believe that the principle involved in this amendment and the principle involved in the statement in the White Paper is the right one and one should not jettison it because of some difficulties in closing the loophole, which the Minister says exists.  I should like to know in what way was it proposed to close the loophole and in what way was that proposal defective?  I should like to be sure there is no way of closing the loophole, which the Minister says exists and which he intended to close.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a very thorough examination and we found <Col N="689" /> it was impossible to do so.  It would be most inappropriate to use Parliament for the purpose of illustrating a multitude of tax-avoidance measures that could be taken.  As I said no country has yet provided a weapon for doing this and it would be extraordinary if we were able to do it.  I have not given up hope.  We have made a number of quite radical and useful departures in tax reform.  We might produce more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To say that no country has succeeded in doing it and therefore it is unlikely that we will do it would seem to suggest that at the time of the White Paper the Minister thought it could be done, despite the fact other countries could not do it.  I have not got all that much faith in the Minister but I have perhaps a little more faith in his advisers.  Therefore I am not entirely convinced that the loophole the Minister says exists could not be closed.</P>
      <P>In regard to the loophole as I understand it what the Minister is saying is that if you did not provide for the payment of both capital acquisition tax and capital gains tax on the one transaction, where both are applicable, people could avoid liability for capital gains, although presumably they would be liable to capital acquisition tax.  Is the Minister's position that the avoidance would be on capital gains rather than on capital acquisition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be avoidance of both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that is not correct? The amendment provides that where capital acquisition tax applies no capital gains tax will apply.  I would not object if it were reversed, that where capital gains tax applies no capital acquisition tax applies.  It is the principle of not paying both I am more concerned with.  If it turned out to be less of a loophole to switch around the position of the two taxes in this amendment, I do not think it would present any great difficulty from our point of view.  If it were to be provided that where there was liability for capital gains there would not be liability for capital acquisition tax, I <Col N="690" /> do not know which would be the greater liability.  Does the Minister accept that if there is liability for one of the taxes one should not be talking about avoidance of liability for the other tax?  He should only be concerned about avoidance of liability for the particular tax being imposed, whichever one it is.</P>
      <P>The point I am trying to make is that if a man is liable for capital gains tax, without being able to avoid it, the fact he would not also be liable for capital acquisition is not of itself a reason for imposing the two.  If he is definitely liable for one of them we should not be concerned about his not being liable for the other.  It is only of the failure to apply both enables him to escape from both that we should be concerned, and that there is a genuine loophole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tax on the capital gain is paid by the donee.  There are two separate people, two separate liabilities for tax.  One pays tax on the business gain and the other pays tax on the advantage he has gained because a gift has been given to him. He does not pay tax unless the amount reaches the threshold, which is £150,000 in respect of a child.  The capital acquisitions tax is payable only on the element of the gift which is above that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the principle of this rather than the details. It seems to me that what the Minister is saying is that we have to ensure the liability for both taxes because they fall on different people although they are in relation to the same transaction&mdash;the Minister does not want to let one out.  I wonder is he right.  As indicated in the White Paper, he contemplates a different situation where the liability would arise only for one tax&mdash;the person involved would be liable for only one tax.  Is it not a misnomer to talk about avoidance when referring to somebody being liable for one tax when, if you do not apply the two taxes, one person will not become liable for the other tax? I do not think that is avoidance in the ordinary sense of the word.  I wonder <Col N="691" /> if the Minister would look at it again because I suggest he is misdirecting himself.  Originally what he contemplated was liability for one tax and the reason he has given us for changing that is he wants to stop avoidance. It seems that what he means by avoidance is avoidance of the other tax. Why should there be two taxes on the one transaction?  The Minister's reason is that two different people have liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Avoidance arises because a person could make a gift to somebody and then get the proceeds of the sale of the gift from the person to whom the gift had been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would that person not be liable to capital acquisitions tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a threshold and it would arise only if the threshold were exceeded.  If a father had a property and gave it to his son, the son could realise it the day afterwards and hand the cash back to the father. There would be no question of a capital gains tax being paid or no question of a capital acquisitions tax being paid either.  Although one might think that might be a simple transaction, at least we would have an anti-avoidance measure.  Money has mercurial qualities.  It is very difficult to come to grips with it.  The proceeds could easily be lost through a multitude of different distributions.  At the other end of that machine there could be the person who got the proceeds of the sale of the gift and in that way escaped liability for capital gains tax. That is one element of avoidance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making this a lot more complex than it need be.  He seems to be visualising a situation in which no liability for either capital gains or capital acquisitions in taxes would arise.  All this amendment seeks is that where liability for capital acquisitions tax arises then no <Col N="692" /> liability for capital gains would arise. That is not the situation envisaged by the Minister because the non-liability would arise in respect of one tax only where liability arose in respect of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the property disposed of was £150,005, there could be a percentage of capital acquisitions tax paid on the excess of more than the threshold figure.  Under the amendment there would be total exemption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that earlier when I said we would not object if it were switched around to provide that where capital gains tax was payable no acquisition tax would be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The opportunity to engage in avoidance practices would be just as open if you were to reverse it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be due to my density, but it is not clear to me why it should be that there would be opportunity for avoidance in any case. We are talking about exemption for one of the taxes which would only arise if a person were liable for the other tax.  Therefore avoidance can only arise in respect of the other party to the transaction.  One tax is being paid, so what is being avoided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be easy to set up an arrangement whereby a person disposing of an asset with a capital gain would pass it on and some element of acquisitions tax would arise.  Under the amendment this liability would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have another look at it, solely on the <Col N="693" /> principle that no exemption arises unless one or other of the taxes is payable&mdash;that unless there is liability for either tax this would not apply at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann condemns the failure of the Government to honour its promises in regard to control of prices; notes with concern the apparent intention to enforce even less strict price control; and calls for the implementation of the various available forms of assistance to industry which will help firms in difficulties without resorting to further price increases.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In putting down this motion for debate by the House I, on behalf of the Opposition, am only reflecting the views of the entire public, irrespective of what their political views might be or might have been on previous occasions. The entire country is shocked and horrified at the rate of inflation that has been allowed to build up and that little serious effort seems to have been made to control prices, in particular, as a major factor in inflation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="694" /> It is no harm to remind the House that in February, 1973, before the last election, a document was brought out which was known as the 14-point plan.  It is a document we do not hear a great deal about in recent times because it has been convenient for the Government to forget about its provisions. Nonetheless, there was such a document which made some impact at the time, and if there was any one point in it that made a special impact on people it was the pledge in that plan, as one of the 14 points, that not alone would prices be controlled much more strictly than they had been up to then, but that they would be stabilised at their March, 1973, figure, when the new Government came in.</P>
    <P>There were many people who were gullible enough to believe that was going to be implemented because it was sold to them on the basis that it could be and would be implemented. We have seen what has happened since. We have seen an inflation rate of less than 10 per cent turn, within 18 months, into an inflation rate of more than 20 per cent.  The last full year for which we have figures is the year to mid-November, 1974, when it was 20 per cent.  I would have thought we would have had the mid-January figures by now, but apparently we have not.  I know the figures are issued only quarterly and there will be no figures until the mid-February figures are issued, which, presumably, will not come out until mid-March or later.</P>
    <P>That promise was given solemnly, that prices were going to be controlled and stabilised at their March, 1973, figure.  I know the 14-point plan did not say that in so many words; it did not say March, 1973, but that is the basis on which this infamous, unfulfilled plan was sold, and this was one of the principal planks in that platform. It was probably the one which made the greatest impact and on which a certain number of people had reliance.</P>
    <P>If Dáil Éireann were to do anything but condemn the failure of the Government to honour its promises in regard to price control, it would make itself look foolish.  The country, needless to say, has never seen anything like <Col N="695" /> the situation we have seen in the last 23 months, and please God we shall never see it again, but while this Government remain in power we cannot be certain we shall not see it again.</P>
    <P>In this motion, having asked the Dáil to condemn the failure of the Government, we go on to ask the Dáil to note with concern the apparent intention to enforce even less strict price control.  This is something I cannot exactly quote day and date for because there have been several conflicting statements from Ministers in relation to this.  They have made statements, contradicted them, contradicted the contradictions, and recontradicted them again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy day and date for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not quite clear where we stand.  In particular, we had the Minister for Transport and Power, answering here in this House for the Minister for Industry and Commerce, saying one thing and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, coming back from abroad or wherever he was, saying another thing, but in general leaving a considerable area of doubt as to what the intentions are in regard to price control.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has indicated that unless price controls are lessened certain firms may be in danger and thereby employment may be in danger.  Unquestionably, many firms are in difficulties at the moment, but there are several ways of getting those firms out of their difficulties and ensuring continuity of employment for their employees, that is, those who have not already lost their employment other than simply the very easy and lazy way out of just letting the firm in question put up its prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as prices generally are concerned, the Government, in ease of their failure to honour their promises &mdash;and even if they had never made these promises they would still have an obligation to control prices&mdash;have blamed outside influences and said these are responsible for the uncontrolled <Col N="696" /> inflation, for the almost uncontrolled rise in prices taking place every day of the week.  This seems to imply that outside influences on this country or any other country never began to have any bearing or influence on the situation until 14th March, 1973, when this Government came into office.  Outside influences always had some bearing, but their bearing at the very most &mdash;and in this I am backed up by the views of the Central Bank&mdash;do not exceed 50 per cent, and 50 per cent of the pressures which lead towards price increases are domestic factors entirely under the control of the Government. That is not just my view.  It is the view of a great many people, including the Central Bank which can be quoted as an authoritative responsible source of commentary on these matters.  If outside influences were responsible for 50 per cent of our inflation, they were responsible in 1974 for a 10 per cent rise in the cost of living but factors which are directly under the control of the Government were responsible for the other half of the increase.  There has been little effort on the part of the Government to endeavour to control that situation.  To give an example&mdash; from the Minister's point of view, perhaps I am picking the best type of example because he and his colleagues have made more noise about the cost of oil than about any other outside factor in price rises&mdash;we are in the situation of not knowing how much offshore oil we have.  We know there is some.  There may be a lot and there are many companies both from Ireland and from various other parts of the world with, apparently, the necessary capital, expertise and equipment who are very anxious to begin searching for that oil.  They are anxious to begin the detailed exploration which would make us aware, within, perhaps, six to 12 months, of how much oil we have.</P>

      <P>Although the Minister for Industry and Commerce is screaming about the effect that oil is having on us, he is refusing to do anything to enable oil which unquestionably we have within our jurisdiction to be obtained and brought into use for the benefit of our country.  This oil would cause a reduction in oil imports and would result also in a reduction in the cost of oil.  The same applies in respect of natural gas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the various steps available to a Government in relation to price controls, the most fundamental is the establishment of a prices commission. This step was taken by Fianna Fáil in mid-1971 at a time when the rate of inflation was less than 8 per cent. Since then that commission have remained in existence.  The scope of their work has been expanded to some extent because they now have more staff but, basically, their terms of reference remain the same as when the commission were established.  If any <Col N="699" /> thing, some matters which were under their control originally have now been removed from their control.  The most important of these were animal feedstuffs and fertilisers which were removed from the supervision of the commission at the beginning of 1974. This step was taken by the Minister for reasons which nobody could ever be clear on although many people have certain suspicions.  There were definite limitations on the powers of the NPC and these are set out in some detail in their December, 1974 report.  This makes interesting reading.  It is a kind of <i>apologia pro vita sua</i> of the commission. The commission&mdash;and this is understandable&mdash;considered it necessary to point out the limitations on what they can do and to enumerate the vast range of activities in respect of which they have no control.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the NPC as such. They should have been given greater powers.  Frequently the argument is made to the NPC that unless certain firms are granted permission to increase prices, they will be in danger, because of their liquidity problems, either of having to close down or of having to cut back on employment.  If any such firms are not subject to the commission&mdash;and a great many are not&mdash;they use this argument as an excuse to increase prices so that they may increase their turnover and cash flow.</P>
    <P>Liquidity is dependent on their having available sufficient money to restock and to build up their capital requirements and assets.  One of the ways in which many firms have been hit badly during the past 12 to 18 months in so far as liquidity is concerned is not so much that of their turnover, although their prices may be controlled, but because of their banks pressing them all the time to reduce their working capital.  Firms are finding this an impossible situation but the only outlet they have in order to try to keep up their liquidity has been continuously to apply for a whole series of price rises.  If the Minister were to approach the banks on the basis that they should ease off these firms, let them increase their borrowings <Col N="700" /> and stop pressing them to repay what they have already borrowed, the pressure of liquidity would be eased and, correspondingly, the pressure to increase prices to make up for that would be eased.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Central Bank have been advising the banks to lend more in certain respects to manufacturing firms.  When they are approached by these firms the bank say: &ldquo;We have not got the money to lend.&rdquo;  The reason they invariably give for not having got the money to lend is that the Government have taken so much from them, through the huge deposits which have to be made to the Central Bank, that they are bled dry so far as lending capital is concerned.  I do not know if this story on the part of the banks is 100 per cent right.  If it is right, clearly the Government should reduce the amount which the Central Bank are being compelled to take and hold all the time from the associated banks. They should ensure that the banks lend much more generously to the manufacturing firms than they are doing.</P>
    <P>Because of the nature of inflation, the tax demands on firms are exceptionally heavy.  Not that the amounts are necessarily any heavier, but because of their liquidity position, they find it impossible to pay.  A gesture was made to them in the budget in this regard, worth over £12 million to every firm in the country as a composite figure.  To make any realistic impact on prices that figure should have been in the region of £50 million or £60 million.  In the very same budget in which this very minimal gesture was made towards helping the liquidity of companies in difficulties in relation to the payment of tax, the interest on outstanding tax, of which there must be a fair bit at the moment, was increased to 18 per cent per annum, simple interest.  When that is compounded it comes out at something over 20 per cent per annum.  Of course, this is a brutal imposition on firms who already find it extremely difficult to pay the tax they owe.  They are in arrears and find enormous problems arising from their liquidity position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> The Government have also open to them the whole question of the readjustment of VAT rates.  In England there is a flat rate of 8 per cent across the board.  Here we have three rates basically.  There is a fourth rate which applies in certain circumstances.  The two top rates are extremely high by any standard.  By comparison with Britain they are extremely high, and by comparison with most, but not all, European countries they are also extremely high.  Although they have problems of their own so far as prices are concerned, most of those countries have not problems anything like ours.</P>
    <P>Governments elsewhere have adjusted the system of indirect taxation to take account of price rises and to take account of the difficulties created by flat rates of tax.  Governments elsewhere recognise that every time there is a price rise the Exchequer benefits by it.  Every time the price of any commodity which is subject to VAT goes up here, the Government get more out of it.  To a great extent the Government have a vested interest in increased prices inasmuch as every time the price of something goes up they get more into their own coffers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most obvious of all the various steps open to the Government to take, which they are not taking at the moment, is the question of subsidies, and in particular subsidies on food.  In Britain certain commodities such as butter, milk, and so on, which are paid for, for the most part, out of EEC funds, are subsidised.  The farmers throughout Europe are getting much the same prices.  If there is any difference our farmers seem to be getting somewhat less, unfortunately, than the farmers in other countries. In Britain, to take one example of a commodity which is virtually in everyday use, butter costs just over 50 per cent of what it costs here.  The difference in price is made up almost exclusively by subsidies which the British Government are prepared to pay in order to keep down the price of butter and many other commodities which are vitally necessary.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months we have had some brutal increases in prices, and <Col N="702" /> particularly in food prices, so much so, that pensioners and other lower paid people find it very hard to buy ordinary day-to-day food.  Instead of buying a week's supply, perhaps they buy a three or four-days' supply.  It is very irritating for an Irish housewife in a Border town on our side of the Border, say, in Monaghan or Dundalk, to see butter in her shops at 41½p, 42p or 42½p per lb. and to know that five miles away in Newry or some other town just over the Border, exactly the same butter, probably manufactured here in the Republic, is on sale for 22p, 23p or 23½p per lb.  We are told that we must put up with that situation.  Allegedly this is one of the necessary consequences of the EEC.  Allegedly it is one of the necessary consequences of the, happily, much better prices our farmers are getting as a result of our entry into the EEC which the Minister and his colleagues did so much to try to prevent.</P>
    <P>The implementation of price control seems to be geared, in so far as it exists, towards the retailer and at no other level.  Any kind of objective view of the problems which are giving rise to price rises, taken as a whole, would show that the real problem arises at the production and manufacturing level.  Little or nothing is done to encourage better internal methods of production, better control of costings at that level.  The whole effort is made and is seen to be made at retail level. With the huge variety of goods on offer in most retail shops, and with constant price rises, the retailer cannot be expected to be 100 per cent accurate in every price, in every week. We know only too well that the price of many commodities can vary, not just from month to month which was bad enough at one time, but nowadays from week to week.</P>
    <P>Increases in the price to farmers for beef and milk were announced within the past week after an EEC decision. Inevitably, unless subsidies are introduced, there will be further increases, within the next couple of weeks at the outside, to the consumer in the price of all these items.  Butter, milk, cheese and meat are fundamental basic <Col N="703" /> necessities for everyday life.  Their prices have been going up and up, and they will go up again.  With all the extra money which, happly, is coming into the country as a result of our entry into the EEC, and having regard to the good prices farmers are getting for beef and milk, surely it is possible for the Government to devote some of the extra money coming into the Exchequer to the subsidisation of these essential commodities, as has been done in Britain very successfully.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Government have constantly argued is that world commodity prices have been going up; what has to be brought in from abroad is going up and they have no control. It is well worthwhile studying the trends in world commodity prices over the past 12 months and the Minister would be well advised to do so.  While they vary to some extent, the overwhelming impression one gets, looking at the trend, in nearly all world commodity prices, is that they have all dropped, some of them very substantially indeed, over the past 12 months. Most metals have dropped.  So have a great many other commodities essential either at the food level or as part of the manufacturing process.  One of the things people do not realise is that the world price of timber has dropped very substantially in the last nine months or so.  Unfortunately, we are in the position that we are unable to avail of this drop because our suppliers here are fully stocked at prices that were ruling about a year ago and they have been unable to move the timber because of the disastrous slump in the building industry over the same period.  It is no harm to emphasise the fairly continual drop in commodity prices, particularly those which affect our situation; that excuse is no longer available to the Government.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is one sphere in which the Government cannot, as they have been trying to do, wash their hands of responsibility so far as price rises and price control are concerned. I refer to the price rises they themselves have deliberately as a matter of policy imposed on the people.  I shall give five or six examples only over <Col N="704" /> the past three months alone.  Over the past 23 months I could find ten times as many examples.  I am confining myself to the last three months because I can give quite a number of very telling examples where the increase, very often a huge increase, was deliberately imposed by the Government as a matter of policy.  In the last 18 months postal charges have been deliberately increased by the Government by 75 per cent.  The cost of posting an ordinary letter 18 months ago was 4 pence.  It is now 7 pence, or almost 1s 6d in terms of old money.  The Government cannot claim that wages or costs forced them to impose that increase because the increase in costs would actually be less than one-third of the actual increase imposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Television licences have been increased on average by 40 per cent. Health contributions have been increased by over 80 per cent.  These charges are charges deliberately and directly imposed by the Government and by no one else.  In one five minutes here at the end of November the Government by a surreptitious backdoor method increased the already very high cost of petrol by 15 pence a gallon on the spurious suggestion that, in doing so, they were doing the country a service by encouraging people to use less.  It was not the Arabs who increased the price of petrol by 15 pence a gallon at the end of last November.  It was this Government increased the price of petrol and the Minister and his colleagues in the Cabinet have collective responsibility for that, whether they know it or not and whether they act that way or not.</P>
    <P>Following on the dodge at the end of November we had the health contributions budget at the beginning of December and the withdrawal of the subsidy on butter.  The latter caused a further increase in the price of butter. In the middle of January of this year we had another budget&mdash;the Government actually called it a budget&mdash; which had the effect of putting up the cost-of-living index by 2 per cent to 2½ per cent, and that at a time when the Government were asking <Col N="705" /> for rigid restraint in wage and salary demands, saying there is nothing they can do about prices, they are very sorry, and all the rest of it.  They deliberately came in here and put a huge increase on tobacco, spirits and beer, deliberately putting up the cost-of-living index by 2 per cent to 2½ per cent.  They made all sorts of glib comments to the effect that people should not be smoking and drinking. The fact is the great majority smoke or drink or do both and they will continue to do so.  If they did not continue to do so the 2½ per cent rise in the cost of living would not take place.  But we know now as a result of what has happened, that it is very likely that in the 12 months to November, 1975, the cost-of-living index will rise by not less than 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The criterion on which to judge whether or not a country had entered the Banana Republic league was whether its annual rate of inflation had reached 20 per cent.  We, of course, have reached that now and we are set fair to exceed it considerably in the months ahead.  In addition to that, in the last budget there was yet another major tax increase to which very few people have adverted because we have not yet got the details of how much it will be.  I refer to the increase in the social welfare stamp.  The worker will have to pay his share of the stamp and that is just as much a tax on him as income tax is.  Its deduction from his pay packet is not made any sweeter for him by calling it a social welfare contribution rather than an income tax contribution.  On the day of the budget we made several efforts to discover exactly what the increase would be.  The Minister for Finance sat mute. He did not say he did not know.  He did know but he refused to answer. The probability is that the cost of the stamp may be doubled.  It is already pretty high.  I suppose the Government think they are making a contribution there towards lowering prices. They are doing nothing other than making yet another hidden price increase as a matter of deliberate Government policy following on the pattern they set when they raised the VAT rates.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to acknowledge <Col N="706" /> that there are limitations in certain aspects to what a Government can do.  Possibly one-third of price increases are beyond their control, but there is one thing any Government most assuredly can do at any time and that is refrain from deliberately driving up costs.  Where State service commodities such as postage have to be increased the increase should be the absolute minimum instead of three times more than is necessary.  This country is practically punch drunk from the way it has been hit since the advent of this Government in the matter of prices.  The situation has got so bad that many people are almost despairing.  They see the Government have given up the battle psychologically and in practice of trying to control prices.  All I can say to these people is that they will have an opportunity of making their comment at the next general election. They can then pass judgment on the flagrantly cynical way in which one of the famous 14 points, that in relation to the stabilisation of prices, has been dealt with.  That is the only effective opportunity those people have.  I hope sincerely they will avail of it.  If Dáil Éireann were to vote honestly for once and if those behind the Minister were to express in public what they freely express in private, the motion I am now proposing would certainly be passed.</P>

      <P>The hustings are not yet and I think this motion deserves more serious treatment than the sort of church gate tub-thumping oratory it received this evening.  It is interesting from this side to observe how rapidly psychologically the Opposition have settled into the mental attitude of permanent Opposition as expressed by the total irresponsibility and unreality of the criticism that is offered.  One would expect that people who relatively recently knew what the <Col N="707" /> decisions of office were like would at least for a little longer retain a sense of responsibility.  We have not found it.  We have found a totally negative approach, so easy if there are better solutions to our own and then, as I have said elsewhere, either we would accept them as being obviously wise and correct, in which case the Opposition would be dictating policy, or else we would reject them because they came from the Opposition in which case we would seem to be playing party politics with a serious situation. If they had better suggestions it is so easy to seize the initiative and to seize the leadership of the country.  Instead of that we see the sort of tendentious juggling with statistics and the sort of totally destructive taking of positions which are at simple variance with recently held positions in a way that I will show.</P>
      <P>Most of what Deputy O'Malley had to say related to issues that are not relevant to his spokesmanship or to my Department and much of what he had to say was not relevant to the current crisis of inflation.  It may be that he wants to be the spokesman on Finance as well as the spokesman on Industry and Commerce, which is perhaps a legitimate aspiration, but I do not propose within the Standing Orders of the House to follow him into the areas to which he devoted so much time where he talked of financial matters except in the matter of VAT which is so marvellously ridiculous and such a perfect example of the shortness of memory.  I remember when VAT was introduced by the previous Government.  We in Opposition suggested that food should not carry VAT.  We were argued down and voted down.

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At the moment yes, and they should have been there over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a clear answer on that.  We will come to the facing in all directions about costs in a minute.  Deputy O'Malley gave the example of butter.  He said it costs 41p to 42p a lb here and 22p a lb in the UK.  To reduce the price of butter by 15p a lb here would cost £12.4 million, to reduce it by 20p would cost something over £16 million.  Deputy O'Malley has just said explicitly that he wants subsidies on food but if that is the cost for butter, the amount for milk, cheese, tea, flour, bread and sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>And detergents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;would be £80 million or £90 million.  It is a serious question as to whether that is an appropriate way to spend £80 million or £90 million.  I think subsidies are a sort of blunderbus instrument which reduces the price to every consumer and if I had £80 million I would rather spend it in a more precisely targeted way.  At this moment, at a time when the needs for stimulating the economy in specific ways are pretty clear to everyone, I am prepared to say what I would rather do.  I would rather spend it on social welfare and on stimulating the building industry and what I had left over from that I would rather spend in other ways.  The luxury of Opposition is to create cash at a flash of the tongue which is not possible with the realities of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that what Deputy O'Malley said merits analysis but I will at least try to pay him the compliment of analysing what he said. He talked about what we were doing wrong in regard to the banks.  He said we were bleeding the banks dry. However, he has just asked for subsidies which would involve, at the sort of rate we talked about, another £60 <Col N="710" /> million, £80 million or £90 million. To come from where?  From the banks that we are already bleeding dry or from overseas borrowing?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The money will come back to the banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the Deputies opposite think the banks should lend more generously?  Can they tell us with what?  Are they saying that the tax demand should be reduced by £50 million or £60 million?  It is perfectly simple and easy for an Opposition to say that a Government must give out more and take in less in taxation.  That is very easy, even luxurious, but it is irrelevant to the real dilemmas that exist.  With regard to VAT on food, the people who at one moment say, &ldquo;put VAT on food&rdquo; and a little later, having opposed its removal, who cry not only for its removal but also for subsidies, are blowing with every wind, are looking for every cheap onslaught which is irrelevant, do not recognise the situation and are hard to take seriously.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley made a point about world commodity prices.  It is true that many world commodity prices have stayed up in price but many have declined.  However, not having thought his way through it or having teased out what he meant, he argued, at a time when people are locked into commodities they purchased when prices were high, that we should use price control more rigorously. He gave the example of the timber industry; this was a good example because throughout the country there are people, as the Deputy correctly realised, who are locked into stocks which they bought at high prices and they are in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we tease out what using price control in regard to the timber industry really means, does the Deputy suggest we bankrupt the people in the industry?  Surely he does not want to do that&mdash;I am not putting words into his mouth.  However, what does he suggest we do?  Does he not recognise that the value of a rigorous price control is at a time when prices are rising, not when prices of raw materials have reached a plateau? With an innuendo he did not have <Col N="711" /> the courage to follow or to put on the record of the House, he gave the example of the price of animal feedingstuffs. I will defend the record because once the dramatic rises were over for animal feedingstuffs and with prices on a plateau and eroding we have had the functioning of a normal price mechanism in animal feedingstuffs which has given the farmers better value than price control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the various components of prices.  We have recommendations to spend almost £100 million on food subsidies. The British have done it and they have had the effect of a one percentage point or a two percentage point influence on the cost-of-living index. In any event they will have to phase them out soon so that there is a deferred effect.</P>
      <P>The prices the farmers get are Community prices.  As Deputy O'Malley correctly remarked, I am critical of the Community but the one advantage I gave to joining the Community&mdash;I did not think it would last forever but I always acknowledged it would come on entry&mdash;was higher prices for farmers. For decades we laboured under the British cheap food system and we are glad to be out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Does Deputy O'Malley think the farmers should not get the prices?  Is he against it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I made it perfectly clear I was delighted they were getting the prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Deputy does not want the price mechanism to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The British farmers are getting the same prices or even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the nine countries, the British have a small agricultural <Col N="713" /> sector and a big industrial sector, they have food subsidies that are transitory, which they have agreed they must phase out, which are extremely expensive and are not appropriately targetted. The Deputy believes in subsidies but I think they are a blunt instrument. I am in favour of the farmers getting the price&mdash;perhaps I am prejudiced.  If I am in favour of that, I acknowledge the consequences and I do not look for evasions by diverting a great deal of money into subsidies which in a country like this, with our structure of population and industry, we do not have available.</P>
      <P>With regard to fertilisers, the source is imported oil, imported urea, imported phosphate and we have some development indigenously based on imported raw materials.  Does the Deputy suggest we should not buy fertilisers, that we should not use them?  Of course he does not, but how does he suggest we get them?  Is he suggesting that NET are making exorbitant profits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they not making more profit than private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In no context is the manufacturer of fertilisers, either public or private, making an exorbitant profit.  The source of the fertiliser increase is what people in West Africa are charging for phosphate, what people are charging for oil and urea. There is the choice&mdash;either do not buy it or pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that in the latest list of price increases the prices charged by NET are higher than those charged by other private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>For comparable items the price is comparable.  However, the products are not always identical. As I understand the situation, I disagree with the Deputy.  The point I have made about fertilisers applies to import prices in general.  Do we not buy, in which case whole sectors of our industry do not function, or do we buy and pay?  Apart from what I am calling the Ard-Fheis type of contribution, what is the way out of <Col N="714" /> that situation?  I did not hear anything. If we come to profits, we have at the middle of 1975, the end of the AIFTA, the approximation of the abolition of barriers to imports with the UK.  By 1977 we have the abolition of barriers with the Community.  If we are to get advantage rather than destruction from a free trade situation of 280 million to 300 million people we have to allow industry to get a bit of volume, to get some profit, to get re-equipment, design and development and to get efficient.  Is the Deputy against profits for industry?</P>
      <P>I would not accuse Deputy O'Malley, who is realistic but is, perhaps, new to what he is talking about, of being against profits for industry. In regard to the wage-cost guidelines that we have announced&mdash;we have guidelines for the National Prices Commission&mdash;it is fine uttering great broadsides of general opposition, but is the Deputy against the widened guidelines we have announced?  These guidelines allow for settlements arrived at under the Labour Court conciliation officers.  In my view they are properly a part of increased labour costs.  I do not believe in bankrupting industries; I believe in letting them earn a little gravy, become more efficient and grow a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to liquidity problems, which Deputy O'Malley referred to, we have permitted some increases where specific submissions are made to the National Prices Commission and under no other heading, not for increased raw materials, not for increased labour costs but because liquidity was too tight.  We are prepared to entertain the concept that a price application can be made to improve liquidity and, indeed, to give price increases to improve liquidity.  Is Deputy O'Malley for or against that?  He has to choose.  If he does not want to choose he can fire off the sort of general material that his speech consisted of; but if he is serious he ought to choose, he ought to say whether he was for VAT on food or against it, whether he is for the changed and widened wage guidelines; price increases are allowable to improve a <Col N="715" /> firm's liquidity because that is a way to improve liquidity.  The Deputy owes it, as the spokesman of the largest party in the country, to make his position clear on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I was out of order the Chair would have stopped me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the Deputy was out of order but if he puts down a motion to me to be dealt with by me he should talk about things that are within my competence and are appropriate for me to reply to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy chose, in the rather widely formulated resolution, to talk about a particular section.  There is another aspect that I should like to talk about.  It is an area where <Col N="716" /> there is acute concern at present and where the Opposition, by their irresponsibility, have been damaging the national interest and the work we have been trying to do.  I am talking about the area of import controls. Deputy O'Malley referred to lots of things that did not arise in the terms of his resolution but he did not refer to that which in my view is relevant on the question of assistance to industry.</P>
    <P>In so far as I am aware the first person to raise the matter of import controls was myself and I did so on the occasion of the Shoe Fair in Dún Laoghaire.  From there we went to the European Commission to invoke the protection we believed we were entitled to under the terms of the Accession Treaty.  It is perfectly thinkable in those circumstances, and for those who are willing to stop and think about it it is obvious, that the policy of the Commission, faced with the desire of many of the member states to resort to protection, would be to try to force action on to those member states and to avoid taking action at Commission level. The whole strategy of our approach, while we did all that was available to us, was not to trumpet that from the rooftops but to force the Commission to act.</P>
    <P>We found an irresponsible Opposition, unaware of the difficulties and simply concerning themselves, as has been the case over the week-end and is the case today, not to be constructive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The week-end has certainly got under the Minister's skin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not got under my skin but the mood of the week-end has carried itself on in here and just as the contribution here was destructive and negative so was the attitude of the week-end destructive and negative.  I am illustrating the way the destructive and negative aspects of Opposition came to the fore in an important area where, if Deputy O'Malley had been familiar with his brief or had been anxious to help, he might have seen fit to make reference. <Col N="717" /> In relation to the Community we did, in regard to the use of our licensing arrangements, restrict the importation of products available here.  In regard to our surveillance mechanism, in regard to the anti-dumping procedures available to us and in regard to things that the Opposition and Government are familiar with but that are not appropriate to discuss, we took all steps available to us but we did not trumpet them from the rooftops.  We did not do so because we were anxious to have the Commission fulfil its responsibility and not pass the buck back to us.</P>
      <P>An understanding, an intelligent, a helpful, a subtle, an able Opposition plays the game of our opponents by trumpeting from the rooftops that we are doing nothing and by making the situation easy for the Commission to say we should be doing this, that and the other.  The Opposition played their game, damaged what we were trying to do and harmed our industry in the process.  If they want examples of where their irresponsibility, their foolishness, and their desire to do damage and to gloat in a difficult situation can get one, that is the perfect example.</P>

      <P>We must make excuses for the Deputy because he is new to his spokesmanship and he has to play himself in.  However, he is saying foolish and irresponsible things that are damaging in just the way the particular instance I gave him was damaging to our national interest.  We have seen the perfect example in this debate, and we had it in the last session about the textile and footwear industries and again in the debate on my Estimate, that there is a glee, and the cliché is &ldquo;unholy&rdquo; in this case, that because for reasons that are worldwide the economy here like every other economy in the market world is in difficulty.  There is the classic dog in the manger attitude; if they cannot eat, they will not allow <Col N="718" /> anybody else to eat it; if they cannot run this country, they want to wreck it.  The Opposition have not had a single practical, helpful, constructive thing to say.</P>
      <P>If you had better leadership you could take the leadership of this country away from us in a moment by displaying that leadership but all you can do is whine in as damaging a way as possible.  This is the shallow, bankrupt contribution, a desire to hurt, to wreck; the dog in the manger &mdash;God help us.  If that is what Opposition has brought you to, you are guaranteeing that you will be there for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at a Minister coming here and literally saying nothing for the past half-hour, a Minister who, when on this side of the House and when he went before the electorate, promised rigid price control.  They fooled the people in the last general election that they would be able to introduce price control and bring down prices, particularly food prices.  The Minister is on record here as saying that the then Government was doing nothing to control prices, and what he would do if he was in power.  Now he is in power and we shall see what his record has been. Inflation was at 8 per cent in this country two years ago when Fianna Fáil left office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the 12 months' period it was at 8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we have it running at 20 per cent.  The Minister said nothing about what he did to control prices since he took office.  To give <Col N="719" /> one example, the price of cattle at that time was roughly £20 per ton, according to the National Prices Commission in January-February, 1973.  The same cattle dropped to £12 by November, 1974, according to the commission.  In the case of beef sold in butchers' shops or wholesale the drop was insignificant.  In most cases the price was the same; in some cases it was 1p or at most 2p per lb. less. The Minister got into a flurry in November when the farmers were crying out that the bottom had dropped out of the cattle market and he ordered butchers to reduce the price of meat by 5p per lb. for any beef over 50p per lb.</P>
      <P>What was the Minister doing in the period before that when cattle prices were dropping gradually over the whole year while the price of meat remained the same?  The fact that they did not go to the Prices Commission for an increase in price was no reason for the Minister and the Department not to monitor prices, not to exert pressure, or make an order to reduce the price. Even 5p was too little to suggest as a reduction at that time.  That was something at which they should have been taking a very hard look because they were the people who were saying that beef had become a luxury which the people were unable to buy.  They did nothing to reduce the price when it was being considerably reduced to the producer.</P>
      <P>Not only was the price not reduced but the butchers were able to qualify for the slaughter premium introduced in September, a further subsidy which should have brought down the price of beef lower and which, if passed on to the consumer, would have reduced the price much more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government aimed at building 25,000 houses each year but while they have been in office the price of houses has gone up 31 per cent.  There is a scarcity of money for people who want to buy houses and there has been large-scale unemployment in the private housing sector.  Because of the Government's financial policy we have not been able to get people to invest in building societies to provide loans for <Col N="720" /> those houses.  The Government could have increased SDA loans, as we suggested, up to £6,000 and reduced the income limit to £3,000.</P>
    <P>Inflation here is now running at 20 per cent but the Germans have been able to keep it at 8 per cent.  When the Government took office, inflation in Germany was around 5 per cent and in their case it increased by 3 per cent.  Some other countries were not as successful as Germany and inflation has increased considerably in them but in none of them has there been anything like the inflation we have had here in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The massive increase in prices in this country has brought us to the stage when the economy is <Col N="721" /> nearly breaking down.  This is the cause of the large-scale unemployment we have had in the past four or five months.  It is due to the failure of the present Government effectively to control price increases.  They are saying it is foreign based and they have no control over foreign prices.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank reported that 50 per cent of this is our own doing.  If we had effective control over those prices we could have kept our rate of inflation within manageable proportions, had more people in employment, our firms would be able to maintain exports and would not lose markets, as happened in the past few months.  It shows how futile and disheartened the Prices Commission are when their chairman said, as far back as last November, that the day was fast coming when the Commission would have to give up some of their control over price increases.  They also said they were not able to process all the applications they got because they were coming in at such a fast rate. If we had taken control over prices in 1973 and early 1974, we would not have this trouble.</P>
      <P>The Commission are permitting price increases for at least 100 different items every month.  At least half the number of firms which would in the normal course apply for increases have not done so because the Minister said they were too small.  They also said it would affect employment if they had to apply for price increases because the Commission would not be able to process them quickly enough. That is a sad reflection on any Department. If the Revenue Commissioners are collecting money, they employ more staff and get on top of their problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we compare the number of firms who have applied for price increases in March, 1973, with the number applying at the present time, we find the number is about 50 per cent fewer.  I tried to question the Minister last autumn about this.  He went all around the world to avoid giving an answer and made excuses why it was not possible to do this.  He knew the answer only too well but did not want to let himself down because when in <Col N="722" /> Opposition he was one person who advocated strict price control.</P>
    <P>The other part of this motion deals with assistance for firms in difficulty. When we have inflation running at 20 per cent and over, as at present, it is very difficult for firms to keep afloat.  The Minister for Finance had a wonderful opportunity in the budget to help those firms in some way.  The increased value of stocks held by the firms should have been compared with the year before.  The Minister need not have looked for tax on those increases although inflation was running at 20 per cent.  His only concession was to leave the tax over for two years.  Those firms really needed help.  They had not made an increased profit.  They had the same amount of stock on the 1st January and at the end of the financial year but, as I said, inflation had increased by 20 per cent.  The Revenue Commissioners are taking at least 50 per cent of this increase in tax.  In my view, this is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>These firms should have been given a chance to reinvest in their businesses because, as the Minister said on numerous occasions, firms need to reinvest to keep competitive and provide employment.  This Government are so hard up that they are trying every way they can to collect money into their coffers to keep afloat. When they took office over two years ago, this country was in a very healthy state.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Malley mentioned, the price of fertilisers&mdash;the 10.10.20 used for tillage crops&mdash;has increased from £50 to £100 roughly.  The Minister mentioned that these products were imported, as were oil, phosphates and other raw materials and all have increased in price.  A mine in County Clare used to produce phosphates until it became uneconomic.  We should explore the possibility of producing our own phosphates again, Under present prices, this would possibly be cheaper than the imported raw material from North Africa and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>At present people are prospecting for oil in the Celtic Sea.  They are terrified of present Government <Col N="723" /> policy.  They are drilling around nine holes, corking them and then leaving them because if they drilled the tenth hole they would have to develop the field.  They are waiting to see if it is possible that this Government will leave office and then they will get a Government which will let them develop for the betterment of this country.</P>

      <P>When we adjourned I was suggesting to the Minister that he might consider, in relation to this amendment, an alternative by which there would be applied either capital gains tax or capital acquisitions tax to one transaction, whichever was the higher.  Would the Minister give some further consideration to this or consider some variant to it?  If he did he would find there would not be avoidance in the sense that whichever was going to yield the greater amount to the Exchequer would be the tax applied.  At the same time he would maintain the principle adumbrated in the White Paper of not applying both <Col N="724" /> taxes to the one transaction.  I appreciate that one tax is payable by one party and another by another, but the Minister accepted in the White Paper that in such a case payment of one tax would be sufficient.  If he gives some further consideration to something on the lines I have suggested he might be able to achieve what he originally proposed to achieve in the White Paper and at the same time close the loophole to which he has referred and which he has put forward as the main reason for rejecting this amendment and departing from the proposals in the White Paper.</P>

      <P>I doubt if there is a general realisation of the fact that capital gains tax liability can arise in regard to a marriage settlement and it is as well to have it on the record of the House that this is clearly envisaged in this section.  Now I wish to refer to a matter that is absent from the Bill but if it were in the Bill it should be in this section, the question of group relief for companies.  I should like to quote from the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry for 4th February last. I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the provisions under consideration for group relief in the forthcoming Corporation Tax Bill, the confederation sees no reason why the new Bill on Capital Gains Tax should not incorporate group relief for capital gains tax purposes. No real gain can be realised for the benefit of the shareholders in a transfer of assets from one company to another within a group.  There should be no charge to capital gains <Col N="728" /> tax on the disposal of assets until the asset is disposed of outside the group or until a group company within the group may leave that group.  It is essential that the businesses should be allowed the flexibility to move around plant and machinery within the same group without incurring tax liability.</P>
    <P>It seems to me there is quite a valid point made by the CII.  When I raised this on Second Stage the Minister said it was intended to deal with this point in general in the Corporation Tax Bill when introduced.  I think he said that in the meantime persons who felt aggrieved could appeal to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am not sure that is a satisfactory situation.  Perhaps I might start by asking whether in the Corporation Tax Bill the Minister intends to deal specifically with capital gains as between groups of companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet settled with the parliamentary draftsman the precise lay-out of the Corporation Tax Bill but I expect it will need to be handled differently.  It is something about which I do not wish to come to a conclusion at present. We propose to deal with this matter in the corporation tax legislation because it is in such legislation we ought to bring together the law as it affects corporations.  That Bill will include provision to cover taxation of capital gains accruing to members of a group of companies.  We will also be dealing with the corporation tax situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite sure that is what he intends to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is appropriate that corporation tax liability should be brought together in one measure.  As I said on Second Stage, pending introduction of that legislation, any company that think they are adversely affected by the absence of group treatment in this Bill may apply to the Revenue Commissioners who will consider the granting of relief in any cases of genuine hardship.  They have the administrative power to do that.  Companies may be assured their cases will receive a genuine hearing and that assistance and relief will be given where appropriate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Revenue Commissioners have power in certain circumstances to grant relief, but is it quite clear that they have power, if necessary, to grant total relief in cases such as are contemplated by the Minister and myself at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, where cases of hardship arise relief is given. While I am not in a position to say that the discretion will be exercised in all cases in which the potential taxpayer might consider it would be appropriate to exercise it in his favour, by and large it is an administrative arrangement which operates satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister refers to companies or taxpayers who may feel aggrieved.  Since there is no provision in this Bill, in what circumstances should they reasonably feel aggrieved? By what standards do the Revenue Commissioners judge the legitimacy or otherwise of their sense of grievance? In other words, is it intended to provide the kind of thing that is sought by the CII in the extract from their newsletter which I read out, that is, that businesses would be allowed the flexibility to move around plant and machinery within the same group without incurring tax liability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how flexibly we interpret flexibility but, broadly, that is the intention, and, pending the introduction of the corporation tax legislation, the Revenue Commissioners will give administratively the relief which will be given in the Corporation Tax Bill eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a somewhat unsatisfactory position, in that it is not unreasonable to expect that the Corporation Tax Bill will not be enacted for quite some time.  It has yet, according to what the Minister has said, to come from the parliamentary draftsman, and with the other procedures that will have to be followed before it can be circulated and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, a substantial interval will elapse before it is enacted, but in the meantime groups of companies will be dependent on making appeals to the Revenue Commissioners, <Col N="730" /> on a basis which is not specified anywhere, against their treatment as being unfair or inequitable, without their being in a position to point to what would be fair or equitable according to the law.</P>
      <P>It would be far better if the provisions relating to capital gains tax treatment of groups of companies were incorporated in this Bill and, if necessary, repealed and re-enacted in the Corporation Tax Bill.  If that is not done, it is expecting taxpayers who, in some cases, would be very substantial taxpayers of capital gains in certain circumstances, to operate with the Revenue Commissioners, neither side knowing with any degree of certainty at all what is the correct way to operate or what is the law on the subject.  That is an indefensible position and I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider it and to spell out the provisions in this Bill; then if for tidying up purposes he wants to incorporate them in the Corporation Tax Bill, he can incorporate them in that and repeal them in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have already complained about the size and complexity of this Bill.  It is some comfort to know that it would be twice as bad if we were also to deal in this Bill with the company group treatment under the capital gains code.  The general provisions have already been specified in the Government's White Paper on corporation tax, and the scheme proposed is similar to the scheme which is already in operation in Britain and with which most accountants and tax consultants will already be familiar.</P>

      <P>The broad scope of the capital gains code as applied to groups of companies is, as I said, generally understood by the business community, and I am quite certain they will be grateful to have it brought within the Corporation Tax Bill, in one measure rather than to have it in two. While I can see the point Deputy Colley is making, that we could put it in here and transfer it later into the other Bill, it would make this Bill a very clumsy one.  It is much easier to have, as we are proposing to have, clean Bills that deal with each individual problem.  It is only people who would be concerned with corporation tax and capital gain on groups of companies who would need to know about this.  Therefore it is better to leave it outside this Bill altogether and to have it in a tidy and as concise as possible Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have as great a desire to see a clean Bill as the Minister has, but we are talking about a tidying operation, and I do not think that is a sufficient justification for leaving a substantial group of taxpayers and, indeed, the Revenue Commissioners, up in the air as to how capital gains tax legislation is to be applied to their activities, when we are enacting a Capital Gains Tax Bill.  I feel sure the Minister agrees in principle with what I am saying and that the difficulty he faces is partially what he said and also the fact that he does not have available at the moment the actual terms which would be applied to the handling of capital gains tax among companies. However, that is not an insuperable difficulty, and it would be possible, I am sure, between now and the next Stage for the Minister to have amendments prepared which would incorporate this.  It is not the ideal solution, <Col N="732" /> I freely admit, because it would be untidy and we would have to repeal this in due course.  Nevertheless, it is wrong in principle that a very important part of the capital gains tax legislation, with possibly very important repercussions, should not be spelled out in any way and that it should be operated on groups of companies without they or the Revenue Commissioners knowing precisely what the law is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean the taxpayers. We are not dealing here with individual people with little knowledge or understanding.  We are dealing with companies that are in groups, and they are usually well advised financially. If such groups or their representative organisations or professional organisations or accountants have any doubt at all about the matter, they can be assured that the Revenue Commissioners will give every possible assistance and advice. I would propose to say as much to the CII.  I have seen their recent submission to which I propose to reply shortly telling them that, if they are in any doubt as to the applicability of the relief which is proposed under the corporation tax code in relation to capital gains tax, the Revenue Commissioners will be only too happy to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position, then, that so far as such taxpayers are concerned, if they are to try to determine whether any transaction would be liable to capital gains tax, the only yardstick they would have for guidance would be the British legislation? The same would be true of the Revenue Commissioners if they are asked to advise such taxpayers on certain problems.  Is it not true also that, while the Bill before the House is similar substantially to the corresponding legislation in Britain, there <Col N="733" /> are some significant differences, one of which was referred to earlier by Deputy Belton&mdash;that was the treatment of capitalised interest?  Is there any guarantee for taxpayers who might be involved potentially as members of corporations or companies or for the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with their applications that the legislation in Britain will be followed to a very significant degree?  I would not mind some minor changes but a change such as the non-allowance on capitalisation of interest would be a major change.  In the absence of this matter being spelled out, where will the taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners stand?</P>

      <P>I cannot presume to say what Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann may decide, but I can say my intention is to do as we said we would in the White Paper on corporation tax.  It is fair to point out that the postponement of corporation tax legislation was sought by the business community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have missed a point made earlier by the Minister and to which he has referred now. Did he say that it was intended to deal with capital gains as between groups of companies in precisely the same way as it is intended to deal with corporation tax between groups of companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to deal substantially with it in the same way, to provide the relief on a somewhat similar system.  Relief would be given appropriately within the group of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore they would be the grounds on which the Revenue Commissioners would base their advice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Deputy is right in saying that the taxpayer is entitled to know the law, to know whether he is putting himself in peril. While we are endeavouring to change the laws we will have unfortunately some periods of uncertainty.  The mere announcement of change generates uncertainty but this is inescapeable. In regard to the postponement <Col N="734" /> sought by the business community in general, I was only too willing to accede to a delay because I thought it desirable to have more time in which to complete the draftsmanship in what was a very difficult and complicated area.  In the meantime anybody having any problem, or who may think that the details are not sketched sufficiently already in the White Paper, may communicate with the Revenue Commissioners and, contrary to their general image, the Revenue Commissioners are as willing to advise taxpayers on their non-liability to tax as on their liability.  The people and their advisers with whom we are dealing here are well up.  We are not dealing with a non-sophisticated and non-skilled group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's description of the kind of taxpayers that are involved but I am happier to think of them and the Revenue Commissioners relying on the White Paper on corporation tax rather than on the British legislation.  I take it that the White Paper on corporation tax will be the framework on which both the taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners can operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing to do in order to avoid any uncertainty is for anybody who is concerned about this matter to communicate with the Revenue Commissioners so that any element of divergence as between the White Paper and the British system of legislation can be pointed out.  In order to assist such people we will take some initiative now by notifying all major organisations of the Revenue Commissioners being available to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this to be an unsatisfactory way of dealing with the matter but in view of what the Minister has said I presume it will be practicable to operate on this basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to revert to a matter I referred to earlier&mdash;the question of liability for capital gains tax not arising where there is a liability for income tax, that is, on the same monetary gain which, in some cases, could be deemed to be income.  Section 115, <Col N="735" /> subsection (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides that:</P>
    <P>Tax shall not be charged by virtue of section 114 in respect of the following payments, that is to say&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) any payment made in connection with the termination of the holding of an office or employment by the death of the holder, or made on account of injury to or disability of the holder of an office or employment;</P>
    <P>On the face of it that would appear to suggest that some of the items envisaged in paragraph (c) of subsection (1) to which the Minister referred earlier would not be liable to capital gains tax.  Golden handshakes may come within that.  Certainly some of what is envisaged, as adumbrated by the Minister, would appear to come within the terms of section 115 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  If that is so they would not be liable to income tax and if they are not so liable, neither are they liable to capital gains tax in accordance with, I think, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 does not say that the asset or acquisition is subject to tax.  It says what is an acquisition of an asset, and that is something entirely different.  Once the asset is acquired the possibility of the gain increases and there is a possibility of tax on the gain subsequent to the date of acquisition as defined in section 9.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Page 46, paragraph 2 (1).  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> There shall be excluded from the consideration for a disposal of assets taken into account in the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on that disposal any money or money's worth charged to income tax as income of, or taken into account as a receipt in computing income, profits, gains or losses for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, of the person making the disposal:</P>
    <P>It would seem&mdash;and I think the Minister agrees&mdash;that under section 115 of the 1967 Act, terminal payments of the kind we have been discussing would not be liable for income tax. Would they therefore be excluded from section 9 by virtue of Schedule I, paragraph 2 (1)?  In other words, if they are exempt from income tax, they do not seem to be exempt from capital gains tax under this provision in the Schedule.  What would be the position arising in the situation envisaged here in subsection (1) (c) if, in fact, they are not liable to income tax?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No capital gains tax would arise on the acquisition of the asset.  Capital gains tax will be charged only on such gain as is made during the ownership of the asset, which is a different thing.  Income tax might be chargeable on certain receipts at the time of receipt, but the capital gains tax is only payable at the time of disposal of an asset, and provided the gain has been made over and above the cost of the acquisition of the asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purposes of subsection (1) of section 9, in the kind of case we are envisaging there may be no cost of acquisition and the provisions of subsection (1) in such cases would seem to apply the market value as the deemed consideration at that point.  Therefore, in the case of some from of substantial presentation to somebody on the termination of an office, other than money, he would be deemed to have acquired it at that date at its market value.  Apparently, on foot of section 115 of the 1967 Act, he would not become liable to any income tax on that.  Is the Minister <Col N="737" /> saying that, in due course, if he disposes of that asset, whatever it may be, he would then become liable to capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>On that gain.  It is the difference between the value on the date he acquired it and the value on the date of disposal, but only on the gain, on the growth in value, not on the original gift.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wondering if, in view of that provision in the Schedule, it is correct to say it makes no difference for the purposes of section 9 (1) whether or not the asset in question becomes liable to income tax, or whether the income from the asset becomes liable to tax.</P>

There are expenditures and profits which are income and are properly treated as income and appear <Col N="738" /> in income accounts.  Separate from that, there are expenditures for the purpose of acquiring an asset which are part and parcel of the cost of the asset which are not available for income tax purposes.  They must be treated differently.  We must ensure that there is no duplication of either charge or profit.</P>

      <P>I have only just come in and I have not heard the argument but, <i>prima facie</i>, if shareholders were placed in a very disadvantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> other shareholders abroad or, perhaps, in foreign companies that might militate very much against the holdings of Irish shareholders in companies or against them in the sense not just from the point of view of the holding but from the point of view that Irish nationals would not be able to exercise their rights, would not be able to build up a dominant position in the company and they would thereby be hindered by the action of their own Government placing them in an invidious position <i>vis-à-vis</i> shareholders of other nationalities.

      <P>I would call the Minister's attention to the disadvantageous position in which Irish shareholders are placed in companies in which there are issues of shares made in lieu of dividends.  That has become quite a common practice in the last few years especially when companies outside Ireland are endeavouring to help their strained liquidity position by giving shares instead of dividends.  Irish shareholders are already placed in a disadvantageous position in that they have to pay full tax while shareholders of other nationalities do not have to do so.  It would not be good if, added to that position, they found themselves in difficulties under this particular provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The consideration itself is not chargeable.  We are dealing in section 9 with the situation where an asset is acquired for some consideration other than cash.  Marriage was a case I used to illustrate where you had a consideration which in itself could not be valued because it is invaluable.  There you would have to take the market value of the asset as being the consideration and that would then be the starting point.  It is only subsequent to that, that any gain or any loss might arise.  The starting point would be the time of the acquisition of the asset which would be taken at its market value and thereafter you would tax only the gains that could be made.</P>

I think that is the situation which was envisaged.</P>

We had better leave that aside for the moment.  It is a problem we are very carefully examining.  I thought Deputy Brugha was asking me what kind of consideration had we in mind here in section 9.

      <P>What is the thinking behind subsection (1) paragraph (a)? It seems, on the face of it, to provide that where an asset is disposed of and acquired under a contract the time at which the disposal and acquisition is made is the time the contract is made and not, if it is different, the time at which the asset is conveyed or transferred. What is the thinking behind that provision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should explain what the section is all about. The section sets out the rules for determining the times of disposal.  This is normally the time when the contract is made but where the contract is subject to a condition the time of disposal will be when the condition is satisfied.  On a compulsory acquisition of land by an authority so empowered the time of disposal is either the date the compensation is agreed on or the time of entering on the land, whichever <Col N="743" /> is the earlier.  In the case of an asset subject to a hire purchase agreement the time of disposal is when the person hiring the asset obtains the use of the asset.  Where compensation or insurance money is received the charge to capital gains is to apply at the time of receipt.  Subsection (1) provides for three types of disposal: (a) in the case of an unconditional contract the time of disposal and acquisition is the time at which the contract is made and not, if different, the time the assent is conveyed.  If the contract is subject to a condition, the time of disposal and acquisition is the time when the condition is satisfied. Where an asset in land is acquired by an authority under compulsory purchase powers, the time of disposal and acquisition is the time at which the compensation is agreed on or the time when the authority enters into possession. Would the Deputy like me to stop there?</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would stop there for the moment.  I am grateful to him for what he has told us.  What he has done is to explain in slightly simpler terms what is actually in the Bill.  My question relates to subsection (1) paragraph (a) which provides that where a contract is without condition the time of disposal is the date of the contract, not the date of conveyance, say, of the property.  My question is why is it the date of the contract and not the date of conveyance of the property?</P>

      <P>Normally the condition to be fulfilled is that on receipt of the consideration the proper transfer of the property will be completed but an unconditional contract could be written in order to avoid indefinitely liability for capital gains.  People could <Col N="744" /> enter into a contract for the disposal of a property and not have any date for the completion of it.  Another person, could, under that contract, get a right in the property which was about to be conveyed, something that might never be completed but be quite content with it in order to have an indefinite postponement of capital gains tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is if that is the condition in a contract.  There you have one where the event is known and identified, where the condition is set out, but if you have a contract with no condition then you have to have some finality and the only finality you can have is the date on which the contract was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister visualising a contract which does not provide for the payment of a consideration and does not provide a definite date for completion of the transaction?  Is that the kind of contract he is envisaging?  It seems a peculiar contract on the face of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but the date of payment of the consideration in the normal way would seem to be the date on which the disposal takes place or could be deemed to take place.  In the case of a normal contract what happens on the date of the contract, as the Minister knows, is that only a deposit is taken and on the face of it it would not seem to be the right date for deeming it to be the date of disposal.</P>

      <P>If it is a normal contract it will provide that on the happening of a certain event or the passing of a consideration the transfer will take place or a certain deed be <Col N="745" /> done but you could have a contract which would be indefinite as to the point at which something is to be done.  It could be indefinite in duration. Some gain might arise out of the existence of that contract.  There must be some starting date and the only thing known for certain is that date.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister provided in another section for the payment of a consideration by instalments and provided for payment of capital gains tax by instalments.  The point I am raising is not a totally academic one. As the Minister knows, in the case of a normal, unconditional contract it is possible that, the contract being signed, a dispute may develop between the parties that could drag on for a long time.  If there is a long interval between the date of the contract, which under this section is the date of disposal, and the actual completion of the transaction, it is clear in the ordinary sense that the asset is not disposed of until the transaction is completed.  As a result of the dispute it could happen that no gain would accrue and, in the kind of circumstances we envisage, will the Minister say when is a gain deemed to accrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we take a case where a person acquires an asset two years prior to the unconditional contract being entered into, under this subsection on the date of the contract, there is deemed to be a disposal.  Presumably the value of the asset on that date is taken for the purpose of determining what gain there was in the two-year period.  Let us assume there was a gain which is a chargeable one arising <Col N="746" /> during that two-year period but a dispute develops between the parties that goes on for one-and-a-half years or two years.  After that time either the asset has increased in value so that there is a larger gain or it has decreased so that there may not be any gain whatever.  Does this subsection affect the amount of the chargeable gain?  It seems that it does because it determines the time of disposal and, consequently, the time of acquisition.</P>
    <P>On the face of it the subsection seems to be out of touch with the reality of what is happening and it will cause a chargeable gain to arise in a case where the gain is considerably bigger or considerably less. Either situation could arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the date of acquisition or disposal will determine at what point capital gains tax may be paid and who pays what amount.  Taking the case put forward by the Deputy, if a person has an asset for two years and enters into an unconditional contract to dispose of it, that is the point at which the person decides to dispose of it and enters into an agreement to do so.  It seems to me that is the appropriate time to say that is the point of disposal if there is no further condition to be fulfilled.  By signing the contract the person confers rights on another. With regard to a situation where there may be a dispute between the parties, the Deputy wishes to know who will end up paying tax on such gains as may be made in the two years of the dispute.  The answer is whoever wins. If A contracts for the disposal of an asset to B and if there is a dispute&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the point the Deputy is making is that A has not disposed of the asset?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>According to subsection (1) he disposed of it on the date of contract.  If the asset has increased in value in the interval of 18 months, presumably B will be the beneficiary of the increase in value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should qualify all this by saying what the dispute is about.  If the vendor is disposing of it <Col N="747" /> but has second thoughts and is challenging it, if he wins and the contract is declared invalid that is a straightforward case.  If the dispute is about the consideration, the Deputy's point may be at what time does the gain of A stop and when does the gain of B commence.  The gain of A will stop at the time of the making of the contract and if there was any gain or loss made after that it would be the liability or gain of B.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of B would be that his date of acquisition and, consequently, valuation of the asset at acquisition would be as at the date of contract?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>Paragraph (c) of subsection (1), deals with the situation in the event of compulsory acquisition. Lines 19 and 20 carry the words, in brackets, &ldquo;variations on appeal being disregarded for this purpose&rdquo;. I want the Minister to clarify whether this subparagraph determines only the time of disposal.  If there were variations on appeal in the amount of the compensation would these be taken into account in computing the gain or loss or, since the date of disposal is the date on which the compensation is agreed, and disregarding subsequent variations, is the gain based on the figure originally agreed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is a difference in value by reference to change in, for instance, the market value of land bonds, the value most favourable to the taxpayer will be taken.  The date would be the date upon which the compensation is originally agreed or determined.  That is the point at which the public authorities' rights over the property become absolute&mdash; that may not be the correct word because oftentimes the transaction has to be crystallised through various legal forms.  This section operates so that there cannot be any question of gain subsequent to the date of the original agreement.  For instance, there could be a situation where the land bonds might increase in value after the date of the original agreement and there would be no additional gain involved there, that was the mode by which the compensation was being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be so in the case of land bonds but if one assumes negotiations in connection with compulsory acquisition by a local authority and that on a particular date the owner of a property agrees on a figure with the local authority, as I read it this paragraph says that date is deemed to be the date of disposal and acquisition.  The paragraph envisages variations in this subsequently on appeal.  Presumably in such case the agreement already arrived at is gone back on and, as a result of the appeal, there could be either an increase or a decrease in the figure which was agreed on the date of disposal.  In such circumstances is the gain in question computed by reference to the figure agreed originally on the date deemed to be the date of disposal or is it computed by reference to the figure ultimately agreed on appeal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this would be a case where the arbitrator's finding would be in dispute.  I assume it would have to relate to the date upon which the original assessment was made and not to any delay which occurred following an appeal from that assessment. A lot depends upon whether or not the assessment by an arbitrator would be a determination within the meaning of the subsection.  If it was a determination it would appear that that would be the appropriate date.  If it was not then it would go on to the date upon which there was a determination. I will look at the particular words in brackets and I will contact the Deputy to see what he considers to be necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister has undertaken also to look into the question of the words in brackets.  I want to pursue that a little further and point out to the Minister that, in a case where a determination is made by an arbitrator, in most cases as envisaged here it would be a determination within the meaning of this section and subsequently there is a variation in the figure for compensation.  Where that variation increases the original figure, obviously the taxpayer will not complain if a gain is assessed as at the date of the original determination. The real problem would arise if, on appeal, the figure is reduced and he is being charged capital gains tax on a gain which he did not get.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to that particularly in his consideration of the matter.  That is the one that will present the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley is now advancing an excellent reason, which I had not thought of at the time, for the rejection of his amendment for the sliding scale of tax, paying a higher tax in an earlier year than in a later one.  The problem the Deputy now identifies would not arise if on the variation there was a different value put on the consideration, because the same rate of tax would apply even if the time of disposal was at an earlier date.  There would be no difference in the rate of tax because of the time of disposal.  It would be a difference in the amount of tax payable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister may be missing the point I am making, which is quite independent of the rate of tax or the period over which it is made.  The point I am making is related to the amount of the gain and how that is determined.  Is it determined on the date of determination by the arbitrator <Col N="752" /> or the determination by the court on appeal?  If the subsequent one is less than the first, then the taxpayer will be asked to pay capital gains tax on a gain which he did not make&mdash;or at least on a gain which is bigger than the one he actually made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister right in saying that considering the section says that the time of disposal or acquisition is the time in the case we are talking about at which the arbitrator determines the value?  If the disposal and acquisition are deemed to take place on that date, surely that must be the date on which you assess the value of the gain and that can only be done in relation to the arbitrator's figures and it specifically says that you disregard variations on appeal.  Can the Minister be right in what he said?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Consideration&rdquo; is a term which is generally understood to be something of which the court already has notice other than such consideration as is dealt with in section 9.  Therefore there is no need to specify in section 10 or anywhere else that &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; is the actual cash received.  Where parties are at arms length, where there is a genuine transaction, the consideration is whatever actually passes between the parties.  That would be the appropriate one, whether it was by agreement or determined by a valuer.  We are dealing specifically here with the time of disposal so that the gain would be determined by the profit that had been made between the date of acquisition and the date of disposal.  We are only dealing with the time of disposal in section 10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the general principle involved is that the amount of the gain is determined by deducting the value of the asset as at the date of acquisition from its value as at the date of disposal. My original question in relation to this was: in this kind of case, will that principle be applied?  If it is, in the example the Minister gave the second figure, the value as at date of disposal would be £10,000, not the £9,000 within the brackets.  If that is so, it seems that this subparagraph needs to be amended to cure that.  If it is not so, I should like to be assured by the Minister that it is not so and evidence in the Bill to that effect drawn to my attention.  I appreciate the Minister may not be able to do that offhand but perhaps he would undertake to do so in due course.</P>

      <P>Does subsection (2) mean irrespective of the time period, say five years, in any arrangement like that, that the capital sum will be chargeable to capital gains tax right at the beginning in a hire purchase agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) fixes the time of disposal and acquisition where an asset passes under a hire purchase or other transaction under which the use and enjoyment of the asset is obtained by a person for a period at the end of which the property in the asset will or may pass to him. If a person is acquiring a property under a hire purchase agreement the title to the article does not pass until the instalments due under the hire purchase contract are paid.  But the use and enjoyment of the asset is from the date on which he first takes possession of it and has it under his effective control.  Such a transaction would be treated by both parties as an outright sale as at the beginning of the period of hire.  Of course the price would be determined at the commencement of the contract at the time possession was taken.</P>
      <P>The subsection further provides that if for any reason the hire terminates without the property in the article passing to the person who had the use and enjoyment of it, as, for example, by repossession for failure to pay instalments, the capital gains tax is to be adjusted by repayment of tax if necessary in accordance with the circumstances of the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (3) relates to capital sums received as compensation, insurance <Col N="755" /> money, sums received for forfeiture of rights or for the use or exploitation of assets and provides that the time of the disposal is to be the time of the receipt of the capital sum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that. I am not really concerned with the person who is disposing of an asset as much as the person who is getting the use of it.  If it is on a long-term basis&mdash;so much per month over five years for example&mdash;does this mean that the instalments would be the capital sum?  Does this become chargeable? It is not a hire purchase but a sale agreement over a period, such as is done in the case of machinery.</P>

But if somebody is using some payment made by them under an agreement to set off against profits, then it cannot be computed for capital gains or losses purposes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question on subsection (3) and I will try to make it as clear as I can.  First, I want to refer to section 8 (2) to which this subsection refers.  For simplicity, I am referring only to (iii) and (iv) which read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(iii) capital sums received in return for forfeiture or surrender of <Col N="756" /> rights, or for refraining from exercising rights, and</P>
    <P>(iv) capital sums received as consideration for use or exploration of assets.</P>
    <P>It would be reasonable to expect that in any of those cases there would be a contract entered into in regard to the forfeiture or surrender of rights or refraining from exercising rights or from the use or exploitation of assets.  Let us assume that the contract is entered into for one of those purposes. The question then arises whether for the purposes of this Bill that contract is to have the date of disposal determined by section 10 or section 8. On the face of it, that may appear straightforward enough, because subsection (3) says the disposal shall be the time when any capital sum is received.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (a), assuming there is no condition attached to the contract, says that a contract if it is unconditional, will determine, by the date of the contract, the date of disposal and acquisition.  My question is: if one has a contract in any of these circumstances, how does one know if the contract comes under section 10 or section 8?  A contract for one of the purposes I have mentioned could well fit into the description in subsection (1) (a).  We get a different result, of course, with the date of disposal, depending on which section it comes under.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) (a) of section 10 is subject to subsection (3). In other words, it specifies the general rule, except as provided for in subsection (3).  Subsection (3) takes us back to section 8 in order to specify the items which do not come within section 10 (1) (a).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that a contract for any of the purposes mentioned, such as surrender of rights or refraining from exercising rights or a contract for the use or exploitation of assets, anything of that nature comes within subsection (3) and the date of disposal is determined by the date of receipt of the capital sum and does come within paragraph (a)?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister reasonably satisfied that there will be a clear-cut distinction in cases of contracts of this kind, or can he envisage a number of grey areas where it may be difficult to determine under which section the contract would come for the purpose of determining the date of disposal and acquisition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying there will not be grey areas because, as any practitioner knows, there are often arguments about various contracts and their implications.  There is also the right of appeal if the assessment made by the Revenue Commissioners is disputed by a taxpayer.  In my view, it is as clear as it can be made by the use of parliamentary language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to make it less clear but, in so far as this is clear, why should there be a distinction? In other words, for any of the purposes I have mentioned why should a contract not be treated the same way as the ordinary unconditional contract envisaged in paragraph (a) and the date of disposal and acquisition be deemed to be the date of the contract?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases the capital sums might be received before the other part of the contract was performed. For instance, one might receive the capital sum on undertaking to refrain from exercising certain rights.  This might be an ongoing restraint on the person who receives the capital sums but they would not be performing their part of the contract until long after the capital sums were received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the performance of the contract is not relevant?  What is relevant is the date of the contract. That is determined under section 10 (1), the date of disposal and acquisition. My question is why in the case of contracts for the kind of purposes I have mentioned, like the use or exploitation of assets, they should be treated differently for the purposes of determining the date of disposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In many cases the dates will be different.  In practice <Col N="758" /> they will be different.  For instance, in the case of insurance there will be a difference in the dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are specifying in subsection (3) that the time of disposal is the time at which the capital sum is received of whatever is disposed of.  That is a very specific thing and that is what Deputy Colley thought ought to apply to all transactions. In most cases that is what happens because most contracts are conditional on some event happening or the passing of some consideration. If you have an open-ended contract the appropriate thing seems to be, in order to have some finality on it, to decide the cut-off point.  That can only be the point at which the contract is entered into.  There is no other event which you can recognise as determining the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister that you can have an open-ended contract but in many of the cases covered by subsection (3) there would not be open-ended contracts at all.  They would be normal, unconditional contracts which, but for subsection (3), would operate the same as those under paragraph (a).  Why should such clear-cut contracts, which are not open-ended, be treated differently?  This really gets back to the question I asked about how you know which section they come under.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must get the tax collected at some stage.  We have to relate it to events which can be identified, as otherwise you could have a situation of people escaping tax for an indefinite period.  The contract in the cases mentioned could be, for instance, in the first stage in this year but the compensation might not be paid for ten years to come.  In other words, it might not arise for ten years and it might not be paid.  It is only fair that the appropriate time to charge the tax would be the time the compensation was actually passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me the argument the Minister made is not unreasonable but it is really justifying this suggestion we put to him on subsection <Col N="759" /> (1), that the date involved should be the date on which the consideration passes, which in effect is the argument he is making for subsection (3).  It seems to me to be far more realistic than the date of the contract.  The argument he has made for the date of receipt of the capital sum in some cases makes sense.  In effect, what that means is the date of payment of the consideration.  Does that not make more sense than the date of the contract as provided in subsection (1)?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that &ldquo;capital sums received in the terms of forfeiture, surrender of rights or prevention of exercising of rights&rdquo; and so on.  It could be a long time after the contract.  A long time could elapse from the time of the signing of the contract.  As the Deputy said, there could be cases of unconditional contracts when it would be impossible to determine the time at which benefit accrued.  We have to have some point to determine when liability arises.  I cannot see any other way of determining it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but an unconditional contract in the normal way, according to paragraph (a) is deemed to be a disposal at the date of contract whereas an unconditional contract for any of the purposes specified in section 8 (2), is deemed to be a disposal on the date the capital sum is received or the date on which consideration is paid, which is the argument <Col N="760" /> we were making to the Minister on the earlier section.  I will not push that and I do not want to hold it up. Would the Minister have another look at this because it seems to me that the provisions of subsection (3) are far more realistic than those of subsection 1 (a)?  It might be advisable to apply the same principle to subsection (a) as is applied to subsection (3).</P>

      <P>May we take it that &ldquo;profit or gain&rdquo; in the Income Tax Acts includes a profit or gain which is subject to income tax?  I will explain. If a profit or gain under the Income Tax Acts is excluded from capital gains tax, there are certain profits or <Col N="761" /> gains which are income but which are not subject to income tax.  Take receipts of artists.  There are others.  I think the Income Tax Acts refer to such things as profits or gains even though they are not subject to income tax.

      <P>They are exempt from the tax but they are within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts.  I was faulted last year when I properly said that farming profits were also within the ambit of the Income Tax Acts but that they were exempt.  A profit which is income is chargeable unless exempt.  Anything which is by definition an income is subject to income tax unless exempt in relation to the occupation, the source of the income or the nature of the beneficiary. In strict terms they are income within the meaning of the Income Tax Acts.</P>

      <P>On the basis that such profits are profits or gains in the Income Tax Acts, no problem arises in relation to my point but could I refer the Minister to subsection (2) and suggest that there should be added to this a provision corresponding with section 12 (7) on page 13 of the Bill?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the First Schedule, Part II, page 46. Paragraph 2 (1) states:</P>
      <P>There shall be excluded from the consideration for a disposal of assets taken into account in the computation under this Schedule of the gain accruing on that disposal any money or money's worth charged to income tax as income of, or taken into account as a receipt in computing income, profits, gains or losses for the purposes of the Income Tax Acts, of the person making the disposal:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the inclusion of the word &ldquo;losses&rdquo; that makes me raise the point.  Losses are included in the same way as gains in that part of the Schedule and is it not necessary that they should be included in section 12 in the same way?  Should there not be a similar provision in regard to <Col N="762" /> gains, or otherwise would not subsection (7) be unnecessary, or that portion of it that refers to it not being payable more than once?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is appropriate on this section to raise the point that was raised earlier by Deputy Dockrell as well as Deputy Brugha, that is, the position whereby, when a company makes a capital gain and distributes to its shareholders the amount of that gain, there is a disposal by the company and therefore a liability to capital gains tax arises, payable by the company.  The appropriate shares having been distributed to each shareholder, <Col N="764" /> say, by way of additional shares&mdash;as was indicated earlier, this is quite a common practice at the moment in order to preserve the liquidity of the company&mdash;if these shareholders subsequently dispose of those shares, a further liability to capital gains tax can arise.  This would appear to be capital gains tax being paid twice in respect of the one gain. A somewhat similar position appears to arise in the case of unit trusts and unit holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No question of capital gains tax arises until there is a disposal. If a person holds an asset and ultimately disposes of it, that person has made a gain.  There are many forms of taxation which involve what could emotively be termed double taxation.  A person with an income pays tax on the income, and, having paid tax on income, may be obliged to pay further tax on the expenditure of the income which is left.  They may apply the income left after income tax in payment of other taxes such as motor taxation.  There is hardly anything in the complicated life in which we now live in which the handling of any portion of money does not involve more than one form of tax.  What we are taxing in this Bill is the making of a gain upon the possession of an asset, and there are generous exemptions, as I have emphasised.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The making of a gain on the possession of an asset at the point of disposal of the asset.  The fact that that asset has involved an element of tax somewhere along the line is no reason why thereafter possession of that asset by somebody else should exclude the possibility of any chargeable gain on that asset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, no doubt unintentionally, leading us on a false trail when he talks about the person who pays income tax then having to pay tax on, shall we say, motor tax, VAT or whatever else of his expenditure.  Of course, the second tax in that case is not a tax on his income but a tax relating to the item <Col N="765" /> of expenditure in which he engages. That is not what we are talking about here.  We are talking about a capital gain arising in the operations of a company on which the company becomes liable and pays the capital gains tax when it disposes of that gain by distribution to the shareholders, distribution by way of shares rather than cash.  Does the Minister agree that at that stage the company itself is liable for capital gains tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The company becomes liable when it sells the asset; if it does not reinvest that asset in the business but distributes it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it distributes it by way of shares to shareholders it has already paid capital gains tax on the gain.  When it distributes to the shareholders and when the individual receives those additional shares representing his proportion of the gain made by the company, and if he then disposes of those shares, he becomes liable to a capital gain.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but when he acquires the shares he acquires them for nothing in the sense that he did not actually pay money for them.  Presumably the gain is assessed on whatever their market value would be deemed to be when he gets them, as the commencement figure, and whatever he disposes of them at, as the disposal figure.</P>
      <P>Whatever the Minister may say about VAT or motor tax, this is the one gain being subjected to tax twice. Subject to correction, I suggest that in a similar situation in regard to income tax the tax is not payable twice. The Minister has suggested on a few occasions that capital gains tax is analagous to income tax but the actual working of the system in regard to companies and dividends and the income tax system in regard to those does not mean that income tax is paid twice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go into lengthy argument on this.  It might be better to pursue the question when we are dealing with Schedule 2, which deals with companies and shareholders. As I said earlier, I am having <Col N="766" /> an earnest look at some of the problems that arise in relation to realisation of assets by companies and the distribution of those to shareholders. I cannot accept, though, that there is an element of double taxation.  However, if people wish to draw a parallel with the income tax system I will produce another example which is on all fours with what is being alleged is double taxation in the company and shareholder arrangement.</P>
      <P>A person may earn an income which is subject to tax but out of that income he may pay wages to others, and these wages too may become subject to tax.  For example, if people are employed in the course of one's business they become a liability which may be deducted for the purpose of computing one's own tax; but if people are employed on the domestic front and not in connection with one's business, one pays income tax on his own earnings, while those to whom part of that income is distributed for rendering other services pay income tax also.  Therefore in respect of the one income there may be several different liabilities to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither is it the same transaction when a company, which is a different person in law, makes a capital gain.  A company is a separate entity.  A gain is the company's and the shareholders get the asset if the company distribute it to them and, if later, a shareholder, who is a separate person, proceeds to make a gain on that acquisition and disposes of it, there is another element of gain enjoyed by him.  A second gain might never have been made if that person was not a shareholder.</P>

      <P>Regarding the hypothetical case raised by Deputy Colley, may we consider a case of a company which for liquidity reasons, instead of paying cash decide to issue bonus shares?  The advantage of this to the company would be that they do not have to pay cash in dividends and also they keep capital available for their own business.  If the Minister is right in what he says, the situation is as Deputy Colley suggested.</P>
      <P>The first problem for a company that have not acquired capital gains is that of cash if they wish to capitalise and increase.  If a company increased their cash resources, can these be classified as capital?  If they cannot be so classified, the logical result of what the Minister is saying is that companies will be careful not to expand their assets as capital and will vouch for cash liquidity.  In that case they would be forced to distribution.  The two undesirable consequences of this action would be, first, that the Minister's purpose would be defeated and, secondly, that where it is desirable that money be ploughed back and kept for productive purposes, it would be dissipated by what I might call broadly payments for consumer purposes. However, I appreciate the complexity to which the Minister, Deputy Colley and Deputy Brugha have been referring.  What I am saying is merely to bring into the argument a further facet for the Minister's consideration.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Minister to subsection (3) and ask him if there is not conflict between that and section 8, subsection (2) (a) which provides that there is a disposal of assets by their owners where any capital sum is derived from assets notwithstanding that no asset is acquired by the person paying the capital sum.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 12 refers to &ldquo;the occasion of the entire loss, destruction&rdquo; and so on &ldquo;shall constitute a disposal&rdquo;&mdash;I am leaving out some of the words&mdash;&ldquo;whether or not any capital sum is received&rdquo;, whereas subsection (2) of section 8 provides that there is a disposal where a capital sum is derived from assets notwithstanding that no asset is acquired by the person.  To confuse the issue still further subsection (3) of section 10 defines where there is a disposal in cases where a capital&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 10, subsection (3).  That refers back to section 8 (2) and defines when there is a disposal, that is, when the capital sum is received.  In other words, section 8 (2) provides that there is a disposal where a capital sum is derived from assets although no asset is acquired, and section 10 (3) says that in such a case the disposal occurs when the capital sum is received.  Section 12 (3) says that the disposal occurs whether or not a capital sum is received.  The <Col N="769" /> question I am putting to the Minister is: is there not a conflict, or at least a possibility of a conflict between this subsection and section 8 (2) in the light of section 10 (3)?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do my best. Perhaps the best way of approaching it would be to get the section in perspective. The section says that we are to compute losses in the same manner as we compute gains.  The principle by which a gain is determined to be a chargeable gain is to apply in deciding whether a loss is an allowable loss or an available loss and thus a loss will not be allowable if a gain would not be allowable on the same transaction.</P>
      <P>The occasion of the complete destruction or extinction of an asset is to be regarded as a disposal, even where no capital sum is received by way of compensation, or otherwise, with the result that a loss may be claimed in the event of a destruction.  If, on a claim being made by the owner, the inspector of taxes is satisfied that the value of the asset has become negligible he may allow a loss, computed as if the asset had been sold for an amount equal to the value specified by the owner in the claim.  An owner of buildings and structures may claim a loss when their value has become negligible by treating them as separate from the land on which they are situated.  In order to allow for the possibility that the land could have increased in value, the site is deemed to have been sold separately at the same time, and re-acquired at market value.  Any gain so arising would be set off against the loss on the buildings or structures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Relief for losses where a person is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State would be confined to losses on the disposal of those assets in respect of which he would be liable to tax on chargeable gains under section 4 (2) if a gain instead of a loss resulted from the transaction.  These assets are land and mineral assets in the State, trading assets of a branch <Col N="770" /> or a business in the State, and rights of exploration or exploitation on the Continental Shelf.  An allowable loss may not be carried back and set off against a gain in an earlier year of assessment, but an exception to this rule is provided in section 14 to allow a carry back of a loss incurred in the year of death to the three years immediately preceding death.  Relief for a loss may not be given, of course, more than once, and it cannot be given for capital gains tax if relief in respect of it has been given under the Income Tax Acts.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3), to which Deputy Colley refers, provides that the destruction or extinction of an asset is to be treated as a disposal of the asset, even when no capital sum is received by way of compensation, or otherwise, and relief for a loss consequently may be claimed.  The subsection is subject to the options section which is section 47 which lays down the rules for the treatment of options. I hope that background may be of assistance to Deputy Colley.  If he is not satisfied with that and wants me to deal with them separately perhaps he would not mind directing me briefly on the path he is trying to follow and I will do my best to take him up on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some other points I want to raise on the section but I will try to put more clearly the point I was raising.  I confess it was not clear the last time.  In trying to put it clearly I may be over-simplifying it.  Could I refer the Minister to section 8 (2)?  Broadly speaking, that provides that, if a building is destroyed completely, and a capital sum by way of compensation is received, there is a disposal of the asset.  Section 10 (3) says that in such a case the date of disposal is the date of receipt of the capital sum.  Is the Minister with me so far?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 12 (3) says that if an asset is entirely destroyed the occasion of that happening constitutes a disposal.  There seems to me to be a possible conflict there in so far as it says that the occasion of the happening <Col N="771" /> constitutes a disposal, whereas in the other case which could be similar, the date of the disposal is the date of receipt of the capital sum.  This goes on to say that, even if no capital sum is received, the occasion of the happening is a disposal.  It seems to me that section 12 (3) and section 8 (2) both envisage in some circumstances the same occurrence but spell out different consequences from the same occurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are treating two distinct events here.  One is the destruction of a property.  That creates a loss.  If there is no insurance involved, and if there is no compensation involved, nobody can doubt that that would create a loss.  There could be an exceptional case where the site value would be higher than that of a site with an unwanted building on it. Let us take the loss situation.  That is one event and a loss has arisen as a consequence, and the taxpayer is entitled to claim that a loss has arisen. If subsequently the person recovers compensation against that, then the loss can be set off against the gain to determine what in fact has been the gain, if any.  If the money recovered is re-invested in the property, no question of any gain arises because the property is reinstated.  If, however, there is a realisation at that stage and a gain has been made, then the gain can be calculated, but one treats them as two separate events and it would be to the advantage of the taxpayer to have them treated as one but, as there may be a passage of time between the two events, it is better to keep them separate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances envisaged by the Minister, under subsection (2) of section 12 where the complete destruction of the building constitutes a loss, as the Minister says, that constitutes a disposal. Under subsection (2) of section 8 the receipt of a capital sum in respect of the loss constitutes a disposal.  How can they both be a disposal?  One would appear to be a disposal and one an acquisition but, here, on the face of it, the same circumstances constitute <Col N="772" /> a disposal, one on the occasion of the destruction and the other on the occasion of the receipt of compensation, the capital sum.</P>

      <P>I suppose they would have to be defined but, if a person is to get the benefit of the loss when it occurs and wants to claim it, then we have to treat that as an event separate from any subsequent event. They are so defined and the law will not operate to the disadvantage of the taxpayer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>I appreciate what is sought to be achieved in subsection (3) but the Minister will appreciate that, in order to operate the whole system, there are built into many sections of this Bill totally artificial concepts. On a particular occasion there is deemed to be a disposal and immediate re-acquistion without any loss and no gain.  I understand why that has to be done but the fact is that it is done and there is the building up of this artificial structure and that is why I am concerned about any possible conflict between these two, even though subsection (3) of section 12 is designed to enable a person in such circumstances to claim the loss.  With this kind of artificial structure it is important that there should not be any apparent conflict even between one section and another in relation to the same circumstances because, should there be, the taxpayer involved is almost certain to lose out in trying to have it determined as to which section he comes under.  My purpose in raising this matter is to draw the Minister's attention to the possible conflict and if, when he examines it further, he accepts that there is a possible conflict, then I am certain some redrafting will avoid that possibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>I want to raise now a matter I raised on the Second Stage in relation to subsection (4).  I do not think the Minister dealt with the matter then when he was replying.  Perhaps he <Col N="773" /> overlooked it.  I refer to the use of the word &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; in the second line of subsection (4).  What is that word &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; intended to mean or convey? Clearly it is a very relative term and what might be negligible in relation to one particular asset might not be negligible at all in relation to another.  It seems to me there would be plenty of room for litigation if we do not specify somewhat more clearly what is intended by the word &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am immediately reminded of a lengthy debate on the occasion when the late President Childers used the word &ldquo;nugatory&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think he used it in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He used it in relation to an expense.  Subsection (4) enables the owner of an asset to make a claim to the inspector of taxes for the allowance of a loss on an asset, the value of which has become, as the section says, negligible even though the asset remains in existence.  The word&mdash;I quote it&mdash;&ldquo;valueless&rdquo; could be used but then we would certainly have to change the sentence because one could not have the value of an asset being &ldquo;valueless&rdquo;.  I suppose one could say the asset had become valueless.  Where the word &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; is used in this context it is regarded as not having a value or having no depreciation.  The inspector of taxes being satisfied as to the merit of the claim, the loss would be computed as if the asset had been sold at this value, as it were, and if it immediately acquires for the owner an amount equal to the amount set out in the claim the value would then form the base cost of the asset for the purpose of the computation of any gain in later disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulty involved but I think we must pursue this a little further.  Suppose there were a derelict house, the value of that derelict house could well be nil or almost nil.  That might be counterbalanced by the cost of removing, let us say, the rubble.  On the other hand, in the case of a derelict <Col N="774" /> office block or a large old factory, one can separate the actual building from the site value and I appreciate why that has to be done.  In the case of the derelict building, the large derelict building could have a value.  Let us say it is worth £500.  The value of the derelict house might actually be nil and the cost of removing the rubble might outweigh the value of taking it away.  Does &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; mean valueless or almost valueless or does it mean &ldquo;negligible&rdquo; in relation to the value of the asset before it deteriorated?  In relation to what is the value supposed to be negligible?  Is it in relation to zero or is it in relation to the value of the asset before it began to deteriorate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are concerned with here is the value of an asset which has become negligible, which is of small value today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister mean small in absolute terms?  Is this in relation to zero?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because it has become a small fraction of its original value.  It could have been worth £1 million at one time and now could be worth only £250,000.  There would be no disposal there so no question of a loss would arise.  If something has become well-nigh valueless and not something which in the ordinary course of events would give rise to a gain, but quite the reverse, if the property is to be disposed of, then the owner of that asset can, at his own option, ask to have it assessed at its negligible value.</P>

Of course, this involves the risk that if it seems to gain value again afterwards the greater gain would arise.  It is something which is done at the option of the owner of the asset. It is a relief that is made available if a person wants to use it.  If a person does not want to use it, there is no question of using it against him.</P>
