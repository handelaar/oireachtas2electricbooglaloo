      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 2, line 26, to delete &ldquo;relation to such rights;&rdquo; and to substitute: <Col N="354" />&ldquo;relation to such rights; and such child shall be deemed to be the child of the adopter or adopters born to him or them in lawful wedlock and not to be the child of any other person;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is an addition to the definition of &ldquo;child&rdquo; which I introduced on the Committee Stage. That definition omitted the final paragraph which occurred in the definition of &ldquo;minor child&rdquo; in the Bill as drafted which it superseded.  That paragraph stated that the adopted child shall &ldquo;be deemed to be the child of the adopter or adopters born to him or them in lawful wedlock and not to be the child of any other person.&rdquo;  It was not considered necessary to keep this in the definition as amended as it was considered to be tautological.  However, Deputy Colley raised, on the Committee Stage, a point that a similar paragraph occurs frequently in the Adoption Act, 1952, for example, in sections 27 and 28 and, accordingly, significance could be attached to that fact.  I am prepared to take that point.  It is an arguable point and rather than have any argument on it, it is better to have clarity.  On that account, I propose this amendment to reinstate the paragraph and thus put the matter beyond any doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has taken this point which, in my view, is more than an arguable point. It is a matter of considerable importance. I confess I was somewhat taken aback when I looked at the Adoption Acts and found that they were so drafted as to incorporate the wording now in the Minister's amendment in a number of sections, as the Minister said.  The implication seems to be quite clear: the effects of the Adoption Acts, as generally understood, are applied to different circumstances only as the sections or subsequent enactments specify and not, as one might think, for all purposes.  Therefore, it seems that, for the purposes of this Bill, the omission of these words could leave a very serious gap in the arrangements sought to be made.  Therefore, I am glad this amendment is being made.  The Minister <Col N="355" /> will, of course, be aware that it will be necessary to make an amendment similar to this and similar to the one he has already made in the definition of child in another Bill.  As I pointed out on an earlier stage, there was another gap which he has already filled and this amendment is filling the final gap, I hope.  As I say, the same procedure will be necessary in regard to a similar amendment in another Bill.  As far as this amendment is concerned, I welcome it because it is necessary in the light of the wording in the Adoption Acts.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19, in the definition of &ldquo;minor child&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;21&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to provide that the date at which a child ceases to be a minor child will be 18 rather than 21, as stated in the Bill. We did advert to this before and my impression of what the Minister had to say in that regard was that, while he did not basically disagree with the case being made, he felt the implications of making the amendment were extremely wide and that it ought not to be done in this Bill but ought to be the subject of wider consideration and introduced in a wider context.  In reply to some questions on the Committee Stage the Minister stated a view; it was no more than that, and I do not think anybody would attempt to hold him to anything but a view expressed.  He said that if any one person had responsibility in this regard it would be the Minister for Justice.  I can see the Minister's point of view but it seems to me, as I indicated briefly on the last occasion, that there is a grave danger that this matter will be everybody's responsibility and nobody's responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is certainly no evidence to indicate that the Minister for Justice or any other Minister is at present working on the proposition that there ought to be a general change in the law changing the age of majority <Col N="356" /> from 21 to 18.  If no such work is going ahead then it simply will not happen, certainly not for many years.  I am not satisfied that the inclusion of a provision such as this amendment would cause any undue difficulty or disruption.  On the other hand, its inclusion would exert a certain amount of pressure in order to have the general change made that the Minister feels would be necessary.</P>
    <P>On the general proposition of reducing the age of majority to 18, particularly in the context of this Bill, I do not think there can be any real dispute that the time has come when we ought to do just that, when we ought to recognise the age of majority in the ordinary accepted sense is now 18 and not 21.  It is some years since we gave votes at the age of 18 and it is my belief that the law ought, in general, to provide for the age of majority now at 18.  The development of our social structures and the development of young people indicate that the age of 21, which we have had for a very long time, is now out of date. I suggest that the age of 21 for majority is now an anachronism and ought to be changed.  A start has to be made somewhere.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Bill to the effect that any wealth which belongs to or accrues to the benefit of a minor child is assessed against the father, is deemed to be part of the father's wealth, and the father is accountable in respect of it.  He has to pay the wealth tax assessed in respect of that wealth, the wealth which belongs in fact to his minor child.  I instanced on a previous occasion an example of what can happen.  I confessed then, and I confess again, that it is not an example that will happen every day of the week, but it is an example of a situation which has occurred and almost certainly will occur again and it illustrates the change in our society, a change which, I believe, calls for the adoption of this amendment.  If there is a young man of 19 who becomes what is commonly called &ldquo;a pop star&rdquo;, and he earns a great deal of money he may well be, and frequently in the past has been, the son of a father who himself is a man of little or no wealth.  Yet, under this Bill, in such cases the <Col N="357" /> father is made to account for and pay wealth tax on this wealth which is deemed to be that of the father and not of the son.  The example I have given is by no means one that will occur every day.  On the other hand, it is not a far-fetched example.  It has occurred and it will almost certainly occur again.  That is only one example. There are others.  That being the situation there is a strong case for recognising the reality of the situation and ensuring that in future 18 will be the age of majority.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest for a moment that the acceptance of this amendment is sufficient.  It does not go nearly far enough.  I suggest the time has come when the overall change should be made.  A start must be made somewhere, and there is no good reason for saying it cannot be made in this Bill.  Consequently, I am urging the Minister to accept this amendment. Its acceptance will put pressure on to apply the overall principle right across the board.  As far as I know, the Minister does not object to the principle involved and I do not think any great difficulty or damage could ensue from the acceptance of this amendment in order finally to get the machinery moving towards recognising the reality of what is happening around us which is, in general, that people aged 18, 19 and 20 are now in all reasonable interpretations of the word regarded as adult.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I support everything Deputy Colley has said but I would put the argument in a slightly different way.  Deputy Colley has dealt with the matter from the practical aspect.  By giving votes at 18 we have recognised that people are maturing earlier.  A boy or girl of 18 is now completely independent and should be <i>sui juris.</i> That is an accurate way of putting it.  Young people are maturing earlier, even physically.  It is a natural consequence of the universality of modern literacy and education and particularly the dissemination of information that a person of 18 is in as good a position to have the information and to make a judgment as a person of 21 or 25 or even 30 or 40.  We have been proceeding <Col N="358" /> in a large part of our law to recognise this as a matter of social desirability.  Indeed some people have not been a bit slow to make political capital out of it and to plead the cause of young people with perhaps not the purest of motives sometimes. If we accept that, then why make distinctions?  Deputy Colley rightly stressed the practical and realistic reasons why a person of 18 should be recognised as a fully fledged citizen and not as a minor.  I want to put the case from a legal point of view.  We have enough administrative difficulty, we have enough frictional clogs in the administrative machine, without having one definition for a minor in one Act and another definition for a minor in another Act.  In page 5 of this Bill we refer to:</P>
      <P>the minor children, if any, of an individual </P>
      <P>and on page 3 we have:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;minor child&rdquo; means a child (including a stepchild) who has not attained the age of 21 years on the relevant valuation date and who has not married. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a traditional definition and I am sure it still persists in other enactments, but in other legislation we have put in the age 18 so that is no justification for bringing into a new Bill, dealing with a completely new area, a legacy from the past.  From the point of view of legal simplicity and good administration in this Bill and in all new legislation the definition should be uniform.  It is high time we made up our minds where young people are concerned, just as where women are concerned, what is our policy.  We have plenty of talk aimed at getting the votes of the people concerned.  We have talk about the rights of young people and the rights of women but when it comes to doing something we do not do it.  This is a very good place to start doing it, to start cutting the cod and the cackle and making up our minds where we stand.  If the Minister stands up and says a minor child should be a person up to the age of 21, well and good. He has a point.  We can agree with it or not but we cannot have it both ways.  Whether it is equal pay or <Col N="359" /> parity for women or whether it is equality for young people we should not try to have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I would strongly urge on the Minister, from the point of view of administrative uniformity and certainty of the law, that we make up our minds whether it is 18 or 21.  If we are going back to 21 let us tell the whole world we are going back to 21 but then I would like to know why we passed certain other legislation.  If we are satisfied that the giving of votes at 18 was a step in the right direction and if that is the policy of the House and the policy of the people let us follow that policy unswervingly and put 18 in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 aggregates the taxable wealth of individuals and subsection 1 (b)  includes minor children of an individual in that aggregation.  A father, for instance, is answerable for the answerable wealth of all his minor children for the purposes of the Bill. As the Bill stands the wealth of every minor who has property of his own, who has assessable wealth chargeable under this Bill, will be aggregated to the father or the mother or the individual responsible.  It is that person who will pay the wealth tax, if wealth tax has to be paid.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that we will hear the argument which has been made so often before that it is only the rich who will have to pay, or only a few people will be affected.  If that answer is to be used to evade the real point at issue, I will answer it at the end.  I will not confuse my arguments by chasing up that alley now.  From the legal point of view, taxable wealth will be aggregated to the father.  As Deputy Colley perfectly rightly pointed out, the father will have to pay wealth tax.</P>
    <P>It was not a far-fetched example to say that an individual who would not be liable for wealth tax could be very seriously caught by the wealth of a minor child, a child not <i>sui juris.</i></P>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned a pop star. That is not as far-fetched as it seems. From the days of Shirley Temple we <Col N="360" /> have had child stars.  If Shirley Temple and her parents had lived in this country there would have been a nice little windfall for the Revenue Commissioners. Not so very far away from this House the material for a situation like that developed within my time in the House.  There have been successful minor children.  Anybody in or out of the public service could be caught.  It seems to me to be inequitable and wrong in principle that this liability should automatically attach.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties, but one way of minimising them is to accept this amendment and reduce the level to 18 years.  Deputy Colley has made the actual point in practice and in fact more cogently than I would be capable of making it, and I do not want to repeat what he said.  Coming to the legal side of it, what are the consequences if this happens?  The individual to whom this wealth is aggregated is assessable for the wealth of the minor child.  Unless I am greatly mistaken the personal wealth of a minor child is in trust for his majority. This can certainly be arranged.  In the case of a minor child who is in this position I imagine that will be done.</P>
    <P>That means the actual wealth which is subject to tax is inaccessible to the individual unless other provisions in the Bill cover that, and perhaps they do.  There are omnibus provisions in the Bill which may do this.  Knowing the Revenue Commissioners and their good staff work, I will be surprised if they slipped up on that one.  For the moment I am assuming that point is covered.  Even if it is covered, is that the right way to do it?  I do not think it is.</P>
    <P>One of the ways of minimising this problem of covering it would be by reducing the age limit.  The majority of cases of this sort involve child prodigies.  They are unusual.  The enterprising young person between 18 and 21 is not unusual.  I have come across cases where the question of minority at the age of 20 years has caused certain little legal problems.</P>
    <P>As in the first thing I mentioned, this is an inconsistency in the law.  To meet the point about the wealth or property of a minor being virtually in trust in both cases by the later provisions <Col N="361" /> of the Bill, if it is covered, is a legal and administrative complexity that should be invoked to the minimum. Unfairness can occur and the probability is that it will arise in the three years we are concerned with here. These arguments reinforce the first point I made about consistency about minority generally.</P>
    <P>How much will the Revenue get out of this?  The more I look at the complexities of this legislation, the more I begin to wonder what we will get out of this legislation by way of profit to the State.  I am aware that the computer techniques will do much to solve the Revenue Commissioners' administrative problems but I can see a multiplication of machinery, forms, tests and administration that will have the double disadvantage of being so costly as to minimise the net profit to the Exchequer and, at the same time, to pose a serious strain on the Revenue Commissioners' organisation. I do not like it.  By taking something out of the system we can minimise the load.</P>
    <P>In relation to deaths occurring after 1st April, 1975, the estate duty branch has sent out a notice to solicitors about the inland revenue affidavits. This is an indication of the extra administration that will be involved, and the notice I have referred to is only an effort to obtain more information, resulting in more administration, and it follows the adoption of one of the Bills in this capital code. This is what will happen in every case and it cannot be helped where there are complications like this.  I believe a similar document will be issued, following the adoption of this Bill, about whether people are under or over 18.  Can we not get all this administration down to one age, 21 years?  Will the Revenue Commissioners have to send out a document asking if people are under 21 because of the provisions in one Act and asking if people are over 18 because of another Act?</P>
    <P>I make those points in ease of the Revenue Commissioners because we are giving them a terrible burden. Estate duty was a back-breaking burden.  Before that duty was <Col N="362" /> suspended the estate duty office was overloaded.  Under section 13 there is an allowance of £2,500 for each minor child.  We will be overloading the Revenue Commissioners if we have distinctions in age in relation to such allowances.  In supporting Deputy Colley I put forward the argument for legal consistency, uniformity and the necessity for having a definite policy on which to base our law with regard to the date for determining majority.  That is, so to speak, the legal and administrative counterpart of Deputy Colley's argument.  Complexities and unfairness can arise in regard to a minor's property.  Complexities can arise if an individual is accountable for tax in regard to property where it is not perfectly clear that he has full control and entitlement to that property.  Even if that does not lead to legal blocks and legal cases it can lead to administrative difficulties of the sort I have mentioned. There is also the point of £2,500 of an allowance per child and when that sum is taken for the difference of the three years concerned and all the administrative costs tied up with it is it worth it?  Will there be anything gained from it?  Is the Minister sure he will not finish up with a net loss?  For these reasons I urge the Minister to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>The philosophy seems to be that we are only dealing with the rich. Leaving out the philosophy of envy I wonder how many rich people there are who will be caught in this. Although it is fair to apply the principle of taxation and equality I do not think any section of the community should be singled out for punitive treatment.  In enforcing the principle of distributing wealth and getting equality a punitive element arises, and that should be minimised. Even making the plea that it is not desirable for the community, socially or otherwise, to foment class warfare or to exploit the philosophy of envy there is the question of inflation.</P>
    <P>When the Minister started this code the record will show that he was optimistic about controlling inflation and about better times being around <Col N="363" /> the corner, but the tune of the governmental orchestra has demonstrably changed in the presence of facts in the last few weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a bit far removed from the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  If the Minister wants to do what he did on every other occasion, make a tirade about taxing the rich and saying it was only the rich he was concerned with, I will not lay off my end.  If the Minister is going to stick to his tune I will stick to my counterpoint. Wealth tax may come nearer everybody than we think.  It would be a good idea to relieve the burdens, where this can reasonably be done, in the case of those of 18 years.  They will not be the normal case but they are significant enough to be considered here.  As a Parliament we should legislate for possibilities; that is what law is all about.  A person of 18 years of age can be caught as easily as his parent in this case.  All I am saying is that, in these arguments about the rich and so on, let us not forget the matter of inflation; inflation at a rate of 20 per cent will reach 100 per cent in five years.  It is a serious matter.</P>
      <P>The other answer I expected was that as there was such a small number of people concerned, why worry? In other words, there would be so few people practically concerned it really does not matter.  My answer to that would be why not make the change in the interests of uniformity and taking the load off the administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, if one takes the more legal counterparts of the points made by Deputy Colley, let us have a definite policy as to what is the majority and act on that.  Let us not impose an unnecessary burden on the individual, which could be an unfair one, in that there is a legal complication involved and, at the very best, one could say it is administratively complicated to do so.  The other point is: is it worth it?  Lastly, the Revenue Commissioners will not get very much <Col N="364" /> out of it.  I have made the point about the rich and the small number involved, in anticipation of arguments being advanced.  Everything being added up, I cannot see why we cannot simply write 18 instead of 21.  It is a very simple amendment, would improve the Bill and would be in line also with what is likely to happen in legislation in other spheres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how much time we should devote to this amendment.  There are a few points that have emerged as a result of what has been said by Deputies Colley and de Valera.  Deputy Colley, quite rightly, pointed out an aspect of this that would occur to any of us going back a few years when there was discussion about the vote at 18.  Generally speaking, all except the most conservative people felt that there should be a vote at 18 but it took some sort of political agreement in some area to make the change.  There is something similar involved here.  Most people would say that the idea behind giving majority status at age of 18 is desirable.  One will not find many people opposing it.  But changes in this area need political decision and somebody must take that decision at some stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera drew attention to the last paragraph of section 13 which allows an amount of £2,500 for each minor child who has property to be excluded from the father's assessment. The fact that that exists may mean there is some significant taxable aspect of this matter of which none of us on this side of the House would have any knowledge.  That may be so and perhaps the Minister would enlighten us on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into too much detail, what is involved here is, quite simply, the difference between the ages of 18 and 21.  Out of that one must consider a person between the ages of 18 and 21 who might be married.  Under this Bill such a person falls out of the category of a minor and is excluded from the wealth of the parent.  Therefore, it does not seem to me that there could be a very great number of people involved.  The Minister <Col N="365" /> should have information in that respect that would not be available to the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley mentioned also the exceptional cases, and there can be exceptional cases, perhaps that of a pop star where the father might have to look for money to pay the tax from the son.  But if there is to be a decision taken in this area, which is not of any material importance, the sooner that sort of decision about the majority being reduced to 18 is taken the better.  Prior to its being done in relation to the vote, criticism was made of the fact that one could join the Army; in theory, at any rate, one could die for one's country from the age of 18 onwards but one was not regarded as a citizen.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister when replying would deal with those few practical points.  I think most people on all sides of the House would feel that a person should become an adult at age 18.  The arguments against it would need to be fairly substantial in respect of the short period involved between the ages of 18 and 21.  I cannot foresee there being a large number of cases involved, but perhaps the Minister has more information on that aspect than we have.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am not at all surprised that this section has been inserted in the Bill with regard to one reaching majority at 21 years of age.  When I examine all of the taxation measures before us there is no forward or advanced thinking to be found in any section.  In the 33 sections of this Wealth Tax Bill very few can be recommended to the House or to the country.  Therefore, it does not surprise me to see written here that one must have attained the age of 21 years before reaching majority.  We know perfectly well that a section such as this would have been accepted 20 years ago.  But the Minister and parliamentary draftsmen must have their minds closed completely to the realities of life and of industry today.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I withdraw that comment; of course the Minister is responsible. We can observe the changes being made in industry today with regard to people undertaking managerial positions at a younger age.  Throughout the world we can see people, politicians, attaining the highest posts in their countries at an age that would not have been conceived of 20 years ago. In some cases such people attain such posts perhaps 20 years younger than would have been contemplated a decade or two ago.</P>
      <P>But the Minister, in this section, with regard to the age at which a person attains majority or reaches a responsible level adheres to the former age of 21, accepted generally 20 or 30 years ago.  It is quite obvious that the Minister is not advancing in his thinking. It is not in keeping with European and modern thinking which is essential if we are to pull the country out of the economic mess it is in today. The same old type of legislation is enshrined in this section.</P>
      <P>We had a referendum here giving people the right to vote at 18 years of age, and quite rightly so.  The majority of people over 21 years of age, who were the only people at that time entitled to vote, voted to give people of 18 years this right.  I believe there are people of 19 or 20 years of age who have attained the maturity and understanding of people of 45 or 50 years.  We are depriving them of responsibility and this will have a detrimental effect on them. This section will apply to a confined section of the population.</P>

    <P>The Minister sees fit to allow these young people to vote at a general election or at a local election, they are subject to income tax and can join the Army, but when it comes to taking property into their possession it is the Minister's view that they will not act responsibly when they have reached 19 or 20 years of age.  Does the Minister sincerely believe that that is a fact, or is it that he does not feel like changing the whole legal structure?  If we are to start enlightened legislation I believe this would be the best first step as far as <Col N="367" /> Deputy Colley's amendment is concerned. The time will come, as sure as day follows night, when the age of the majority will be reduced to 18 years.  The Minister knows that day will come.</P>
    <P>What we are doing in the three Bills&mdash;the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, the Capital Gains Tax Bill and the Wealth Tax Bill&mdash;is inserting this section again where a person does not reach his majority until he is 21 years of age.  What will happen when that age is reduced to 18?  Every one of those Acts will have to be amended. Would it not be better if the Minister took the initiative?  It would not be long before the Department of Justice would bring in the necessary measures to make it effective.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why the Minister is hesitant about accepting Deputy Colley's amendment.  It would certainly give new confidence to people in business and industry.  There are young executives today of 19 and 20 years of age whose fathers would like to transfer to them substantial parts of their property.  The Minister knows perfectly well that in all types of industry and in farming there are young boys and girls being trained to take executive posts.  They can do that very effectively at 19 or 20 years of age.  The best way to encourage them is to give them status and responsibility.  We all have had experience of people in the past who held jobs without responsibility. People took the view that they were irresponsible but when responsibility was thrust upon them there was a change of attitude.  That is the type of thinking which I would expect the Minister to bring into this Bill if we are to look to the Ireland of the future.</P>
    <P>People between the ages of 18 and 21 are going to play an important role as regards restructuring and guiding the country to the prosperity which we hope to attain.  Whether it will be in the near future or not is a difficult question but at least we hope to attain that objective.  Evidently the Minister is under the impression that between the ages of 18 and 21 people cannot play a very positive role.  The attitude is that they are not capable of taking <Col N="368" /> responsibility and responsibility is withheld from those people until they are 21 years of age.  Surely that is a negative approach.  At the same time those people are expected to serve in the Army, to pay income tax and they have a right to vote in a Government to serve the country.</P>
    <P>I can see every merit in Deputy Colley's amendment and I believe if it were accepted it would create a new image.  At least we would be starting in the right direction.  I am not sure how the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill is going to work.  Where there are thresholds of at least £150,000 in the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill, will a father be prohibited from transferring to his son or daughter a substantial part of his property because he or she is under 21 years of age?  Certainly there is no reason why the Minister should withhold this right from people of this age group.  As I have already mentioned they are playing an important role today.  What we should be doing is encouraging them and giving them responsibility.</P>
    <P>That is the type of Ireland which I would envisage in the future.  These will be the people who will charter Irish industry and agriculture in the future.  We know of many young men in the past who were orphaned and who had to shoulder responsibility for younger brothers and sisters.  I know several orphans who at 16 and 17 years of age had to carry the burden of running a farm and they made excellent farmers afterwards.  They had that responsibility not at 21 or 18 years, but at 16 years of age.  I have confidence in young men and women of 18 years, especially now when we are trying to expand industry and get new blood in.  People who own property will be anxious to ensure that their sons will play an active role and the most effective way of doing that if you want the family to stay together is to give them some share of the property; otherwise they may seek their career in some other industry in another part of the world.  They are entitled to a share and a transfer of the property held by their father and mother before the age of 21 years.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should accept <Col N="369" /> this amendment.  Certainly it will be a new type of legislation.  It will help the Bill, which in my opinion is one of the most deplorable Bills that has come before the House but it will give some image of respectability.  I would ask the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>

      <P>I have extensively dealt with this matter on both the Second and the Committee Stages of this Bill.  Every argument that has been advanced has already been answered. It is regrettable that so much time has to be spent on this Stage advancing the same arguments that have been twice rebutted.  I have spoken with greater conviction in favour of reducing the age of majority from 21 to 18 than any Deputy opposite and did it seven years ago in the Council of Europe.  It does not need any exhortation from them to get me to advance this cause.  But it has no relevance to a taxation Bill which has to accept the laws of the land as they stand.</P>
      <P>I was asked specifically by Deputy Brugha on Committee Stage who had responsibility for it.  I said it was the Government's responsibility but has to be moved by the Minister for Justice. It involves many questions affecting the law of property, contract and financial matters, the jurisdiction of the courts, the question of trusteeships, guardianships and so forth.  It is not a matter that can be flippantly or casually dealt with in any taxation Bill which must follow the law of the land and cannot seek to change the social and economic laws of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this is a taxation Bill.  It is not a Bill to change the social and personal behaviour of people.  It has never been used for that purpose.  It would not be a taxation Bill if it sought to do that, except in so far as it may be necessary to make changes for the purpose of collection of tax.  This is not one of these purposes.  If a child is fortunate enough to be liable to wealth tax, this Bill provides that the Revenue Commissioners may collect the money from the <Col N="370" /> guardian of that child, which is the sensible thing to do.  The guardian has the right of recovery against the child. The stories about Shirley Temple having some reference to our wealth tax is utter unmitigated rubbish. Shirley Temple made her money long before she reached 18 years of age.  Are we to provide that the age of majority ought to be the moment one is born? This is the kind of rubbish that has been advanced in the course of this discussion.  I suggest that the Deputies opposite try to get some reality into their comments on the Wealth Tax Bill, at least at the Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that the Seanad complained because they had to wait so long for the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  When they got it, there was an adult debate and we are already back with their recommendations.  If the Dáil dealt with its business with the same relevance and speed, the legislation could be better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the debate might be of more value.  In the general law of this country the age of majority is 21 years.  People under that age enjoy considerable immunities. The Deputies who talk so flippantly about the restrictions which the law imposes upon them seem to overlook the fact that the law provides very specific and helpful immunities and protections for people if they are deemed by law to be minors.  They enjoy a special position not merely in relation to the law of property but also in relation to the law of contract and in tort.  Their domicile depends on their parents.  A tax on capital must have regard to the law of the land. For that reason alone a minor child should be any child under the legal age of majority in the country.  In this country that is 21 years of age.  To provide otherwise would be to provide concepts in taxes which are in conflict with the general law of the country, and their operation would be impossible. The law in relation to income tax accepts the law of the land in relation to majority&mdash;21 years.  Until <Col N="371" /> that is altered, a change cannot be made in the wealth tax proposals.</P>
      <P>I would like to point out that section 14, subsection (1) (b), subsection 2, and subsection (3) (b) provide that the tax in cases where children are liable to wealth tax can be collected from the children, their guardian, or the committee of that child if they have it and they have the opportunity of collecting the money from the child's wealth.</P>
      <P>I respectfully suggest that this matter has been debated in considerable detail and the legal impossibility of accepting the amendment at this stage is quite clear I am sure to a lawyer like Deputy Colley.  Deputies have complained that this Bill is intricate.  It would be immensely more intricate and longer if we tried to change the laws of this land affecting minors in relation to wealth tax.  We certainly could not use a Wealth Tax Bill for the purpose of changing the law in relation to minors and the age of majority.</P>

      <P>The Minister may say that he has answered all the points put forward before.  Perhaps he has to his satisfaction but he certainly has not to my satisfaction.  He has made a couple of sweeping statements which do not stand up.  For instance, he said the age of 21 is accepted under the income tax code.  Is the Minister telling us that a young man or woman aged 18 or 19 who is working in a factory and being subjected to PAYE on his or her earnings is, in fact having them assessed on the father, and the father's income tax assessed accordingly?  That just does not happen.  While it may be true that for certain purposes under the income tax code the age of 21 is accepted, in practical terms that is not happening. We are talking here about a new annual tax.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now talking about a very rare aspect of income tax.  I am talking about it as it is known to the man and woman in the street.  As it is known to them, there is no question of somebody under 21 years having their income assessed on the father and his income assessed accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Minister also said that the parent could recover this from the minor child who was particularly wealthy.  What the Minister did not advert to was, if the minor child has a reasonable amount of wealth and the father has a reasonable amount, and the two are put together, he may go over the threshold and have to pay where he otherwise would not.  There is no way in which he can recover that from the minor child under the Bill.  Some of the Minister's statements in regard to the general position relating to the age of 21 years versus the age of 18 years for majority, simply do not stand up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To talk about the law of this country as though it totally accepts the position that the age of majority is 21 years and that there are no exceptions to it is simply not correct. We know about the amendment that was made in the Constitution and the consequent change in the law in regard to voting but the basic difficulty here is not what the Minister has said. It is simply that the whole approach in regard to this Bill and the other Bills the Minister has introduced is, as I said before, at the very least Victorian and the mentality probably goes back even further than that. That has been demonstrated on Labour amendments.  Here is a very good example of it.  It is simply not good enough for the Minister to say that the law of contract or various other laws provide the age of majority at 21.  That is not the point and it is not true to say that one could not <Col N="373" /> accept this amendment and administer the wealth tax.  That simply is not true.  It can be done but the Minister is just not prepared to do it.  He went on to say that this should not be done here because it is a taxation measure and should not be used for the purpose of creating the law in regard to a general matter of social importance. What he should be doing is following in a taxation measure what is, in fact, the social position in the country and that is what he is failing to do.</P>
    <P>We have urged him to do it.  We have urged him to treat young people in a new measure, for which there is no precedent so he is not bound in that way, as having attained the age of majority at 18 years.  The Minister <Col N="374" /> has given all sorts of reasons, none of which is convincing, as to why he should not do that.  He may have talked about this matter seven, eight, or more years ago at the Council of Europe, but the real test of the Minister's attitude is not what he says either at the Council of Europe or in this House but what he does.  What he does is in this Bill and we are giving him an opportunity to change it and he has refused consistently to change it.  He can be judged on what he does now in relation to this amendment which asks him to accept, for the purposes of this Bill, that a young person is an adult at 18 years.  He is refusing to do that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 48 to 50, and in page 4, to delete lines 1 to 4. </P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3, although it cannot be discussed with subsequent amendments, is part of a framework I am endeavouring to build into the Bill.  The object is to ensure that a married woman would be treated as a separate individual and not as a chattel of the husband.  I mentioned on the last amendment that the whole thinking that emerges in this Bill is, to say the very least, Victorian if not feudal.  It is clearly demonstrated in the section which is here sought to be amended.  I have consistently sought to establish on this Bill that we should endeavour to treat individuals equally and, in particular, that we should recognise the separate individual existence of the married woman.  The Bill singularly fails to do that.  As a result we have a situation in which there is&mdash;this is the only way one can interpret what is being done in the Bill&mdash;discrimination against a wife who is living with her husband, <i>vis-à-vis</i> either the single person or the separated spouse.  We have that because of the way the thresholds are fixed and because of what is provided in section 4, which is sought to be amended.  It provides that:</P>
      <P>The property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession on a valuation date shall also include all the property to which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the wife of the individual, if she is living with him on the valuation date, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the minor children, if any, of the individual,</P>
      <P>is or are beneficially entitled in possession on the valuation date; </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that if you have a situation where the husband has little or no wealth and the wife has considerable wealth, it is the husband who is assessed in respect of that wealth.  For the purposes of this Bill it is treated as his wealth and he is liable both to account to the Revenue Commissioners for the wealth and to pay the tax thereon.  There may have been some thought that there were practical difficulties of administration involved which necessitated this approach.  I do not believe that is so.  I have sought in <Col N="377" /> this and in other amendments to which I have referred to demonstrate a way in which this problem can be approached that will not create any undue administrative difficulties.  The time has come, particularly when we are dealing with new legislation and are not bound in this regard by previous legislation and the complications that could ensue over a long series of Acts of the Oireachtas and perhaps court decisions&mdash;we are not bound in that way in this legislation&mdash;when the question is do we now, in 1975, International Women's Year, decide in Dáil Éireann that we want to treat married women merely as chattels or appendages of their husbands, or do we want to give them the kind of independent recognition to which they are entitled as individuals, not merely as the wives of the taxpayers concerned which is what is sought to be done in the Bill?</P>
    <P>It is desirable that we should approach the matter in the way I am suggesting here.  It is possible to do so. It is inexcusable to produce a Bill in 1975 which incorporates all the worst features of Victorian and earlier than Victorian legislation in regard to the role of a married woman, to regard her solely as somebody who is to be lumped in with her husband for the purpose of wealth tax.  That is not an unfair version of what is sought to be done in section 4.</P>
    <P>The Minister has refused to agree to our proposals in this regard.  We are giving him another chance hoping that, in the meantime, he has thought over the matter and will recognise that it is both desirable and possible to do what we are advocating particularly in this new legislation where the Minister is not bound, as he might be in regard to certain other codes of taxation, by considerable difficulties. There is no insuperable difficulty involved here in the wealth tax. What is required here is a decision in principle as to what the role of the married woman should be and the political will to implement that decision. That is what is required from the Minister.  That is what is sought in this and in the other amendments to which I referred which form part <Col N="378" /> of a framework designed to ensure that the married woman under the Wealth Tax Bill will be treated as an individual in her own right.</P>

      <P>The reason I am coming in now is to reply to some queries posed by Deputy Colley to the Minister for Lands on Committee Stage.  The Minister for Lands undertook to obtain information for Deputy Colley and I thought it might be of assistance if I gave it now.</P>
      <P>The subsection treats a husband and wife as living with each other unless they are separated by a court order or by deed of separation or they are separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.  That is surely in accordance with the facts of life. Nobody can say that is unreasonable treatment.  That is what marriage is all about, to live together.</P>

      <P>The wealth of the husband and wife with minor children is aggregated to form one taxable unit in section 4.  The question of separation arises in the case of certain discretionary trusts where the trust property is deemed to be the property of a member of the family.  That is in section 5 (3).</P>
      <P>The appropriate thresholds in section 13 are also affected by the fact of whether or not spouses are living together.  Subsection (2) is therefore necessary to set out when, for the purpose of the Bill, a husband and wife are treated as living with each other. The subsection is a necessary part of the Bill and, on that account, I cannot agree to accept an amendment which seeks to delete it.  I suppose the Deputy will say the amendment is a necessary corollary to the amendment he is proposing later in relation to aggregation of family wealth in section 4.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> Deputy Colley asked the Minister for Lands for an explanation as to why the terms of the Wealth Tax Bill and the Income Tax Bill, 1967, were not on all fours in the matter of husband and wife living together.  The relevant sections are section 1 (2) of the Wealth Tax Bill and section 196 of the Income Tax Act.  Section 196 is divided into two areas.  Under subsection (1) the married couple are treated for income tax purposes as living together unless (a) they are separated under a court order or deed of separation, or (b) they are in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent. Under subsection (2) of that Act they are treated as separated when (a) one of them is and the other is not resident in the State in the same year of assessment, or (b) both are resident in the State and one of them is absent from the State in the year of assessment although, in fact, they are living together in the sense that they are not separated.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 1 of the Wealth Tax Bill corresponds with subsection (1) of section 196, that is, a husband and wife are treated as living together unless they are separated by a court order or deed of separation, or they are, in fact, separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.  The material difference is that subsection (2) has not been included in the Wealth Tax Bill. In order for this subsection to apply for the purpose of income tax the husband and wife must be living together, yet one of them must be nonresident in or absent from the State throughout the year of assessment. They are, in fact, separated in a technical sense only.</P>
    <P>In cases where the subsection applies, the husband and the wife are treated as separated, that is, as single persons.  Income tax is concerned with income which accrues over a period of one year.  Events which happened throughout the year have, therefore, a material effect on the year's income tax liability.  Wealth tax, on the other hand, is concerned with wealth on a particular date, that is, the valuation <Col N="380" /> date.  The facts as at that date are examined and the liability arises accordingly.  For example, if a married couple have separated a week before the valuation date they are treated as single persons on the valuation date, whereas for income tax purposes they are treated as living together for 51 weeks of the year.  Likewise if two persons marry on the day after the valuation date their wealth is not regarded as one unit on the valuation date.</P>
    <P>Where one of the parties to a marriage is absent from the State for a year or more in this context, it will generally be found that that person was earning a living outside the State during that time.  In other words, his income arises in the area where he happens to be living.  A person in the wealth tax bracket is unlikely to be taking his wealth with him if he spends a year outside the State.  In other words, his capital is, by and large, unlikely to be affected by his own personal movements.  The considerations which arise when considering income for income tax purposes over a period of a year are, therefore, quite different from those which are relevant where the wealth is on a particular date and where the wealth is being examined for wealth tax purposes as on that date.</P>
    <P>The concept of subsection (2) of section 196 which relates to a continuing process is not, therefore, relevant in the context of a wealth tax.  Furthermore, this subsection deals with the case of a person who is resident in the State, whereas the basis on which a person is liable to wealth tax is that of domicile and ordinary residence.  In all these circumstances it is, therefore, considered that the principle of section 196 subsection (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, has no place in the context of wealth tax.  For that reason it is not incorporated into the Wealth Tax Bill.</P>

      <P>While I see the relevancy of the reference to section <Col N="381" /> 196 of the income tax code, I am at a loss to see how the Minister is arguing on the amendment.  In the case of the income tax code there might be a relevancy in the disparity of the two sections.  I am glad to see Deputy Esmonde is present but he need not think I am going off on a tangent.  I said the Bill was <i>in pari materia</i> with the other capital taxation measures but it was not <i>in pari materia</i> with the income tax code, and therefore, there was to be a question of interpretation.  The Minister's explanation is, indeed, understandable but the only point I can glean from the Minister's argument&mdash;I concede it is possibly my own denseness&mdash;is that the omission of a subsection from section 196 might be construed as implying something into this Bill.  The Minister gave reasons for the implication.</P>
      <P>Unless the discussion is now to be enlarged into accepting without question that the Acts are intertwined, the relevancy of what the Minister has been saying escapes me.  Being a taxation measure, A and B are the two provisions which rule in this case.  For instance, if the Revenue Commissioners, or the other party, were to invoke the provisions of section 196 of the income tax code for the purposes of some case, the point would have to be argued.  However, that is not the basis on which we are presenting this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever the complications being compounded in the income tax and the capital code by the various provisions of these Acts, it remains that we have here the same type of anomaly we discussed on the previous amendment in principle.  Here we are in certain other Acts, moving in one direction. For example, take the Family Act at present.  All legislation is moving in a certain direction since the time of the Married Women's Property Act a long time ago.  We base the Bill on the concept of the husband and wife being essentially a single person for the purposes of the law.  Cynically, we are reaching the stage where, when it suits the State, particularly when it is a question of taxation or administrative procedure, husbands and wives <Col N="382" /> will be integrated.  In other cases, especially if there is any political popularity involved, we will nearly adopt the standards of Women's Lib.  This is a contradiction in approach.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with this amendment and this Bill.  The fundamental question which arises is: if we have recognised that married women can hold, and are entitled to property in their own right, apart from their husbands and married status, why must we integrate husband and wife for the purpose of taxing that property? Why, when we recognise that, say a wife&mdash;it argues equally the other way for the other spouse; incidentally, a trend in modern legislation from the Succession Act onwards has been to recognise the two spouses equally&mdash; can have property in her own right, and property is defined in this Bill on the same page as the lines sought to be deleted by this amendment stand, should there be a differentiation in the taxation of that property?  Why should a woman be in a different position from a man?  That is, in practice, what it boils down to.</P>
    <P>Even if equality of the spouses is granted, which has not been fully attained by any means, why should two people who are independently and individually qualified and competent to hold property be so connected that their property is pooled for the purpose of taxing it?  Why should that be so?  It is a simple question.  I sympathise with the Minister and his advisers on this matter because of the historical and traditional situation which must be disentangled.  I am not forgetting the directives in the Constituation either.  Here we have a case where there is a clear-cut distinction even taking into account the relationship between husband and wife. Incidentally, if the Minister will pardon my saying it, I hope in the friendliest and most good-humoured terms, I was somewhat intrigued at what he inadvertently embarked upon, namely a definition of marriage.  When he reads the record, he will probably see what I mean.  Marriage is a little more than what the Minister is seeking, in legal and other terms, to define it as.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me frankly admit, this is just a point to lighten the heaviness of this discussion, or rather to promote the atmosphere we should have in approaching this Bill, and against which I sin as much as anyone else.</P>
      <P>To get back to the seriousness of this: granting what marriage is in its totality, granting the physical, social, moral, economic and all other aspects of the state of marriage for both spouses, granting the traditional approach, granting these accretions of thought and procedure that have grown around this institution over the years, we can still see clearly one thing&mdash;that, at this time, and let us take the Minister's favourite date, the 4th April, 1975, it is fact, recognised and practical, that a husband and a wife, as individuals regardless of their status and sex, are entitled to hold, own, dispose of and otherwise exercise full proprietary rights over property, and property as defined in this and its cognate Acts.  If that is so, I repeat the question which arises: if there is such an independent holding of property why should that property be aggregated and the owners thereof considered to be, for the particular purpose in hand, conjoined in order to tax that property?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one asks the question in that clear way, one sees immediately that one is up against what might be called a taxation device.  It is a taxation device pure and simple.  There is no principle to support it.  There is no equity to support it, granted the premises I have postulated.  It is here I see the relevance of what the Minister said about the Income Tax Acts. In short, where the Income Tax Acts were concerned, two factors came into play.  The first, I rather suspect, was the traditional.  I suspect that those who first thought of income tax and developed the code in its early and middle phases were thinking only in terms of the traditional concept of <Col N="384" /> the wife being in the hand of her husband, to use the Roman expression; the wife, so to speak was under the tutelage of her husband and marriage reduced her into a subordinate position where her husband was concerned. I rather think that concept ruled and, therefore, most of the thinking would have been conditioned by that notwithstanding the fact that earlier provisions visualised women with property and so on; they were strong-minded women; there were even medieval, fuedal laws and so on that qualify the statement I make. Basically that thinking obtained.</P>
    <P>The second aspect&mdash;and this was bound to influence development&mdash; was the possibilities of evasion, and complications encouraged that approach.  Lastly, in the early stages, it was not usual for women, certainly from the point of view of earned income, to be in the income tax bracket.</P>
    <P>That was in the past; that was the income tax code.  It was income that was being taxed.  It was arguable that income was pooled, in so far as two people were living together in the traditional set-up, where you had a man who was the so-called bread-earner, a woman who was the housewife and minder of the children, however the money came into the house, the income was both effectively and practically and could be in contemplation of law, pooled.  The income tax approach was perfectly justified, apart from administrative convenience.  Even that has changed.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get away from the amendment.  I could launch off too far on section 196 and the income tax code generally here.  Suffice it to say, it is understandable but, even there, new thinking may be and is indeed desirable.  If I may be permitted to say so on this amendment, the taxation of married women from the income tax point of view in relation to their status as single has anomalies.  That is not what we are dealing with in this Bill.  We are dealing with property.  This property is defined and is separate.  With all the precautions that are built into the Bill <Col N="385" /> to keep it separate, in other cases and so on, there will be no difficulty in keeping it separate.  The only thing that can be confused is the income deriving therefrom.  Income deriving therefrom is a totally different thing. That is why I am letting the income tax code take care of itself, whether it is <i>in pari materia.</i> This is property which can be taken separately.  Therefore, why should it not be assessed separately on a property tax?  What is a capital tax?  It is a property tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister can play away.  I suppose he is entitled to his political gimmicks.  He can talk about abolishing death duties when he is only giving substantial reliefs and changing them. All right, that is politics but he calls it capital acquisition.  Where property is transferred for a consideration and where profits are made he calls it capital gains.  When he taxes property directly, he calls it a wealth tax.  As I said, what is in a name?  Changing a name does not change a fact.  What we are dealing with in these three Bills is property.  So fundamental is that point in all these Bills, and in this Bill in particular, that the actual definition has to be brought in.  In this Bill property is defined as including interests and rights of any description. Real property and personal property are defined.  If all the definitions are brought together and the common demoninator taken, we finish up with the one word &ldquo;property&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If A and B can hold property, if it can be ascertained and is taxable and if A and B are independent, then the tax is independent.  Why in the name of goodness should the property be aggregated just because A and B get married?  Leaving out the income consideration that I have mentioned as far as the property is concerned, why should the property be aggregated? The only good reason I can advance is if you aggregate it you will bring it over the threshold; it is just another device to bring it over the threshold so that it can be caught.  This is very apparent in a later section.  It is one of the reasons why the £90,000 threshold is, to a certain extent, objectionable.</P>
    <P>I admit that this is a preliminary amendment and I do not want to <Col N="386" /> exhaust all the arguments.  There will be other arguments to be made on the next amendment.  This does not dispose of all that may be said on this point. I want to ask a question, which I will try to answer when it becomes substantive on the other amendment.  If the property is held independent, with the owners having full proprietary rights, why should the mere fact of marriage bring the two properties together?  That is as far as I will go on this amendment.  There is a lot more to be said when we come to the substantive point of the other amendment.</P>
    <P>There is a slight technical point on this amendment too.  Here the Minister reverted back to section 196 of the Income Tax Act.  The point I am going to make will not be very material if my point of <i>in pari materia</i> is admitted. If the Minister for Lands, deputising for the Minister for Finance, was right that the question of <i>in pari materia</i> does not stand up&mdash;my learned friend, Deputy Esmonde, seemed to argue in support of his Minister&mdash;this point may have relevance.  If the Minister is going to invoke the income tax code to answer me, all I will say is, all right but then he is invoking <i>in pari materia</i> and must take the consequences elsewhere. If he is rejecting the principle of <i>in pari materia</i>, then he says they are, in fact, separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.</P>
    <P>What is separation in this case? These are simple questions that seem at first sight to be so elementary as not to be worth asking but Acts of Parliament, like everything else, have to assume common meaning.  This is a new code.  I am taking the Minister for Land's point of view, admitting that if you accept all the codes of <i>in pari materia</i> then, correspondingly, there is less substance in what I am going to say.  If they are not <i>in pari materia</i>, then we have got to look and ask what does the word &ldquo;separate&rdquo; mean.</P>
    <P>In case A that is clear enough, but in B they are separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent.  Under the income tax code that is explained and qualified.  Under this code, I think even the Minister's advisers would <Col N="387" /> like to have something more definite than &ldquo;likely to be permanent&rdquo;. What is &ldquo;separation&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill?  If it is not accepted that the income tax legislation in this code is <i>in pari materia</i>, and that this stands absolutely on its own, what exactly does &ldquo;separation&rdquo; mean and what does &ldquo;likely to be permanent&rdquo; mean?</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to a valuation date.  The income tax code would want to be considered very carefully and perhaps the precedents will get one out of trouble if it is <i>in pari materia.</i> If it is not, this section nakedly says &ldquo;on the valuation date unless on that date they are separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to be permanent&rdquo;.  I will give a case under this Bill, far-fetched though it may be.  Suppose that on the valuation date a husband and wife are separated by the physical fact that one or other of them is in a hospital with medical certification that that separation is likely to be permanent, whether it is in the form of a prognosis or a terminal disease or anything else you like to imagine with relation to matrimony or otherwise, that section on its own might create a problem in a case like that.</P>
    <P>That is only one of the things I could think of in relation to it.  Whether you accept this amendment or not, the relevance of the Minister's quoting of the income tax code raises a matter which I queried when the Minister for Lands was deputising for him on this very definition section which obviously has not been completely disposed of.  I do not want to hold up the House by a long dissertation on that subject.</P>
    <P>The questions I asked have been very simple.  If two people hold property independently, why should they be aggregated for property taxation purposes?  If this section stands on its own, as the Minister for Lands maintained vehemently at the beginning of the Committee Stage, ably backed by the senior counsel and learned Deputy behind him, and if that view is correct as against the one I propounded&mdash;we are both agreed on the strict construction <Col N="388" /> of a taxation statute in favour of the taxpayer&mdash;then the desirability of adopting Deputy Colley's amendment to paragraph (b) is a live question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I intend to be very brief on this section.  We have been over some of this before.  Deputy Colley's amendment is as valuable on the Report Stage as it was before.  We firmly believe that a married woman should be treated equally.  If the Government have not paid practical service, at least they have paid lip service to giving a married woman status.  We have seen Bills introduced which gave them the right to retain their position in the public service.  This was a step to give her the dignity and rights to which she is entitled.  We agree with that policy.  We are asking the Minister to go further.  We brought in legislation along these lines over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Women today are looking for equality, and quite rightly so.  They are entitled to it.  When it comes to taxation, the Minister takes a different view.  He is prepared to write into this Bill old Victorian-style legislation. There is no forward thinking in the Minister's mind with regard to the wealth tax as to how he should assess property.  The Minister says it is all right to bring in legislation which will enable them to work in the public service after marriage, but when it comes to taxation the Minister is not modern and forward thinking.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley and Deputy de Valera outlined in detail our views on this matter.  One would need legal training to understand the bulk of these taxation Bills; because of their complexity, they are very difficult for the average person to understand.</P>
      <P>The Minister could have simplified this section by stating very plainly that every man and woman was treated equally, whether married or not.  The Minister took 20 minutes to read out his script as to what constitutes where separation is taking place, if one is living out of the country and all that type of legal matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): Of course we are.  I am saying there would be no need to put him to that trouble if he had drafted his Bill properly and in a simple form the average man could understand.  I appreciate the fact that the Minister gave us that explanation.</P>
      <P>We are basically against the principle that a married woman should be discriminated against.  That is exactly what this Bill is doing.  A married woman born in Ireland and married to an Irishman is being discriminated against in this Wealth Tax Bill.  A married woman born in America, and married to an American, owning property in Ireland, is not discriminated against.  She is exempt.  That is the type of equality the Minister is talking about in the 1975 tax legislation.</P>
      <P>It is bad enough for a woman to be discriminated against by virtue of the fact that she is married and not given the full allowance in her own right but to make it worse, a foreigner owning shares in a company here can carry her individual rights and will not be asked for thresholds of £100,000.  She will not be subject to any wealth tax.  I object to that type of discrimination against any Irish person.  The Minister could have avoided this and improved the Bill in some small way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to do anything with this Bill.  If we are to give any genuine recognition to the independence of a married woman, we should start in a Bill such as this.  We saw in a previous amendment that the <Col N="390" /> Minister is not prepared to move forward as regards giving a person the majority at 21 years of age.  That is the type of thinking we have in the Wealth Tax Bill of 1975.  We are supposed to be moving into a new era, with new thinking and forward ideas, but the Minister is going back to old, antiquated Acts, dating back to the 18th century.</P>
    <P>It is a pity he was not forward thinking in the legislation to further the independence of married women. They can today retain their jobs in the public service and in various other occupations that up to now they were prohibited from doing.  So it should be.  Why that same recognition is not given in this Bill is something that I cannot understand.  Why must the Minister victimise the married woman as against the unmarried woman where this exemption is concerned.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal of money involved.  The whole Wealth Tax Bill will involve only a few million pounds and, if this amendment of Deputy Colley's is accepted, the amount involved will be infinitesimal in relation to the total revenue from wealth tax. This amendment would be a genuine gesture in the right direction, a direction we have been advocating on this side of the House with regard to the status and the rights of married women.  The Minister seems to be adamant.  We discussed this on the Committee Stage.  It is a matter of vital importance and it is for that reason we are here on the Report Stage trying to impress on the Minister that he is failing in his duty in our opinion in not recognising the proper status of married women and giving them the same thresholds as he is giving to single people.</P>
    <P>God knows, we know the trials and tribulations of married life today.  We know the expenses of purchasing homes and various things like that. We know only too well the erosion of profitability in business.  There is no justification for the Minister's attitude. The return on capital, as most people know, has been eroded during the past few years and these discriminatory <Col N="391" /> thresholds cannot be justified.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. We have put our points of view both in the Committee Stage and Report Stage.  We have asked the Minister to accept this amendment and give that equality to which a married woman is entitled in this year, 1975, when there is, throughout the world, the tendency to have equality for women.  We see it in the public services as regards equal pay.  It will be an obligation, under EEC regulation, to have equal pay throughout the entire community in a very short length of time.  Surely these regulations point the way.  The Minister should ensure equality of status as adopted by other European countries.  We should not wait for other European countries.</P>
    <P>We should advance our own new ideas with regard to what should go into legislation such as this.  Most legislation introduced here is a copy of the same kind of legislation introduced elsewhere.  We saw that in the Capital Gains Tax Bill.  It is very similar to the Bill in England.  We should be introducing our own ideas. The Minister in discriminating against married women hopes to gain additional tax.  This is a bad way of raising taxation.  It is certainly not a very enlightened way.  I would urge the Minister to accept Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say that the Minister in speaking gave the thinking behind the wording of subsection (2) in relation to the income tax code.  He may have been in doubtful order, but he was certainly doing so, I appreciate, as a courtesy in response to the query I put on the Committee Stage.  I do not want there to be any doubt about that.  The Minister took the opportunity however narrow it was, to give the explanation, and we appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, on the substance of the amendment itself, as far as I could see, the Minister gave only one argument and that was that to accept this amendment would be contrary to later provisions in the Bill.  Of course, I <Col N="392" /> have amendments down in regard to those later provisions which taken together, give a framework as to how this problem might be tackled&mdash;that is if the Minister recognises that there is a problem.  The particular words sought to be deleted here are an attempt to define when a married couple are not, in law, living together and that is just one of the consequences of the complications that arise because of the approach in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The alternative framework I am putting forward, of which this amendment is part, suggests that for the purpose of the wealth tax there are three kinds of individuals with different thresholds, widows or widowers, minor children and other individuals, whereas the Bill has none of these&mdash;widows, widowers and minor children&mdash;but has a married man living with his wife and then the separated couples with all sorts of complications arising and anomalies and injustices.  All of these are arising in the teeth of what should be done and what the Minister must know should be done in this day and age in regard to the treatment of married women.</P>
    <P>The basic question was raised by Deputy de Valera.  If married women are legally entitled to own, hold and dispose of property, why should their property be aggregated with that of their husbands if they happen to be living with them, and not if they are not living with them or, if they happen to be single people, it is not aggregated?  This is the basic question, and the Minister did not attempt to answer it.  I can only assume, therefore, as this is not the first time that this matter has been raised, that the Minister believes the approach set out in this Bill, which involves a married woman, whatever property she has, being shoved into the background and having her property for the purpose of the Bill treated as if it belonged to her husband, and her husband being treated as being liable to account for it and to pay the tax on it, is correct socially or, alternatively, he may be unhappy about it but he thinks it cannot be done in any other way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> I have sought to demonstrate in this and the other amendments that it is possible to deal with this matter differently.  The Minister was given an opportunity in dealing with this amendment, if he did not think that this was so, if he thought it was impracticable, of pointing out why, but he did not do any such thing.  Neither did he attempt to defend the antiquated and unthinkable approach involved in this Bill, and in particular in the treatment of my amendment.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Minister has not availed himself of the opportunity to introduce a reasonably modern approach in this legislation which is new and dealing with a new tax.  It is also unfortunate, if the Minister thinks that should not be done, that he did not tell us why he thinks it should not be done, other than the purely technical argument that it would conflict with subsequent <Col N="394" /> sections&mdash;sections to which I have tabled amendments.  It is unfortunate, but that is the way it is.  We can all assume, therefore, from the Minister's consistent refusal to make any change in this regard that he favours, and that when it comes to brass tacks those behind him favour, whatever lip-service they may pay to the rights of women, married or otherwise, an approach which produces the kind of situation I have mentioned where the married woman is regarded as a chattel of her husband and where she can only obtain equal treatment with the single woman if she is separated from her husband.  That is not the approach we favour.  That being so, I put down this amendment.  It is regrettable, but it should be noted, that the attitude on the other side of the House is as it is.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 19, to delete &ldquo;1975&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;1976&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to provide in section 2 that, with effect on and from the 5th April, 1976, a wealth tax shall be charged, levied and paid.  The Government issued a White Paper on Capital Taxation and on page 45 of that White Paper in paragraph 93 the following is stated:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April. </P>
      <P>Later on in the White Paper on page 60 the Government stated:</P>
      <P>Annual Wealth Tax: The date of commencement will be 6th April, 1975. </P>
      <P>I submit that the clear intention conveyed to readers of that White Paper, and there were many of them, was that the Government intended to commence the operation of the wealth tax on the 6th of April, 1975, and that the valuation date on the basis of which the wealth tax would be collected in the first year was likely to be the last day of the tax year, that is clearly the 5th of April, 1976.  If it was to be an annual tax and to be levied on the basis of wealth held on one particular day in the year, and the indication was that that one particular day was likely to be the 5th of April, and that the tax was to commence on the 6th of April, 1975, then clearly what was intended to be conveyed was precisely what is in my amendment.  That is that the first valuation date, the first date on which property would be valued and tax would be levied would be the 5th of April, 1976, and that is what this amendment seeks to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be said, that having got as far as we have with it, there is not a great deal of point in changing horses now.  I suggest there is a great deal of point in it.  I would also suggest <Col N="397" /> that it is important to realise just what the Government said in the White Paper and what they are doing now, why we had a guillotine motion, why we have had long sittings in regard to the wealth tax, with all the consequent strain placed on everybody concerned, including the staff of this House.  It has all been happening because the Government have attempted to introduce the wealth tax one year ahead of the date they said they would introduce it in the White Paper.  Everybody should understand that very clearly.</P>
    <P>The problems which have arisen, and are continuing to arise, for potential taxpayers, their advisers and the Revenue Commissioners are quite substantial.  They are problems which required to be and would best be dealt with by giving people an opportunity to consider the implications of what is happening.</P>

      <P>Under the European Communities (Proprietary Medicinal Products) Regulations, 1974, no medicinal product may be placed on the market in this country without a product authorisation granted by the Minister for Health on the advice of the National Drugs Advisory Board. These regulations put on a statutory basis voluntary arrangements with the pharmaceutical industry which have existed for a number of years whereby the board carry out a full assessment of all medicines before they are introduced here for the first time.</P>
      <P>To supplement these controls certain safeguards are provided for in the Medical Preparations (Licensing of Manufacture) Regulations, 1974, and the Medical Preparations (Wholesale Licences) Regulations, 1974, which govern the adequacy of arrangements and facilities for the manufacture and wholesale distribution of medicines generally in this country.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>The total amounts of grant paid to the Medical Research Council and the Medico-Social Research Board in 1974 were £230,000 and £106,000, respectively.  Approximately one-third of the amount paid to the Medical Research Council was expended on experiments involving living animals. None of the grant paid to the Medico-Social Research Board was used in connection with such experiments.</P>
      <P>In 1974 the total number of experiments carried out under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, was 65,871, as compared with 68,525 in 1973.  The decrease of 2,654 is not particularly significant having regard to the pattern established over a number of years, and on the basis of the information available it is not possible to attribute this decrease to the use of alternative procedures not involving the use of animals.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons are eligible for benefits under the various non-contributory social welfare schemes such as old age pension, widows' and orphans' pensions, unemployment assistance and children's allowances.  They are, however, not insurable under the social insurance system and thus cannot qualify for any of the benefits of that system.  The question of extending social insurance to the self-employed is being examined in my Department.  The Green Paper on a national income-related pension scheme which will be published later this year as a discussion document, will raise a number of matters regarding pensions for the self-employed which will be relevant to this examination.  The introduction of legislation will depend on the outcome of the examination.</P>

      <P>The basis on which pay-related benefit is calculated was carefully considered when the scheme was being drawn up and the system introduced, which takes account of an applicant's earnings over the income tax year, was considered to be the most equitable and suitable arrangement.  While I am always ready to consider improvements in the scheme of pay-related benefit I am not satisfied that the arrangement suggested by the Deputy would improve the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary is aware that, when Fianna Fáil introduced the scheme of pay-related benefits, the idea behind it was to cushion an employee who, possibly, had hire-purchase commitments, an SDA loan or other financial commitments, but because it is based now on the previous financial year, many a person unemployed today does not qualify for any pay-related benefit whatsoever?  He may have been unemployed for part of the year 1973-74; came into employment again early in 1975, finds himself again unemployed and does not qualify for pay-related benefit?  If the idea behind the scheme was to cushion an employee against lack of earnings because of either sickness or unemployment, I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;as mentioned in my question&mdash;that the pay-related benefit be based on the average earnings of the three months prior to a person becoming unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Several improvements were made by way of regulation under the scheme drawn up by the former Administration, all of which were to the benefit of the recipients.  Pay-related benefit is designed to ensure, as far as possible, that a man's normal earnings be maintained, to some extent, during periods of prolonged sickness or unemployment.  The operation of the scheme has proved to be of very considerable value to people who avail of it.  I do not think that the proposal made by the Deputy <Col N="405" /> would achieve the object of the scheme.</P>

      <P>The person mentioned by the Deputy, though now resident in County Donegal, was last employed in the United Kingdom.  Under EEC regulations governing social security for migrant workers payment of sickness benefit in her case is the responsibility of the United Kingdom Department <Col N="410" /> of Health and Social Security and her claim for disability benefit received on 10th March, 1975, was accordingly transferred to that Department for attention.  At the time the claimant's Irish insurance record showed no contributions to her credit since June, 1973 and, as her United Kingdom record was also deficient, the claim was disallowed.  Subsequently, however, following the completion of inquiries into the stamping of social insurance cards by the firm in which the person concerned had been previously employed in County Donegal it was possible to credit her record with additional contributions.  Unfortunately, however, due to a failure in communication within my Department the United Kingdom administration was not immediately notified of the additional contributions so credited. This has now been done and all benefit due on the claim up to 28th April, 1975, the date of the last medical certificate received, has been paid by the United Kingdom Department.  The inconvenience caused to the claimant in the matter is regretted.</P>

      <P>The scheme of dental benefit administered by my Department is designed primarily for the maintenance and restoration of dental function.  It provides for scaling, filling and other treatment of teeth and gums as well as for extractions and the provision of dentures. With two exceptions the full cost of treatment is paid by my Department to the dentist and no charge is made by the dentist to the insured person. In the case of dentures, however, while the overall cost of the provision of dentures is controlled, the insured person pays two-thirds of the cost and the Department pay one-third. In the case of certain sophisticated items of treatment such as gold crowns, gold inlays, bridges and chrome cobalt dentures, the Department make a fixed subvention and the insured person pays any balance.  In <Col N="413" /> most of these cases the fixed subvention paid is £10.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is implying that the insured person was not aware of her entitlements under the scheme.  That information is readily ascertained.  The implication of the Deputy's supplementary would be that a person could get a dental job done for £300 and expect the Department to pick up the bill, irrespective of how extravagant the expenditure may have been.</P>

      <P>That is a distortion which the Parliamentary Secretary is putting on the case I mentioned.  I am talking about a case where a contributor finds himself or herself in need of dental care.  Is the subvention which the Department makes relatively insignificant?  I am proving my case by stating that where dental treatment costs £45, the Department will only pay £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence why an ex-Army member (details supplied) who had over 40 years' service in the Army was allowed only 31 years as pensionable service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, maximum pension and gratuity are payable to a non-commissioned officer or private on completion of 31 years' service.  In accordance with the established practice in the public service credit is not given for years in excess of the number of years required for maximum superannuation benefits.  It should be borne in mind that a soldier can retire on pension at any time after 21 years' service and that, during his Army service he is fully insured under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that members of the Civil Service are guaranteed full pensionable service for each year's service? Why is the same system not applied to members of the Army?  Are they considered second-rate citizens?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree with the Deputy.  To qualify for maximum pension a civil servant must have 40 years' service.  For that he gets 50 per cent of his pay on retirement. A member of the Garda Síochána qualifies for maximum pension after 30 years' service and receives no further addition to his pension.  An Army man qualifies for maximum pension after 31 years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A civil servant's pension is 50 per cent of his pay but in the case of an Army man it varies.  It is 46.6 per cent of his pay in the case of a company quartermaster sergeant, and 52.9 per cent of his pay for a private.  If he retired after 31 years' service, having started serving at the same time as a civil servant, he would have <Col N="416" /> nine years' pension drawn before the civil servant.  If I were to take the better scheme, I would take the Army pension scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very elaborate explanation.  Will the Minister compare the pension an Army man would get with that of a civil servant who has 31 years' service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil servant would have to serve 40 years to get 50 per cent of his pay.  The company quartermaster gets 46.6 per cent of his pay after 31 years, the private gets 52.9 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am constantly examining the pension and pay schemes to see how we can help.  In relation to the last 5 per cent increase granted to civil service and Army personnel it was decided not to apply the increase to recruits and that allowed other ranks to get more, in some cases as high as 9 per cent.  For the non-commissioned officers and men that was a much appreciated change.  That is an example of how the officers of my Department and myself are keeping an eye on such matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept that there are anomalies.  I have said many times in this House that Army pensions are, of necessity, different.  The reason is that <Col N="417" /> their conditions of service are different. If men must work different numbers of years in different ranks then the pension schemes must be different.  An examination of them in detail will prove that the Army pension schemes are better than those for other services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a very quick reply.  If there is no distance limit of aircraft flying over prisons, why, when an aircraft appeared over Limerick prison recently, did the security forces, according to the Press, communicate with the Department of Justice who ordered a full alert, bringing out, at considerable expense to the nation, the military from Limerick and the total Garda Force and, again according to the Press, the aircraft was fired upon?</P>

      <P>The Press was mistaken. I have a note in front of me dealing with the Limerick incident.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that it is necessary to have a full alert at times which does not result in anybody being apprehended or action being taken does not mean that they are unnecessary.  Full alerts are often very necessary deterrents.</P>
      <P>At 3 p.m. on the 24th June, 1975, a report was received by the Air Corps, Baldonnel, from the Garda Síochána that an unidentified aircraft had been flying some minutes previously within the prohibited air space at Limerick.  The Duty Officer at Baldonnel checked with Air Traffic Control, Shannon, who informed him that they had no knowledge of an aircraft in that area at the time mentioned nor could they see any on their radar. This information was passed to the Garda.</P>
      <P>As a result of a further Garda approach, an Air Corps Cessna which was returning from Cork airport to Baldonnel at the time&mdash;3.40 p.m.&mdash; was diverted to Limerick to investigate the report.  Southern Command and the Garda were notified of the diversion. The Cessna arrived over Limerick prison at about 4 p.m., just before the information arrived regarding its diversion, and a military guard fired three flares&mdash;not rounds of ammunition of any kind&mdash;to attract the attention of the pilot of the aircraft which he considered was flying too close to the prison.  The pilot saw the flares and changed his position immediately.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Air Corps Cessna was en route from Cork to Baldonnel resulted in its being diverted so quickly that it arrived over the prison almost simultaneously with the arrival of information for the military guards at the prison.  The pilot of the Cessna did not observe any other aircraft within the prohibited air space.</P>

      <P>As regards the council's capital allocation for local authority housing, as I informed the Deputy in my reply of the 25th June, 1975, to his Question No. 6, the present total authorised expenditure of £385,000 is adequate to meet existing commitments and to allow the commencement of the limited amount of new work which was ready to be started so far this year by the council.  The council's request for additional funds, over and above those already allocated, is under consideration in conjunction with similar claims from other authorities.</P>
      <P>In so far as house purchase loans and supplementary grants are concerned, the initial capital allocation to Waterford County Council for the six month period ended on 30th June was £474,000.

There was work done which caused damage, and that was known before work started and that is why such high insurance was taken out.  It was known by both the corporation and the contractor.

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given this matter deep consideration but I am unable to add anything to my replies to previous questions on 8th November, 1973, and 7th February, 1974, in which I stated that I have no power to alter the terms of legal agreements entered into by tenants who purchased their houses under sales schemes in operation prior to July, 1973.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In conversation with Deputy Tunney I have told him that I am still studying the matter but as of now there is nothing I can do. There is no point in asking if I will alter the scheme because the scheme, as it stands, is one which has been accepted by tenants and legal contracts have been entered into.  Therefore, an exceptional type of action must be taken if anything can be done about it.  If there is something I can do to assist, I will be glad to do it but I do not want to be rushed into trying to do something.  Legally, as it stands, there is nothing I can do.  I am endeavouring to find some way around it.</P>

I regret to say that there are some local authorities who, for some extraordinary reason, have not yet been able to assess the correct price of the houses which they are selling to their tenants.  Until the whole thing is cleared up, I do not want to mix it up by attempting to introduce some other change.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of complaints and what I would consider to be very serious complaints in regard to this firm.  One of them involved the leaving of a house which was commenced in one year, unroofed over the winter with serious damage to the house.  It certainly did not show that the builders were very anxious to look after the interests of the people for whom they were building the house.  The fact that the applications are not being made by this builder but by the people who are buying the houses is making it pretty difficult but there are three cases that I know of where it appears that the purchasers are being treated with less than they are entitled to.</P>

The roof was taken off one house and put on another to comply with a court order in one case.

If the complaints which are being received are correct, it appears that there is a very serious matter which I suggest should be inquired into by the people who have purchased the houses.

    <P>Under the extended scheme, a grant may be paid for work started on or after the 1st July, 1975 in cases where <Col N="429" /> the local authority is satisfied that a member of a household suffers from severe mental handicap and that the existing accommodation in the house is inadequate for his proper treatment or segregation from other members of the household.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>To put it in its proper context, in 1972-73 the amount allocated was £158,000.  The first big allocation was given by me in 1973-74 of £477,070 because Galway County Council were in a position to spend that money and had everything going for them.  In 1974 they got £112,698 all of which they spent and in 1975 they got £152,000.  Like a lot of other counties, apparently, Galway County Council did not take steps to prepare schemes until they found there appeared to be a different approach to the allocation of money.  The result is that last year a lot of money was asked for and this year Galway County Council in the normal way got a fair share of what is going. The fact that they got an abnormal share in the previous year seems to have prompted the question.</P>

      <P>It is quite correct for the manager to say a number of schemes have been held up because they have not got this extra money.  It is only right to point out that we are talking about an allocation of money this year of more than twice what was being allocated when I took over. Galway County Council and other councils should have got a much higher amount for water and sewerage schemes over a number of years. Apparently they stopped planning and it was only last year they produced a very big plan and got £477,070 to <Col N="432" /> carry it out.  This year because of the fact that a number of other counties have produced very expensive plans also, so far we were only able to give them the amount of money which has been given which, incidentally, is a fairly sizeable sum, £152,000.</P>

    <Title>Turf Development Bill, 1975: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to empower Bord na Móna to borrow the amount necessary to finance its third development programme.</P>
      <P>As I informed the House when I moved the Estimate for my Department for 1975, Bord na Móna, following the 1973 fuel crisis, carried out a review of bog areas which had previously been considered incapable of economic development.  As a result the board formulated its third major bog development programme.</P>
      <P>The board's initial development programme adopted in 1946 had as its main features the production of 1 million tons of sod peat annually, improvements in the Lullymore briquetting plant and the establishment of the first generation of turf fired power stations.  The second development programme launched in 1950 concentrated chiefly on milled peat production, and since that date the annual milled peat output has been built up to around 3 million tons. The success of that programme led to the erection of four additional peat fired power stations and two new major briquette factories.</P>
      <P>The third programme is being introduced at a time when the high cost of imported energy is inflating both domestic prices and the external deficit on the balance of payments. In a White Paper entitled &ldquo;A National Partnership&rdquo; laid by the Government before both Houses of the Oireachtas last November, the need to accelerate the development of domestic sources of energy was emphasised. Amongst the proposals listed in that White Paper towards that end was the board's third development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Under the third programme, in addition to the 130,000 acres of bog already in production, it is proposed to develop a further 40,000 acres from which annual production will be available as follows:&mdash;Milled peat, 1.7 million tons; sod peat, 44,000 tons; moss peat, 600,000 bales; briquettes, 80,000 tons.  The additional milled peat supplies will be capable of sustaining 160 megawatts of electricity generating plant with the capacity to produce 700 million units of electricity annually.  A new 80 megawatt unit will be erected at a site yet to be selected.  Additional units will be added to the milled peat stations at Lanesboro and Shannon-bridge and the lives of the stations at Ferbane and Rhode will be extended.</P>
    <P>Because of the increase in oil prices the cost of production of electricity from milled peat is comparable with that of production from oil.  Provided the present trend of world oil prices is maintained, it is expected that electricity generated from milled peat produced under the third programme will continue to be competitive with that produced from oil.</P>
    <P>The production of briquettes from milled peat ranks next in importance to the production of electricity from milled peat.  Since the rise in oil prices, briquettes have become more popular and production is now scarcely adequate to cope with the demand.  To meet the increased demand the board proposes to erect a fourth briquette factory at a cost of £3.5 million and an annual output of 80,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Bogs at Coolnagun, Garrymore and Ballydermot will be developed at an estimated cost of £700,000 to produce 44,000 tons of sod peat annually.  This will be absorbed by the domestic. industrial and institutional demand for sod peat.</P>
    <P>As regards moss peat, four bogs at Gilltown, and Prosperous, County Kildare, Kinnegad, County Westmeath, and Ballivor, County Meath, are to be developed to yield a total annual production of 600,000 cubic metres of peat for processing at the moss peat factories at Kilberry and Coolnamona.  This production will be <Col N="435" /> used partly to meet increasing factory demands and partly to replace reductions in bog outputs where some production areas are being cut away.</P>
    <P>The development involved in this programme will extend over counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Kilkenny, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon and Longford and will take about five years to complete.  It should provide continuous all-year-round employment for an additional 1,500 men rising to about 1,800 men during the peak production season. The Board at present employs 4,500 men on a regular basis, a figure which rises to 5,500 during the peak production period.  The total cost of the programme, including the estimated cost of preparing the bogs by draining them, providing the necessary rail haulage services, production machinery, workshops and ancillary buildings, will be £28.5 million.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill arises because the board has almost exhausted its existing statutory borrowing powers.  Under the Turf Development Acts the board may not borrow more than £28 million.  Its borrowings to date in respect of previous programmes total £27.7 million.  The Bill proposes to raise the borrowing limit to £60 million to cover the £28.5 million needed for the third programme and contingencies. The Bill provides that the additional borrowings may be made in any currency and that repayment may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance in foreign currencies should the need to do so arise.  The Minister is already empowered to guarantee borrowings by the board in the currency of the State.</P>
    <P>In the case of the first and second programmes the necessary capital was advanced by the Exchequer, but pressing demands on the Exchequer for other services could limit its capacity to meet the board's requirements in respect of the third programme.  The board has, therefore, been having discussions with its bankers about the possibility of raising finance from banking institutions. No decision has yet been taken <Col N="436" /> on how the programme will eventually be financed.</P>
    <P>A major difficulty which the board must face is how to remunerate its capital investment during the initial five years while the bogs are being got ready.  During this period there would be no production and hence no return to the board on the investment. In the case of the first and second programmes this difficulty was overcome by allowing the board a waiver of interest in respect of Exchequer advances for the initial five-year period and a deferment of repayment of capital until after the expiry of that period.  The board has proposed that a similar waiver and deferment be granted in respect of Exchequer advances for the new programme.  I am at present in consultation with the Minister for Finance about the whole question of the financing of the programme. Meanwhile section 3 of the Bill would enable a waiver of interest on similar lines to the earlier programmes to be granted to the board should it be found necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this third programme of Bord na Móna represents an important step in our developing energy policy.  The events of 1973 and 1974 brought home to us the vulnerability of our energy supply position. The availability of cheap and abundant supplies of oil from the Middle East led us in this country, as it did in many other western countries, into a position of overdependence on a single energy source. Moreover, it tended to stifle the incentive for the development of costlier alternative sources.</P>
    <P>The curtailment of oil supplies in late 1973 demonstrated the great insecurity of undue dependence on Middle East oil.  Moreover, the huge increases in oil prices added tremendously to the cost of energy, with repercussions on domestic consumers, industrial enterprises and almost all services.  These increased costs added to the difficulties already being experienced by business firms and thus aggravated the recession affecting the economy.  They also caused a sharp deterioration in the balance of payments position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> In the light of these developments, there is a clear need for a diversification of our energy sources so as to ensure improved security and stability. In the pursuit of this objective, priority must naturally be given to our native resources, because of security considerations, because of the balance of payments advantages and because the development of our own resources confers additional social and economic benefits.  An intensification of the turf development programme is fully compatible with these criteria.  It has, of course, been a basic aim of national policy to encourage the development of our bogs.  While the aim has been to pursue maximum economic development, the low price of oil which prevailed up to 1973 affected the scale and extent of previous bog development programmes.  In this respect, we should perhaps recognise that one effect of the energy crisis has been to lift the economic constraints which previously prevented the development of certain bog areas.  These previously uneconomic bogs will now be developed under the third programme.</P>
    <P>The opportunity presented by this Bill is being availed of to provide in section 5 two small but desirable improvements in the terms of the board's general employees superannuation scheme.  That scheme was established under section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  Under its terms pensionable service dates only from the date on which an employee enters the board's employment.  Some members recruited at an age which precluded them from achieving the qualifying period for full pension are anxious to be permitted to purchase the additional years needed for such qualification by making additional contributions to the scheme.</P>
    <P>Under the same scheme, pensions of members who die in service are payable for five years and pensions of members who die within five years of retirement are payable until the fifth anniversary of retirement.  However, when the board introduced their widows' and orphans' pension scheme on 1st September, 1972, this facility lapsed for new entrants to the board's service as from that date.  Employees <Col N="438" /> already on the board's staff who had been contributing towards this benefit were given the option of opting out of payment or retaining the benefit if they were prepared to pay the board's share of the contribution as well as their own.  If they decided to retain the benefit they would be required to pay an additional ½ per cent of their salary to the superannuation fund.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this Bill to the House.  It will make an important contribution to our energy objectives, as I have explained earlier.  It will provide a social and economic boost to the midland counties whose prosperity is closely linked with the scale of activity of Bord na Móna.  It will be a vote of confidence in the board who have always enjoyed the strong support of the whole community for the progress they have made down through the years.  The board have earned a high reputation for technical innovation and development and they hold an important place in the fabric of rural life.  I am confident that the House will join with me in commending the board for their initiative in coming forward with this programme by giving a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill which leads to the adoption of the third programme for Bord na Móna. Bord na Móna have been a success story within the framework of semi-State bodies and have achieved a lot during their short history.  They have given good employment to close on 6,000 people at peak periods.  This Bill will now lead to further employment by the board of a further 1,600 to 1,800 people.  This employment is badly needed at present due to economic trends and so on and the large number of unemployed.  The energy crisis of 1973 made us all more turf or bog conscious, and we had no alternative but to look at the further development of our own natural resources of fuel in order to survive the energy crisis.  The bogs were the obvious source of fuel to develop in order to lower the cost of our fuel bills and balance of payments resulting from fuel bills which jumped from <Col N="439" /> £30 million to £200 million in one year.</P>
      <P>On the question of further development of our bogs, I know that the board, and the Minister, will ensure that there will be no mad rush into the bogs by people who will cut turf all round them because the life of our bogs is somewhere in the region of 25 to 30 years.  Even at the present rate of production it needs careful planning.  A bog is like an oil well&mdash; it runs out in due course.  This is important from the point of view of the number employed.  They must be assured of a reasonably long working life while working for the board.  If the bogs run out there is no question of this happening.  It must be done in a well planned way in order to ensure that the employees involved will have a long working life.</P>
      <P>We should consider this planned development in the probability of our providing our own oil in future years. This will help to ease the balance of payments situation which we have. Side by side with the development of oil and natural gas, the bogs can go ahead and the board can continue to employ a large number of people who, I understand, are reasonably well satisfied working for the board. A good relationship has always existed between the board and their employees. The development of the bogs is important and I am sure the board will see to it that this development is done for the maximum benefit for all concerned, employees and turf users.</P>
      <P>With regard to developing bogs not owned by the board, some action needs to be taken at a local level in order to give people who burn turf an opportunity to cut turf.  It is a source of great frustration in western counties particularly that these bogs are inaccessible.  The road structure is the cause of this inaccessibility. There seems to be no road development or repair in progress in order to reach the turf.  The existing roads have gone into bad repair over the years because of lack of use and lack of turf cutting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are finding difficulty <Col N="440" /> getting to where they can cut turf.  I understand that the Department responsible for making grants available for these roads is the Department of Local Government through their special improvements schemes which are administered by county councils of each area.  Unfortunately, at present these grants are not available. They seem to have come to a standstill because of lack of funds being made available to local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I was going to suggest, because of the inactivity with regard to these roads, at present; because it is so essential to have access to these bogs for turf development some action should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree that he has had some leeway on the matter at this stage.  I would ask him to keep to the scope of the Minister's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider taking over this aspect of turf development in order that some action be taken.  It is very essential that something be done about it at present if we are to permit people to get into the bogs and cut turf, which they will be quite happy to do to keep down their fuel bills, whether it be oil or electricity.  As well as the <Col N="441" /> Bord na Móna bogs, the development of other bogs, whether privately owned or owned by the Land Commission, should be examined in great detail.  There should be no obstacle left in the way of people willing to develop bogs other than those owned by Bord na Móna.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider making grants available for the purchase of turf-cutting machines which were available previously from the western regional fund but which are no longer available.  Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Power would devise some scheme under which we can make grants available for the purchase of these turf-cutting machines which could be owned and worked on a co-operative basis and which would reduce considerably the labour factor.  It is work which is very dependent on fine weather.  It would eventually lead to cheaper fuel for turf users, if done on a co-operative basis.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has had any consultations with his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, as to whether there are Gaeltacht grants available at present for the development of bogs in the Gaeltacht. In the past I understand the Department of the Gaeltacht did make grants available for the development of these bogs.  I suggest that the Minister have consultations with the Minister for the Gaeltacht to see what can be done in this respect.  The Department of the Gaeltacht should involve themselves in this obvious development which can be carried out throughout the Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another minor point which has to do with turf development, one which has been drawn to my attention, about the non-availability of TVO fuel for tractors used in bogs. TVO fuel is used in Ferguson tractors. There is great difficulty being experienced at present in purchasing this type of fuel for tractors.  The Minister for Transport and Power should take some action to ensure that oil companies concerned, whether they be multi-national or otherwise, make this TVO fuel available to people who are dependent on using <Col N="442" /> tractors which work properly on TVO fuel only.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill.  We are in favour of the development outlined by the Minister in his brief, which we hope will be on a carefully planned basis to ensure long-term and secure employment which should reach something in the region of 7,500, to 8,000 people under this development for at least 30 years.  I am sure Bord na Móna will leave nothing undone in order to ensure such security of employment for their employees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be rather brief on this because there are a number of other Deputies offering. This is the third development programme submitted by Bord na Móna approved by the Government.  The Bill before the House was introduced in order to provide the finance to continue the programme.  It increases the amount of money that can be borrowed by Bord na Móna by £32 million.  I have no doubt but that the Board will spend this money in the way they have spent all previous moneys they have received.  In my opinion, Bord na Móna is one of the best run semi-State bodies in this country.  The manner in which it is run is a lesson to all other semi-State bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that a new megawatt unit will be erected at a site yet to be selected.  I want to state the claim of Ballyforan, County Roscommon, on the borders of County Galway.  On numerous occasions Roscommon County Council made representations to Bord na Móna, to the Minister for Transport and Power and have sent deputations here.  The bog at Ballyforan has a potential output in the region of 560,000 tons of bog milled peat per year.  That is sufficient to run an 80 megawatt power station.  The Minister for Transport and Power and Bord na Móna should bear this area in mind when siting the power station.  I know there are some problems in that area; some people and voluntary organisations have a fear with regard to pollution of some of the rivers there.  I am told that this can be easily overcome.  The Department of Local Government, <Col N="443" /> Bord na Móna and the Department of Transport and Power should convince these local organisations that there will be no problem.  If they can convince them then I do not think there will be any objection.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of a supply of water to the power station. There may be some fear on the part of people in towns in that area who get supplies of water from the river Suck.  Water is available at other rivers, for instance the Bunowne River which is not far away from Ballyforan.  If the water supply was not sufficient from the River Suck it should come from the Bunowne. These are the only objections to it and I do not think they would be very hard to overcome.  As the Minister and the Opposition Deputies have said, we have all learned too well a lesson about the cost of oil and the effect it has had on the country.  It is in our interests to produce as much as we can.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill because it was Eamonn de Valera who came to my parish in Clonsast to cut the first sod there on the turf development programme.  With due respect to all the Members of the House, I have a good right to speak here this afternoon on it.  In April last, I asked about making more money available to the board on the third programme. I am glad now that it has been seen fit to bring that Bill in here today.  It will create much badly needed employment in the midlands.</P>
      <P>During the years no other semi-State body have given such sound employment.  They have been able to pay their way and they have never been top-heavy with staff.  I should like to compliment the management of all the bogs and head office also for the manner in which they carried out all their projects and development. That applies to the workers also.  Most people know that the men have been working shifts since last March and they deserve our congratulations and thanks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> The Government are not providing any money for the programme.  It will all have to be financed through the banks.  It seems to me that it will take almost five years to get the programme off the ground as regards cash returns.  That will mean that the interest charged on the money will be very high.  I hope that the Government of the day will be able to see their way at least to waive the interest because if they do not the board, in order to pay their way and keep their head above water, will have to increase the price of fuel.</P>
    <P>Recently they had to increase the price of the turf from £7 to £9 a ton to pay their way.  People complain and ask the reason for the increase. It was because the board got no support from anywhere.  The Government gave them no support in regard to making a contribution.  They should have got at least £1 million from the Exchequer and this would have helped them out in some way. As I see it now, they are mostly depending on sales and borrowed money from the bank.  That is all right but I am always afraid of the interest and all the costs that accrue. Eventually they must be passed on to the consumer.  There is always the cost of wages to meet.  The cost of interest now is in the region of 12 per cent and that is very high.  I hope the Government will be able to give some help in this matter.</P>
    <P>In regard to the superannuation scheme I am glad that some improvements have taken place.  When the scheme was first brought in it was very paltry indeed.  Some employees, after having served 40 years, received only something in the region of £2 or £3 a week.  I know it has improved a lot now and I welcome the change.  It was badly needed.  I am glad for the spouse of the employee that the lump sum has been improved.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to Bord na Móna's new project regarding cattle.  In my area, which is vast, they have started the project and it has got off to a good start.  I hope that where many of the bogs have been cut away future development here will continue.  It is very worth while.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="445" /> I should like to refer also to some of the bogs that have been purchased by the board.  The price being offered for some of this bogland&mdash;and this has been going on for a long time&mdash; is ridiculous.  I do not know who the valuers are but some of the farmers have come to me and stated that they were most unhappy about it.  I have sympathy for them, and if something could be done in this respect to improve the price it would be very helpful.  When this bogland is taken the board develop it and now, when it is cut away, they are going to turn it into good grassland.  This is the right course but the price they are paying should be improved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The compulsory order is all right provided it applies in the same way as the council land for building houses, but at least it should be at market value.  I do not want anyone to think I am talking for the farmers alone.  Everyone will agree that £20 and £25 an acre for bogland today is out of the question.  I challenge anybody in the House to say that it is not.</P>
      <P>With the price of foreign fuel now bogs here can be developed more, especially a number of the bogs in Offaly, in Kilcormack, and parts of Birr.  I would like to see them developed because there is great potential in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see the extension at Shannon Bridge, which will give further employment.  I am also glad to see that the peat in the Kildare area will be brought from Offaly to be processed and developed.  I always said that Bord na Móna and the ESB are the two main employers in the midlands.  You can bring in what you like, from where you like, but one <Col N="446" /> thing can be said about Bord na Móna, they are consistent in giving employment and they pay good money.  In all the negotiations I had with the board since I came into public life, they treated me with respect and courtesy.  That goes for every official of the board, from the top to the bottom.  Bord na Móna was one semi-State body one could approach.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment them also on clearing the silt from the farmland drains.  A vast amount of silt goes through bogland and into the rivers. The board are quick to respond with their machines and workers to have these places cleared as quickly as possible.  In the winter time, when there is flooding, the silt moves from the bogs and blocks the landowners' drains.  This can cause havoc in the spring.  Bord na Móna have given wonderful help in this area.  They have also helped the Barrow Drainage Board in Laois/Offaly and made a very good contribution towards the carrying out of the work.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an extension in the briquette factory.  The swing is away from solid peat to briquettes.  I am very glad to see a development taking place there.  It can be said by some that we may develop too quickly, involve ourselves in too much money and find ourselves in difficulty, but I do not see that happening.  It can also be said that our bogs are good for another 30 years at least.  We are dependent on oil as a fuel.  We can talk about oil in Kinsale or anywhere else, but the chance of it becoming a natural resource is 10:1 as far as I am concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>They are 10:1 as far as I am concerned.  We know where we are with bogs.  We know we are able to generate electricity from turf or briquettes.  Therefore we should concentrate more on briquettes.  In this city there is a great demand for them because they are well packed and easily transported.  The board should look into an expansion in that line.  I know they are about to build another briquette factory, not in <Col N="447" /> Laois/Offaly I am sorry to say, but in Tipperary.  Wherever it goes it must bring about an improvement in employment.</P>
      <P>To conclude, I hope this Bill will strengthen the hand of the board, will make more employment available and, perhaps, with the co-operation of everybody, especially the management, there will be further worthwhile development in the midlands. As I said before, and without fear of contradiction, this semi-State body has paid its way, has given a good return for money, and brought hope and happiness to many people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise time is short so I will be brief.  As one who represents a county that has gained a lot from Bord na Móna I agree with what has been said concerning the board and the employment they give. I welcome this Bill as a means of providing further employment.  Bord na Móna have been a very important factor in employment for the midlands in general, and in County Kildare in particular.  This Bill will improve the board's borrowing capacity to provide development and much needed employment. Having said that, I join with others who have said that the board have done a good job and are capable managers.  There are a couple of points I would like to make which may not be in their favour.  I agree with what Deputy Connolly said of prices paid for bogland.  It is about time that the board realised that when they are buying bogland they are buying something valuable.  There is a feeling in my constituency that down the years the board had a right to move in on boglands and talk about price afterwards. The people also feel that in many cases they were done badly by the board.  I would not wish to take away their right to compulsorily acquire land for development schemes but a realistic price must be offered to the people who own land.  In certain cases people who were prepared to develop their own bogs and had been given the opportunity, were offered a ridiculous price for their bogland by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> I would not be doing justice to my constituents if I did not say that. There is a belief in my constituency that board officials went around to old widows who owned bits of bogs and absolutely codded them out of them.  I hope some proper scheme of valuation will form part of the future policy of the board.  The board have changed their policy lately because of certain action taken in the High Court and elsewhere by my constituents.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I know there are other Members wishing to contribute. I could go on talking for a long time because this Bill will have great influence in my constituency since Bord na Móna have had a great influence in my constituency. However, as time is short, I will let the other members contribute.</P>

I should like the Minister and the Members who spoke on both sides of the House to know that the record of Bord na Móna is good because it is mainly run by engineers from my old school, St. Mel's College, Longford.  That explains the efficiency and the development&mdash;not from fancy schools in Offaly or from Cork or Dublin, or the west or east of the country.  Engineers from St. Mel's developed Bord na Móna and we are justly proud of this development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The efficiency of the board is primarily due to the brains and energy those men put into Bord na Móna.  Deputy Connolly may make claims for Laois/Offaly but I still maintain that I am right.  Some years ago, reading the ESB report, I saw that the cost of the unit of electricity produced <Col N="449" /> from turf was much higher than that produced from the other fuels but, even at that time, most thinking people were prepared to justify the production of electricity from turf even though per unit it cost more than it would from imported fuels, because of the employment content and because of the social element in the cost the people were prepared to justify its use.  It is a strange turn of events that the increased price of oil should have brought about a position when, in answer to a question put down by me it now appears that the unit cost is cheapest for a unit of electricity produced from turf.</P>
      <P>There is a reference in the Minister's speech to the paper, &ldquo;The National Partnership&rdquo;.  This brings me to one of my hobby horses with regard to economics.  We seem to have a lot of the economics of the copy cat.  We have a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; over the water and we have a national partnership here in the following couple of months.  This is one of the things that worries people; we do not seem to be able to develop our own line of economics.  The Minister referred in his speech to the balance of payments.  To me there is a question to be answered when he comes to talking about where he is going to get this money.  He says that the board's activities at one time were financed from the Exchequer and this enabled the Exchequer to waive interest rates and to defer payment of capital and so on.  It is still desirable that our Exchequer should finance the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister goes abroad to borrow this money I do not see how, in fact, he will help the balance of payments by developing our own fuel with money borrowed abroad upon which interest has to be paid abroad. This is a serious flaw, and the Minister should talk seriously to the Minister for Finance and ask him to do the financing from our own resources if at all possible.  Deputy Barrett, our spokesman, in discussing the Bill mentioned the development of private bogs.  In most of my constituency people are going back again to harvesting their own turf.  This is a great saving for the country.  They <Col N="450" /> had been switching to oil and coal over the years but many of them this year&mdash;they had a marvellous opportunity in that the summer was a fine one&mdash;have gone back to producing turf for their own use.  This should be encouraged.  I do not want to go over the ground about the LIS, which was referred to by Deputy Barrett.  The Department of Lands has some responsibility with regard to some of the approaches to private bogs, and perhaps just mentioning it might suggest to that Department that some money might be spent on bog roads and bog passes to make access to bogs easier.</P>
    <P>With regard to the production of briquettes, I am glad to see that the demand for them is increasing, and I am glad to see that provision is being made for financing increased production. Some years ago a very damaging statement was made in one of the Houses of the Oireachtas about the tarring effect that comes from burning briquettes.  That was adequately answered by the board at the time. Everybody knows that briquettes provide a very clean quick-lighting and efficient fuel.</P>
    <P>With regard to peat moss, I have seen criticism that over-development of this part of the industry tends to impoverish us and we may run out of material and so on.  This does not cut any ice with me at all.  When one has a thriving industry like that it should be fully developed.  Improved technology and improved knowledge will find something else if our resources run out in that particular line.</P>
    <P>It is true that in my own area the use of peat for gardening and farming was wellknown scientifically though the actual product was not scientifically prepared as the peat moss is nowadays. It was known that in certain soils peat moss was very useful for loosening the soil and thus enriching it.  The Minister deserves to get the support of the House for this Bill.  I am concerned, however, about where the money, up to a certain limit will come from.  I hope that what the Minister is doing with one hand he will not undo with the other.  In other words, whatever the Minister is saving by way of balance of payments in developing <Col N="451" /> our native resources he will not lose by borrowing abroad and paying a high rate of interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Just before we adjourned I was explaining that the object of this amendment, effectively, is to have the first valuation date for wealth tax occur on 5th April, 1976. I was drawing attention to the fact that that is what the Government indicated would happen in the White Paper.  The White Paper at paragraph 93, read:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April </P>
      <P>and there was a statement on page 60 of the White Paper which read:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Annual Wealth Tax:</i> The date of commencement will be 6th April, 1975. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only reasonable interpretation of the White Paper, and as I indicated earlier the way in which it was interpreted, was that the first valuation date would be 5th April, 1976.  It is an annual wealth tax.  For obvious, technical reasons it must be charged on the basis of the wealth on a <Col N="452" /> particular day in the year and as indicated in the White paper, the likely valuation date would be 5th April, which is what the Bill provides. What the Bill does not provide though, and what was indicated in the White Paper, is that the commencement date for this annual wealth tax would be 6th April and, therefore, that the first valuation date would be 5th April, 1976.  This Bill provides the first valuation date as the 5th April, 1975.  Therefore, the wealth tax is being introduced a year earlier than was indicated in the White Paper.  The consequences of that have included long sittings of the House, a guillotine motion, considerable strain on the staff of this House, problems for potential taxpayers who will, when the Bill is passed, be legally liable for wealth tax from 5th April last; with all that that entails in the preparation of valuations of their wealth for the purpose of the tax&mdash; and inevitable strain on the staff of the Revenue Commissioners in setting up the operation of the tax a year earlier than was indicated in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Why the wealth tax should have been introduced a year earlier than was indicated in the White Paper is something of a mystery.  I have merely been indicating some of the consequences. When one considers the state of our economy at present, it becomes even more of a mystery.  I doubt if anybody on the Government benches would contend that this is an auspicious time for the introduction of a wealth tax even if they believed in the whole principle of a wealth tax in our circumstances.  That being so, the mystery of why the Government have brought forward the introduction of the wealth tax by one year deepens.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to operate the Bill in the way that was indicated by the Government that it would be operated.  On earlier stages we sought to get the Government to agree to carry out what they said they would carry out.  So far they have not agreed.  There is every reason why this amendment should be accepted because, apart from the <Col N="453" /> Government's statement and the impression that created in the mind of anyone who read the White Paper and apart from the economic difficulties, in view of the other difficulties which present themselves in the operation of a new tax such as this is, it would be reasonable to expect that there would be some interval allowed after the Bill had been enacted to enable people&mdash;not just taxpayers and their advisers but the Revenue Commissioners&mdash;to evaluate what was the content and effect of the Bill as enacted.  No such interval is being allowed in the timetable the Government are now pursuing because the Bill will go through the House, according to the guillotine motion, on Wednesday next.  It will then go to the Seanad where, no matter what points are raised or what discussion takes place, it must be passed within 21 days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us assume, for the purpose of the Minister's argument, that they pass it in one day.  It will then become law some time early in August with a provision in it that people are legally liable for payment of wealth tax on 5th April last.  Is the Minister aware of that fact?  It is no answer to say that he has introduced <Col N="454" /> an amendment to say you will not have to pay interest on tax outstanding if you pay it before 5th December.  The idea of saying in a Bill enacted by both Houses of the Oireachtas that tax is legally due and payable months back is just nonsense. It would never have happened if the Government had adhered to what they said they were going to do in the White Paper.</P>
      <P>This amendment is seeking to get the Government to do what they said they would do in the White Paper which, given that one is going to have a wealth tax, would have been a reasonable approach, an approach which would have allowed a reasonable opportunity to everybody concerned to study the enactment and to prepare for its operation.  It would have allowed the Revenue Commissioners, who are already overburdened, to gear themselves up to the administration of the wealth tax. That is not being done in the Bill as it stands.  The only way it can be done is by acceptance of this amendment.</P>
      <P>We gave the Government an opportunity before this to mend their hand in this regard.  They are now getting another opportunity to do so.  If the Government fail to avail themselves of that opportunity, then the responsibility for what ensues will rest clearly on the shoulders of the Government and no one else.  Furthermore, people can judge for themselves why the Government should have decided to rush this Bill through and implement it one year earlier than they said they would in the White Paper.  It is up to the Government to choose which way they want this to eventuate, which decision they want the people to arrive at as to their motives.  In this amendment I am giving an opportunity, probably the last opportunity, to the Government to mend their hand in this regard. As I indicated, if they do not avail themselves of it, the responsibility is clearly on the shoulders of the Government and nobody else.</P>

      <P>As on the previous amendment, I do not wish to repeat Deputy Colley's arguments in <Col N="455" /> a parrot-like way though I support them.  I want to put them in a slightly different form.  Deputy Colley has quite rightly based his case in the first instance on page 60 of the White Paper on Capital Taxation laid by the Minister for Finance before each House of the Oireachtas on 28th February, 1974.  In that official document the question of capital taxation was analysed.  There was a foreword by the Minister for Finance. Various parties were invited to make recommendations not later than the end of June, 1974.  June, 1974, was about nine months before April, 1975.  On that point, we all know how long it takes to deal with representations. We have had plenty of experience in this House of the delay involved and the time it takes to provide for legislation.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the novelty, the scope and the likely volume of the subsequent legislation, that nine months&mdash;the minimum time to consider the legislation in question&mdash; seemed to anyone who knew about these things to be rather short, that is, always assuming the Minister was serious in inviting representations and was willing to consider fully and give due weight to representations, that he was not just bluffing people and telling them to send in their recommendations and then virtually putting them in the wastepaper basket when they came in.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that the indication in the foreword was that it would take some time to prepare that legislation after the date in June. As I have said, the proposals were novel and far-reaching.  We then come to page 45 of the same Government document and it says in paragraph 93:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present the 5th April.  As a fixed annual date invites evasion, safeguards would be introduced to protect the tax base from artificial depreciation of the market value of assets. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a most material paragraph in respect of what Deputy Colley is urging.  It says: &ldquo;at present the 5th <Col N="456" /> April&rdquo; and there has never been any suggestion of an immediate change of that date.  In fact, in changing the law not so very long ago in regard to the financial year the tax difficulties were such, if I understand the picture correctly, that the tax date could not be adjusted to the end of the calendar year as many other things were, including rates.  It was this Government who made the adjustment in regard to rates.</P>
    <P>Right through the debate it has been clear the 5th April stands and that being so nobody could be under the illusion that the tax date was to be changed from 5th April notwithstanding the use of the words &ldquo;at present the 5th April&rdquo;.  On page 45 of the Government's own White Paper there is the statement that the wealth tax would be valued on, say, the last day of the tax year, at present 5th April. It would be valued on 5th April as, indeed, the Minister proposes to do. This is a material consideration.  Anybody reading that would say that the tax date was as it is, 5th April.</P>
    <P>The safeguards to protect the taxpayer from artificial depreciation of market values of assets is mentioned there, but, of course, that was done, amongst other things, by the warnings given.  No argument can be made out of that warning because that warning synchronised with the date of the issue of the White Paper and nothing could be read into that warning.  It was simply a warning that said: &ldquo;Now you have got notice of what we are going to do, from the time of this notice the intention will operate.&rdquo; The warning gave no indication whatever of date.  The fact that it was synchronised with the appearance of the White Paper deprived that fact of any significance as to when the tax was to come in.  The Minister cannot invoke that point to qualify the argument I am basing on paragraph 93.</P>
    <P>On page 60 the final paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>The date of commencement will be 6th April, 1975.  The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76. </P>
    <P>The Minister is jumping because he thinks he has the answer but he has <Col N="457" /> not.  The words used are: &ldquo;from the tax year&rdquo;, and a year is a year.  If the Minister wants it we can argue whether it is from the beginning of the year or from the end of the year. That argument can be answered by the argument we are making about 6th of April, the date of commencement.</P>
    <P>The point is that anybody reading this paper would come to the conclusion that the tax assessable on 5th of April would be assessable at the end of the financial year in question. That is Deputy Colley's point.  He holds that it should, therefore, be on the 5th of April, 1976 which would be the last day of the financial year 1975.</P>
    <P>Firstly, we had the Minister's foreword.  Secondly, the paragraph on page 45 &ldquo;...would be valued on the last day of the tax year...&rdquo; and that would be 5th April, 1976.  Lastly, the 6th of April, 1975, would be the first day of the year in question.  In other words taking the 6th April, 1975, that could only be 5th April, 1976, as the first day of the year, as would be the custom, and taking the last day as 5th April, that would correspond to what is in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>That, in a nutshell, is the case Deputy Colley has made on the White Paper.  It is a fair case that the capital taxation will be fully operated from the year 1975-76.  I do not think that is a strange interpretation.  This argument cannot be brushed aside by saying: &ldquo;What is in a day?&rdquo; It is not what is in a day; there is much more involved in it than that.  It is what is in a year.  Deputy Colley has given reasons about the time factors and the uncertainties.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I want to get that argument clearly on the record to test the credibility of Governments for the future, and the present Government in particular.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;credibility&rdquo; in a pejorative sense; I want to use it in the simple meaning of the word.  I do not want to use it in the sense of vulgar abuse. The Minister for Finance has more than once on Committee Stage claimed when we were making an argument that the people who would be concerned <Col N="458" /> would be mainly people who knew what it was all about and who would have readily available expert advice.  Let me take the Minister for Finance up on that.  Deputy Esmonde may have a different opinion to mine, but would one fault an accountant or a barrister who might be more cautious and suspicious?  Would you fault an accountant who read that White Paper and said to a client: &ldquo;You had better get ready for this, certain things are fixed as of 28th February, the day the White Paper was issued but reading the Minister's foreword, people have up to the end of June to make representations.&rdquo; Could one be faulted for saying that page 45 says it will be the end of the tax year and the tax date, for all we know&mdash;there is no sign of it being changed&mdash;is 5th April, the last day of the financial year?</P>
    <P>The custom is that tax is assessed at the end of a year.  Would you fault an accountant, a solicitor or even a barrister&mdash;who, from training and wide experience normally is conditioned to being suspicious&mdash;would you blame any of these men, much less the knowledgeable client the Minister for Finance has so often postulated, for coming to the conclusion that the first time tax would be payable would be on the 5th April, 1976?  Would that be an impossibly rash or mistaken view of the White Paper?  We have given our interpretation here.  But I submit to the Minister that it is not to be brushed aside with the facile answer &ldquo;what is in a day?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The sentence that the system of capital taxation will therefore be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76 cannot be used to refute the argument. I will read that sentence again.  &ldquo;The system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76.&rdquo;  There are two words to be noted in that&mdash;&ldquo;from&rdquo; and &ldquo;fully&rdquo;.  The tax year 1975-76 ends on the 5th April, 1976.  Can you blame anyone for saying that taxation will be fully operative from the end of that year?  What does the word &ldquo;fully&rdquo; mean?  We have already had capital gains tax, which is operative in the <Col N="459" /> year 1974-75.  The capital acquisitions tax will be operative and would have been expected to be operative in the current year 1974-75.  These Acts were going to be operative anyway from the 28th February, 1974.  Under the notice given the Act was partly operative from the 27th February, 1974.  The capital gains tax, of its nature, could be expected to be operative during the year 1974-75.  The capital acquisitions tax could be expected to be operative in that year also, because nobody in their senses could expect a complete moratorium on death duties for a year.</P>
    <P>In spite of the marginal note in the Finance Act that death duties are abolished; estate duty was suspended but, from the 5th April, 1975, legacy duty, or whatever one likes to call it, death duties in another form, continue. If there is any doubt about it I have that document which was circulated to solicitors bearing out what I mentioned this morning.  I can quite understand the Minister saying to me: what are you at?  I am at a very simple point, the meaning of the word &ldquo;fully&rdquo;. If the new system of capital taxation was to be fully operative in the year 1974-75 why say it will therefore be fully operative in the year 1975-76 as is said in this White Paper?  The whole system of capital taxation is already partially operative in the year 1974-75.  It is partially operative in the current year 1975-76.  It will be fully operative only from the tax year 1975-76.  I have made the point that &ldquo;from&rdquo; means from the end of the year.  If I say it is such and such a distance from a certain road I normally mean from the end of the road nearest me.  In the same way, if I say from a period of time the normal meaning is that it is operative from the end of that period of time.</P>
    <P>In fact what that sentence means is that this system of capital taxation will not be fully operative until the end of the current year, the year 1975-76. If all the provisions entailed in the capital acquisitions tax and capital gains tax are legally fully operative in the current year, and even if parts of them were not, certainly it is a fair <Col N="460" /> assumption that this sentence indicates that it was visualised that some part of this legislation was not going to be fully operative in the current year.  On the terms of the Wealth Tax Bill, and with the explicit statements on pages 45 and 60 of the White Paper, it was a very fair inference that the reference to the part that would not be fully operative was the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>I am trying to present the case, the White Paper, on a factual basis.  I want to present Deputy Colley's point in a logical and legal way.  This White Paper goes to the credibility of the Administration in this matter.</P>
    <P>In repetition and summary, the Minister's foreword signed &ldquo;Richie Ryan&rdquo;, dated 28th February, 1974, on page III; the statement on page 45 I have quoted; the statement on page 60 to which Deputy Colley adverted more than once, and that I have now parsed in its context.  I affirm and plead that that would have left any responsible adviser in the position of expecting that the date on which the burden would become operative or the wealth tax would become fully operative would be the 5th April next, not 5th April, 1975.  That is not a trivial argument.  The consequences are serious for all concerned.  They are serious for the Revenue Commissioners administratively, no matter what one can say.  One can lay the best plans in anticipation but we know, and I am sure the Revenue Commissioners and the other Departments of State have all had experience of this, it is very hard to get work under way and to reach finality until you know essentially what you are catering for.</P>
    <P>There have been many amendments to these Bills.  It would be asking too much of the Revenue Commissioners, even with their computers and with the relief that they are expecting in the estate duty office. That is slightly illusory; it will be simply transferring their activities. They do not yet know precisely, though I suppose they know perhaps 90 per cent, what they are up against, but that psychological factor is there among the staff, and when the flag <Col N="461" /> comes down they will be up against all these problems familiar to those of us who have had to organise a project.</P>
    <P>It is just like a political party when it comes to an election.  There could be talk about a general election for months before with everybody preparing, but it is only when the Taoiseach comes out and says that the Dáil is dissolved that one goes into action.  It is amazing the amount of work that perhaps could have been done beforehand that now has to be done.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners, and the taxpayers this is a hurried measure and it will lead to errors and errors will lead to more trouble for the Revenue Commissioners.  It will lead to disputes about interest, genuine mistakes, evasion, how to distinguish which is which and so on.</P>
    <P>When I used the word &ldquo;credibility&rdquo; I did not do so in a pejorative way.  What I am urging the Minister is to realise the necessity for good faith and, even at Report Stage it is not too late to make the necessary amendment when it is appreciated what is in this.</P>
    <P>That is the case presented as I have presented it and there is no need to go back on what Deputy Colley said. The principle of making a tax legally due and payable months before the legislation is imposed is something that has to be done when notice is given in order to avoid evasion.  I have no quarrel whatever with the restrictions that were put on when notice was given on 28th February. When you go beyond that it is a very undesirable development in taxation to introduce at the one time extensions of the liability to assess oneself, extensions of the penalties through interest bearing, and then to add to that an extension of the idea that you can create a tax liability retrospectively.</P>
    <P>These things are bad in principle, and when they are bad in principle they will inevitably lead to various difficulties.  Remember we are not living in the old days, we are living in an unstable world.  To quote Deputy <Col N="462" /> Colley, we are imposing a tax legally due and payable months back after the passing of this Bill.  There is food for thought.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said that there was a bit of a mystery about the rushing of this legislation.  Here I am going to be frankly political, as I am entitled to be. Everything I have said on this amendment to date was meant to be helpful, constructive, objective, a fair, intelligent legal interpretation of the situation&mdash;the type of thing that if I were wearing a wig I would present to the court.  That was my approach.  Let me, so to speak, now take off my wig and put on another hat and become the politician.  If I am the politician I can give a pretty simple answer to the mystery that Deputy Colley finds in this.  The mystery is simple.  Capital gains was a popular political name: people were worried about the nice little sums of money that speculators made.  That Bill then could be called what it was called.</P>
    <P>In the deliberately political misleading marginal note, to the first Finance Bill, we had a Minister and the Government adumbrating the phrase &ldquo;abolition of death duties&rdquo; when it was, in fact, a suspension of estate duties.  I am giving full credit, as I said on that Bill, for the great improvements and I am in favour of a lot of that legislation.  The Government did themselves a disservice in what they did there; instead of calling that Bill what it was, they called it by the grand name of Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill.  Fair enough; it is just a little political gimmick.  They wanted to pretend that they abolished death duties. They did not, and to my mind they did themselves a disservice because they gave fairly good reliefs.  They are arguing a very good thing and for the life of me I cannot see why they did not bring in that Act.</P>
    <P>Wealth tax sounds good.  It is a great name, it is a catchword.  They call this a wealth tax when it is really a property tax.  I suspect that the rush is a political one.  I see no mystery.  It is a political point to pretend and say, &ldquo;we are going to tax all the rich people.  The money we collect will contribute to our economic <Col N="463" /> and social welfare.&rdquo;  The fact is there will not be very much money. The Minister has not told us if that is so, but my guess is that there will not be much money.  There are not as many rich people in this country to be made the objects of this scapegoat exercise as some might think.  It is being rushed in as something that looks well.  Instead, it will cost a lot of money; it is at the wrong time; it is not achieving its purpose properly, and we, on this side of the House, are all for taxing non-productive wealth.  The Minister would be shoving an open door.  He has had our arguments about its repercussions on employment and productive wealth. As far as taxing the non-productive and luxurious wealth and so on, we are all with him.  We want to know why he has to rush it in at this moment, when it is not going to do anybody any earthly good in the present financial year.  Its administration will be complicated and costly.  It will be responsible for individual injustice, errors and so on.  With that political plea, I supplement the quasi-legal presentation of the points made earlier by Deputy Colley.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): A wealth tax is an annual tax in the sense that it is paid once a year.  It is not an annual tax in the sense that income tax is.  The difference is that income tax covers a person's income or earnings for the entire tax year and therefore the entire year is relevant to the amount of tax payable.  Wealth tax is different.  It is payable and leviable in respect of wealth which is taxable and in the possession of the taxpayer on a given date.  It is important to note that in so far as wealth tax is concerned, one day only in the year is all-important with, admittedly, certain devices for dealing with avoidance.  One day and one day only is important in regard to the payment of wealth tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper said, on page 60&mdash; and it has been so quoted by the Opposition&mdash;that the date of commencement will be the 6th April, 1975.  That is simple language.  The date of commencement means the <Col N="464" /> date on which a person will be taxable in respect of wealth tax.  I repeat, a person is not taxable in respect of 12 months, but in respect of one day.  Then, admittedly, one is not troubled again until that day 12 months.  But if a person has £200,000 in his possession on the valuation day, 5th April, 1975, he is liable for wealth tax on that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, he is liable for wealth tax if he has in his possession and owns £200,000 on the 5th April, 1975. Irrespective of what he does with himself or with his money between that date and the 5th April, 1976, he will be taxed on £200,000.  If he is a gambling man, goes to the Derby in June, 1975, backs the favourite and gets himself £400,000 or £500,000, he will still only be taxed on the £200,000, subject to exemptions and thresholds, which he had on 5th April, 1975.  Or, if he is not so lucky and disaster befalls him, and he again goes to the Derby and loses his £200,000, or the greater part of it, he will still be taxed on the £200,000 he had on 5th April, 1975.  Therefore, there is no point referring to the tax year, and saying that because the tax year was to commence on the 6th April, 1975, that that is referable to the tax year 1975-76, and the whole year is to be taken into consideration. There is only one date here, and the date specified in the White Paper was the 6th April, 1975.  Admittedly, there is one day sooner, the 5th instead of the 6th&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): In the sense that it is payable once a year.  In order to understand what is involved here and to see the reason why April, 1975, was selected, we must understand that, as the White Paper said, this was one of three taxes that was being introduced in substitution for death duties.  About that there is no doubt.  Sometimes it is said by the Opposition that the Capital Acquisition tax was the tax introduced to replace death duties.  Death duties were a crippling tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to go over the whole thing again.  The person concerned here with £100,000 would be liable to £41,000 taken in death duties.  If he had £200,000 he would have over £100,000 taken in death duties.  That was appreciated by this Government and that was appreciated when the White Paper was published and when the legislation was being introduced. It is stated in black and white the Government have decided that, if these objectives are to be achieved, the three existing death duties&mdash;namely estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty&mdash;must be abolished and replaced. &mdash;I invite the Opposition to note carefully, replaced&mdash;by a capital gains tax, an annual wealth tax and a capital acquisitions tax.  There we have the proposal in the White Paper as clear as ABC to replace death duties by <i>inter alia</i> the wealth tax.  Replacement does not mean in ordinary language that you do away with death duties this year and replace them with another tax in 12 months time.  The ordinary man in the street understands by replacement that you do away with one thing and, at the same time, replace it with another.  That is what was done here.  That is as clear as anybody can put it and the White Paper said that <Col N="466" /> clearly.  The people were glad.  Estate duty was abolished as from the 31st of March in respect of families as promised by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no use Deputy de Valera saying that it was not replaced, because it was replaced.  Death duties is defined in legislation as meaning estate duty, legacy duty and succession duty.  Those three types of duty were abolished as from the end of March of this year.  The Government promised that, when it did that, it would replace those taxes by <i>inter alia</i> a wealth tax.  That is the reason that the wealth tax came into operation early in April of this year.  I do not believe that anybody was or has been deceived by the White Paper.  I honestly believe that this whole argument is a political argument.  First of all, there was a demand throughout the summer and autumn of last year, following the publication of the White Paper, that the Wealth Tax Bill be introduced immediately so that the people could see where they stood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): There was a general demand.  There was pressure on the Government and there were representations to the Department to publish the Bill so that the people could see where they stood.  If the White Paper meant and, was understood to mean, that it was not going to come into operation until 1976 what was the hurry?  There was none.  Furthermore, we know that private non-trading companies are taxable entities without thresholds.  If the White Paper meant that wealth tax was not going to come into operation until April, 1976, what was the rush about dismantling and liquidating these private non-trading companies? There was a hurry and a rush and a great many of them were dismantled, liquidated&mdash;call it what you like&mdash;last year in anticipation of the introduction of the wealth tax in April of this year.  That is why I say that this argument is a political argument. It is not alone a political argument, it is an afterthought.</P>

Even though I say so myself, the reference to the man with £200,000 on 5th April, 1975 and the fact that he either made or marred himself on Derby Day did not in the slightest affect his liability for wealth tax in that year, demonstrates that this is not a tax which is referred to in relation to a whole year.  It is a tax referred to in connection with a person's wealth on a certain date.</P>

They have wasted their own time and the time of the country because they, as an Opposition, are the watchdogs of the country.  They are wasting time on this particular section, which is a broad section. They will leave themselves with no time for the remainder of Report Stage.  If they have decided on that course of action I cannot help them. They must be judged by the country.</P>
      <P>Because they did that I introduced an amendment, first of all, extending the interest-free period, which was originally three months from the valuation date.  It was then extended to October. I extended it further up to 5th December to take account of the particular circumstances in this year.  The position is as I have stated. First of all, 6th April, 1975 is mentioned and paragraph 45 is only a discussion paragraph.  It says:</P>
      <P>The wealth of the taxpayer would be valued on, say, </P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Yes, and we make that the date.  Anyone would think to hear the Opposition talking that this was something hard and fast which was written into the White Paper.  It is only by way of example and explaining to the people how wealth tax works.  First of all, there is that and then the statement on page 60 that the tax will commence on 6th April, 1975.  There was a great demand for the Bill in the summer of last year so that people could examine it and know where they stood.  Then there was the dismantling of the unfavoured private non-trading companies so that they would not be caught for tax in April, 1975.  This tax was introduced to replace death duties which the Government undertook to abolish and did abolish as from the end of March.  Deputy de Valera made the point, which I accept, that the last date for representations in regard to this Bill and the other Bills was June of last year, so that progress would be made on the drafting.  There are all those things coupled with the statement by Sandford, Willis and Ironside that the tax was commencing in April, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

All the indications received, the demand for the Bill, the dismantling of the private non-trading companies, the last date for representations, June, 1974, the statement in the White Paper that the <Col N="472" /> tax commences on 6th April, 1975, and the statement in this published authority, all indicated clearly that the tax would operate as from a valuation date in April, 1975.  Nothing could be clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister in his political experience and I would imagine also in his professional experience on occasions, has had to make the best he could of a poor case.  I doubt if he has ever had as difficult a task as he has had just now. I pay him the tribute that he did it very well considering the poor quality of the case.</P>
      <P>First, the Minister said that since we are arguing one thing and he is arguing the other, an independent view of the situation should tip the scales. He then proceeded to quote what he said was an independent view&mdash;I accept it as independent but what did it say?  It said that the wealth tax would commence in 1975.  That is exactly what the White Paper said.  The date of commencement would be 6th April, 1975.  The argument he quotes does not help him.  I will refer him to an independent view of the situation.</P>
      <P>I received and I think every Deputy in the House received representations in regard to the Wealth Tax Bill from the Irish Farmers' Association.  If the Minister looks at that, he will find precisely made in that the very point about the reference in pages 45 and 60 to the 5th April and the commencement on the 6th April.  There is no doubt as to how they read it or how very many people who are interested in wealth tax read the White Paper. They could not read it in any other way no matter how the Minister tries to gloss over its significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said he would deal with a particular point which he did not deal with.  I reminded him of it and again he did not deal with it.  It is significant that he did not.  That is the fact that page 45 refers to the valuation date as being likely to be the 5th April and that page 60 says the commencement date will be the 6th April.  The Minister said that the commencement date being the 6th April meant that would be the valuation date.  If that is <Col N="473" /> true, then there is a contradiction between page 45 and page 60 of the White Paper.  I invited the Minister to comment on that and explain his view of it.  He did not.  He avoided it very carefully and for a very good reason.</P>
    <P>He knows as well as I do that the White Paper can mean only one thing. It said the valuation date was likely to be the 5th April as, indeed, it has turned out to be in the Bill.  It said that the commencement of the wealth tax which it describes as &ldquo;annual wealth tax&rdquo; will be 6th April, 1975. It did not say the 5th April, the 26th April, or 4th April.  It did not say April.  The Minister tried to suggest on another occasion that there was no difference between one date and another date in April.  There is a difference between the 5th and 6th April of one year.  That is the difference. It is the difference in the tax year, and no amount of glossing over this by the Minister will get over the fact that the White Paper clearly said the annual wealth tax would be commencing on 6th April, 1975, and that the valuation date was likely to be 5th April in each year.</P>
    <P>If the annual wealth tax commences on 6th April, 1975, and if the valuation date is 5th April, which 5th April can it be referring to?  The one before the commencement date?  Is not that impossible?  The Minister knows that quite well.  Furthermore, the Minister said there is no point in referring to tax years when you are talking about a tax that commences on a particular date, not in a year.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the statement in the White Paper:</P>
    <P>...the new system of capital taxation will therefore be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76. </P>
    <P>Each of the systems of capital taxation proposed relates to a particular date, not to a year, except the wealth tax which is described as an annual wealth tax.  None of the others&mdash;capital gains tax, gift tax, inheritance tax &mdash;refers to anything other than something arising on a particular date.  Yet the White Paper refers to the tax year 1975-76.  There is a good reason <Col N="474" /> why it refers to that.  I am quoting from pages 59 and 60 of the White Paper on Capital Taxation under the heading Introduction of New Taxes:</P>
    <P>Capital Gains Tax: The charge would commence from 6 April 1974... </P>
    <P>Then it goes on to refer to measures to counter avoidance before that.</P>
    <P>Capital Acquisitions Tax:</P>
    <P>Gifts: To prevent avoidance, gifts made on or after the date of this Paper, viz. 28 February 1974 would be liable...</P>
    <P>Inheritances: ...the inheritance tax element of the proposed capital acquisitions tax will not come into effect until 1 April, 1975. </P>
    <P>Each of those dates is prior to 5th April, 1975.  They are all in the tax year 1974-75.  Then it goes on:</P>
    <P>Annual wealth tax: The date of commencement will be 6 April, 1975.</P>
    <P>The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76. </P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were intended that the wealth tax first valuation date would be 5th April, 1975, that sentence should read: &ldquo;The new system of capital taxation will, therefore, be fully operative from the tax year 1974-75&rdquo;. Each of those dates would be in that tax year.  But it says 1975-76 because the wealth tax was not to commence until the tax year 1975-76.  The wealth tax is commencing on 5th April of this year which is in the tax year 1974-75.</P>
      <P>This, I believe, is just as plain to the Minister as it is to me and to everybody else but he has to maintain this facade.  The fact of the matter is that the Government have introduced the wealth tax a year ahead of the time they said they would.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Any attempt by the Government to force it through is something they are doing, and if we are spending time on these matters&mdash; it is the duty and responsibility of the Opposition to do it&mdash;and in so far as the time available to do it is limited, that time being limited arises from two facts both of which are the responsibility of the Government, one, the decision to bring in the wealth tax a year earlier than stated in black and white in the White Paper and, two, the introduction and passing of a guillotine by the Members of the Coalition parties in this House.  They are the reasons the discussion on this Bill is being restricted and no other.</P>
      <P>The consequences for the Revenue Commissioners and for the taxpayers and their advisers, which will be serious, are all arising directly out of the Government's decision to bring in the wealth tax a year earlier than stated in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred to the mystery of why this decision was made.  Deputy de Valera said there was no mystery as far as he was concerned.  He understood it and explained what he understood. I am aware of what he was talking about, but there are other possible explanations, perhaps even more sinister.  That is why I prefer to cover the whole thing with the blanket term of &ldquo;mystery&rdquo;.  I do not want to waste time speculating on this.  People can do that for themselves.  You do not have to speculate about the facts of <Col N="476" /> the situation.  The facts are clear. They are in the White Paper and they are spelled out on the record of this House.  Having said the whole system of capital taxation would be fully operative from the tax year 1975-76, if the Minister is now correct in what he is saying, the Government should have said the year 1974-75.  They did not say that and the reason is in the line above it.  The commencement was to be the 6th April, 1975.</P>
    <P>The position is quite clear.  The Government are insisting on rushing through the wealth tax a year ahead of schedule with all the consequences for everybody concerned, including this House.  We have done our best to point out the damage being done.  We have demonstrated in regard to the capital gains tax beyond any doubt the value of the kind of opposition we are giving on matters of this kind, the vast improvements that have been made in the Capital Gains Tax Bill directly as a consequence of the manner in which we were able to study and discuss it in this House.  That is being denied to us in regard to the wealth tax. The reasons are ones that the Government may explain to the country if they wish.  The facts are clear; the Government have gone back on what they said in the White Paper and are directly responsible for all the consequences, including the long hours in this House and the application of the guillotine.  So be it, we have done our part.  This amendment is designed, as far as possible, to remedy that situation but if the Government wish to refuse to do it so be it, the consequences are on their heads.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 4, lines 26 and 27, after &ldquo;wheresoever situate&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;other than property in the State, which is agricultural property or is used directly in the provision of <Col N="479" /> employment in the State and stock and shares of a trading company trading in the State,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of discussion on this Bill on previous Stages, the Minister for Finance, and on other occasions the Minister for Lands sitting in for him, repeatedly referred to the fact that trading companies are not liable to wealth tax as though the imposition of wealth tax on shareholders in a trading company would have no effect on the operations of a trading company. This amendment relates not to companies but to an individual.  It seeks to exempt from wealth tax productive assets in the hands of an individual.  Therefore, I suggest it does not leave any room for clouding of the issue as to what is involved here because what is involved is whether it makes sense, economically, to impose wealth tax on productive assets in the hands of individuals and, in particular, in the hands of individuals who are shareholders in trading companies which, as I said earlier, are themselves not liable to wealth tax.</P>
    <P>We have been told in the past about other EEC countries having wealth tax.  The Minister has been rather coy about mentioning some of the EEC countries which do not have a wealth tax&mdash;of course all of them are far more wealthy than we are&mdash;nor has he been terribly explicit about the countries which have wealth taxes as to how precisely such taxes operate.  In general, it is true to say that those of the EEC countries which do have a wealth tax operate different systems. None of them operates a system similar to ours either as regards scope, methods of valuation or, I think, rates. But to pick out a portion of a wealth tax in one country, for instance the rates being charged, and compare that with the rate being charged in other countries is quite meaningless unless one is also comparing the scope of the tax, that is, the kind of assets to which it is applied and the methods of valuing those assets.  Even if one could demonstrate that there were other EEC countries which operate a wealth tax similar in all respects to the system proposed in this Bill the <Col N="480" /> question still arises as to whether it makes sense, in our circumstances, to apply such a wealth tax to productive assets here.</P>
    <P>It is so obvious that we are in a major recession having regard to the level of unemployment, the level of inflation, the downturn in our economy, the contractions rather than even holding our own, and all the other indicators with which we have been dealing recently that we are in a grave recession and that nobody would attempt to argue that it would be helpful to our recovery to apply a wealth tax at the moment to productive assets.</P>
    <P>The main argument made in the past by the Government is that the impact of this wealth tax will be so small as to make very little difference. That argument is totally mistaken.  It is mistaken in that a wealth tax applied to productive assets creates a climate of opinion.  Confidence or lack of confidence is a vital element in the welfare of any economy.  It is not something that can be measured.  It is not something to which a wealth tax can be applied nor can it be exempt from wealth tax.  It is a vital element in an economy and never was it more vital than at present.  In my view we ought to be using every possible device open to us to get our economy moving again, to get as many as possible of the 103,000 unemployed back to work, to get growth in our economy again.  We should be using every possible method open to us to get this done.</P>
    <P>Has anybody got the nerve to suggest that the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets will do that? He could not seriously make such a contention.  People fall back on the argument that it will not make much difference.  It will make a difference first because of the climate it creates, but also in practical terms.  No matter how much or how little is collected by the Exchequer in the way of the wealth tax on productive assets, whatever amount is collected will be a charge on productive assets.  It will add to the overheads of business which is providing employment.  It will add to the overheads of business which is not alone providing <Col N="481" /> employment but which is our only hope for getting growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>The recognition of how serious this matter is and how important it is to try to get employment lies in the Government's own measure, belated though it is, in respect of which there is a Bill before this House, to pay an employment premium of £12 per week in respect of each person taken off the unemployment register and put into employment. With the one hand the Government are doing that but with the other they are imposing a wealth tax on the very sector of the economy to whom they are offering £12 a week in respect of each job created.  Does that make sense to anybody?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was here when I commenced to speak.  I referred to the fact that there were repeated statements from the other side of the House to the effect that since wealth tax was not being imposed on trading companies it had no effect as far as productive assets were concerned and that this amendment, which relates only to the <Col N="482" /> individual, obviates wasting time on that ridiculous argument and gets to the root of the matter.  If Deputy Esmonde or any other Deputy on those benches wants to say that it makes sense to tax productive assets in our circumstances, let him say so openly and clearly and defend that concept.  To my knowledge nobody on that side of the House has said so. They are trying to blur the issue.</P>
      <P>The issue is quite clear.  This country is in dire economic straits. The Government's duty is to get the economy moving, to get people back to work.  What they are doing is imposing a wealth tax on productive assets on which jobs and growth depend. If anybody wants to deny the truth of that statement I would like to hear from him.</P>
      <P>The allegation that it does not make any real difference does not stand up because no matter how large or small the revenue from the wealth tax on productive assets it will be a charge on productive assets.  It will be a charge on business, on assets which are employed in the creation of employment, in the creation of growth in our economy.  To the extent that it is adding to the overheads it will restrict the use to which the productive assets can be put with, in some cases, a loss of jobs, in other cases, slower or no growth, and in other cases increases in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because much of business is carried on in the form of trading companies it may be argued that it will not affect prices or employment.  Is it not the truth of the matter that very much of business in this country is conducted by private trading companies? The impact of the wealth tax on private trading companies can be quite serious.  Deputy Esmonde knows what I say is true but some Deputies on the other side&mdash;Deputy Barry Desmond may be one who apparently does not know&mdash;may not know that there are private trading companies operating in this country in which no dividends or direct receipts have been drawn for years since the companies were founded.  All profits have been ploughed back into expanding those companies, with a consequent increase in employment created by those companies <Col N="483" /> and by the use of those productive assets.  In any such case where the shareholders are individually liable to wealth tax, can it be seriously suggested that a man who has invested a considerable amount of his wealth in a trading company, from which he has received no return whatever for a number of years, when asked to pay an annual tax, will not insist on getting that tax at least out of the company?  I would not expect him to do anything else.  If he does&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue here, of course, is that in whatever form it is done, it is going to come out of the company.  The impact in such circumstances will be considerably greater than in the case of the actual amount of wealth tax being paid because income tax will have to be paid on it. What it amounts to is&mdash;if anybody is in doubt about this I will give them the calculations, but I do not want to waste time on that if I do not have to &mdash;that for £1,000 wealth tax each year, there would have to be paid out of the company £2,167.  The net effect of that is that less money will be ploughed back into the business, jobs will be <Col N="484" /> lost, there will be less growth in that business, and therefore, in the economy.</P>
      <P>Such a result could be justified in certain circumstances.  One of the circumstances would be that the state of the economy was such that it could stand this.  That clearly is not so in this case.  Another condition I suggest should be that, as a result of the imposition of this tax in circumstances where the economy could bear it, the result would be to achieve greater equity and a greater redistribution of wealth.  That will not be achieved by this Bill.  That was originally suggested but it is not being pretended any longer because the estimated yield is relatively so small that it can make no difference and contrary to something said earlier by the Minister for Lands, it will not make one penny difference to people paying PAYE.</P>
      <P>The redistribution that will be brought about, not just by this but by the whole package, is redistribution within wealthy families, not amongst the people of this country in general. None of the conditions which would justify a wealth tax apply.  Yet it is proposed to apply a wealth tax to productive assets, not only in the hands of discretionary trusts and private non-trading companies, but even in the hands of individuals, such as individual shareholders in trading companies I have been describing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We would welcome a reasoned contribution from Deputy Esmonde on this, or any other amendment. I hope that if the spirit moves Deputy Esmonde to contribute on this amendment he will deal with the crucial question involved here.  Is it right or wrong to apply a wealth tax in our circumstances to productive assets on which jobs and homes depend? It is a simple question, and that is what is at issue in this amendment. <Col N="485" /> One can confound the issue in various ways, but we come back to that question.  This amendment seeks to ensure that it is not done in the case of productive assets in the hands of individuals.</P>
      <P>We believe it is very important to the future of our economy that this proposition should be accepted, and that could not have been more important at any time in the past than it is today, in 1975, having regard to the state of our economy and the urgent need for any method open to us to get the economy moving again. If the Government persist in imposing a wealth tax on productive assets in these circumstances, it can only be assumed&mdash;and I suggest reasonably assumed&mdash;that they do not care about their major responsibility, which is the management of our economy, and are interested solely in what they think is party political advantage based on the politics of envy.</P>
      <P>Whatever chance of success that might have had, in my view has gone out the window because of the state of our economy, and because everybody now knows what the duty of the Government is.  Not alone the imposition of wealth tax on productive assets at this time, but the amount of time and effort which the Government are spending on this whole measure when it should be concentrating on the management of our economy, is very very revealing, and people are getting the message of where the priorities of this Government lie.</P>

      <P>The message the people of Ireland are receiving is that the Fianna Fáil Party are against wealth tax.  They are also receiving the message that the Fianna Fáil Party are, in 1975, delivering speeches reminiscent of the 19th century, the same kind of speeches as the rearguard of Blue Toryism were delivering in other successful countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, half a century ago when wealth taxes were introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt whether this amendment is in order.  Dáil Éireann have voted in <Col N="486" /> favour of the principle of the wealth tax, on amendments tabled by Deputy Colley on the Committee Stage which are virtually on all fours with this amendment, and Dáil Éireann rejected them because it saw that the purpose of the amendments was to exempt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is completely unacceptable because, having regard to the other exemptions in our wealth tax proposals, which exemptions exempt the principle private residence and its contents and many other assets, there is virtually no property left to tax and Deputy Colley knows that.  If we had the generosity of mind and the wisdom to give a lower rate of tax to productive assets, it probably would not have crossed Fianna Fáil's mind at all or anybody else's mind at all that there was a case for giving a special exemption to productive assets.  As I say, we are the only country in Europe, the only country anywhere that I know of, and I have studied the European situation closely, that gives special treatment to productive assets.  There 20 per cent of the tax liability is removed because of our anxiety to distinguish between assets which people put to productive purposes, which give employment in Ireland, and assets which are not capable of producing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde was quite right when he raised the question of the abolition of death duties.  Death duties applied to all productive assets. <Col N="488" /> The full rigours of death duties applied to all productive assets.  There is many an employment unit here that was destroyed because death duties up to 55 per cent had to be paid and the only way they could be paid was by selling off the productive units.  That will not happen under wealth tax.  The amendment takes no account, as I say, of the exceedingly high thresholds and it clearly is designed for two purposes&mdash;one, to allow the Fianna Fáil Party for the umpteenth time to make the same irrelevant partisan speeches and, if that is not the purpose, then it is to make a laugh of the wealth tax, to prevent this country having a wealth tax, to prevent this country getting some degree of social justice, which is very necessary at any time but particularly at a time of economic strain when, unfortunately, some of the greatest burdens have to be borne by people least able to carry them, by the people of small means, the people whose only means are their labour which they have to sell at a price. People with property and people with wealth can survive economic stresses and strains because they can eat, as it were, into the fat, but these days are more difficult for people who only have incomes and cannot do that, particularly if they become unemployed and if their labour is not in demand.</P>
    <P>This talk about this not being the time is the worst of all arguments. There never was a better time for the introduction of taxation which will help to give social stability and, if this is not acceptable because it comes from members of this Government, the Fianna Fáil Party might during the coming recess spend some time reading the many textbooks on taxation which are available, the many text books on economics which are available, all of which point to the value of having a tax on capital.  We have gone to great trouble to trim the capital taxation measures here to Irish circumstances and to build in incentives that no other countries have.  If wealth is employed for productive purposes, then I think it will be seen that the criticism of the <Col N="489" /> Opposition here is puerile and facile and not related to the circumstances or the requirements of today.  May I ask the proposer of this amendment, what would be left to tax if his amendment were to be carried?  That is a fair question.</P>

      <P>The Minister asked me a question and I am saying that I do not know what proportion would be involved but, suppose 90 per cent were exempted because they were productive assets&mdash;I have no idea what the percentage would be&mdash;there is a message in that for the Minister if he will only think about it.</P>

      <P>If people hold their property in productive assets, they are getting better treatment than if they hold it in non-productive assets.  That will be an incentive to people to put their money in productive assets if they are interested in getting the 20 per cent concession applicable to productive assets.</P>
      <P>I will conclude, as I opened, by asking the Fianna Fáil Party to accept what Dáil Éireann has recorded again and again, namely, its support for the wealth tax.  That principle has long since been debated in this House and the concluding days of the discussion on the wealth tax is not a time to reopen that matter of principle which was decided in this House months ago.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief. I take the view that this approach by the Opposition on this amendment is somewhat of a smokescreen to cover what I would regard as the gross political and economic negligence in the past.</P>
      <P>In the last general election I was deeply concerned to see that death duties would be abolished.  I know well, and I think that anybody who has bothered to study the figures knows well, that the present proposal will exempt 90 per cent of the people who were previously liable to death duties.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  Deputy Colley can have his view and I can have mine.  If the Fianna Fáil Party did not regard estate duty, succession duty and legacy duty as capital taxes of a very swinging nature, then I cannot understand either their political or economic thinking.  They have had disastrous results on the economy. Death duties were multiplied capital taxes and I would describe them in the language in which other people have described them, namely death penalties with which the family was saddled when the breadwinner died.  Very often the breadwinner died at the age of 55 or so with a young and growing family and left that millstone around the family's neck.  If anybody wants to investigate this all they have to do is go and examine Land Registry folios and see the number of ACC owned mortgages and charges that are on the folios of Irish farms which were created principally for the purpose of paying off death duties because people had not got the money to pay the death duties and they had to put their families and their property in pawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to be realistic when we are looking at the matter of wealth tax in this House and not lose sight of these facts and not lose sight of the damages <Col N="491" /> those taxes did and the damages they continue to do to our economy.  Yet when the proposal was put publicly to the leading members of the present Opposition Party before the last polling day, when the question of the abolition of death duties was mooted, the answer was quite clearly&mdash;no we cannot do it and will not do it.</P>

      <P>We have done it. You who previously had to pay 40 per cent are now being asked to pay 1 per cent when your assets are well over the £100,000 and so far as the incidence of wealth tax is concerned it will not affect, on average, people unless they have £150,000 worth of net assets, when you take exemptions and the general picture across the board.</P>

      <P>For the second time today the Minister for Finance has opened up, I think somewhat petulantly, against the Opposition.  Ten minutes ago he said that the message to the people of Ireland is that the Fianna Fáil Party are against wealth tax and that the Opposition are blue Tories of 50 years ago.  He followed that up by saying that the capital tax situation in Belgium is well in excess of here.  I would like the Minister to give us a little bit of information about Belgium, because his own White Paper says that there is no wealth tax in Belgium.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us some details of them, because I gave a detail in relation to Belgium yesterday which to me is very significant. The level of income tax in Belgium percentagewise is quite high, almost as high as here&mdash;it is 70 per cent against the Minister's 77 per cent&mdash; but in Belgium that level is not reached until you have a very high earning capacity, far beyond the vast majority in this country.  In Belgium you do not reach the top level of taxation until your income is over <Col N="492" /> £44,000.  Here you reach it at £12,000. I am not complaining about that.  I expect most of us here in Dáil Éireann have not any complaints to make about that.  We are not that worried about wealth tax.  We are concerned, as Deputy Colley has set out in this amendment, about the effect of this kind of taxation on the economy. We have told the Minister that times without number.  The impression I am getting from the Minister is that he does not think the Opposition should talk at all.  That is the impression the Minister is giving.  The purpose of the amendment is to illustrate the effect that taxation of this kind can have on this economy and on employment.  The idea of applying this type of tax to shares held in Irish industry by Irish people when the same tax does not apply to shares held in Irish industry by foreign companies is simply ridiculous.  I do not know how the Minister can stand over it. Talk about blue Tories of 50 years ago.  The idea of taxing productive assets in a small undeveloped country of this kind is something similar to the penal taxes of a century ago.  It is only five years ago that the balance of emigration changed and the population began to increase for the first time since, I think, 1845.  That is where the effort has been put in over the past 50 years&mdash;to try to reach a situation where we would be relatively self-sufficient and where people would not be driven out of the country to look for jobs.  If the Government must have what the Minister described as social stability or if they have some ideological inclination in this regard, there would be some merit in putting this Bill through and then suspending it until better economic times.  That is what the Australians did.  In fact they withdrew it because of the state of their economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that the levels of wealth tax in the EEC countries are considerably below the level the Minister is putting through here although I grant, as I have said before, that the thresholds here are reasonable.  Nevertheless the information available to me is that the level of wealth tax in Denmark starts at .9 and drops to .18.  In Luxembourg it is <Col N="493" /> a half a per cent.  In Holland it is .8 per cent.  France, Belgium and Italy do not have wealth tax.  Neither do the USA nor Japan.  That is the information available to me and I believe it to be true.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde has been trying to equate death duties with this tax on property and productive assets.  He is trying, to some extent, to mislead, not only us, but himself.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that the estate duty and death duties were not a good thing.  They were applicable right across the board on estates of any kind whether they were productive or not.  In fact, they were an undesirable thing in our economy because it meant that companies, in the event of a death, would be up against a fairly high level of duty and it might cause the winding up of a company.  That is the sort of thing that is undesirable in any economy.  If companies or industries being run by families come up suddenly against a fairly high level of death duty and the money is not there to pay it, and you have perhaps five, six or seven shareholders, minority shareholders tend to step in and say: &ldquo;Why not sell it because you have a high death duty coming in?&rdquo; That was one of the undesirable sides of death duties.  But Deputy Esmonde's argument just does not apply in this area because what is being done here, and I think the Opposition have not totally disapproved of it&mdash;I certainly have not&mdash; is that an Inheritance Tax Bill is still before the House and that Inheritance Tax Bill gives the safety area of a threshold where a parent can transfer at a stage to a descendant at a fairly high level without suffering a high tax.  That gives one the stability that one needs in relation to the continuity of business and the continuity of jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend a long time talking on this subject.  We talked about it before.  I believe that the principle of taxing productive assets which are providing employment and, at the same time, introducing a £12 a week premium in order to try to get people back into jobs are simply contradictory.  Are the Government going in one direction or the other? <Col N="494" /> The Minister for Labour is heading in one direction trying to get people back to work and the Minister for Finance is apparently trying to put people out of work.  The principle of this tax as applied to working productive assets is a bad principle.  It is not responsible and it is bad for our economy and it certainly is disastrous for any prospects of expanding employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with the interpretation.  We have a short time to discuss this Bill here tonight.  I pointed out on the Second Stage the reason why the fact that we have the one hour to discuss the final stages of such an important Bill is a tragedy.  I am disappointed that this Bill was included with eight others in the guillotine motion moved in this House in July.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said to me, and he will say it again, that extra time was offered for it but the position is that extra time would have been taken at the expense of other necessary legislation. This Bill is so important that we could have discussed it for a full day on Committee Stage and gone through each section.  We shall be discussing the other sections later.  That is all I wish to say on section 1.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, after line 28, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4) without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the net additions of employees to whom the Scheme applies, made by an employer to his total insured work force shall be measured by reference to the level of the work force on the 20th day of June, 1975, provided <Col N="496" /> that a date which is later than that date may be specified in respect of certain industries&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is obvious.  It is a difficult Bill on which to move amendments because it is very much a shell within which guidelines have been set down by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The date set by the Minister is 20th June.  The Minister is already aware of industries that closed on 20th June, or just after that date, and perhaps having this enticement available to them would be an attraction to industries to re-employ their workers.  In other words, the company who closed with a work force level of a figure of X hundred on the evening of 20th June, as the guideline stands at present, are debarred from availing of the payment of these premiums subsequently if they re-employ in the month of July or in the month of August.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate that there are probably very good reasons why the Minister fixed 20th June as the date. It was probably to avoid evasion, or to prevent unfair advantage being taken of the scheme by people who would be prepared to become involved in such practices.  I ask the Minister to assure us&mdash;and I think he will&mdash;that he will accept this amendment from us if we give him the opportunity of deciding on the date. He will be able to look at each firm in detail and if its application is genuine, the Minister should decide in its favour.  In this Bill there are many powers given to the Minister.  This is one that should be specifically handed over to him so that he will not have to confine the date to 20th June in case it might debar some firms from re-employing their workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  The amendment was put down for the purpose of making the Bill more flexible.  We are seeking to <Col N="497" /> give the Minister the opportunity to include industries which, as the Bill is now framed, do not appear to be eligible to benefit.</P>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, I have a particular industry in mind of which the Minister is aware.  As the Bill stands, it appears to me that this particular industry will not benefit.  It is an important industry, employing quite a number of workers.  It has gone through a very difficult time and any assistance the Minister might give through the provisions of this Bill would be of considerable benefit.  It is estimated at the moment that only 50 per cent of the workers will be taken back&mdash;approximately 300.  Some of these workers have already been taken back but a considerable number remain to be taken back.  I am convinced that if the provisions of the Bill covered these workers it would be possible to take them back much more quickly than was originally estimated by the firm.</P>
      <P>If the provisions of the Bill were applied to this firm, not only would it be possible to take back workers quicker than originally estimated. Possibly, and hopefully, the boost that would be given to the industry might help, in the longer term, to get back some of those who at the moment have no hope of being taken back.  I wish to impress upon the Minister the need in this case to accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>We have not the knowledge in relation to draftsmanship that is at the disposal of the Minister.  If it should happen that this amendment is not acceptable from a drafting point of view, I am sure the Minister could have it redrafted so that it would do what we hope it will do, make available to those who are ruled out because of a specific date the benefits under the Bill.  The Minister knows the facts in relation to this industry and I would be glad if he would accede to the request from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. I should like to remind the Minister that we welcomed the Bill and we described it as imaginative thinking.  We are keen to ensure that <Col N="498" /> the Bill will do what it sets out to do. This amendment would take the Minister out of the straitjacket he may find himself in, if he is going to stay within the rigid framework in the Bill.  I hope the Minister will meet this in the spirit in which it was put down. It would make it a better Bill and would give certain people who have become unemployed a better hope of being reabsorbed in industry.  If the Minister does not amend this section in some way, he may find that it will be practically unworkable after a while.  The Opposition are trying to show the Minister that the Bill would be better if the amendment was accepted.  The Minister should accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Faulkner said, I am aware of the problem in AET.  Approximately 600 employees were working there up to Friday, 20th June, 1975.  All employees were dismissed at closing time on that date.  There is participation in management by Fóir Teoranta in that company's affairs at present, and as Deputy Faulkner knows, in an effort to restore efficiency to that company, its reopening was based on a reduced work force.  It seems that the reopening of the firm with a reduced work force&mdash;fewer than the 600 who were there at closing time&mdash;would mean that this firm could not benefit at all from the scheme.  Deputies opposite will appreciate that we must have a starting date to any scheme of this kind.  Otherwise the door is open for people to seek a subsidy from the State for an augmented work force which would be taken on in any case. The purpose of the scheme is that we wish to induce industry to bring back into employment workers whom they would not bring back at this time if it were not for the existence of the scheme.  It is not a subsidy without strings attached.  The string attached is that it is an inducement to re-employ labour now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Officials from my Department have met the management of AET to consider this problem, as they have been meeting other managements who are interested in the scheme since it was <Col N="499" /> announced.  In telling Deputies that I do not accept the amendment, I want to assure them that I think it will be possible to meet the case of AET and other firms.  We have not, of the number of cases so far, come across a case which has similar features to the AET case.  It is a cut-and-dried case of State participation by Fóir Teoranta organising its reopening on a reduced work force the following week.  I have taken powers to overcome the problem posed by the AET case.  Under the scheme I will have powers in exceptional circumstances, to determine a base level of employment for a firm other than that based strictly on its 20th June, 1975 level.</P>

Under the determination of application of the scheme in section 3 (1) I have sufficient powers to do what I am suggesting, to determine a base level of employment for a firm other than that based strictly on 20th June work force.  While the date would remain unchanged for starting, I would have powers, in certain conditions, to act on a notional base level, that is, a base level other than the actual work force on 20th June.  That would meet the case of AET.</P>

I am accepting the principle that on the date which causes difficulty, the 20th, that in a firm which is contemplating increasing its work force and which may in fact, in pursuit of such policy, re-employ extra workers on that day of that week&mdash;in such cases where such are proved and where my officials are satisfied that that is the case, I can vary the base-line of the employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Reverting to subsection (1) of section 2 which gives the Minister discretionary powers to amend the scheme, I welcome this but I am critical of the fact that there was such little detail in the Bill.  I fear we will have an anomalous situation.  We on this side of the House would have put down many more amendments but we realised that the time was not available to us to discuss them and that we would be dragging the business out all night.  It is left to the Seanad to go into this Bill in detail.  Naturally, where more time is available, I have no doubt that that House will be putting down amendments which I believe the Minister will accept.  Does that mean then we have to come back here, go over this Bill again, because there is an urgency about it?  I would have preferred that we could have dealt in detail with those amendments here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="502" /> Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Scheme shall be to encourage employers in industries or activities to which the Scheme applies to employ persons.... </P>
    <P>This has been going on since 26th June.  As far as I can see we on this side of the House do not know yet the specific industries included and these excluded.</P>
    <P>I thought this Bill could have been extended to help to create employment in all spheres at present.  If one looks today at a Question to the Minister for Social Welfare and the reply to it, we see a figure of £18,356,000 being paid out in unemployment benefit from the 1st of January to the 30th of June, 1975, and unemployment assistance of approximately £16,779,900 and one realises that these figures are staggering.  It would be an imaginative idea were this Bill extended to embrace all industries, all activities and not confined to manufacturing industries.  But, of course, I accept that there would have to be control.  We could not have a situation in which people exploited its benefits.  Certainly that would not be acceptable.  If it were more embracing, we could then see real value being gained by our Exchequer generally.  We would see a saving in the figures I have just mentioned.  We would see the contribution by way of stamp, and possibly some income tax, out of the £12 being paid by the State towards the premium.  That is why I express disappointment at its narrow nature.  I would appeal to the Minister &mdash;and we will give him power if he wants to amend the scheme&mdash;to broaden its scope in the coming months.  In that way only can I foresee a realistic number of people re-employed under the scheme in the coming months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Again speaking on subsection (2) of section 2, when will the Minister spell out the industries to which it applies?  Is there a date set for that, or will he do it every month or every week?  When will we know what industries the Bill covers? It is very difficult to discuss it adequately here when we do not know. <Col N="503" /> Would the Minister say it would be six months or three months?  Could we have a full list saying this applies to the following industries from A to Z?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We thought the best thing to do was to make it as wide as possible in terms of definition, by describing is as manufacturing industry, by stating that it was not the purpose of the Bill to assist seasonal industry.  As I explained, it is a Bill designed to induce workers into industries which would not take them on at this time but for the fact that this Bill has been brought through this House.  Deputies may say it is a Bill which simply gives me powers to do these things.  It is true that the Bill gives me a great deal of discretion in choice, within the general limits of the industry being manufacturing.  All I can say to Deputies on that is that I will be back here presumably in the autumn looking for extra money, at which time they will be able to judge whether the Bill has been working satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Before we publicise the actual scheme fully and proceed to sell the benefits of this employment programme, we must get this legislation through the House.  With that done next week I hope the officials of my Department and I will be free to approach employers up and down the country in industries in the manufacturing area.</P>

Has he looked at the employment premium schemes in operation in Northern Ireland where, rather than allow the disemployment to take place &mdash;where it is clear in an industry that disemployment is about to take place &mdash;premiums are paid, admittedly not as high as £12?  The Minister should and may need in future to consider the situation rather than allow these workers to become disemployed.  Some action should be taken prior to the break which would be more satisfactory all around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have missed my point.  What I am asking is&mdash;forgetting about the service industries&mdash;within the manufacturing industries, what ones are excluded?  Much of the manufacturing industry can be hit by seasonal trends. They all have their peaks and valleys during the year, admittedly some more <Col N="505" /> than others; certain food industries take on workers in the summer months. May I take it that any permanent employer working throughout the year in any manufacturing industry is covered under this scheme?  Why is there a necessity, in the title of the Bill, for mentioning &ldquo;certain&rdquo; ones?  Could the title not state &ldquo;manufacturing industries&rdquo;, excluding only a few under the scheme?  Could the Minister give the House some indication of what industries are excluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The general point of the scheme is confined to those industries which have suffered most from the present recession.  If funds came from the programme and assistance went to employers in seasonal industries the possibility would exist in that case that the programme would be assisting employers who were taking on extra workers for a seasonal chore, but who would be taking on extra workers anyway.  The programme is directed at the centre of the areas which have suffered most from the recession.  It is directed to induce employers in those industries which have been worst affected, such as the textile and footwear industries.  The Government are suggesting to employers in those industries to re-employ workers who have been laid off.</P>

If any industry, despite the type of business, increase their work-force level over that of 20th June, provided they comply with the other conditions of the scheme, will they qualify for the scheme?  There are no exclusions other than the seasonal intakes? On the question of State aid, what industries are excluded or what is the situation in regard to firms in receipt of State aid or grants?</P>

Although I have power to vary the premiums that could be payable to a firm in receipt of State aid&mdash;an example is the firm referred to which, by any technical assessment of the provisions of the Bill, is totally outside the limits&mdash;the Deputy can rest assured that all cases will be examined very carefully.  The purpose of the Bill is for the Government to <Col N="507" /> ensure that the maximum number of workers are re-employed at this time. There will be no impediment put forward to that purpose by my officials, even in cases where firms may be in receipt of State moneys.  The Government must examine those cases very carefully, and they have the discretion to do so.  There is no sense in which aid or premiums are totally excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham) Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Cunningham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 has been put down but it is ruled out of order because it involves a potential charge on the Revenue.  We are now dealing with section 3.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Ceann Comhairle is not present because I do not agree with his ruling on the extra financial charge.  My reason for putting down this amendment was to eliminate discrimination in the Bill.  Section 3, subsection (2) refers to</P>
      <P>...a determination of a person or class of persons may include a requirement of the specified minimum period of unemployment. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that this amendment which has been ruled out of order does not do what the Chair says it can do.  It is imposing no extra charge on this particular Bill.  Instead of imposing a charge on the Exchequer generally, it will mean a saving of money for the Exchequer.  Therefore, I cannot understand the ruling of the Chair on this amendment.  Section 2 states it may include a requirement of a specified minimum period of unemployment. I understand one of the conditions mentioned on the Second Stage last week by the Minister was that they must be continuously on the live register for not less than the four weeks immediately preceding their <Col N="508" /> first employment under this programme.</P>
    <P>I suspect that somewhere along the line someone said: &ldquo;We will have to stop evasion and for that reason, we will ensure the workers will be on the live register for a specified minimum period.&rdquo;  I believe this discriminates. Whether my amendment is accepted is not important, especially at this stage when we have only an hour to devote to the Bill. The way I look at this is: it will discriminate against the newly unemployed. If a group of people in a town are unemployed, some for a period of six, eight or ten weeks, and others for one or two weeks, or even two days, when a company who can otherwise avail of the employment premium seek workers they will discriminate against the newly unemployed. That is why there is no charge in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The same number of jobs can be created, but a group of unemployed will be denied the opportunity of being considered by the employer. The Minister is aware that the first days and weeks for many people who are now becoming unemployed are the traumatic weeks.  This is the time they begin to feel a disruption of their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy accept that there is need for a qualifying period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not. The Minister's stipulations of reservations and guidelines of the scheme should refer to the employer.  Exploitation by the employer must be eliminated.  I accept the point of two employers combining to try to get around this scheme and fiddle&mdash;if that is the correct word to use in this House&mdash;the Department by dropping and picking up workers.  That will not be the case with the guidelines set down, and with the inspectorate keeping their eye on the situation.  There should not be even a day's unemployment. The Minister will find that there are people of 40, 45, 50 and 55 years of age becoming unemployed now, who never knew the difficulties of unemployment, or the problems of <Col N="509" /> queuing to draw their unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The first day these people are unemployed I know this from experience &mdash;they will scour their towns, cities or counties in search of a job because work means something to them.  They want to work.  They want the independence of work.  It is unfair to say to these people, as employers will say: &ldquo;We will not take you on, because if we take this other gruop we will be able to collect our £12 premium from the Department from now until next March and £6 for three months afterwards&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is necessary to limit this scheme on employees.  I feel very strongly about this.  It is grossly unfair and can only discriminate against them.  The majority of people on the live register do not want to be in receipt of unemployment benefit.  If they have to hang around for four weeks before they can effectively look for work, it will be a social disaster for many of them.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that condition forthwith. I will depend on the Minister's discretionary powers to ensure that there is adequate control of the firms and companies operating it, but take away the condition.</P>
      <P>As I said, this amendment does not impose an extra charge.  I am disappointed that the Ceann Comhairle ruled this out of order.  If he were here and I had time, I would make the same submission to him.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned that people becoming unemployed, <Col N="510" /> who have worked all their lives, want to go on working.  To find that they must stay on the live register for four weeks to qualify under the Bill is a very harsh decision. If the Minister will not accept our amendment he could amend it himself. If the Minister looks at section 3 he will find a great deal of verbiage. Section 3 (1) gives the Minister the power to decide to whom it will apply. In subsection 3 of section 3 the Minister can decide to whom it will not apply.  That whole section needs to be tidied up.  The Minister could embody in it the sentiments expressed in Deputy Fitzgerald's amendment.</P>
      <P>We, on this side of the House, are bending over backwards to make it easy for the Minister to make the Bill a really workable instrument.  We feel very strongly on the four weeks.  The Minister may say there must be time to adjust the records in respect of people becoming unemployed but we feel their cause is so worthy that the Minister should be well able to speed up the machinery of the Department to ensure that these people do not have to spend four days, not alone four weeks, unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing I would bring to the attention of Deputies is that there must be some qualifying period to distinguish the person who is genuinely unemployed from the person simply changing jobs.  If we do not have such a distinction, it would merely be a general subsidy to employers up and down the country.  There would be no guarantee whatever that it would be assisting those whom this legislation is intended to assist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discretion under the scheme to consider hard cases that are brought to my attention where the qualifying period debars a person genuinely unemployed from participation in the scheme.  Again what holds true of the date holds true of the qualifying period.  We must have a recognised qualifying period.  The Deputies opposite, on reflection, will see that a qualifying period is necessary. If no period of unemployment was specified, all would be eligible. Such a provision, namely, that all <Col N="511" /> would be eligible, could prove seriously disrupting to the maintenance of a stable labour force.  It would not assist in the direction that this Bill intends.</P>
    <P>It could be said that acceptance of an amendment on the lines suggested by the Deputy would defeat the whole purpose of the Bill, which is to encourage employers in manufacturing industry to re-employ on a full-time basis those who have lost their jobs as a result of the recession.  It is our hope that by means of this programme we will re-employ something like 10,000 people.  That is our objective.  We wish to ensure that those re-employed are those out of work at present as a result of the recession.  We believe a qualifying period is necessary.  Otherwise we could have the situation where employees transferring from one employment to another, or employers transferring workers from one firm to another, would simply benefit from the scheme intended for a totally different purpose.</P>

To quote the Minister's own words, the main purpose of this scheme is to stimulate employment and create the opportunity of employing or re-employing people in manufacturing industries. There is a full stop there. The Minister can rest assured that he will have every support from this side of the House on this measure but, for goodness sake, at this stage do not tie up in red tape the odd person who may try to do something unfair under the scheme because the vast majority of people will suffer for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the situation at the moment.  On Friday evening company A are laying off 50 workers, male or female and company Y down the road is re-employing workers.  If there are opportunities for some of those people in factory Y and if they are <Col N="512" /> lucky enough to get some of those jobs they would never experience unemployment. But company Y would be in the position of having to say to those workers: &ldquo;No.  We will not take you on because we cannot draw the unemployment premium in respect of you, but we can draw it in respect of 20 men in the next street, in the next road or the next town.&rdquo;  In my opinion, this is a weakness in the Bill. I would appeal to the Minister not to inspect people who want to operate the scheme as schemes have been operated in the past.  This is for a specified minimum period.  This Bill is introduced with a good intention and let us ensure that that good intention is implemented.  Eliminate this from the scheme because ways and means can be found to get around it.  There is no point in saying there must be proof of unemployment.  I do not want the Minister to be involved in cases where there is some argument about just one man.  We have too many at the moment and the Minister knows that as well as I do. Where there are 20 or 50 or 100 people unemployed those people will be stymied by this scheme.  That is the reality of the situation.  This may not militate against opportunities in other industries but in the manufacturing industry people will be prevented from being re-employed for at least four weeks.  Many wage earners and breadwinners in constant employment for many years are facing unemployment. This is a new and traumatic experience for them.</P>

      <P>My answer to that is that he may well have passed up his chance of being re-employed in that four weeks.  I would hope that initially there would be a good reaction to this scheme and consequently there would be a number of people employed but the newly unemployed may suffer.  This is the peak employment period.  This is July. August has always been a holiday month, a bad time for the creation of new jobs or new employment.  I am concerned that there are a number of firms in which more people will be unemployed in September and October. Opportunities will be slipping away in <Col N="514" /> those months.  Difficulties will arise in homes.  This is effectively discriminating unnecessarily against the newly employed. The Minister's objection may possibly be an administrative one.  How can we be sure that they are unemployed and there is not a deliberate attempt by employers to gain benefits under this scheme?  That problem can be solved with an adequate and alert inspection.  We are giving the Minister a free hand in that.  I am genuinely interested in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Having had the opportunity to verify it, the position is this, and I paraphrase it.  It will be a tedious process but I have it on tape here and I can put it on the record if necessary.  I am paraphrasing when I say that, as a result of the transactions affecting the green £, there is a benefit generally to agriculture of, I think, £70 million or so, but the question arose about the food subsidies and in that connection the question arose as to whether £2½ million would, in some way, have to be found in the agricultural sector to meet the contingency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not because, first of all, Deputy Barry Desmond has put me in this position and I am entitled to reply to him.  Secondly, we are asking the Minister for Finance in this amendment to exempt agricultural property.  The Minister said there was no change in the situation. I have no intention of repeating what I said on another section.  I certainly am entitled to adduce new evidence, evidence today that should make the Minister re-consider this point.  The evidence is that food subsidies may be adversely affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was put to Deputy Clinton, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, today as to whether the £2.5 million would be raised in the agricultural sector and, though he did not directly answer, he said that <Col N="518" /> sector would have to bear the burden. If the Minister wants the whole lot, I can give it to him.  I am trying to be absolutely and conservatively fair to the Minister when I say he said no decisions were made yet but it was only fair to assume that the sectors involved would have to contribute and that the farmers were the first section to feel the effect&mdash;I am coming very near quotation here&mdash;of the Government's determination to hold the CPI.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that we do not want a debate on that.  This is a fact.  Many people heard that on the news tonight and on the 1.30 news today on the radio as I did&mdash;I did not hear the 6.30 news as I was in the House here&mdash;and they can judge whether I am telling the story right. These answers were given by the Minister to the interviewer who mentioned the one figure I have mentioned.  He said no decisions were made and went on to say that every section would have to bear it.  The implications were plain.  The president of the IFA said the farming community could not do it, that they had three bad years.  On the news bulletin I heard Deputy Clinton corrected them by saying the farmers had one bad year, not three.</P>
    <P>In all sobriety here is a new situation. There is another burden being imposed on the agricultural community. It is not too late yet, even if the Minister's arguments on Committee Stage were valid, even if Deputy Colley and myself who adumbrated what is said in this amendment are correct, even if this amendment is a repeat.  The Minister went as near as he could with propriety to question whether this amendment was in order.  The facts today in the current news justify putting down that part of the amendment which asks for the exemption of agricultural property.</P>
    <P>I give the Minister credit for the many exemptions he has granted in this and other Bills.  I expressed my sympathy with him before when he ruefully said: &ldquo;I give so much and then I am pressed the whole way; perhaps, it would be better if I stood still and did nothing.&rdquo;  I can understand the Minister's reaction.  But in regard <Col N="519" /> to agriculture, as disclosed by the State broadcasting agency, Radio Telefís Éireann, there is justification and substantial cause for advocacy in regard to the first part of Deputy Colley's amendment.</P>
    <P>The second point is in regard to employment in the State.  In the fertiliser industry we have a colossal unemployment problem.  Do not let us get lost in apportioning blame for this.  Let us take this as the unhappy fact.  People who are employed are having to support the unemployed who would rather be working than to be so supported.  Surely anything that is conductive to the provision of employment&mdash;Deputy Colley is only talking about property directly used in the provision of employment&mdash;remains as valid as when we made it on other Stages of this Bill and after hearing the news in another context I need not expand on that.</P>
    <P>Next we come to the stocks and shares of a trading company trading in the State.  I dealt with that already and my arguments are still valid.  On that occasion I was willing, as a last resort, to think of the first two as being more directly involved.  Deputy Colley pointed out later that I was probably mistaken in trying to go the road as far as I did with the Minister on the question of stocks and shares.</P>
    <P>In supporting Deputy Colley's amendment let us get down to the point.  Agriculture and employment today are deteriorating.  There is more need for this amendment today than there was when we moved it on Committee Stage.  It is in that sense I urge it on the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am tempted to get after some of Deputy Esmonde's red herrings but that is a little far fetched when dealing with this amendment.  Nobody has denied what took place in regard to death duties.  The Minister's talk about social justice is a little beside the point of this amendment.  Social justice and equality is all very well but what will this Bill do for the agricultural sector if the exemption is only partial?  What does it do for employment when there is only provision for partial relief for productive assets?  The Minister talked <Col N="520" /> about the reliefs he introduced for productive assets but the situation is so critical that it demands a total one.  I will be content with saying that because one can lose the wood for the trees in an amendment of this nature.  Where agriculture and employment are concerned today's news would justify the bringing in of this amendment as an extraordinary and emergency measure in its own right.  That is enough to make an amendment of this nature a compulsion rather than a desirability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I should like to speak in support of this amendment.  On amendment No. 4 we gave the Minister an opportunity he may not get again when we asked him to defer the implementation of this Bill for 12 months, or to make the date effective from 1976.  This is an inopportune time to present a Bill of this nature to the House.  Looking around we can see the chaotic state of industry and agriculture. The position of these is reflected in the employment exchanges today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not believe my ears when I heard the Minister saying there was no better time to introduce a wealth tax than at this stage.  How could any Minister in his sane senses make a statement like that in view of the present state of the economy?  Ask any businessman or any farmer what is the state of his business today.  This is reflected throughout our standard of living.  One has only to look at our fertiliser factories today.  Is it an opportune time to introduce a wealth tax with our factories closing down?  I believe it is not.  Evidently the Minister is so concerned about introducing this type of philosophy into this House, having made commitments to his colleagues in the Labour Party, with which many of his party disagree that he is now faced with the option of getting out of Government or getting through this penal taxation.  This is why the Minister is caught with this type of taxation.  It is obvious he has complete disregard for our present economic situation.  He is more concerned with remaining in Government because, whether he likes it or not, if this Bill does not go through, his Ministers <Col N="521" /> in the Labour Party will not support him.  There are many members of the Fine Gael party who are completely against this Bill because they know the detrimental effect it is having on our economy.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking here to protect the wealthy.  Rather I am speaking about protection of our economy and promotion of economic expansion to ensure sufficient expansion in agriculture and industry where our workers can be employed and maintain a meaningful and high standard of living. Evidently, the Minister's views of a proper standard of living for our people is different from mine.  My view is that one should encourage the utilisation of wealth to ensure it is used in productive assets.  That is the object of Deputy Colley's amendment to exempt productive assets.</P>
    <P>What I mean by productive assets are factories and farms giving useful employment.  Can anyone criticise us on this side of the House for trying to exempt industries finding it very difficult today to keep their heads above water?  We see them closing down week by week.  What is the Minister doing to help them?  In my opinion he is doing something very negative.  He is introducing a wealth tax which has completely undermined the confidence of the entire country. Ask any section of our community today&mdash;I had the experience within the past fortnight not alone of speaking to business people but to farmers throughout the south&mdash;and they will give one the very same reply, that confidence generally is completely undermined.  That is the achievement of a Coalition Government two and a half years in office.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I am confining myself to employment in productive assets which can apply to several types of industries.  It can apply to farming, manufacturing, brewing, the hotel industry. What we are trying to do in our party is to instil some measure of confidence in our people again.</P>
      <P>There are other countries in Europe much more advanced, with much more wealth, traditionally, throughout the years.  Take, for example, France, Italy and Belgium. They were not foolish enough to introduce a wealth tax within the past few years.  Take the United Kingdom: they have economic problems at present and they are our nearest neighbours.  They issued a White Paper on the subject but did not go further.  I did not hear Mr. Wilson, or any of his Government Ministers, say the introduction of a wealth tax would be a cure for their economic problems.  The reason is that they have more commonsense.  They know perfectly well that the introduction of a tax at this time, when all types of business are trying to get off their knees, would not constitute a solution to the problem.  We know there is a recession in Europe; there is worldwide recession but we should be taking positive steps to rectify it.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that the steps they take will help to bring down inflation, generate more employment and reduce the cost of living generally.  Had the Minister come into this House over the past six months and introduced positive economic policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): We have been telling the Minister for the past six months what he should have been doing but he did not listen to us.  Can anyone tell me how one can even float a loan, whether on an international basis, or with Irish banks, seeing the state of our economy at present?  Let us go to the World Bank or any European countries that are prepared to lend money at this particular time.  Does the Minister adopt a very good formula in going to any of these international institutions?</P>
      <P>I have had occasion in the past to borrow from banks.  The questions they pose are very relevant.  The principles are the same.  They want to see one's balance sheet, how one is doing, what are one's abilities to repay.  The Minister may say that they have been in Government for two and a half years only.  Since they took office there are an additional 42,000 people unemployed.  Inflation has risen from approximately 8 per cent to 25 per cent.  The cost of living has risen likewise.  Factories have closed down.  That is what he may say as regards an international loan.  Any financier would be entitled to ask: What are you doing to remedy that situation?  Are you taking corrective measures?  That would be a fair question for any international financier to ask the Minister for Finance of a foreign country and he would say: &ldquo;Yes I am taking certain measures.  We are introducing a capital taxation package.&rdquo; Those are the measures he considers should be taken to try to curb inflation and boost the economy.  No man in his sane senses would accept from a Minister of State that that action would cure economic ills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our amendment we ask the Minister to exempt productive assets held in the hands of individuals.  That would be a small measure to try to restore a sadly lacking confidence in this country.  There is no point in the Minister, or the Government, trying to put up a facade as regards the <Col N="524" /> present state of our economy.  In my opinion nobody in this House remembers during his lifetime our economy having been in such a state.</P>
    <P>Our first priority is to maintain the standard of living and to keep people in employment.  It should be the priority of any Government.  We will be responsible and will co-operate with the Government if they come forward with reasonable proposals.  However, no one on this side of the House could possibly support a measure such as this which will do exactly the opposite to what we want to do at this time.  We want to encourage Irish people who are holding assets at this time, either at home or abroad, to put those assets back into productive industry and business here.</P>
    <P>I believe measures at this time are necessary to try to repatriate some of this money which is probably invested in foreign securities.  If there was a positive move from the Minister for Finance to try and encourage some of this back, of course the Government would get support from this side of the House.  But it is very difficult to support the Minister in a Bill that is deliberately penalising Irish investors and giving preference to foreigners holding assets here.  The Minister in this Bill, whether we like or not, is taxing the native Irishman in his assets and he is exempting the foreigners.  That is the encouragement that we are getting from the Minister for Finance as regards helping Irish investors.  I have said several times in this House that I for one object to being taxed when a foreigner is not taxed.  I am sure this objection is shared by others.</P>
    <P>That is the situation as we find it in this Bill, whether we like it or not, let it be in industry, hotels, private business or land.  A foreigner with a foreign company owning shares in a company in this country is exempt from wealth tax.  That is not the case with the Irish investor.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider how we are going to get the economy back on the rails.  The most difficult thing to do at this time is to restore confidence. Once a person loses confidence it is <Col N="525" /> very hard to restore it.  Everyone gets a set-back in business at times but if he can see that there is some future he will respond, knowing that with a little additional effort he can restore the business back to its proper trading position again.  But when you undermine confidence, when there is no light at the end of the tunnel, it is very hard to restore confidence.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this seriously.  If he does not, it is quite obvious that the unemployment which we have today will be far greater by next January.  This is going to increase production costs.  It is going to make exports more difficult and certainly it is going to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I am talking about productive assets to which Deputy Colley's amendment refers.  I have already told the Minister what the consequences will be if he continues to tax productive assets.  There will certainly be no hope of expanding our economic base, if this section in the Bill remains.  The same will apply to all types of industries.</P>
      <P>As a small gesture at this time, the Minister should now accept Deputy Colley's amendment and exempt productive assets from the wealth tax.  I think by so doing he will at least be restoring some confidence.  He will be encouraging Irish citizens who have foreign investments abroad to invest here.  That is the philosophy on this side of the House that we believe can help the economy at this time.  We do not believe in this negative approach because it will not work.</P>
      <P>When one is operating from a weak basis, as we are operating now, where industry is concerned, it is encouragement that is essential.  In this section the Minister is penalising the productive assets that are operating on a very narrow margin at the moment.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It is in the Bill.  I do not <Col N="526" /> want to delay the House any longer on this amendment.  There are many more amendments which are equally as important.  I know it is practically impossible to make anything of a hopeless Bill such as this.  There is not one good section in it.  We have been here for the past few months trying to give it some semblance of respectability. If this amendment of Deputy Colley's is accepted it will be a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I would not have spoken at all had I not heard of what Deputy Desmond said and Deputy de Valera's reply.  This was in connection with the agricultural sector.  If there was no reason for Deputy Colley's amendment as far as agriculture is concerned up to today, I think a case was made by the announcement by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries today that there will be direct taxation on the agricultural sector, owing to the fact that subsidies have to be increased because of the 5 per cent devaluation of the green £. It is in the interests of the economy and the country to do this but the fact is that somebody has said the farmer is going to benefit directly by it.  As far as the agricultural sector is concerned that is further taxation being put on them.  The headlines of <i>The Irish Independent</i> today state: &ldquo;The farmer foots the bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has no intention of interfering with the Deputy in regard to his speaking but the Chair is trying to keep the debate to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment refers to the agricultural sector.  Am I right in that?  Everybody else has dealt with industry.  I just want to clarify that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has not yet said what the agricultural sector will pay. Definitely the agricultural sector have to pay over £2 million and this is an extra taxation on the agricultural sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the amendment is stronger today than it was at any time during the passage of this Bill.  The irony is that it is supposed to benefit the farmers but many of the benefits <Col N="527" /> of intervention have not come back to the farmers.  The president of the IFA has said this, and I agree with him.  We do not agree on many things but I certainly agree with him on this.  We have no assurance whatsoever that this is going to come back directly to the farmer but if the farmer's direct grants are affected he must be considered.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the amendment as far as the agricultural sector is concerned is more relevant today.  I would ask the Minister to give serious consideration to it.  What Deputy de Valera said was right.  If Deputy Desmond said the farmer will not have to pay, he has only to take up <i>The Irish Independent</i> today or have regard to what I understand the Minister said on the 1.30 News to see that the agricultural sector will have to pay&mdash;that will be another burden on the agricultural sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of points I want to say in reply on this amendment.  Firstly, the Minister said that Dáil Éireann had accepted the principle of a wealth tax and that there was no point in our going back on that.  I want to make it quite clear, lest there be any doubt about it, that Dáil Éireann did not approve the principle of a wealth tax a majority of Deputies in Dáil Éireann did.</P>

    <Col N="528" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it as clear as I possibly can that this party do not accept the principle of a wealth tax in our circumstances and regard it as totally reprehensible and against the interests of our economy, lest there be any doubt about that.  If a majority of Deputies in this House led by the Minister for Finance, and subject to the Whips of their party, voted for that principle, then on their heads be it.  But I do not want Deputies on this side of the House who are totally opposed in principle, in our circumstances, to a wealth tax to be saddled directly or indirectly with the consequences of what the Deputies on the other side of the House are doing.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Minister asked me what items would be left to be subject to a wealth tax if productive assets were exempt.  I told him that I did not know what proportions were involved and he said he was not interested in percentages, but in items.  The clear message that came across was that as far as he is concerned there has to be a wealth tax, no matter what the consequences for the economy.  If we exempt productive assets, as this amendment seems to do, the clear implication of what the Minister said was there would be very little left to put a wealth tax on.  If that is so, and I suspect it might be so, the case for this amendment is all the stronger, because it means that the Minister is proposing to apply a wealth tax which will affect, in the main, indeed perhaps almost exclusively, productive assets.  If that is so it gets us back, despite all the red herrings we have been having from the other side of the House, to the question I posed when I proposed this amendment and that is, is it right or is it wrong to impose a wealth tax on productive assets in our circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one thinks it is wrong, one should vote for this amendment.  If one thinks it is right, one should oppose it.  It is as simple as that.  No amount of red herrings or clouding the issue can alter the real issue.  On this side of the House, we have no doubt whatever that in our general circumstances it would be wrong to impose a wealth tax on productive <Col N="529" /> assets, but in our particular circumstances today, in 1975, to impose a wealth tax on productive assets is crazy.  The craziness of that proposition is highlighted by the fact that while the Minister for Finance is imposing that wealth tax on productive assets with the one hand, he is with the other offering £12 a week to employers who employ people off the unemployment register.  If anybody can reconcile those two things, he is a better man than I.  I notice the Minister did not attempt to do it, nor did anybody on the other benches, because it is impossible.</P>
    <P>This Government are galloping off in all directions.  Gradually the centre is being pulled apart and the economy is sinking further and further.  Instead of having some regard to the problems with which we are faced and, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, trying to encourage the use of productive assets in any way we possibly can&mdash; which is the only hope for a growth in our economy and if we are to create jobs&mdash;the Minister is imposing a wealth tax on productive assets.</P>
    <P>As far as this side of the House is concerned, that makes absolutely no sense, and I am being somewhat reserved in my choice of words when I say that.  It makes absolutely no economic sense.  We have consistently sought to draw to the attention of Deputies on the other side of the House the dangers of a wealth tax on <Col N="530" /> productive assets in our circumstances. We have made a further effort in this amendment.  So far we have not been successful.</P>
    <P>As I started out when I was replying to this I want to finish and make it quite clear that if the Deputies opposite, under the Whips of their respective parties, troop into the lobby to support the imposition of a wealth tax on productive assets, then they are responsible, and nobody on this side of the House is responsible for the consequences, what it is going to do to jobs, the loss of jobs and a further downturn in our economy.  We have had occasion in this House over the last two and a half years to point out to the Government what they were doing wrongly.  Recently they had to admit that we were right.  We are telling them again now that they are wrong to do what they are proposing to do in this Bill.  Undoubtedly, in due course, some Government, possibly this Government, recognising the mistake, as they have recognised their previous mistakes, will accept what is in this amendment.  But if they do not do it now they will have done an enormous amount of damage in the meantime. The consequences for that damage lie on the heads of Deputies who support the Minister in his effort to apply wealth tax to productive assets in our circumstances today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's eyesight is better than mine.  Domicile is largely a matter one's permanent abode somewhere, and to end one's days there.  Therefore, if any person claimed that he intended to abandon his Irish domicile and to take up another, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Revenue to rebut the claim, although it might be quite clear that he was merely leaving the country for a couple of years to take up an appointment elsewhere, for instance, or to pursue a course of study or for an extended holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Absence, however long from a country does not necessarily involve a change of domicile, although it may itself be one of the factors which go to make up a change of domicile.  It is clear that the Revenue Commissioners would find it very difficult to rebut fictitious claims of a change of domicile since intent is one of the vital <Col N="534" /> elements that go to prove the change. In effect, the purpose of the paragraph was to state that a person shall be deemed to retain Irish domicile for three years subsequently to making such a statement of intent.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate on the paragraph, it was argued that the paragraph went somewhat further than the original intention, since it deemed &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; also.  The Minister for Lands felt that there was merit in that argument and he promised to look into the matter further.  Since then we have re-considered the matter and these amendments are the result.  The paragraph will no longer impute &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.  It will deem domicile only.  Accordingly, such a person shall be deemed to be domiciled here, not domiciled and ordinarily resident, as originally drafted.</P>
    <P>The effect of these changes may be summed up as follows: (1) such an individual shall be deemed to be domiciled here for the next three years; (2) there is no imputation of ordinarily resident which will, therefore, be a question of fact in each case; and (3) a person will be subject to wealth tax on global wealth only if being deemed to be domiciled, he is also ordinarily resident here. Deemed domiciled, which this paragraph imputes will not, therefore, of itself, catch the case of a genuine change of domicile because, in addition to &ldquo;deemed domicile&rdquo; a person must also be &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; here.  That would be most unlikely in the case of a genuine change of domicile. Certainly no question of being ordinarily resident for three years after a genuine change of domicile should ever arise.</P>

      <P>The thing that strikes me about this is that the phrase, &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; is defined in paragraph (a) (1).  The effect is that whatever the meaning of the word domiciled&mdash;the Minister is right, when he says that domicile includes a number of things including the <i>animus manendi,</i> the intent&mdash;and whatever the meaning within the ambits of this Bill of the words, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, paragraph (a) defines the phrase, &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;, in a particular way.  Presumably that definition is sufficient and complete for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being granted, we come to the paragraph in respect of which the Minister is bringing in his amendment. The first line of that paragraph refers to an individual who was domiciled and ordinarily resident.  The words, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; are left in that line although they are deleted twice later in the section and in the first case substituted by the word, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;.  In that situation it appears that an individual who is domiciled and ordinarily resident within the definition of paragraph (a) on the valuation date shall, notwithstanding that he ceased to be domiciled be deemed to be domiciled, as the Minister put it.  Is the word, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, not part of the phrase, &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;? Is the word &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, in the second case, to be interpreted in another way in the more general sense?  In the first case the intention, the <i>animus manendi,</i> is excluded in <Col N="536" /> the definition of the phrase, &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo;, in paragraph (a).  That is based on a matter of ascertainable fact.  If one excludes the words, &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, and substitute them with the word, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo;, is one not now bringing in a word which imports the <i>animus manendi</i>?  If it does, is there any consequence?  Perhaps the Minister will answer that as far as he is concerned it is immaterial but it is no harm to look at what we are doing with words in a case like this.</P>
    <P>In lines 21 and 23 in substituting the word, &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; for &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; the Minister is then using the word &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; in one sense, whereas &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; has another sense.  Perhaps that is purely technical.  It does not matter for the purposes of this section under what circumstances the person is absent.  Even if they changed their domicile the difference between &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; and &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; from that point of view does not seem to make a lot of difference. Deputy Colley is satisfied with the explanation the Minister gave.  That being so, I do not wish to raise any difficulties but it is no harm to note that when one defines a phrase incorporating a word that has a different and well established meaning.  I have Halsburg here if we wish to have an interesting legal evening which I am sure nobody wants.  &ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; is a word about which much can be said and confusion created.  Where we have a word like that incorporated in a phrase, or even by itself, and specifically designed for a purpose of a statute as is done in paragraph (a) then that meaning will prevail.  The trouble is that in this case it is the phrase &ldquo;domiciled and ordinarily resident&rdquo; which is defined.  That is used in line 19 and I understand the reason for it but the consequence is that in separating the words, &ldquo;and ordinarily resident&rdquo; from the word &ldquo;domiciled&rdquo; we restore domiciled to its ordinary meaning.  The point may be of no practical importance for the purposes of this Bill.  Deputy Colley is satisfied and I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to intervene to say that, as Deputy de Valera indicated, <Col N="537" /> the only question I had in mind in regard to these amendments was answered by what the Minister said in explanation.  In view of what Deputy de Valera has said he has raised a slight doubt in my mind.  I want to suggest to the Minister what I think is the position, or what it will be if these amendments are accepted, and perhaps, the Minister, when replying, could indicate whether I am interpreting the position correctly.  Firstly, an individual must be or be deemed to be both domiciled and ordinarily resident to come within the terms of the Bill, broadly speaking.  Secondly, paragraph (a) (1) deals with an individual who is not domiciled in the State on a valuation date.  Paragraph 2 deals with a person who was domiciled in the State on a valuation date.  That is the distinction between the two.</P>
      <P>The first one is clear enough.  The second one, if the amendments are accepted will, have the effect simply of deeming a person to be domiciled, not ordinarily resident, in the State if the conditions set out in the paragraph are fulfilled.  If the person is so deemed to be domiciled in the State, then if it can be established as a matter of fact that he was ordinarily resident as well as domiciled, the appropriate section will apply.  If it can be established that he was not ordinarily resident then it will not aply.  That is my understanding of the position.  I would be glad if the Minister would say whether it is correct.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult area because some of the terms are not precisely defined, even if they are clearly understood by lawyers.  &ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; has not been defined for the purpose of death duties, although it was a very basic ingredient in the determination of liability to death duties.  It is a concept of general law.  We all take at birth the domicile of our fathers which, incidentally, might not be the country in which one was born.  &ldquo;Domicile&rdquo; is something which is distinct from either residence or nationality.  It involves intent as to where one proposes to dwell, not merely as a runner-in, if I may use the words generally understood in the Irish context, but rather to dwell with the intention of living permanently there.</P>
      <P>The amendment helps to clarify the issues very clearly for wealth tax purposes and does it in such a way as, in all probability, will relate to and properly reflect the intention of persons.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, lines 39 and 40, to delete &ldquo;and limited interest shall be construed accordingly&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;and, for the purposes of <Col N="539" /> subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, property to which a person is beneficially entitled in possession but to which he is not absolutely entitled shall be deemed to produce income and the income shall be deemed to be payable to him or applicable for his benefit and &lsquo;limited interest&rsquo; shall be construed accordingly&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>In the course of the Committee Stage debate on paragraph (b) the question arose whether the paragraph as drafted covered the case where property yielded no income.  In other words, could an individual be said to have a limited interest in property that yielded no income?  The intention of the paragraph as drafted was that a limited interest could exist, whether or not there was an income. That was the reason that the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; were inserted in line 25.  It appears, however, that the insertion of the words &ldquo;if any&rdquo; could be said to have precisely the opposite effect, namely, that the paragraph does not apply unless there is income.  In order to rectify the position, I propose this amendment which I trust will be acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that at present I do not recollect the discussion on Committee Stage on this paragraph to which the Minister referred. I take it from the wording of the amendment, and from what the Minister has said, that the intention is that property shall be artificially deemed to produce an income, even though it is not producing an income and that in addition, that artificial income shall be deemed to be payable to the person who is beneficially entitled, in possession, but not absolutely entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is produced in this amendment seems, on the face of it, to be an artificial creation in its entirety. It is not quite clear why it is necessary to go so far in deeming a situation to exist which does not exist. Perhaps, when replying, the Minister would briefly recapitulate why he considers it necessary to have a situation in which a person who has property <Col N="540" />&mdash;to which he is beneficially entitled, in possession, not absolutely entitled but is getting no income from it&mdash;has to be deemed to be deriving an income therefrom so as to construe him as having a limited interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just make two short points?  First, this &ldquo;i&rdquo; in italics has occurred again, instead of the Roman (I), in the amendment. This is another printing error.  The printed sheet of amendments shows <i>subparagraph (i)</i> instead of subparagraph (I).</P>
      <P>Supplementing Deputy Colley's question, is the Minister simply capitalising a certain income, in a certain case, because he feels the capitalisation involved in the definition of &ldquo;limited interest&rdquo; is not sufficient?  Is that what the Minister is doing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am getting at: &ldquo;shall be deemed to produce income&rdquo;.  Is the Minister capitalising notional income?  If that is what is involved, is there any limit to the abstractions and notions we are going to import?  Like Deputy Colley, I should like to hear what the Minister has to say because I do not understand the matter either.</P>

There are a number of practices which might be worthwhile looking at, including the practice of not numbering lines in Schedules which I found quite confusing since we had to consider Schedules in such detail.  Perhaps we can take it up elsewhere.</P>
      <P>A limited interest can exist in a property irrespective of whether it is producing an income.  One can have a life interest in painting, jewellery, works of art, precious objects and so on and one does not have to have an income nor is the section deeming that an income has to exist in order to give rise to wealth tax liability. Wealth tax liability arises out of possession of the limited interest irrespective of whether the property may or may not give income to a person holding that interest.  That is what the section is saying.  It is saying it with greater clarity as a result of the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 50 to 57 and in page 6, to delete lines 1 to 5 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) For the purposes of this Act, the property to which an individual is beneficially entitled in possession on a valuation date shall be deemed to include all the property to which the minor children, if any, of the individual is or are beneficially entitled in possession on the valuation date:</P>
      <P>Provided that, where both parents of such minor children are living, all the property to which such minor children is or are beneficially entitled in possession shall be deemed to be included in the property to which the male parent is beneficially entitled in possession unless, prior to the valuation date, the Commissioners are notified to the contrary, in writing signed by both parents of such minor children.&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>This is the second of three amendments I have put down in order to try to provide in the Bill a framework in which wealth tax can be applied to each individual, that whether that individual be a married woman, a single woman, a separated married woman or a man in any of those categories it would apply equally to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, in regard to individuals who are subject to wealth tax the Bill deals with them in three different categories. First, there is the husband living with his wife and her property is deemed to be his property and he is accountable for the tax.  Secondly, a widow or widower and, thirdly, a <Col N="543" /> minor child.  I am endeavouring with this amendment, taken in conjunction with the other two, one of which we have dealt with, to have the categories concerned consist of a widow or widower, a minor child and any other individual.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to provide that where it is necessary to aggregate property as in the case of the minor children it will be done in the way set out in the amendment.  The Bill provides that the wife's property is aggregated with that of her husband. In my view, it is extremely downgrading to the role of a married woman. There is a problem, admittedly, in the case of minor children because one has to aggregate their property with one or other of the parents.  If you are taking them separately you have to decide with which one should it be aggregated.  For that reason I suggested in the proviso to the amendment that:</P>
    <P>where both parents of such minor children are living, all the property to which such minor children is or are beneficially entitled in possession shall be deemed to be included in the property to which the male parent is beneficially entitled in possession unless, prior to the valuation date, the Commissioners are notified to the contrary, in writing signed by both parents of such minor children. </P>
    <P>An agreement such as that, I suggest, gets over the only real administrative difficulty that arises.  If one accepts that, then one can go ahead and deal with the individuals, whether it is a husband or wife living together or husband and wife who are separated or single people, each as an individual having the same rights and benefits under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment which appears later in regard to the thresholds is tied up with this whole proposal.  Basically what I am trying to do is to take out of the Bill this approach which is very much outdated&mdash;I would suggest in 1975 it could almost be described as pernicious&mdash;under which the married woman is effectively being treated as a chattel of her husband.  You get the <Col N="544" /> situation in which if the married woman living with her husband has a good deal of property and the husband has little or none, nevertheless he is the one who is accountable and, therefore, he has to know all about it.  He has to know all the ins and outs of it in order to make a return to the Revenue Commissioners.  He is the one who is legally held to be liable for the tax.  She does not figure in the arrangement at all.  She does not exist in the eyes of the Revenue Commissioners except for the purpose of aggregating her property with that of her husband.</P>
    <P>There is a further strange anomaly. If the married woman is living with her husband, between them they are allowed an exemption in respect of their principal residence and contents and a threshold of £100,000.  If they are separated they are allowed two dwellinghouses and thresholds each of £70,000, making a total of £140,000. All these anomalies I suggest are rising because of this very peculiar and outdated approach embodied in the Bill which effectively disregards the existence of the married woman except, for the purpose of aggregating her property.</P>
    <P>I suggest that this amendment, in conjunction with the other two to which I have referred, show that it is possible to deal with the whole problem in this Bill without doing that, that administration does not make that necessary, that the framework of the Bill in this regard can be altered so that individuals can be dealt with in their own rights, whether they are married women living with their husbands or not.  If this can be done&mdash; and I suggest that these amendments taken together show it can be done&mdash; the question that arises is, should it be done?  I have no doubt but that it should be done.  I do not think the Minister should have any doubt that it should be.  I suggest it is intolerable in 1975 for a married woman to be treated as she is in this Bill, merely as a chattel of her husband.  It is not necessary from a legal or administrative point of view, so the only question is whether it is desirable or not.  On that score I have no doubt at all it is quite undesirable to treat the matter in the way the Bill does.  I hope, even at <Col N="545" /> this late stage, that the Minister will acknowledge that this is the wrong way to approach this problem.  It is degrading for married women living with their husbands.  The matter should be approached in a manner more consonant with what is the more generally accepted view today, not only of the role but of the rights of a married woman, as an individual.  That is the important thing to understand. The married woman is entitled, as an individual in her own right, to be treated the same as other individuals. She is not being so treated in the Bill. This amendment is suggesting a way in which she can be treated as an individual in her own right.</P>

In Ireland the threshold for a husband and wife is £100,000; in Denmark, £31,500; in Sweden, £19,000; in Germany, £23,000; in the Netherlands, £9,300; in Norway, £7,700; in Finland, <Col N="546" /> £3,600, and in Luxembourg, £1,100.

It simply says that where property exists within the marriage it should be aggregated.  There is many a man who went into a rich woman's house and hung up his hat.  You would think that it was always the other way around.  But of course that is not the truth either and Deputies know it.  I think it is time we got off the &ldquo;women's lib&rdquo; bandwagon.  Some of you do not look very attractive passengers.  That is no disrespect to you, but out of my regard for the women folk for whom I am not supposed to have any affection or interest.</P>

      <P>First, let me compliment the Minister on his good humour.  It is refreshing when we can approach even a serious matter like this in a good humoured way.  I was guilty of making some cynical and facetious remarks as the Minister went along on his thesis about the healthy marriage.  In effect the Minister is penalising the healthy marriage and providing benefit for the pathological marriage, as I hope to show in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all seriousness, what Deputy Colley is saying here, and what we as an Opposition are trying to draw attention to, is that there is an anomaly here which can be avoided.  Admittedly it may have a threshold effect in one section.  I want to dispose of two things the Minister said in his good humoured concluding remarks.  We recognise the generosity of the thresholds. <Col N="547" /> Let there be no mistake about this.  He recognises the comparison with other countries, but this is not the point.  We are disagreeing with the whole code of taxation and this Bill in particular on a certain principle I need not go over.  On this specific question, we feel that even though it possibly involves some increase in the joint thresholds for a married couple, if you care to look at it from the Minister's point of view, the advantages otherwise are outweighed. Remember, the revenue to the Minister is not all that much.  All that is involved is 1 per cent of £40,000&mdash;£400 in the year, if I have done my sums wrong when I am very apt to do my sums wrong when I am on my feet here.  The point is that, as on the first amendment, and I will not delay the House with repetition, if the proprietary rights in the property are separate, why should the taxation not be separate?</P>
    <P>Everything that was said on Deputy Colley's amendment No. 3 is germane to this amendment.  Following on that premise that those arguments apply there are two parts to this amendment. The first part of the amendment implies&mdash;it is a very important implication&mdash;that paragraph (a) of subsection (1) is deleted.  In fact, it is deleted. That means then that the wife is to be treated as <i>sui juris</i> and separate from her husband for the purposes of property ownership and property taxation. She is already in many ways so treated from the point of view of property ownership.  If there is not sharing there is the benefit.</P>
    <P>The peculiar consequence of the Minister's position is that, if you have a healthy marriage the threshold is cut by £40,000, plus the house, but if you have a pathological marriage, that is a marriage that has broken down and husband and wife are separated under an order of the Court of <i>competent</i> jurisdiction, or by deed of separation, or separated in circumstances where the separation is likely to be permanent, they have the benefit.  The pathological marriage gets the benefit and the healthy one the Minister was extolling a moment ago is, in effect, <Col N="548" /> at a disadvantage.  Purposely, in recognition of what the Minister has done with his threshold, I have not used the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo;.  I said &ldquo;disadvantage&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us take the pathological marriage first.  Thanks be to God, so far in this country, notwithstanding all our economic ills, one may safely say that the bulk of the community are healthy. That does not mean that we have not got a big problem with the health services for those who are unhealthy.  In the same way, where marriage is concerned, we have got to recognise the fact that marriages do break down.  I am now going to confine myself to (a) where they are separated under an order of the court of competent jurisdiction or by deed of separation because, on the earlier amendment, I referred to (b) and the possible difficulties inherent in the concept of permanent separation.</P>
    <P>Referring specifically to (a) and, incidentially, to (b) where there is a separation and a breakdown, there will again be a benefit under this Bill and there is a direct instigation, therefore, in so far as economic factors are an instigation, towards the resolution of matrimonial problems by such a breakdown.  It has not been unknown in history where large amounts of money are involved, and the Minister has been saying that it is only large amounts that are involved here, for artificial situations to have been contrived, where even the healthy sentiments the Minister extolled earlier on are sacrificed for more mundane reasons founded on economic causes.  That is the first point.  There is an incitement here if there is a disadvantage&mdash;I have avoided the word &ldquo;penalty&rdquo;&mdash;to the healthy marriage.  There certainly seems to be a premium put in this Bill in principle on the unhealthy marriage.</P>
    <P>Let us now come to a few practical points.  No doubt the Revenue Commissioners are like a very experienced medical practitioner; they have heard it all and come across it all before and they know all the diseases to which tax administration is prone.  Perhaps the Minister can give me an answer on <Col N="549" /> this as I have not had the opportunity of looking it up from a legal point of view.  As regards section 1, paragraph (a)&mdash;I have already spoken about paragraph (b)&mdash;and amendment No. 3, if two people are separated by order of the court or by a deed of separation the primary purpose of either the order or the deed is to legitimise or, rather, neutralise the conjugal rights of both partners and at the same time, if necessary, restrain one from molesting the other if the situation calls for that.  So far as I know&mdash;let me be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;if the two separated partners have no particular objection the court does not say they must not meet one another and neither does the deed of separation.</P>
    <P>This could raise an interesting situation in this modern, liberal world where people are less concerned with the conventions of the past.  In fact, apart from being a disincentive to matrimony at all, legislation of this nature, plus the current trends, appears to have the one and only purpose of legitimising children and even that is, unfortunately, apparently becoming of less importance than it used to be.  With that almost as the sole counterpart, for anybody with property who is affected in this way, a division of the property through either the avoidance of a formal marriage or connivance by getting relevant deeds or orders of the court and thereafter exercising the free human consent could give rise to an interesting situation.  I do not know how this would appear in a constitutional case with regard to human rights.</P>
    <P>We had a very interesting one that led to a rather surprising perambulation of the Taoiseach in this Chamber on one occasion arising from somewhat similar causes.  I am wondering whether, just for the sake of recognising what the facts are, we are not wandering down the leafy lane of legal uncertainty.  This may seem farfetched. Nevertheless, I say it in all seriousness even though I follow the Minister in the cheerful tone, which I am glad he adopted, when he was dealing with this.</P>
    <P>I am old-fashioned enough to feel <Col N="550" /> the dangers of these things.  I am social enough to be worried about the consequences of provisions in a Bill like that in particular circumstances affecting the very class that might be prone to this kind of thing.  I do not know if &ldquo;moral&rdquo; is the word to use, but &ldquo;social&rdquo; certainly is the word to use.  Apart from the property aspect which we dealt with on the earlier amendment, there is a trend which will follow from the fact that the wife and husband are being integrated at a disadvantage.  If they are separated, or if you avoid the legitimate relationship, by device or otherwise, this Bill will favour such a situation.  For that reason I support the first part of Deputy Colley's amendment, namely the deletion.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Colley's amendment, the Minister might accuse him of being liberal and I might accuse him of being &ldquo;a chauvinistic what&rdquo; because he is giving the custody <i>prima facie</i> and in the first instance to the male.  Even Deputy Colley prefers the male in this amendment.</P>

      <P>If the Minister said that was an argument for treating them as one I would not blame him.  If female was written in instead of male it would have precisely the same effect.  Perhaps my little joke misfired.  In all seriousness I say to the Minister that we are dealing with a taxation Bill and the property of the married parties is separate and should be taxed separately.  If the Bill remains as it is&mdash;we will come back to this on the other appropriate amendment and on the threshold&mdash; there is a disadvantage for the healthy marriage and an incentive towards the pathological.  Frankly we should try to avoid that at all costs. If the cost is to be, in this particular case, to increase the threshold by the amount I have said, socially it would be worth it.  In saying this, let me be generous to the Minister if not only just.  The thresholds, particularly in the Capital Acquisition Bill, and the thresholds in this Bill are, to my mind, generous enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="551" /> I have two qualifications to that statement and they are made in the spirit of friendliness.  One is the whole question of our approach to this Bill on the question of productive assets and the other is the doubt about inflation and the feeling that an automatic compensator should be in the Bill.  We discussed that earlier and I would be going outside the terms of this amendment if I were to discuss it again now.  I hope these are reasonable arguments, and reasonable alternative points of view, even if they are contrary to the Ministers point of view.  Making them does not debar me from recognising the merits of what the Minister has done.  I would like to assure him that we are only too willing to acknowledge and recognise these merits.</P>
    <P>If we try to keep to our muttons here, these merits are not to be pleaded where they are not directly relevant to the arguments we are making.  The relative measures and the generosity of the thresholds are not really at issue in this argument except in so far as the cost of the increase to the Exchequer might be relevant.  Weighing the social and the other arguments, I would strongly submit to the Minister the view that the cost would be worth the result.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera has opened up a very interesting avenue in his reference to paragraph (b) of the definition section in regard to separation. For people who have considerable wealth it might well be worth their while to have a deed of separation executed if it meant exemption of another £40,000 and another house and its contents.  It could be well worth their while to do it although they might not, in fact, be separated.</P>
      <P>None of these problems would arise at all if the Minister would approach it in the way we are seeking to get him to approach it in this amendment. It is true that the thresholds to which Deputy de Valera referred in this Bill are generous, subject to the reservations he expressed about no provision for inflation and the taxation of productive assets.  In our circumstances they are high.  I do not accept the Minister's comparison with thresholds in other countries, because, as I said earlier, it is not possible to make a comparison unless one can compare the overall effect such as other taxation rates, and, in the case of wealth taxes where they exist in other countries, the rate of tax.  Deputy Brugha spoke about this earlier and seemed to demonstrate that in most European countries the rate is lower than here.  We should also compare the structure of the tax in so far as the items to which it is applied are different.  There is in one case, maybe in others, a method of valuation of property which produces quite a different result from what one gets here.  Comparisons of this kind do not appear to be very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> As Deputy de Valera said, that is not really the point at issue here, nor is the point at issue merely one of the position of those who will be affected by wealth tax.  There is much more involved in it than this.  What is really involved is the basic approach of this Legislature to the role of the married woman in 1975.  In my view, the provisions of this Bill are degrading to married women, whether they are affected by wealth tax or not, or whether their husbands are affected by wealth tax or not.  An approach which sets out in legislation passed by this House in 1975 that the woman is to be ignored except for the purpose of taking her wealth and aggregating it with that of her husband and making him liable fully for all tax on it, plus accounting for all the details of it seems is something that should not be done.  This House I would hope in this year would have advanced sufficiently not to approach the role of the married woman in that way.  Unfortunately, that is what the Bill is doing.</P>
    <P>This amendment and the other two which are tied in with it although not formally under our rules of order but taken together, provide the framework in which an alternative approach to the one in the Bill could be implemented. It is possible to approach this matter differently.  There is no insurmountable problem from a legal or an administrative point of view.  I stated, in regard to this matter on an earlier Stage, and the Minister did not contradict me, that I believe that the possible loss of revenue involved, as far as the Exchequer is concerned, cannot be very great, especially having regard to the fact that the total amount of revenue involved is not likely to be very great anyway. The amount of revenue that would be involved in approaching the matter on the basis of treating a married woman as an individual in her own right cannot be great.</P>
    <P>This is a new Bill for a new tax.  The Minister is not bound in any way by previous legislation or by considerations of loss of revenue.  He has a free hand here in a way that is not often available to a Minister for Finance in a matter of this kind.  He has a free hand to do the job right, but instead of that he is adopting an <Col N="554" /> approach which one can find in legislation that was passed in the last century in a number of countries and in the earlier part of this century in other countries.  Whatever may have been the view of that legislation and its approach to the role of the married woman at that time, surely, it cannot be contended today here that this Bill represents the approach of Dáil Éireann to the role of the married woman. I do not believe it does or that it is necessary because of legal or administrative problems.  It is possible to do this in a way that will treat a married woman as an individual in her own right.  This is basically what I am concerned with as distinct from the anomalies that are arising&mdash;I am concerned about them also&mdash;but basically I am concerned that the married woman with or without property, coming under the wealth tax or not, should as far as this House can do it in legislation it passes from now on, be recognised as an individual in her own right, having the same rights as her husband, as single women, as separated married women or separated married men.</P>
    <P>That is not an unreasonable propostion. I would have thought that the justice of it was self-evident, but, unfortunately, so far the Minister has not indicated that he is even conscious of the enormity of what he is perpetrating in this Bill in regard to married women.  I do not wish to delay this debate unduly.  It is clear from what the Minister said that he is not prepared to accept this amendment but there will be one further bite at this cherry in a later amendment. I can only express the hope that between now and the time we reach that amendment the Minister will think a little further about the matter and recognise that his approach should be different.  I hope he will recognise that it can be different, with no great difficulty, that if it is not different when this Bill is finally enacted, he and his colleagues will stand convicted of, at the very least, a totally Victorian approach to the role of the married woman in our society in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioners that property comprised in a discretionary trust on the 5th day of April, 1975, was transferred to an individual on or before the 4th day of April, 1976, that property shall be deemed to be the property to which the individual was entitled in possession on the 5th day of April, 1975, and section 3 shall, in lieu of subsection (1), apply to such property. </P>
      <P>The object of these two amendments is to provide a reasonable time for taxpayers to adjust their affairs in the light of the legislation being enacted in regard to capital taxation. This is particularly relevant in the case of this Bill where, as we demonstrated earlier today, the Government in their White Paper clearly indicated that the wealth tax was not to be implemented until 5th April next.</P>
      <P>In other words, that the first valuation date under the Wealth Tax Bill was to be in the tax year 1975-76, whereas the first valuation date under the Bill is in the year 1974-75.  Therefore, this Bill, and this wealth tax, are being brought in a year earlier than was indicated in the White Paper. Consequently, no reasonable opportunity is being given to people to rearrange their affairs in accordance with law.  Nor indeed is any opportunity being given to their professional advisers to study the law and advise them.  Nobody, not even the Minister, can say, at this stage what the ultimate version of the capital taxation measures the Government propose will be. Certainly nobody apart from the Minister can say with any certainty what will be the provisions of this or any of the other Bills until they are enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason why people should not be given the opportunity to study the law, as enacted, and arrange <Col N="556" /> their affairs in accordance with that law, subject to the exceptions that the Minister was obliged to announce in the White Paper in regard to certain aspects of capital gains tax and gifts where, in effect, the legislation is leading back to the date of publication of the White Paper, 28th February, 1974.  But, subject to that exception, I would suggest that there is no good reason why the taxpayers concerned and their professional advisers should not be given an opportunity to consider the law and its implications.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that in so far as people have their affairs arranged in a particular way at present, unscrambling that&mdash;it may be necessary for some people in the light of the new provisions which will be enacted&mdash;may mean legal costs; in some cases stamp duty, capital gains tax and, in other cases, perhaps gift tax as a liability arising out of that unscrambling.  The fact that some, say, discretionary trusts, or, indeed, private non-trading companies, may have been used as a vehicle to avoid death duties does not, in my view, mean that the people concerned have no rights because anything that was done by them was done within the law.  Secondly, we have established in the course of the passage of this Bill that, in the case of discretionary trusts, quite a number were set up for perfectly legitimate reasons having nothing to do with any form of tax avoidance whether death duties or income tax. Indeed, provision is made in the Bill now to cover such cases.  That being so, it seems to me that such persons are at least entitled to take what was said in the White Paper, to rely on it. That White Paper indicated quite clearly, on pages 45 and 60 that wealth tax would operate, most likely on the 5th April, 1976 as the first valuation date.  I do not think it is reasonable to bring in the wealth tax a year earlier and to make no provision at all for such persons to have an opportunity of re-arranging their affairs, in the light of the new legislation.  To provide, as is the position at present that such persons, if they do re-arrange their affairs, will automatically become liable to <Col N="557" /> various expenses, and in some cases various taxes such as are provided for in this Bill and other Bills, is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I urge the Minister to accept the proposition involved in these two amendments, to the effect that where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that property comprised in discretionary trust on 5th April, 1975, or, indeed, in a private non-trading company on that date&mdash;where that was transferred to an individual on or before the 4th April next&mdash;it should be deemed to be the property of that individual and taxed accordingly.  In fact, I believe there ought to be provisions which would exempt such persons from the kinds of liability I have indicated in the event of their unscrambling their affairs in that way.  But that is not provided for in this amendment.  I am just mentioning it in passing.  Primarily, what is provided for in this amendment, and the subsequent one we are discussing with it, is the opportunity for persons to re-arrange their affairs so that the property that might be comprised in a discretionary trust or a private non-trading company, could be transferred to the individual concerned. If that is done, it does not mean that such persons will be exempt from wealth tax.  It does mean that they would get the benefit of the thresholds provided in the Bill for other individuals.</P>
    <P>Whatever case that might be made by the Minister in resisting these amendments could be made only with reason and logic, if an earlier amendment of ours to operate the wealth tax, as indicated in the White Paper with the first valuation date occurring on the 5th April next, had been accepted.  Had that been accepted, then I could see the Minister could have a good, reasonable case for resisting these amendments and I would not be pressing them. But that amendment was not accepted and in my view makes the acceptance of these all the more necessary and desirable.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the implications of what is involved in non-acceptance.</P>

      <P>Let me just add to what Deputy Colley has said.  Some people&mdash;to use Deputy Colley's phrase &mdash;who will have unscrambled earlier will I think get the benefit of the thresholds.  Notice was given in the White Paper.  Either for <i>bona fide</i> reasons or, perhaps, through inadvertence, some people will be caught and miss out on the threshold here.  Common fairness suggests that something on the lines of this amendment should be accepted.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to accuse the Minister or the Revenue Commissioners of unworthy motives, but we have to be on our guard here in the House against anything that would savour of a punitive measure.  Admittedly, the devise &mdash;whether of discretionary trusts or a non-trading company&mdash;was used for tax evasion purposes.  Nevertheless, when they were used they were used quite legitimately and lawfully for these purposes or they would not have got away with it.  I feel there is a certain danger that we might approach this on the basis: &ldquo;Ah, ha, now we will give them a rap.&rdquo;  I am not imputing such a motive either to the Minister or his advisers, but it is now before us in the House.  It is quite possible that that motive would be imputed to us in the House.  Very little is going to be gained.  Vindictiveness or getting one's own back plays no part whatsoever in approach to our legislation. We are big enough to rise above that. I would commend the amendment to the Minister with such thoughts, again reiterating that there is no imputation of motive.  I am simply speaking as a Member of the House who is asked to judge on the merits of this amendment.  The quality of mercy should not be strained when it is unnecessary to strain it.  Perhaps it would be very appropriate to accede to Deputy Colley's request in this case.</P>

      <P>No, I do not, but I know well what the Minister for Lands said in my absence because we discussed beforehand the line we would take.  The record and the White Paper will speak and so will all the representations that I have received over the last year.  There was only one understanding, that was April, 1975.  We made it perfectly clear that estate duty would go only when we were ready to bring in the wealth tax. That was always the argument and that is what we have stuck to.  Let us leave that nonsense aside.  The argument of the Opposition is not worthy even of their low estimate of the intelligence of the L and H society which I regard highly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> On the issue of this particular proposal I would say the following.  The point is academic for any persons whose assets exceed £100,000.  It does not matter whether they are held in a discretionary trust or by a private non-trading company.  They will be caught anyway.  If their wealth exceeds £100,000 they will be caught whether they hold it personally, or whether it is in a discretionary trust or in a private non-trading company.  Secondly, the amendments affect only those cases where the individuals interested in these entities would not themselves be liable to tax.  In such cases not all persons would be in a position to unscramble the discretionary trusts or companies, and if the concession were to be given to those who could do it they would be treated more favourably than those who could not and that would not be fair.</P>
    <P>The worst that could be said is that some people might have to pay the tax once, that is in respect of 5th April, 1975, but such people had fair warning.  The White Paper was published on 28th February, 1974.  They had plenty of time to contemplate their position.  It is a strange business indeed when the House is asked to compensate for imprudence.  If people think that the prudent thing now to do is to unscramble their discretionary trusts or companies they ought to have exercised that prudence long ago.  They received plenty of warning because the White Paper gave the date on which it would come into operation and that was 1975.  Do not let anybody waste time arguing otherwise.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick, the Minister for Lands, pointed out, international commentators and experts on wealth tax in their book &ldquo;Annual Wealth Tax&rdquo; have observed, and this includes the deputy chairman of the Revenue Commissioners in Britain, that the Irish wealth tax would be operative from April, 1975.</P>

      <P>Deputy Gibbons gave notice of his intention <Col N="561" /> to raise on the Adjournment the passing on to the farming community of the results of the green £ valuation revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for according me the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment. It is an indication of the recognition of the Chair that the question is immediate and it is of the greatest importance.  I want to say immediately that the devaluation that was made in Brussels the other day by the Council of Ministers, while it was very seriously insufficient to be of any real value to Irish agriculture, was at the same time a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister, or his Department, at any rate, immediately and as is usual got out an instant calculation as to the benefits that would be conferred upon the farming community by this devaluation.  On this occasion they came up with the figure of £17 million and it was expressed in a manner that would give the ordinary hearer to understand that this £17 million was being brought in some mysterious way from Brussels and being channelled directly into the farmers' pockets.</P>
      <P>This is not a new Government tactic. I think the classic example of it was on the occasion of the previous devaluation of the green £ on, I think, 7th October last year when another partial devaluation, that might have been a great deal bigger if the Irish Government had wished it, was made when an 11.4 devaluation was made. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries rushed into print immediately and announced a £50 million bonanza for farmers and within weeks we had the spectacle of farmers at the cattle markets of the country selling their cattle at prices which had not been reached for the previous 15 or 20 years, for £5 a cwt.  If you had spoken to any of these farmers at the time of this £50 million bonanza I doubt if you would have been well received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that there was no real benefit to the producers of young <Col N="562" /> cattle in this country from that devaluation.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the EEC enabled us to send a great many of our cattle into intervention and this had a beneficial effect on the guide prices for cattle.  It is worth remembering that not for a very long time now has the Irish reference price for cattle borne any serious resemblance to the guide price, which is guaranteed to British producers by the mechanism of the variable premium.  For many months the reference price for cattle in Ireland has been consistently the lowest throughout the Community. The beginning in the drop in the price of cattle began about 6th April, 1973.  There has been an almost steady drop in cattle prices ever since.  The cattle trade began to lose ground at that stage and it has been in a state of relative chaos ever since.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Government have been contemplating the effects the devaluation of the green £ would have on certain foodstuffs in the domestic market.  They have announced, very vaguely, that the consequential changes that will have to be made in the level of subsidy would be borne entirely by the farming community.  I understand that the Minister, speaking on the radio today, expressed the opinion that the farmers were in the front line, as he put it, and must bear the full brunt of the increase of £2½ million&mdash;the cost of the increased food subsidies which are consequent on the change in the value of the green £&mdash;and that they must bear it alone.</P>
    <P>I have not got time to dwell at any great length on the havoc of the past two years in the cattle trade, but I want to pinpoint as accurately as I can the fact that when the decay began and when it achieved an increasing rate of acceleration, the disintegration in the market for cattle set in and this situation still exists.  During last year there was a drop of almost 500,000 in the number of cows and heifers-in-calf in this country.  Figures are not available for the drop that will be recorded for the past 12 months, from June, 1974 to June, 1975, but I am sure there will be another serious drop.  This would <Col N="563" /> not be taking place if the cattle industry were in a good position.  It is notable, also, that in the number of cattle under one year old, there is also a decrease. This is an indication of the state our cattle industry will be in in the next three or four years, no matter what we do.</P>
    <P>While all this was going on&mdash;as everybody knows and the meat factories are openly admitting it&mdash;there was widespread profiteering in the sending of meat into intervention by the meat factories last year.  No attempt was made on the part of the Irish Government to ensure that the benefits of the intervention&mdash;and they were very real&mdash;were passed on to the producers of young cattle.  On the contrary, it was in the differential between the price of young cattle and the price of beef cattle that the greatest opportunity for profiteering was made.  It was here that the unbridled profiteering took place to the greatest extent.  It is no wonder that the large number of Irish farmers, the producers of young cattle&mdash;I would say they are more numerous than any other type of farmer&mdash;cannot afford to put fertilisers on their grassland any more, nor to pay for fertilisers for any other crops.  That is why there has been such a massive drop&mdash;40 per cent&mdash;in the use of fertilisers in the current crop year.  The price of fertilisers has increased by about 250 per cent.  It will not be possible to maintain our already inadequate production of hay and silage unless there is an appropriate amount of fertiliser used.</P>
    <P>Last year and the year before the amount of hay and silage produced for the maintenance of our cattle herd, which had been increasing rapidly for the previous decade, was not sufficient to carry the cattle, as they ought to have been carried and fed, during the winter.  Last winter, Providentially, proved to be so mild that our inadequate supplies of winter fodder for our cattle just about got us there without any dramatic loss.  During this summer there will be just as dramatic a drop in the production of silage and hay for the coming winter, for a number of reasons.  One is because of the dryness of the weather, <Col N="564" /> over which the Government have no control, but another reason is that fertiliser is not being used.  Therefore, there must necessarily be a great shortfall in the amount of fodder available for cattle during the coming year.</P>
    <P>If next winter is more normal, it is reasonable to expect that the demands on available fodder supplies will be greater than they were last year.  But available supplies are not plentiful. Any resources farmers could manage to husband in the last disastrous few years will be needed to tide them over the coming year in a period of great scarcity of fodder.  It is not enough to say that farm incomes&mdash;on the Department's own admission and I would question the accuracy of this figure&mdash;dropped by 30 per cent last year, compared with incomes for the previous year.  There will be no upturn in the current year either.  In spite of devaluation and inflation, the amount of money, if counted in pound notes, farmers will get in reward for their work, will be a great deal less than it was two or three years ago.  We have only to refer to the ordinary prices paid for cattle in marts throughout the country.  There has been a very decided drop in the prices paid for cattle since this Government took office.  The Minister said recently that the prices now being realised for cattle were never as high. I want to tell the Minister&mdash;and I have been in the cattle business all my life, buying and selling&mdash;that that statement is not true.  Cattle were making more three years ago than they are now and every farmer knows this, whether the Government know it or not.</P>
    <P>There will be a similar shortfall in fodder for dairy cattle.  As well as that, there will be an acute situation in the co-operative milk manufacturing combines some of which were built in fairly recent years and which still have to be paid for and the service of the loans used to build these plants requires the availability of an adequate supply of milk.  I do not think an adequate supply of milk will be available and it may well be that the consequent increases from the 5 per cent partial <Col N="565" /> devaluation of the £ arranged in Brussels the other day may be dissipated by the co-operatives themselves of necessity in order to service their capital debt.  The benefits that ought to accrue to the actual producers, to the farmers themselves, will be negatived right down the whole way. I am not blaming the co-operatives. They were right to expand their enterprises and they were right to borrow money to expand.  It was reasonable for them to expect there would be an increasing supply of milk.  What they had not bargained for was the disaster the whole cattle herd ran into in the last couple of years and the consequential arrest in the expansion of the milk supply business.  These were absolutely vital for their financial plans.</P>
    <P>Besides these serious problems we have the vital question&mdash;I know the Minister is aware of it, but nothing perceptible is being done about it&mdash;of disease eradication.  This is a matter which will have to be tackled radically by some Government.  When I say it will have to be tackled radically, I mean the whole approach will have to be changed.  Farmers' mentalities and attitudes will have to change.  It will not be a pleasant change and farmers are not going to like it but we will all have to face it.  It will cost a great deal of money.  As far as we can see, this money is not going to be available and it is generally agreed, I think, that the progress of the disease eradication programme is very unsatisfactory. Far from taking money from the moneys already voted in this House for agriculture, their needs in this particular area alone to be a very substantial increase in the amount of money available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Far from giving assistance to farmers in these difficult times, the only thing the Government are thinking of doing is imposing double taxation, treble taxation and quadruple taxation. This is not merely a figure of speech.  We have the very serious burden of rates on agricultural land. We have always had it.  It is completely unjust and bears no relation to the farmers' ability to pay.  This party has always acknowledged that farmers are just as bound to meet <Col N="566" /> their fair taxes as anybody else.  We advocated it when we were in Government. Now, if farmers are thrifty and industrious they build up a certain amount of profit for reinvestment in their own business, as a result of the financial arrangements entered into by the present Government this profit will be taken from them.  Their very right to give their property, when they so decide, to their sons or their successors, will be taxed.  It may well be that the new generation of farmers who come after them will have to contend with a burden of debt round their necks simply by virtue of the fact that they inherited the land their fathers passed on to them, who, in turn, inherited it from their fathers. The whole system of farming succession will be distorted and destroyed by the present Government.  This is the only positive thing they have done in that area for the principal industry of the country.  the industry that makes the whole country tick.  Is there any other class of people who would suffer such a very serious and admitted drop in income, while, at the same time, be required solely, as a class, to subsidise the food of the whole population? The exclusive obligation is put on farmers alone to subsidise food for the rest of the population, the population whose incomes rose by considerable amounts in the past two years.</P>

      <P>I am just finished. What the present Government seem to be attempting to do is to create a new class of helots, a slave class, and put the farmers into that class.  The indications are there.  The intimations we have had from them clearly indicate their intention to put this new tax burden solely on the shoulders of farmers.  That is manifestly unjust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton) Mark A. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood this debate was to be about what happened in Brussels this week and I intend to devote the limited time available to me to dealing with what happened in Brussels.  I should like to <Col N="567" /> put on record exactly what has been achieved in Brussels in regard to the change in the green £.  The Council of Ministers have agreed to reduce the Irish and the UK green £ rates by 5 per cent as from 4th August.  This has the effect of reducing Irish MCA's by 5.6 percentage points.  If the position of the £ on the foreign exchange market remains as it is, the new MCA rate will be only 4.9 on 4th August.  I hope, and expect, the Commission will shortly agree to reduce the MCA in the beef sector by a further 1 per cent.  The Deputy will recall that at price-fixing time last spring, Commissioner Lardinois was given the discretion to reduce, by a certain percentage, the MCA's on beef where the price had been below intervention level for some time.</P>
      <P>I approached him on this occasion, as I did before, and he has now promised to give us a further 1 per cent reduction on beef.  This will bring down the MCA's on beef by a further percentage point, down to approximately 4 per cent.  The result of all this will be that intervention prices in Ireland will be increased by 5.3 per cent on 4th August and the monetary charges on our agricultural exports will be substantially reduced as from that date.  This is a very considerable benefit to Irish agriculture, a benefit we estimate to be worth at least £17 million in a full year.  This figure has been contested by Deputy Gibbons.  It has been carefully assessed and, frankly, we consider the assessment an underestimation.  Of this amount, at least £12 million will accrue in the dairy sector because of increased support prices and reduced monetary charges and most of the balance arises in the beef sector due to the reduction of those charges. These figures are, if anything, conservative. As I have said, they are come to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat this is a real gain.  Some people have suggested that it is not really a benefit to the farmers.  Yet, the same people have long been claiming the high level of MCA <Col N="568" /> charges causes losses to farmers because of a reduction in export competitiveness.  They cannot have it both ways.  The Deputy has himself acknowledged that it was at least a substantial step in the right direction. I have succeeded in having these monetary charges more than halved overnight and the resulting increase in export competitiveness must now bring significant benefits to the agricultural sector.  Our aim was to reduce substantially the monetary export charges.  This is what I have achieved.</P>
    <P>Another misrepresentation that has been put about is that we did not seek this change, that we simply followed in the wake of the United Kingdom request.  This is completely untrue. We made contact with the Commission some weeks ago on this matter and, as I have already said, we were seeking a greater increase.  Some weeks earlier still we had, in fact, made a first approach to the British in the hope that they would change their representative rate simultaneously with us, because we were well aware that, in view of the financial implications for the Community, a request for unilateral change by us would meet with very strong opposition, and that the formal proposal which is essential would not be made by the Commission.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, simultaneous moves by Ireland and the United Kingdom would have a much better chance of success.  Indeed, I may say what we did achieve was obtained only in the face of considerable opposition in Brussels.  But for our very strong pressure, for instance, the change would not have applied at all in the beef sector until January next. The position is that the change which was made in our rate was sought and obtained by us.  It is preposterous to suggest otherwise.</P>
    <P>As everybody here must know, I have sought at practically every meeting of the council in recent months relief from the high level of MCA's which have applied to Irish exports.</P>
    <P>As in all things in life, benefits come only at some cost.  In the present <Col N="569" /> case there is some cost by way of higher domestic prices.  We estimate that if passed on in full, the change in the rate would add about 0.5 per cent to the consumer price index, but the increase over the rest of this year should not in practice be much in excess of 0.3 per cent.  The Government are determined to take measures to offset any such effect on the index.  The cost of doing this, we estimate, as being in the region of £2½ million in a full year.  It is only reasonable that since, in the main, the agricultural sector which, of course, includes processing interests, will benefit from the green £ adjustment, it should contribute towards the cost of these measures.  The Government have not as yet decided the precise form these measures should take. It would be wrong for me to speculate on what the eventual decision may be.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what has been said by all and sundry, the fact is that I have succeeded in reducing substantially a major disability which our agricultural exports faced in trade to all destinations.  We have increased guaranteed farm prices in Ireland. This combination of measures will bring significant financial benefits to Irish agriculture.  The resulting impact on the consumer here will be offset by <Col N="570" /> Government measures to the cost of which those who benefit from the green £ adjustment will have to make a contribution.  As I have said, the MCA charges will be halved overnight. This is a benefit which should not be underestimated.  Deputies on both sides of the House have been urging that relief should be obtained from the heavy burden of these charges.  I have now secured that relief and I do not see how this can be opposed by any Deputy.</P>
    <P>As regards the domestic impact here, we must accept that this is a common fight against inflation in which all of us are deeply involved. All sections are being called upon to make their contribution.  We are seeking sensibly through consultation to get this co-operation.  I believe we will get it, regardless of what Deputies on the opposite side of this House think and feel.</P>
