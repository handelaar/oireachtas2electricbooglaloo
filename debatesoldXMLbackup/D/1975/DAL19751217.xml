    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Dáil at its rising this week do adjourn for the Christmas Recess.</P>
      <P>Nineteen seventy-five was not a year for which the Government entertained any great expectations of economic advance.  In January, I said that the budget had been framed in the most difficult circumstances faced by any Irish Government for very many years.  I mentioned the view that had been expressed by the OECD that its member countries' economies were being put, at that time, to a test which was probably unprecedented outside time of war.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances, what was our response to be?  We could simply have battened down the hatches and allowed the ship to be blown about at the mercy of the economic storm until it blew over.  We could have cut public expenditure back sharply, raised taxes substantially and restrained borrowing.  The consequences for employment and for the standard of living of the weaker sections of the community would have been appalling.  We rejected that option.  We refused to inflict suffering on the people that might well be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Instead, we aimed at careful expansion, at maintaining employment and living standards as far as possible.  We adopted a policy which, as I acknowledged at the time, was not without its risks&mdash;although, in line with the views of many of the experts, we expected that the international situation would show some improvement.</P>
      <P>Certainly, we did not expect that it would get much worse.  Regrettably, this is what has happened all over the world.  The world recession has proved to be much deeper and of much longer duration than was originally expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until fairly recently, it was thought that output in Europe would be virtually maintained in 1975.  It is now <Col N="1759" /> estimated that it has shown a marked fall.  Midway through the year industrial production in most member states of the EEC had fallen to the level of early 1972; over the Community as a whole it fell by 12½ per cent.  At present, there are about five million people out of work in the Community. Taking a somewhat wider view, the depth of the recession is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that, for the first time since the war the volume of world trade fell this year&mdash;and the fall was substantial, between 5 per cent and 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>World-wide economic recession has been with us for some time now and I and my colleagues have found it necessary, on many occasions, to set out the facts of the international situation. We have been criticised for this and it has been suggested that we have tried to evade our responsibilities and to put the blame for our economic ills solely on external forces.  This, of course, simply is not fact.  I myself and my colleagues have tried, at all times, to bring home to our people that we, ourselves, must do everything that is within our own power to remedy our difficulties.</P>
    <P>In fact, as a result of the budgetary and other measures taken by the Government, industry here has not been affected as adversely as in some other countries but the recession has inevitably had an adverse impact on the economy.  It is estimated that our industrial exports will show a fall of 7 to 8 per cent over the year as a whole, although this decline has been offset by a marked increase in agricultural exports.  The uncertain economic climate which originated in the oil crisis of end-1973 induced a marked lack of confidence among consumers.  Coupled with a high rate of inflation and rising unemployment this has resulted in exceptionally high levels of personal saving and led to sluggishness in home demand with further detrimental effects, in turn, on both employment and potential spending power.  More than 109,000 of our people are now registered as unemployed or on short-time.  This, of course, includes a number of persons <Col N="1760" /> who, although on the live register, are recognised not to be appropriate for inclusion on it.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some encouraging signs.  The trade figures for September and October give some evidence of a recovery in imports which may indicate a levelling off of the decline in domestic activity.  There was a rise of 2½ per cent in the volume of retail sales in September. Similarly, if we adjust the unemployment figures for seasonal influences, there are some indications that the underlying trend may be stabilising. The increase of only 2 per cent in consumer prices since last May also provides grounds for satisfaction although, of course, it was largely due to the June budget.  The underlying increase is certainly higher.</P>
    <P>Turning to the prospects for next year, I am afraid that they do not offer us a great deal of comfort. While it is expected that there will be strong growth in the economies of the United States&mdash;where recovery is already an established fact&mdash;and of Japan, the prospects for Europe are much less good.  Broadly speaking, the improvement foreseen in the economic fortunes of our EEC partners is expected to do no more than make up the fall in production this year.</P>
    <P>At all events, it seems likely that we may not be able to draw a great deal of benefit from the international recovery until towards the end of next year.  As I said last week, it is going to be a tough year and we have to face up to that.  We are balanced on the knife edge between even greater depression or&mdash;if we act sensibly&mdash;recovery.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that if export markets are unlikely to provide much of a stimulus, the Government should give a fiscal boost to home demand.  We are getting near budget time and I cannot, just now, anticipate what will be in the budget. However, I should stress that the Government's room for manoeuvre in this area is limited.  As I mentioned earlier, we adopted a courageous budgetary policy last year, a policy involving acknowledged risks, <Col N="1761" /> in the interests of maintaining employment and living standards.</P>
    <P>This action helped to push up public expenditure.  At the same time other factors caused a shortfall in the yield of taxes.  The prospective deficit on the current budget is now almost £280 million, more than twice the budgeted figure of £125 million and total Government borrowing at home and abroad will be of the order of £700 million, as against £450 million originally intended.  The steep rise in costs has also, of course, pushed up the bill facing us for next year and if we were to meet all the demands originally put to us for 1976, without additional taxation, it would be necessary to borrow almost £1,300 million.  All Deputies will appreciate that it simply is not possible to finance a gap of this magnitude: and it is utterly unreal to think of increasing it to boost home demand, or for that matter for any other purpose.  A prudent and responsible Government can accept certain risks for a time but to persist in incurring these risks would be the height of irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>So far as the composition of our spending is concerned, we have been exploring all avenues by which the composition of public expenditure in 1976 can be adapted to assist in economic recovery.  We are strongly of the view that in face of the facts of the economic situation, in face of the numbers affected by short-time working and unemployment and having regard to the tens of thousands who have not got even the basic increases under the present national agreement, there could be no justification for devoting scarce resources to further increases in pay for those in secure employment in the public sector, on top of the substantial increases they have received in the last two rounds of wage and salary increases. Resources must be released for purposes which can contribute in a more direct way to the creation of self-sustaining employment.</P>
    <P>Looking at the question of pay in a wider context, it is also necessary to get our production costs back in line with those of our competitors.  We <Col N="1762" /> have lost ground here.  I know that price is not the only factor in competitiveness and that wages and salaries are not the only cost of production. However I think nobody will deny that they are an extremely important cost.  We can take no comfort, therefore, from comparisons of unit wage costs in manufacturing industry. Since 1970, these have risen here by 73 per cent more than in the United States, 64 per cent more than in Germany, 34 per cent more than in the Netherlands and 26 per cent more than in France.</P>
    <P>Up to now two factors have shielded us from the full impact of this worsening position.  Costs in our major market&mdash;Britain&mdash;have been rising almost as rapidly as our own and the slide in the value of the pound has made our selling prices, measured in the currencies of the countries in which we are selling, in particular the continental and American markets, that much cheaper.  However, we can no longer rely on these factors to cushion us from the full effects in international markets of our deteriorating cost position.</P>
    <P>Let me be quite clear on what this means.  In 1974 the value of the goods we sold abroad was equivalent to almost 40 per cent of the value of all we produced.  If the income from tourism and other services is counted as well, the extent of our dependence on what we can sell abroad or to persons from abroad would be even higher.</P>
    <P>Some of what we sold was industrial goods and some agricultural but they had this in common&mdash;they sold in a market where competition was sharpened by the world recession. Without these exports, tens of thousands of our people now working in good jobs would have been without them; and the entire fabric of our economy, whether in its social, cultural, or financial aspects, would have been different.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, many who say that their work does not directly affect the ability of this country to sell abroad what it produces.  Perhaps they work in an office or on a <Col N="1763" /> building site or in a field or on the roads in a job remote from the task of selling in foreign markets.  This is a mistaken conception.  The price of what they deal in&mdash;whether it is houses, or services from a bank or an office, or merchandise from a shop, or welfare provided through a Government Department&mdash;goes directly or indirectly, into the price of the goods we must sell abroad in order to maintain, if not to improve, our present standard of living.</P>
    <P>It was because of this decline in our ability to sell abroad, as measured by our competitiveness, that the Government, sought the meeting last week with representatives of unions, farmers and employers.  During the meeting I conveyed the Government's view that to maintain employment those who have jobs should agree not to press for any further pay rise at least until the end of 1976, apart from the payment of the final instalment of the present national pay agreement.  I said that those with incomes from other sources must accept a similar restraint.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear now that it is the intention of the Government, if agreement on a pay pause is reached, to introduce legislation providing for restraint in non-pay income, including dividends, directors' fees and rents similar to that which would apply to pay under the present agreement and the pause.</P>
    <P>Farm income is unique in being largely dependent on EEC decisions under the Common Agricultural Policy and on such factors as weather conditions and market fluctuations. However, State expenditure on agriculture also makes an important contribution. The Government will keep under review the level of such expenditure in the light of the restraint in other areas of non-pay income while, at the same time, taking into account the general development of farm incomes and the need to encourage investment.</P>
    <P>The regulation of professional fees and hire purchase charges is already covered by the Prices (Amendment) Act, 1972.  Similarly, bank interest rates and charges are already subject <Col N="1764" /> to supervision under the existing statutory powers of the Central Bank.  The supervision of these rates and charges to accord with the measure of restraint implicit in the pay pause will be kept under review by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There are complexities in each of the areas of non-pay income, but it would be our aim to have a draft Bill ready as early as possible in 1976, and to have other necessary measures ready at or about the same time.  To ensure that the Bill and other measures are comprehensive and can be introduced at an early date, it would obviously be desirable that the Government should have an early indication of intentions in regard to pay.  This aspect of the matter is being pursued.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that business profits have fallen, in many cases quite sharply, in the recent past as a result of the world-wide recession. The legislation on the control of profits will be framed in such a way as to reconcile the need for industry to shoulder, where necessary, its due share of the burden of income restraint, the need to increase capacity to benefit from the recovery of world economic activity, and the need to provide the self-sustaining employment which can come only from investment in productive equipment and facilities.  For let us be quite clear on this, without investment and the profits that come from it there is no future for this country.  In today's world they are, in the end, the means by which employment is created and sustained.  Other Ministers will be dealing further with this question.</P>
    <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, provides for equal pay by the 31st December, 1975.  The Minister for Labour was presented with a report by the Labour Court yesterday which finds that the obligation to pay equal pay on the due date could result in a significant loss of jobs.  The Government have, therefore, decided that amendments to the Act are necessary with effect from the 1st January, 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1765" /> In view of the very serious budgetary situation the Minister for the Public Service will be seeking an early meeting with representatives of trade unions in the public sector to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>I now turn to an equally difficult area, Northern Ireland.  If we have maintained what has been called &ldquo;a low profile&rdquo;, we cannot and would not wish to cut ourselves off from what is happening there.  We cannot look with disinterest at the plight of our fellow countrymen.  We cannot remain indifferent to the pattern of the last six years in part of this island of killings and bombings and tortures, the proliferation of protection rackets, the growth of sectarian killings and reprisals&mdash;and the suffering in purely human terms to which they contribute.</P>
    <P>Our immediate objective is to contribute in every way possible to the restoration of peace in Northern Ireland.  We continue to believe that the soundest basis for peace lies in political agreement between elected representatives in Northern Ireland based on the principles that both sections of the community must be intimately and directly involved in the institutions of government and that appropriate recognition must be given to the relationship between the two parts of Ireland in such fields as security and economic and social matters.  This policy does not derive from any wish on our part to interfere in the affairs of Northern Ireland but from the nature of the problem to be solved.  In a stable society any scheme for government must have widespread acceptance in the community.  In a society as deeply divided as Northern Ireland has been for the last six years the need for such widespread acceptance is even greater.</P>
    <P>I should like to say clearly to the majority community in Northern Ireland that we are prepared to support, with all the forces at our command any solution which is designed to give a fair deal to all and to deal vigorously with violence from whatever quarter it comes.  We have recognised the factual position of Northern Ireland and that its status can only be changed by a decision from the majority of the <Col N="1766" /> people there.  In all this, let me be quite specific.  We in Government have, as strongly as anyone in this House, an aspiration to see the unification of our island; but we see just as clearly that this cannot be brought about by violence.</P>
    <P>We have no desire to coerce anyone into joining with us.  Any future coming together of both parts of this island, if it is to be meaningful and effective, can only happen through the free choice and decision of the majority community.  I would hope that my assurances on this point will help to create a society in Northern Ireland where people on both sides can work together.  In addition, I would add that we are willing to work jointly within Europe for the general development of the island as a whole and particularly to use European resources to develop both our economies.</P>
    <P>Security is an area where our help can be immediate and obvious.  I am not sure if the extent of our efforts to this end are fully appreciated where they should be.  Certainly the type and frequency of some public commentaries recently would lead one to think otherwise.  The tone, if not the content, of some of these comments would certainly not lead one to the conclusion that there is a fundamental community of interest between this country and Britain in suppressing violence.</P>
    <P>Towards this end we in recent years have increased the strength of our Army by more than 40 per cent, so that its complement is greater now than at any time except during the war.  Its capability of carrying out its role in aid of the civil power has been enhanced.  Over the past year the Army acting in this way has carried out more than 4,000 patrols along the Border and operated more than 11,000 checkpoints, in addition to carrying out other security duties on the Border and in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Our police force too are at their highest level for many years.  The effectiveness of the Garda can be gauged by the number of persons caught and imprisoned for offences <Col N="1767" /> connected with violence.  I do not need to cite their recent successes in detecting and bringing to justice persons guilty of the most heinous crimes&mdash;crimes against the Irish people&mdash;to indicate just how successful in their operations the police force are and how great a debt of gratitude we owe to them, and to the Army, in the present difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have also gone a long way towards making our courts more effective in the struggle against violence; and where there are defects or shortcomings in their operations we have shown ourselves ready to remedy them.  We have before the Dáil now a Bill which, when enacted, will remove some of these outstanding deficiencies.</P>
    <P>In all this&mdash;in building up our security forces, both Army and Garda, operating a judicial system which is effective and in proposing legislation to deal with loopholes where they are found to exist&mdash;we are acting with the full support of the people of this country.  We are expressing in a practical way their will that political violence must never be allowed to take root here.  For apart from their natural abhorrence of the results of violence where it has occurred and the suffering that goes with it, the people of this country know full well just how grievous is the damage being done not only to Northern Ireland but to the entire island by those who pretend to protect or advance their interest by the bomb and the bullet.</P>
    <P>For us in the present year alone the cost of the Army and of the Garda will be of the order of £120 million. The total cost to the economy in compensation for damage arising out of Northern violence or in lost tourism or business is now about £250 million.</P>
    <P>I need not emphasise in this House in present circumstances the uses to which this money could have been put.  It could have provided jobs for tens of thousands of our people.  The size of our unemployment figures is, in part, a reflection of the actions of violent men in our island.  Do these <Col N="1768" /> people think they are furthering any cause by continuing their campaign of maiming and killing?</P>
    <P>It is on these principles that our policy on Northern Ireland is founded. I have used my numerous opportunities of explaining our policies on this and other issues to heads of Government of the various countries in Europe whom I met in Dublin, Brussels, Helsinki and Rome during the past year.  During these discussions I have been careful to set out our policy clearly and factually.  We are anxious that an understanding of our position should be widespread and should develop in the countries of the Community in which we live and of which we are part.</P>
    <P>For it is in that Community that much of our hope for the future lies. The war that is being fought in the streets and for the minds of the people of Northern Ireland&mdash;and let me say of the Irish people living in America and elsewhere&mdash;is an anachronism. That is part of the real tragedy.  In Northern Ireland the battles and the catchcries are often of 50 years ago or even longer.  The principles being fought for and against are already established.  The Community of which we are all a part will soon know no borders in trade, in agriculture, in the rights of passage and of work, and will, if all goes well, continue to develop in the direction of even greater integration of peoples and of purposes. In time, and with patience, this prospect will, I hope, become clearer to all, so that we can live in peace with our friends and kinsmen of the North&mdash;that they will live in peace with each other and with us.</P>
    <P>So far, my remarks have necessarily been concerned with the grave problems facing the country, both in the economic and political spheres.  I am happy now, to be able to turn to some of the many achievements of this Government over the past year, in the face of the difficulties which I have mentioned.  Indeed, if I were to attempt a full review, I would be here for many hours yet.  I shall leave much of the record to my colleagues and confine myself to some of the principal features.</P>
    <P>There has been continued progress <Col N="1769" /> in social reform.  During the year, significant increases were provided for in all the main schemes of social insurance and social assistance, further improvements and extensions were introduced and positive steps were taken towards fundamental reform of the system.  Taken together the increases in rates of benefit raised the weekly levels of all social welfare payments by between 27 and 30 per cent in the current year.  In fact, the effect of these increases is to raise the level of social welfare payments, by comparison with those applicable in the spring of 1973, by amounts ranging from 75 per cent to more than 100 per cent.  In the same period the consumer price index rose by about 48 per cent.  There has, therefore, been a substantial real increase in social welfare payments and their level has been well maintained in relation to earnings in general.</P>
    <P>The duration of pay-related benefit was increased on two separate occasions during 1975 so that a qualifying person who is sick or unemployed can now receive payment of pay-related benefit continuously for almost 12 months provided he or she has the necessary underlying title to disability benefit or unemployment benefit.  In this way, those unfortunate enough to be unable to work for long periods due to illness or to unemployment retain for up to 12 months a reasonable measure of relationship between their incomes and earnings in general.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) Bill, 1975 represents the fulfilment of the Government's commitment to reform the outdated home assistance scheme. The National Committee on Pilot Schemes to Combat Poverty has now entered into contracts providing for substantial EEC financial backing for their programme of research in areas related to the causes and ultimate solutions of hard-core poverty; and studies are at present under way of such crucial development areas as pensions, insurance of the self-employed and the financing of social welfare and health services.</P>
    <P>We are conscious, of course, of the need to ensure that with the rapid <Col N="1770" /> pace of development in this area, anomalies do not arise which might adversely affect the incentive to work. In fact, we have studies in hand at present and if the results show a need for adaptations to existing regulations or practices, these will be made.</P>
    <P>These are the main elements in the Government's planned approach to the social welfare services.  They are in line with the long-term aim of creating, not alone an effective income maintenance service, but also a flexible and sensitive system capable of providing those in need with adequate support of all kinds and with the assistance they must have.  As I said during the course of my radio and television address last week, whatever the problems or difficulties, the Government will continue to protect those in our community who, through, either old age, sickness, unemployment or bereavement, are genuinely unable sufficiently to provide for their own well-being.  But I must emphasise that our ability to do this in the way we would wish will be circumscribed first, by the budgetary limitations to which I have referred and, secondly, by the reaction we get to our call for a pause in incomes in 1976.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on health services will total £214 million in this year, or nearly 6 per cent of our GNP compared with 4.8 per cent in 1972.  While I will acknowledge that increased remuneration, and inflation have been responsible for much of the increases in this area, nevertheless it is a fact that real improvements in the services account for a significant part of it.</P>
    <P>I might emphasise here that the more efficient use of the resources of the health services as administered by the health boards is, in the Government's view, of vital importance&mdash;and the more so at the present time where, because of the economic situation, there is a need to take a critical look at all aspects of Exchequer expenditure.</P>
    <P>Standardisation of the guidelines for determining eligibility for medical cards&mdash;which at the end of September covered 1,136,000 persons or 36 per <Col N="1771" /> cent of the population&mdash;has been achieved throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While the provision of a good hospital system is essential, the number of people requiring institutional care can be reduced considerably by the provision of adequate integrated community care services.  Ideally, medical doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, home assistance officers, public health nurses and voluntary organisations should work in close liaison.  Measures are being taken to this end.</P>
    <P>Voluntary agencies and groups continue to play a vital role in relation to community care services.  Almost 150 social service councils and care of the aged committees, comprising the local voluntary agencies in the area, are at present active throughout the country.  The complexity of the social services now available led the Government to promote the establishment of community information centres.  These are designed to provide information to individuals and groups about the whole range of statutory entitlements and benefits.  The centres are run by voluntary groups, as representative as possible of the local community supported and serviced by the National Social Service Council, with the aid of funds from the Department of Health.  To date, 25 centres have been registered and more are in process of being registered.</P>
    <P>The problem of general hospital reorganisation has been tackled by the Government.  The inadequacy of the existing system, with specialist services provided in many hospitals, and the need to reorganise the service in larger units have long been recognised.  Within two-and-a-half years of coming into office the Government has produced a hospital development programme which provides a firm basis for planning a greatly improved, fully modern general hospital system throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Turning to education, the new boards of management have now been set up in most national schools and for the first time parents are being given a significant voice in the management of these schools.  Deputies <Col N="1772" /> are aware of the procedural arrangements for the appointment of the boards.  Parents generally, I understand, have nominated two lay people among their own representatives. Thus not only are there two elected parent representatives but in most cases there are also two other lay people on the board.  All of this should lead to greater identification of the local community with the school.</P>
    <P>Local support for our national schools is expressed in a great variety of ways, not least of which is that of financial support.  The Government have been concerned about the extent of the burden falling on local sources and so authorised a massive increase in the amount of State aid made available towards the operating costs of the schools.  Under the new capitation grants scheme, the grants available towards heating, cleaning and maintenance of national schools were increased to £6 per pupil and in the case of special schools for the physically and mentally handicapped £12 per pupil.  The previous level averaged about £2 per pupil.  It was no mean achievement in times of economic difficulty to have effected such an extraordinary improvement in the balance as between the central and local financial support for the schools.</P>
    <P>We have also increased substantially the rates of capitation grants and supplemental grants in lieu of tuition fees payable to secondary schools.</P>
    <P>During the past year, the grants for secondary school buildings were increased significantly.  For the first time ever, grants of 80 per cent of the cost are now allowed for the provision of furniture and equipment in addition to building costs and fees in the case of new secondary schools and of school extensions.  Furthermore, the grant for civil works has been increased from 70 per cent to 80 per cent.  In fact, a record expenditure has been incurred in the present year for the erection and extension of first and second level schools.</P>
    <P>We have been engaged at their request in continuing consultation and exchange of views with various interests <Col N="1773" /> in higher education with a view to elucidation of the Government decisions and their implementation in this area.</P>
    <P>In several major respects, the task of implementing public policy falls on the local government sector.  It is a measure of the importance of the services administered by local government that in 1975 estimated total expenditure on them will run to £368 million.  The corresponding total figure for 1972-73 is just over £208 million.  It is obvious that with expenditure of this level decisions as to priorities in spending in present circumstances will be of the utmost importance in local government.</P>
    <P>In housing, our record speaks for itself.  During the five-year period up to 31st March, 1973 an average of 15,600 private and local authority dwellings a year had been completed with 21,600 houses for 1972-73 being the highest output figure recorded. Since this Government assumed office, the annual rate of output has exceeded 25,000 dwellings.  The output so far this year has continued to be satisfactory.  Notwithstanding the present difficult economic situation and pressing demands for resources in other areas, public capital expenditure on housing in 1975 will be approximately £115 million as compared with £46 million in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The Government's housing programme is important from an economic as well as from a social point of view.  Housing output accounts for about 40 per cent of the total output of the building and construction industry.  The Government's firm commitment to a high output of new houses is at the same time a substantial declaration of support for the building industry.</P>
    <P>Another important infrastructural requirement in the modern world is an adequate telecommunications service. Capital investment in telephones has been increased substantially in recent years.  The Government are aware of the urgent need for continued expansion and intend to maintain investment in telephones at the highest level possible.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of last year <Col N="1774" /> schemes have been completed in Dublin, Fermoy, Clonmel, Cavan and elsewhere to improve the system. Some 60 new exchange buildings have been erected, more than 200 exchanges have been extended, 10 major trunk schemes were completed and some 4,000 trunk circuits between the principal exchanges were provided.  A further heavy programme will be completed in the coming year, including 40,000 telephone connections.</P>

    <P>I should now like to turn from domestic to foreign affairs and to refer to the marked expansion of our role and influence in the international scene. On 1st January last, Ireland assumed responsibility for the Presidency both of the Council of the European Communities and of European Political Co-operation. The six-month period of our Presidency underlined the greatly expanded role which we have come to play in international affairs as a direct result of Community membership.</P>
    <P>In the Community's external relations the Irish Presidency played a leading role in bringing to a successful conclusion the negotiations with the African, Carribean and Pacific countries which culminated in the Lomé Convention on trade and development co-operation.  The success achieved in advancing the difficult negotiations in the context of the Euro-Arab dialogue marked the beginning of a new step forward in relations between Europe and the Arab world.  The Irish Presidency played a key role in ensuring that the outcome of the first preparatory meeting for the Conference on International Economic Co-operation would be such as to leave open the <Col N="1775" /> possibility of maximising further opportunities to get this conference off the ground.  It contributed also to the successful completion of the renegotiation of the UK membership of the Community, the Community's response to developments in Portugal and the significant improvement in relations between the Community and the United States.</P>
    <P>In order to provide the necessary basis of information and contacts, essential for a more active foreign policy, the Government have greatly extended the range of our diplomatic relations.  The extension of our role has also involved a marked increase in the number and intensity of contacts at Head of Government level. During the past year or so, I have had discussions in Dublin with the Prime Ministers of Britain, France, Belgium, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in addition, of course, to hosting the European Council meeting here last March.  I again met my Community colleagues in the further European Council meetings in Brussels in July and in Rome earlier this month.  I also travelled to Helsinki for the conclusion of the second stage of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and while there, I had useful talks with the Prime Ministers of Finland, Austria, Norway and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>I now propose to refer to important developments in the major sectors of the economy over the past year.</P>
    <P>Agriculture continues to play a vital role in the national economy and has stood us in good stead this year.  Of the increase of £203 million in total exports in the first nine months of 1975, nearly £140 million was due to increased agricultural exports.  The Government are fully conscious of the enormous potential for further development that lies in our agriculture, having regard to the many advantages we enjoy.  This was a point made last week by the leaders of the two major organisations representing farmers.  While the main lines of agricultural policy are now determined in Brussels, this Government aim to <Col N="1776" /> give every encouragement to farmers to increase their production.  On this subject, I should like to say a few words about the package of measures aimed at improving farm structures in the Community.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, these measures aim to create viable farm units, that is, those capable of giving the occupants a fair income and reasonable working conditions.  There should be no dispute about these aims or the need for structural improvement in Irish agriculture. This policy is not seeking to push people off the land.  The whole policy involves absolutely voluntary options&mdash;generous incentives to develop the farm, the chance to retire from farming in reasonable security, the opportunity for further education in farming or retraining for another job.</P>
    <P>It needs to be stressed again that under the farm modernisation scheme aids for all farmers are more generous than they were before implementation of the directive.  It has been suggested that the directive is unsuited to Irish conditions.  Much of this criticism seems to be based on a view which would condemn farmers to a standard of income and of living that they would not accept, as has been clearly shown in the past.  Our attitude to improvements of the directive has been to implement it first and then to base our case for modifications on direct experience.  We are now discussing a number of features, including comparable income, with the EEC Commission.</P>
    <P>In the area of responsibility of the Minister for Lands, the farmers' retirement scheme has now been in operation for some 18 months and the response indicated that it has made a decided impact, with more than 1,400 applications for participation received to date.  At this point 600 applicants have been adjudged eligible to participate.</P>
    <P>In relation to farm structure, I may mention that the recruitment of Land Commission inspectors, which was suspended in 1970, was resumed last year and a substantial number of new inspectors have been appointed.  This strengthening of the inspectorate will <Col N="1777" /> bring solid results in the current year's Land Commission programme.  Apart from the area acquired by way of exchange, it is expected that direct intake of land in 1975 will be of the order of 20,000 acres.  A dynamic drive has been initiated to dispose of acquired land and it is anticipated that allotments in the year will amount to some 35,000 acres.</P>
    <P>I set out the position in relation to the EEC stocktaking of the CAP in my recent statement to the House on the Rome meeting of the European Council and I will not go over the same ground now except to say that the fundamental principles of the policy, so vital an interest for this country, have been safeguarded.  Since then, the Commission's price and other proposals for the coming year have been published.</P>
    <P>It is worth underlining that since joining the EEC, farm prices have increased substantially&mdash;milk prices by over 80 per cent, cattle by over 25 per cent compared with autumn 1973, and by 70 per cent compared with autumn 1974, pigs by over 90 per cent, cereals by about 100 per cent and sugarbeet by over 120 per cent.</P>
    <P>The setback in farm income last year was only a temporary one and farm income is expected to increase substantially in 1975.  Prices for cattle, in particular, have been satisfactory in recent months, even exceeding prices last spring in a reversal of the normal seasonal pattern.  I would urge farmers to avail of the opportunities now open to them, especially in the milk and beef sectors and to expand their output further.  I can assure them that they will continue to have full Government backing to this end.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the Government's support of the building industry. In the sphere of manufacturing industry, the promotion campaign of the Industrial Development Authority continues to be successful.  The job potential of new projects approved this year will be about 17,000 and the total investment involved will amount to about £320 million.  This is somewhat below the average achievement in 1973 <Col N="1778" /> and 1974 but it is nevertheless a notable achievement considering the adverse investment climate which has prevailed over the last 18 months.  The firms secured have included some of the finest overseas industries in terms of job potential, growth prospects and level of technology.  Examples are Burlington Industries Inc., the largest textile group in the world, which is setting up a modern synthetic fabric-weaving plant in Tralee; the GAF Corporation which is to establish a European manufacturing base in Mullingar; and Fieldcrest Mills Incorporated which is building its first plant outside the USA in Kilkenny, an integrated operation going from raw cotton to the final production of high quality terry towels.</P>
    <P>Another encouraging feature of the 1975 performance, despite the recession, is the remarkable level of industrial investment by existing domestic industry.  In the first eight months of this year the IDA have approved proposals from domestic industry involving a total fixed asset investment of £127 million and a job potential of 5,500.  These figures compare with £50 million and 3,700 for the corresponding period of last year.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has also been made on measures to ensure the optimum development of our natural resources.  Satisfactory agreements were recently concluded by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with private mining interests for the exploitation of the Navan lead/zinc ore body and the question of maximising the amount of processing of the ores in question in this country, whether by smelting or other activities, is being methodically pursued.</P>
    <P>I would also refer, to the steps which are being taken by the same Minister to ensure that a wide-ranging and substantial exploration of our offshore areas is commenced next year and continued over the next few years.  Negotiations on the conclusion of licensing agreements with many of the major international oil companies are now at an advanced stage and the successful conclusion of these discussions would hold out prospects of our being able to achieve economic <Col N="1779" /> and social progress on a scale not hitherto conceivable.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we are facing a period unique in our history.  For the first time for more than 100 years our population is rising substantially and consistently.  Emigration has ceased&mdash; if not gone into reverse.  There are more young people seeking jobs.  At the same time, the structural change in our society&mdash;from a community based largely on agriculture to one based on industry and services&mdash;is continuing.  At the best of times, changes of such a character and magnitude would impose a strain on Government and on society.  At present, when the world is in recession, the stress is all the greater&mdash;and is likely to become more so as the problems I mention develop.  For this reason particularly, it is desirable that we should be able to see, with reasonable clarity, the place of this country in the world and the relationship between public and private expenditure and between what the Government should do and what private initiative and effort should do.  All of these considerations require that we should, now that there is some better prospect of stability than in the recent past, set about the preparation of a plan to ensure opportunities for employment in our society, and economic growth, with stability in prices.  The preparation of such a plan is in hands.</P>
    <P>However, I am not so naïve as to expect that any plan, in itself, can produce the sort of results we need. For this, action which is logical and persistent in the pursuit of a settled objective is necessary.  In this area we need a great sense of national discipline and realism.  At present, we see three main areas for this action.</P>
    <P>The first is the European Economic Community of 260 million people in which this country voted overwhelmingly for membership, and on which much of the future of agriculture, industry and investment in this country now depends.  In our dealings with the Community over the past year we have had what I think we can call, with justification, a measure of success. Our presidency passed with praise on all sides for organisation <Col N="1780" /> and was important in the substance of the work done during its currency. Britain, our neighbour, both our major supplier and market, decided as a result of the work culminating in the Dublin Summit last March to remain in the Community.  In the European Council meetings in Brussels and Rome and in the many other ministerial and official level meetings where the work of the Community goes on day after day and week after week we have, at the least, held our own.  If there is a criticism to be made, it is that the impetus of the Community towards the ideal of economic and monetary union has over recent years weakened.  The Community has expressed the ideal and set itself up to achieve it: but refuses the means or, indeed, the interest to attain it.</P>
    <P>The second area of vital concern to us is Northern Ireland.  I have said enough here today and elsewhere to establish clearly the Government's views on this.  What I have said can be summarised simply: we must show for the opinion of others the tolerance we would expect for ourselves; and we must never let any part of our country be a refuge for the men of violence whose actions have disgraced the name of Irishman.  Our aspirations remain, but so does our realism.  Our fundamental wish is to see a just and lasting peace in all parts of Ireland. We know that this can be established only with consent both of the majority and the minority in Northern Ireland. We will give every help we can to the achievement of this objective.</P>
    <P>In both the European Community and Northern Ireland events outside the control of the Government and people here will to a considerable extent determine the future.  In relation to our economy our future will be determined by what we do.  We are now to a greater extent than at any time in recent years arbiters of our own destiny.  World prices are no longer the main determinants of the rate of our inflation.  The price of materials from abroad is no longer the sole, or even the major, cause of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason that the Government <Col N="1781" /> recently asked for a pause in all incomes in 1976, after the end of the present wage round.  This pause could ensure work for those without it and that many persons now in employment will be able to continue in their jobs.  That is the prime objective of this approach to the social partners, to maintain jobs where they exist and to provide jobs where they do not exist.  In order to do that we sought a pay pause so that those who are in secure jobs could recognise the obligation of the community as a whole to provide jobs for those without them and to make certain that those within them would retain them. We have many advantages in the modern technologically advanced industries which have been established in recent years, largely with export markets in mind, in our agriculture, service industries and mineral wealth and, above all, in the enterprise and intelligence of our people.  I believe that this is our greatest natural asset. I believe, therefore, it is essential to repeat that in present circumstances we need a sense of national discipline, a sense of discipline coupled with realism, the realism that if we are prepared to face the challenge we have the ability and the capacity and if we show that sense of national discipline and realism we can surmount and overcome these difficulties.</P>
    <P>If we have the sense to develop the potential of these resources, the future will be bright.  But we must earn this future by, at the least, some forbearance, before we can enjoy it.  It is with these objectives in mind that we put these facts clearly before the social partners from whom we expect a response in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate is taking place at a time when our country is in the throes of the worst economic depression that it has experienced for over 40 years.  I hope to demonstrate during my remarks that this depression and the cause of it can be laid largely at the door of this Coalition Government because of its ineptitude and its mismanagement of the country's economic and financial affairs.  The Taoiseach's account today of the state of the economy is at least <Col N="1782" /> as dismal&mdash;and that says a lot&mdash;as his account in his television and radio address to the nation last week.  His prognosis as to future developments seems to be just as hopeless as it was in his address last week and his proposals to tackle and overcome our problems seem to be as inept and empty of content and the imagination that any government would be expected to have.</P>
      <P>This is not a new situation.  This situation in which we now find ourselves has been building up now for over two years, long before the oil crisis.  Indeed, we pointed out even before the oil crisis that Coalition budgetary policy was leading to a situation such as we have now.  It was fuelling the inflation trends that had set in some years ago.  I can refer to speeches made by our spokesman on Finance on the budget of 1974 and on the budgets of 1975.  On the budget of 1974 he said&mdash;I quote from the Official Report of 3rd April, 1974, column 1492:</P>
      <P>This budget should have been modestly expansionist, as I indicated. I would have thought, taking the best view of the situation, a deficit of £20 million to £25 million would have been tolerable as allowing for growth related to the capacity we have for growth in this coming year and still not lead us further into inflation.  Instead of that we have had this unbelievably irresponsible Budget Statement by the Minister, backed by every member of the Government, of a £76 million deficit in circumstances in which no reputable economist could possibly justify such a deficit.</P>
      <P>If we had such modest deficits now, how much better off we would be, instead of a deficit of almost five times as much in the outcome of the current year.</P>
      <P>These comments by our spokesman on Finance and, indeed, by several members of the Fianna Fáil Party at that time clearly indicated to the Government, if they needed any assistance, where their policies were bringing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This third Coalition Government <Col N="1783" /> started as its two predecesors had done on the basis of a sound economy, State finances carefully nurtured, books balanced, employment rising and emigration stopped, as it was on this occasion, but even before the oil crisis this Government started to complain that their hands were tied, their room for manoeuvre was limited because of the impact of outside forces on our economy.  Indeed, they complained that these outside forces were totally responsible for the price rises that we had suffered, for the decline in our economy, for the decline in employment. Even with the Central Bank's admonition to them at the time that 50 per cent or more of our economic difficulties were within the power and control of the Government themselves, they still continued to deny that the result of our economic decline then and our serious decline at present was due to their own mismanagement. As a result of the ineptitude of the Government's handling of this situation in the past year, we have come to the stage of inordinate spending and borrowing to the point that we are at least twice as badly off now as we would have been if the Government had tackled the problems in a sensible, realistic and responsible way.</P>
    <P>During the past year we have witnessed not just the total collapse of the Government's economic policy&mdash; and one might question here whether they had any policy in this respect &mdash;but also the total collapse of Government policy right across the board.  The position now is that, in terms of unemployment and in terms of failure of national growth, we are at least twice as badly off as any of our fellow members of the EEC, and in terms of borrowing we are three or four times worse off than any of these European countries.</P>
    <P>Before I refer to any of these things in detail I should like to pose this question.  Have the Government any coherent policy in any single field of administration?  This brings me in particular to refer to the singular lack of policy in relation to Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach at least broke <Col N="1784" /> his long silence in his one-hour speech today by devoting a few minutes to that topic, as we would expect him to do.  Here again we have not the slightest indication of any Government initiative, ideas or thinking to bring forward this situation in Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach emphasised again the low profile and, indeed, used these very words.  It seems at this stage that the attitude or the policy or the prejudice, whichever one would like to call it, of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in relation to the North of Ireland has permeated the entire membership of this Government, the attitude that we must all stay quiet, that we must see nothing, do nothing and say nothing, and, unfortunately, the Government seem to be unable to break out of the shackles of the limitations of policy, if policy one can call it, imposed upon them by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and to a lesser extent by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>When the Northern troubles broke out in 1968 or more particularly in 1969, the then Fianna Fáil Government emphasised the quadripartite theme, emphasised that there were four necessary elements in bringing about any solution in the Northern Ireland question: the two communities in the North and the two sovereign Governments of Dublin and of Westminster.  We fought hard and long within the portals of 10 Downing Street and Chequers to establish that fact and to establish our right to be involved in whatever developments were taking place in the North of Ireland.  We felt strongly then that each element, and particularly the two sovereign Governments had a major role, and we believed that no real progress could be made unless and until each of these parties recognised what their roles were.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this is what the Taoiseach and his Ministers now responsible for Northern Ireland policy, if such exists, seem to ignore.  On the contrary, they are walking away completely from the Northern Ireland problem, and I suggest that if this attitude persists, then they can only open the door wider and wider to increasing <Col N="1785" /> violence.  There is no use talking about using peaceful means towards a solution of the Northern Ireland problem when, in fact, no menas at all are being used in this respect.</P>
    <P>I believe and my party believe that it would deny all previous Irish history if the Irish Government pretended that they, the sovereign Government of Ireland, had no positive role in this crucial political problem.  It is not enough to say we are spending so much money on maintaining law and order. As I said in the course of another debate here recently, law and order is no substitute for Northern Ireland policy.  We on this side of the House denounce the IRA in everything they do.  We denounce them as the real enemies of the Irish people.  Here I can fully agree with the Taoiseach that their activities over the past few years have caused much of the economic hardship from which our people suffer at present, setting back the expansion of our tourist industry and deliberately and positively creating unemployment in many other spheres.  It was salutary to hear a person now under charges before the courts say that, with a single bullet, he could have set back the Irish industrial programme by eight years.  If that is the mentality of his current colleagues, or his former colleagues, whichever branch he belongs to, it is a fair indication of the real concern these people have for their country's progress.  I denounce them in everything they do.  Again I refer to them as the real enemies of our country.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the role of this Government.  I have said it would deny all history to pretend that our sovereign Government has no role in Northern Ireland affairs.  I want to say the same with regard to the British Government.  When the Northern Ireland Convention was in progress, and especially in the concluding weeks, there was every justification for the Government and, indeed, for other people in this part of the country, political parties and others&mdash;I refer in particular to responsible people&mdash;not to refer in any detail to what was happening in Northern Ireland and not to <Col N="1786" /> make prognoses of what was likely to happen.</P>
    <P>When the Convention was over, when it had failed in its purpose, when its statutory life had ended, then was the time for this Government to give some indication as to what their forward thinking was and to convey to the British Government what more should be done in their opinion.  Our Government remained silent.  It was in that vacuum, in that void, that we in Fianna Fáil spoke up.  The more people who have been reflecting on the Fianna Fáil statement made at the end of October or early November of this year, the more support it is gaining throughout the country.</P>
    <P>People realise that it represents forward thinking, that it was a realistic statement, and one to which all Irishmen who want a peaceful solution of our problems, could subscribe.  All Irishmen who want to reunite the Irish people North and South in harmony and in peace, and in co-operation with our neighbours on the other island, realise that this is the only means by which this can be brought about.</P>
    <P>I will not refer further to the Northern Ireland problem.  I will come back to the economic situation as, unfortunately, we now have it.  The position now is that in terms of borrowing, in terms of employment, in terms of the lack of national growth, we are, as I said, twice as badly off as any other EEC country.  We have failed to take full advantage of our membership of the EEC to improve our economic position.  The Government have failed completely to use the regional fund in any way to further North-South co-operation.  Not in one single instance have we heard of any programme, as proposed by this party, to engender economic co-operation in cross-Border projects.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance refers vaguely to our plans being more advanced than those of any other member of the Community.  If they are, it is about time we heard of them. It is about time the people in the North and the South heard in what respects they can jointly co-operate <Col N="1787" /> for the better advancement of each community North and South of the Border.  It is no wonder we are making little progress in taking full advantage of our membership of the EEC when Ministers talk about our membership and the value of it in diverse tongues.  Some months ago we had the spectacle of the Minister for Industry and Commerce openly denouncing the EEC as a means of making economic and political progress in Europe and, at the same time, other Ministers were loud in their praise and praising without question the EEC and all it stands for.</P>
    <P>We all acknowledge, as the Taoiseach pointed out, that Ireland's handling of the EEC presidency in the first half of this year deserves praise as an administrative exercise, but we must not become confused as to the real issues.  Administration is not policy. The issues involved are whether or not the Coalition are adequately serving or furthering Irish interests in Brussels.  The only conclusion one can reach is that they are not.  Once again I should like to say that they are not using enough muscle in their consultations and discussions in the European Economic Community in several respects.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is reported as having spoken crossly today because of the proposed changes in the common agricultural policy, but there were many other areas in which he should have spoken forcefully.  I refer to the lack of any policy on sheep in which he could have served better the interests of our country.  However, I will not dwell on that because our spokesman on agriculture will have a lot more to say with much more knowledge and authority than I.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask what has become of the Government's commitment to a social policy?  There seems to be a total lack of any policy on education. Here, again, I deliberately accuse this Government of reversing the progressive trend in education Fianna Fáil had carefully nurtured and built up over the years, starting with the improvement in teaching quality in primary schools, reducing the pupil/teacher ratio, <Col N="1788" /> making it easier for the children of poor parents and people living in remote areas to acquire secondary education, and providing adequate grants for higher education.  Almost in every sphere, contrary to what the Taoiseach said today, there has been a reverse; there has been retrogression; and worse still, in every sphere, and more particularly in the field of secondary and higher education, there has been confusion because of lack of policy by the Minister for Education or, as he pretends, his lack of ability to convince his colleagues in the Government that they have not been paying sufficient attention to improvements in the educational field.</P>
    <P>On housing, the Taoiseach referred to the achievements of this Coalition Government.  It is fair to say there have been improvements in housing output over the past three years.  It is rather naïve for the Minister for Local Government, or any member of the Government for that matter, to claim credit for the fact that in 1973 and 1974 more than 25,000 houses were built.  If we look at what the normal cycle in house building is, in building either local authority houses or SDA houses, it is easy to see that at least three years will elapse before the necessary planning has been organised, finances arranged, land acquired, houses started and ultimately finished. For the Minister to claim credit for 25,000 housing output in 1973 as being his performance is completely unwarranted, unfounded, and I might say dishonourable&mdash;certainly most misleading. We undertook in our housing programme, published in the late 'sixties and early 'seventies, that by 1972-73 we would have reached 25,000 houses output, which was reached.  There was no necessity whatever for a crash programme as the Minister for Local Government announced.  What has gone wrong is that there are too many local authority houses being built as against houses owned by the people which is what most Irish people aspire to.  Local authorities are becoming, and have been for many years, the biggest landlords in the country.</P>
    <P>That is not a very desirable trend, <Col N="1789" /> especially when there is the ideal of self-sufficiency and independence so strong in the Irish character.  That ideal is being depressed by this Government having failed to provide adequate grants for young people seeking houses for the first time.  They are inevitably driven back to the local authorities, even against their will in many cases, to give them reasonable shelter in their early married years.  It is a wrong trend, it should be discouraged and it is one that this Government are deliberately responsible for by their failure to increase to a realistic level grants for house building and loans available from local authorities for a similar purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to know, still on the social side, what has become of Government policy in relation to women's rights?  Following the publication of the report of the commission on women's rights members of the Government gave a series of performances of lip service to the Government's intention to implement that report.  This was followed by the usual facade of Coalition committees, setting up committees to deal with this and that but so far we have seen no practical results of the report of the commission that was set up by my colleague, Deputy Haughey, when he was Minister for Finance and which reported a couple of weeks before the Coalition took over.</P>
    <P>There was a recommendation about equal pay.  The Government with a great flourish, produced a Bill, an Anti-Discrimination Pay Bill, to give it its most dramatic possible title, one which we questioned at the time.  We now find that the Minister has already started on the first steps at whittling away the effects of that legislation.  We realised at the time, in the climate obtaining, in the financial circumstances and the economic conditions obtaining, it was unlikely that the Minister for Labour could have implemented his equal pay Bill by 1st January.  He went ahead, because he felt it was great newspaper copy.  Indeed it was at the time and now he, like other members of the Government in many other respects, has to eat humble pie because their <Col N="1790" /> targets are unattainable.  They must have known in their hearts at the time that many of them would be unattainable. This equal pay Bill will be a dead letter and we can reasonably anticipate there will be further limitations of its effect in the months to come.</P>
    <P>What about a code of family law? Fianna Fáil, when we got that report, immediately published a document, the terms of which we will implement when we get back to office, to ensure an adequate code of family law, a cheap and understandable code, one that can be made effective, to consider and decide on family disputes, estrangements, maintenance matters, custody of children and so on, in a simple procedure before a simple court but with High Court jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Why are the Government not proceeding with any proposals or any legislation along those lines, especially having regard to their much proclaimed commitment to women's rights?  I went through all the spheres of Government activity and there seems to be a total failure to link one part of Government activity and one part of Government policy with the others.  The only sphere of advance in the social field may be that in social welfare benefits.  We know that it was because there was £30 million a year saving from the agricultural subsidies, which would otherwise have to be paid if it were not for our membership of the EEC, that made those improvements possible.</P>
    <P>Even those improvements, made largely on the savings of our agricultural subsidies, are now being paid on borrowed money.  For every £4 paid out in social welfare at least £1 of that is from borrowed money.  Fianna Fáil's commitment to social welfare over the years is unquestioned and unquestionable. Indeed, right up to the present the whole social legislation code was a feature of Fianna Fáil but we based every aspect of it, every line of it, on economic well-being.  We knew that unless we had the economic foundation it would be impossible to maintain social improvements on any basis.</P>
    <P>This Government must have known <Col N="1791" /> that and they must know the dangerous grounds on which we now stand as far as continuing our social programme is concerned.  It is hard to blame Deputy Cluskey, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, for pressing on with his proposals.  He did not realise, nor did he know, because he was not a member of the Cabinet, that much of the money he was providing had to be borrowed and that there was no solid foundation on which he could make social welfare improvements stick.  That is the weakness of our position in this respect.  Therefore, the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare have a lot to answer for if there is any weakening in the structure of our social code.</P>
    <P>What about our economic failure? I want to refer at this stage to the frightening scale of borrowing and spending by the Government.  In his abject confession of the failure of the Government's economic policy last week, and reiterated today, the Taoiseach admitted that we will have borrowed about £700 million in 1975.  I believe the total will be nearer to £750 million when the sums are made up. What have we to show for it?  At the moment we are paying something like £234 million in interest.  I do not know what that represents in taxation but when you add to it the colossal deficit we have incurred this year, which I will refer to in some detail in a minute, we can see exactly where taxation is going on expenditure that serves no purpose whatever for any economic or other progress in the country.</P>
    <P>In the budget of January, 1975 the anticipated deficit was at £125 million and the year's borrowing at £530 million.  These were frightening figures in themselves at that time.  If they still obtained they would be frightening figures at the present time.  In the event these estimates had to be increased considerably in the June budget.  Now, in the ultimate event, we find a deficit of £280 million and the total borrowing, as I said, will have reached about £750 million.  The estimation by the Minister for Finance so far seems to have been so grossly out of touch with the facts that even these figures may have to be <Col N="1792" /> increased before the year's end.  So out of touch has the Minister been that, having announced an expected growth rate of some 3 per cent this year the likely turn-out now will be a minus rate of 3 per cent, therefore, a total reduction in target of 6 per cent.  Of course, this has been caused mainly by increased unemployment and this in turn further affects Exchequer returns.</P>
    <P>If one takes the normal tax at one-third of income there could be a loss of about £60 million to £65 million this year.  Secondly, unemployment having turned out far worse than was budgeted for, there could be even £5 million to £10 million payable in funding unemployment, social welfare and other benefits.  Then came the policy of shift in June when subsidies were introduced in the budget of that month.  These subsidies cost about £50 million this year and possibly would cost £65 to £70 million in a full year.  All these factors to which I have referred, factors of miscalculation or sudden change in policy, resulted in expenditure being much higher and revenue much lower than was anticipated.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, of failing&mdash;I shall not say deliberately but negligently&mdash;to assess the situation much more closely and accurately. This dismal outcome has contributed to and, I suppose, has been aggravated by the fact that there was no real improvement in our inflation rate.  Therefore, in the result and in the spending spree they have been responsible for, this Government are by far the greatest offender and, therefore, the greatest contributor to the inflation that now obtains.  I suggest that if any business company acted in the manner in which the Government have been acting, over the past 12 months in particular, the directors at their next annual meeting would sack the lot of them and sink them without trace.  Unfortunately, the directors of our business will not get that opportunity as far as I can see for some months yet when the situation will have deteriorated to such an extent that whoever will succeed as the next government&mdash;I <Col N="1793" /> know it can only be Fianna Fáil&mdash;will face a more herculean task than faced the incoming governments after the demise of the previous two coalitions. This Government can truly be described as the last of the big spenders.  If I could contrive a saying in the manner of Churchill I would say: Never before was so much spent by so few on so little.  I do not know how near that is to the original but it seems to sum up the situation.</P>
    <P>I think that no government in the western world have borrowed on anything like the scale that this Government have borrowed.  The standard alibi has been that all the other governments are in the same situation, that they have all had to borrow to create employment and improve output. Our borrowing is three to four times greater than any of the other EEC countries.  Even if we had got benefits from it, it might be justified but what benefits did we get?  Our unemployment figures are higher&mdash; roughly double those in all other EEC countries.  Our rate at present is almost 10 per cent&mdash;9.3 per cent&mdash; whereas a typical rise in unemployment in the other EEC countries is half that, 4 to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce frequently tries to draw consolation from the fact that the figure in Denmark is worse than ours but he knows that the Danish figure of something over 10 per cent in unemployment is not comparable with ours in any respect.  The Danish figure of 12 per cent is 12 per cent of the industrial workers and industrial workers represent only one-third of the total number of people in employment in Denmark. Our figure of 9 or 10 per cent on the unemployment register or 109,000 out of 1,100,000 people represents the number unemployed across the board generally, including small farmers.  If our method of calculation were applied to the Danish figure our rate would be 25 per cent.  There is not much point in the Minister for Industry and Commerce trying to draw consolation from the Danish figure as he has done when he alleges the Danish people are worse off.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder that our people are <Col N="1794" /> shocked to the point of disbelief.  One can fairly ask: can they be shocked any more?  They have been literally reeling under a succession of price increases for the past 12 months and longer and many of these increases&mdash;I need only refer to the petrol increase over a year ago, and the post office and ESB increases&mdash;were directly the responsibility of the Government.  They have seen the Government deficit escalating from £240 million in June to £280 million within six months.  The Government might say: What is £40 million in the overall context of our spending?  I should like to give a practical illustration of what that £40 million could mean to the Irish people.</P>
    <P>At present the people are reeling again under the shock of rate increases. During the last election campaign we put forward a plan whereby homes would be relieved entirely from rates. We were not believed because&mdash;perhaps to some extent it was our own fault&mdash;it came late in the day.  The Coalition had produced their plan of relieving local authorities in respect of house building and health charges on the rates.  As a government, we had been considering the possibility of relieving homes from rates.  Our thinking had not completely matured at the time of the general election but it was only natural that when we saw the Coalition producing what we regarded as a half-baked plan we should bring forward our thinking on this matter. And we did and during the election campaign we produced our plan to relieve homes from rates.  We costed that at the time at about £30 million; it would probably be somewhere between £40 and £50 million at present; we can cost it very closely.  This is a firm commitment; there will be no doubt whatever about it that when we get back to power we can do it. That £40 million of increased deficit would almost pay entirely for the relieving of homes from rates under the Fianna Fáil plan but this Government can dismiss it with a snap of the fingers as being of no consequence, a slight miscalculation as between £240 million and £280 million deficit.</P>
    <P>I have been talking about budget deficits and inordinate borrowing.  It <Col N="1795" /> may be that even though the people are deeply concerned about it they may not see the effects of it in the short term.  Probably they will not see them for a long time yet but they know that sooner or later they, the people will have to pay for all this expenditure, all this profligate Government activity, in terms of increased taxation, reduced living standards and reduced employment.  We see the unemployment figures escalating again to 109,000 on the register at the present time.  The prognosis is that it will go up to 120,000 or, perhaps, 140,000 during the course of the year.  Here I want to refer specifically to areas where the Government could have helped in this situation.  In the past number of months industries in and around Cork, which I know well, have been closing down without any attempt whatever on the part of the Government to help them.  They are traditional industries like Mahony's of Blarney and St. Patrick's Woollen Mills of Douglas.  There has been a reduction in Irish Steel of about 30 per cent of their work force.  In each of these, and particularly in the latter, the Government had responsibility to ensure that employment would be maintained.  Only yesterday we had the sad story of another industry, the Cork Shoe Company Limited, closing down and 200 more people being thrown out of work.  That industry is being closed because it owes its two debenture holders, the Bank of Ireland and Fóir Teoranta, something like £300,000.  Side by side with that, we have the account of the British Government pouring £162 million into the Chrysler Corporation of Britain in order to maintain employment. This Government have the power and the capacity to ensure that this viable industry, and it has been proved to be viable since it went into receivership, can be maintained and can endure.  It was, perhaps, understandable that both debenture holders would put it into receivership but it has been demonstrated since then that the company can make profit and was, in fact, making profit and suddenly the industry is being closed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour is here <Col N="1796" /> now and I would like him to address himself to this subject because apparently he will speak next.  I would like him to tell us whether he or his Government have any plans to maintain that industry.  I am sure the Bank of Ireland are not looking for their pound of flesh and Fóir Teoranta are a Government agency, under Government control, and they would obviously conform to a Government directive or even Government wishes in this respect.  If this industry closes down and if those 200 people are to be thrown on the unemployment register to add to the 110,000 that are there already, then responsibility for it must rest fairly and squarely at the door of this Government because they can do something about it.  They have the capacity and it is time they woke up to these things.  Is it a fact that, like the public reeling from price increases and economic shocks, the Government have so many problems on their plate they cannot cope with any one of them?  Are they like a demented housewife, with a houseful of kids, running from one chore to another and not fully accomplishing any particular task?  If they are, it is their own fault and that is why we find ourselves in this position at present.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should apologise for speaking on local matters but before I leave local matters may I ask the Taoiseach whether the promise he made in Cork during his well-publicised trip in the L.E.  <i>Deirare</i> about Government backing for the Cork Harbour plan is to be honoured? If it is, it is time it was honoured and it is time that the amount of Government commitment was spelled out because here, again, by reason of Government inactivity and Government ineptitude, job opportunities are being lost weekly and monthly in that area and work that will have to be done ultimately will be done but at a far greater cost than it could have been done if the Government had, over the past 12 months or so, given their sanction and made the necessary finances available for the furtherance of that scheme.</P>
    <P>Where have all our borrowings <Col N="1797" /> gone anyway?  No government in Western Europe have been so abjectly negligent in handling their nation's affairs as this Government have. Certainly no western government have ever borrowed at the same rate. I would like to give a few examples. Germany borrowed 5 per cent of their GNP, the US, 5 to 6 per cent, Italy, 7 to 8 per cent.  The United Kingdom, which some members of our Government say are in an even worse plight than we are, borrowed only 8 per cent which they regarded as a massive amount, notwithstanding the fact that they are engaged in a programme of social reform at present.  Compare these with the 20 per cent of GNP which has been borrowed by our Government this year and the 23 or 24 per cent of GNP which it is proposed to borrow next year.  How can we sustain a rate of borrowing like this?  The Minister may suggest that I have quoted only the larger countries but may I point to the situation in smaller countries which would be more akin to our own?  Belgium borrowed 3 per cent of their GNP, Denmark as low as 1 per cent, and Holland, 3 to 4 per cent.  Will the money we have borrowed reflect itself in more employment, in more output, in higher GNP, in better standards of living?  I suggest it will not because the money has been spent and much of that money has been borrowed for running costs without any reasonable or real return to the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>Is it not obvious that on all fronts this Government have failed miserably? Is it not obvious that they have leaned too long on the excuse that outside influences were responsible for our economic recession and that other countries were as badly off if not worse.  We see now that other countries have overcome their problems at much less pain to themselves. They were countries whose governments acted in a responsible way.  We are twice as badly off as any one of them and in many cases three to four times as badly off.  When this Government first came into office the people were mildly excited about prospects and, indeed, people are entitled to be excited about things that are new. They were paraded as the Government <Col N="1798" /> of all the talents.</P>
    <P>At this time of year a child may get a box of chocolates with beautiful wrappings, lovely ribbons and a picture on the outside but when he opens it up, by the time he gets through all the wrapping he gets about one-tenth the number of chocolates the box appeared to contain. The Government are like that. They remind me of current soccer stars who are paid to score goals and, having scored a goal, run around the field with their hands up looking for the adulation of their supporters and then run back to their colleagues on the team and start kissing one another.  The few things that the Taoiseach could boast of here are the kinds of things they were paid to do, as a soccer player is paid to score goals, and without looking for adulation. The country is not in humour for giving them adulation at present.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that the Taoiseach gave no indication whatever of how we were going to get out of our present morass.  He spoke last week on the very day that this document&mdash;OECD Economic Surveys Ireland&mdash;was published.  He spoke almost exactly as the OECD document said he should have spoken.  That document was published on Wednesday morning last.  It was significant that the Taoiseach appeared on television and radio on Wednesday evening because, this document having been published, the sad facts could be hidden from the Irish people no longer. The only formula the Taoiseach proposed last Wednesday and again today was what he called a wage pause.</P>
    <P>The OECD Economic Survey to which I refer, on page 30, specifically tells the Irish Government what they should have done in this respect, and almost in exactly the same terms. They proposed that the situation should warrant consideration of a standstill on pay increases for a limited period.  This is what the Taoiseach did.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>However, if voluntary agreement cannot be quickly reached, resort to statutory controls may well need to be considered.</P>
    <P>It was clearly indicated that this consideration <Col N="1799" /> was being given to it in the Taoiseach's statement today where it was said that, if voluntary controls cannot be effected, apparently we are going to have statutory controls over workers' wages.  I would like the Minister for Labour to address himself to this fact when he stands on his feet.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister has not read the Taoiseach's statement. I shall read the relevant part for him:</P>
      <P>There are complexities in each of the areas of non-pay income, but it would be our aim to have a draft Bill ready as early as possible in 1976, and to have other necessary measures ready at or about the same time.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister would listen now, the Taoiseach continued:</P>
      <P>To ensure that the Bill and other measures are comprehensive and can be introduced at an early date, it would obviously be desirable that the Government should have an early indication of intentions in regard to pay.</P>
      <P>I wonder what are the other measures. Why the reference to intentions in regard to pay?  Is it not obvious that, having followed the advice of the OECD of encouraging a standstill in pay increases, the Government will, willy-nilly, follow the next part of the advice contained in the very next sentence of the OECD Report:</P>
      <P>...resort to statutory controls may well need to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1800" /> Is it not clear from the Taoiseach's statement and the OECD document to which I referred that this is exactly what the Government are contemplating? This is the kind of legislation over which the Minister for Labour will have to preside.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to this pay pause, or standstill as the OECD called it&mdash;a wage freeze as other people correctly refer to it&mdash;as the only indication of the Government's proposals to get us out of this unfortunate economic difficulty we are in at present.</P>
      <P>There is no plan whatever for the future, no indication as to what is going to happen.  The Taoiseach announced today that a plan of some sort is in course of preparation.  For almost three years now we have been encouraging the Government to put forward some plan but the Minister for Finance has said that, because of world unstable conditions it would not be meaningful to put forward a plan.  Having persisted in argument in this respect the Minister ultimately, some months ago, announced that he will have a plan by the end of the year.  Now the Taoiseach says they have begun to prepare a plan.  Therefore, it would seem to be the case that this plan will not be ready by the end of the year as the Minister for Finance promised.  In the meantime, how are we going to procure the 300,000 jobs over the next ten years, that is almost 30,000 jobs a year?  In fact the OECD Report refers specifically to some 28,000 new jobs.  The Taoiseach said, rather euphemistically, I suggest, today, that more young people are now looking for employment.  He said that in the context of his reference to the decline in emigration, as if it was the first time he knew it was happening.  Then he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, we are facing a <Col N="1801" /> period unique in our history.  For the first time for more than 100 years our population is rising substantially and consistently.</P>
    <P>I was under the impression that this had been happening for about 10 years.  At least the statistics I have been reading indicate that this has been going on for 10 years ever since the middle of the implementation of the Fianna Fáil Economic Programme. Certainly that has been happening. Then the Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>There are more young people seeking jobs.</P>
    <P>Indeed, we know that to our cost.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(Interruptions.)</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>But where are they going to get the jobs?  Thirty thousand new jobs are required each year to take account of these young people.  But there is no plan whatever.  Let me read from what the OECD Report says in this respect:</P>
      <P>A study of population and employment trends by the National Economic and Social Council suggests that between 1976 and 1981 some 12,000 young persons may enter the job market annually.</P>
      <P>Yes, indeed, more young people are seeking jobs, as the Taoiseach says. The Report continues to say:</P>
      <P>In addition, the Secretariat estimates that about 8,000 persons may move out of agriculture and 8,000 jobs may be lost in the traditional manufacturing industries.  Thus, unless the pattern of migration is reversed, a total of around 28,000 new jobs may need to be created each year (over and above the recovery of employment from the present recession), a figure substantially higher than what was achieved in the past when real GNP was rising at an average rate of about 4½ per cent.</P>

    <P>Let me remind the Taoiseach again that it dropped this year to minus 3 per cent, or 6 per cent less than was anticipated. In this context it is worth quoting again from the OECD Report, in contrast to what the Taoiseach said <Col N="1802" /> about foreign firms looking for opportunities here, where it says:</P>
    <P>Manufacturing investment is likely to remain depressed.  Substantial spare capacity, weak external demand and low profitability should inhibit recovery of investment in the traditional industries, while several planned industrial projects financed from abroad have been postponed.</P>
    <P>We will be lucky if we do not hear that more of them have been abandoned, as we well might in the near future.</P>
    <P>I opened with the words that the Taoiseach's picture today was at least as dismal as that he painted when he addressed the nation on television and radio last week.  There seems to be no future plan whatever, no reasonable hope that the Government have the will, capacity or resolution to get us out of this morass.  I know it is useless saying to them, in Heaven's name, to get out of the way and let somebody do it who can, because they have no intention, not for some months yet anyway.  But: please try to hold the situation as well as you can; do not let it get too much worse because it is bad enough now and will take all the resources of sound, progressive Government that Fianna Fáil would provide to get us out of this unfortunate economic dilemma and get the country moving again, as we did on two previous occasions when the situation was almost as bad.</P>

      <P>We have just heard the Leader of the Opposition.  An Adjournment Debate gives the opportunity to most people participating to raise any items they think of interest to their party or to the country at that time.  It was interesting to note that the Leader of the Opposition. Deputy J. Lynch, spent more time than is usual for him, in adjournment debates, talking about conditions in Cork.  Whether this anticipates a concentration of his political activities in the future in that area I leave to the House.</P>

      <P>The Government's borrowing record and budgetary policy over the past two years has been heavily criticised by the Opposition as being too large and something that should not have been undertaken.  Side by side with that criticism we have constant requests from the Opposition by way of Private Members' motions and otherwise for more expenditure. Deputy Lynch this morning wanted further assistance to be given to particular projects in his own constituency. There is this chronic contradiction in the criticisms by the Opposition of Government policies.  Deputy Colley has become noteworthy over the last year for a routine speech and different parts of it are released on different days.  We should increase expenditure, he tells us one day, and the next day he tells us we should cut taxation and, at the same time, reduce borrowing. Let me explain the reasons behind Government borrowing over the last year or two.</P>

      <P>The borrowing was required.  There is no way this community can avoid the obligation of paying for the extra impost caused by oils and raw materials.  All countries <Col N="1804" /> had to face these increased costs.  In our situation the choice before the Government, in so far as it lay within our power, was to maintain employment at the maximum despite these increased costs.  I think we were correct in our policy of maintaining public expenditure at the highest possible level to ensure employment did not fall catastrophically.</P>

      <P>I shall come to the general question of employment later, but, if it were not to be permitted to fall catastrophically, we had to continue deficit budgeting.  We did that knowing clearly what the dangers were in that policy and knowing also that it was necessary if we were to maintain the economy over this period of recession. The Opposition's criticism of this policy is to say, on the one hand, that we are not doing sufficient in terms of expenditure and, on the other hand, that we should be cutting taxation or reducing borrowing.  This is the kind of comment from the Opposition which will keep them over there in those benches for many years into the future.</P>
      <P>Whatever deficiencies there may be in this Government's handling of any particular issue that arises, the fact is the contrast before the people is glaring.  It is the contrast of Opposition speeches barren of any ideas, beating irrelevant drums, and their warning spokesmen and the Government's facing up to difficulties squarely which will keep the Opposition where they are for many years to come.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the economy, we are undoubtedly going through our worst recession but there are certain signs showing that, if we allow for the seasonal corrections, unemployment is, in fact, as the jargon has it, bottoming out and we are reaching the maximum levels of unemployment. Allowing for seasonal adjustments&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputies would permit me to develop my argument. I suggest we are coming out now from the lowest point of the recession and that will have certain consequences where employment is concerned. It will have the consequence of an improvement in our employment situation in the very near future, if the argument that we are near the bottom of the recession is correct.  The indications from the recent CII survey would suggest some recovery in production has occurred in the third quarter of this year and that we are at last seeing the end of the recession. If that survey is correct&mdash;we would of course, need further figures to show if it is correct&mdash;and we are reaching the end of the output recession it will, of course, take some time for this to register in an improvement in the employment situation.  We will need further information to see if these early signs of recovery in output are maintained into next year.  There will be a lag between an improvement in output and a consequent improvement in employment because employment always lags behind recovery.  In the early part of recession the fall in output does not lead immediately to a worsening of the unemployment situation. The situation is the contrary on the way out of a recession and there will inevitably be some time lag between the improvement in output recordings and an improvement in employment figures.  But at any rate it indicates the direction in which the economy is even at this stage going. The lag between output improvement and an improvement in employment figures is explained by the fact that during the latter months of this recession firms have been operating on their stocks.  When stocks are exhausted they will move into producing goods once more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not all gloom.  We are certainly seeing the worst recession but there are signs in impartial surveys that recovery is on the way.  There are signs of recovery in some of the major markets.  In the textile industry, an industry grievously hit in this country, there has been an improvement in the United States in the last quarter.  What we need in the coming year is a combination <Col N="1806" /> of consumer recovery and export recovery.  It is quite clear we cannot depend simply on one another and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will conclude this debate, will be giving details of the efforts being made to diversify our exports and ensure recovery next year in an export led recovery.</P>
    <P>The two-front strategy we require is a strategy based on exports and on demand in the home market.  That demand is not there at present, not strong enough anyway to induce general recovery right across the board of Irish industry.  That is clear in the light of the fate of my employment premium programme.  That was introduced with the object of getting 10,000 people back to work and I think Liam Connellan was right when, talking about the scheme recently, he said the biggest obstacle which prevented its being adopted by more employers was their feeling that demand was still insufficiently established to permit them to bring back workers even at a subsidy of £12 per head per week.  Admittedly, we have received up to 1st December applications from something like 164 employers in manufacturing industry involving something in the region of over 3,000 industrial workers.  The purpose of that scheme was to bring back workers who had been let go as a result of the present recession.  So far we have succeeded in bringing back more than 3,000 but that is still a long way off the target I set myself of returning 10,000 people to the work force.</P>
    <P>In an effort to ensure that the programme would be adopted, even in present conditions, by employers we have extended it to include the food processing industries previously excluded because of seasonal factors.  I learned from the officials involved in that section that there has been in the last few days a big increase in the number of inquiries from employers as to the advantages of that programme. The areas which have benefited for the most part have been the eastern and mid-western regions, the Dublin region, which has been heavily afflicted by unemployment, and the Limerick region. It appears that engineering has done best.  That would accord with what all <Col N="1807" /> the surveys said about the position of that industry at present.</P>
    <P>Our assessment of the situation is that there are signs of recovery but there is a necessity next year for voluntary agreements on all manner of incomes. This is what Deputy Lynch sought to interpret from the Taoiseach's speech in a different manner.  If agreement is reached on the pay front next year obviously it will also have to combine control of non-pay areas and we will have the legislation ready for control in that area.  Deputy Lynch made a strange interpretation of that speech in that he suggested the Taoiseach was advocating statutory controls in the incomes area this morning.  I understand that the spokesman for the Opposition harped back to the years past and I know that as the party who framed the Electricity (Special Provisions) Act, 1966, they cannot get away from that approach to industrial relations.  They still believe that one must lock one's opponent up in jail as happened in the course of the passage of that legislation. I understand their affection for such measures and I understand their incapacity to realise how a modern Government must operate in a democracy always with the free voluntary agreement of all the major economic powers. That is the path we intend to pursue next year.</P>
    <P>It came strangely from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition to talk about the absence of planning when one considers the fate of plans introduced by Fianna Fáil when in power at a time of boom in Western Europe.  Strange concoctions were produced by them as economic plans and they strayed from the reality of actual job creation.  It came strangely from the lips of the Leader of the Opposition to criticise the position of the Government battling against one of the worst recessions ever faced by the State.</P>

      <P>On the general industrial relations front we have had an improvement this year in that less man-days were lost in industry, more disputes were settled without recourse to the strike weapon and that is something to be thankful for.  In the coming year I plan to look once more at our industrial relations legislation. I intend appointing extra divisions to the Labour Court to enable the court to cope with an increasing work load. I have decided to appoint an additional Rights Commissioner and to update that service.  I am also concerned about the position of lower paid workers under the law.  Our main weapon for dealing with the situation is on the basis of joint labour committees.  Some time ago I decided that a joint labour committee was needed in the restaurant industry but that has not yet been established.  I believe I will have to amend legislation to ensure that I will have some initiating power in the matter of establishing extra joint labour committees where these are necessary, as in the restaurant area.  I am anxious to see such a committee established in the restaurant industry because I am convinced that there is quite an amount of low pay existing in such institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have initiated a vigorous policy, through our inspectorate, of prosecutions in many areas where the legal provisions of low pay were not being complied with.  Last year more employers than ever were prosecuted for failure to fulfil their legal obligations where payments were laid down by our laws.  It is my intention to maintain this policy because in general the stance of the Government is a reforming one.  We can continue to introduce reforming legislation despite the <Col N="1809" /> current recession.  Although the current recession may hold up plans in one area we can proceed in another area.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the position in relation to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974.  The Taoiseach referred to our intention to amend that Act.  In October I had a joint approach from companies in the footwear industry to postpone the implementation of equal pay in view of the critical position of that industry.  I passed on those joint representations to the Labour Court and yesterday, 16th December, I received a report from the Labour Court which stated that 700 jobs in the manufacturing area of the industry could be lost in 1976 and early 1977.  Despite the equal pay provisions of the national agreements of 1972 and 1974 little progress had been made towards equal pay in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another, the obstinacy of management or failure to concede the justice of these claims, provisions for advance towards equal pay in the agreements over those years resulted in little movement being made in the wage rates of women in industry, despite the profitability of many of the companies involved in those years.  The lack of progress over those relatively good years would convince anybody that legislation was necessary in that area to ensure that equal pay became a fact across Irish industry.  I can understand how people, especially those whom one is anxious to help, may be impatient of improvements when they come.</P>
    <P>I can understand how, when we introduced the equal pay legislation in 1973, many people criticised its provisions for what they thought to be a failing when compared to other such legislation, and especial comparison was made with the British Act.  I maintain now, as I maintained then, that the definition at the heart of our Bill made it a far superior instrument of equality than the British Act of 1970. My point is that in the years up to 1973 little progress was made in industry here.</P>
    <P>I do not mind certain organisations <Col N="1810" /> criticising what we do.  When I came into office I did not find any legislation prepared there despite the fact that the interim report of the Commission on the Status of Women as far back as 1971 had put forward recommendations and despite the fact that the Minister for Finance of the day, Deputy Colley, had declared it to be a national objective&mdash;despite these rhetorical statements from the Government of the day, when I came into office no legislation had been planned in this area.</P>
    <P>I can understand that when we produced our legislation some people tended to complain that it was not good enough.  I can understand the criticism, from the women's organisations, trade unions and others concerned with this area, but it is galling to receive condemnation from representatives, supporters, people in the press who are open supporters of the party now in Opposition, who when in power confined their interest in the advance of women in our society to commemoration Masses for Cumann na mBan.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear exactly what the position is in relation to amending legislation in this area. We have been given an impartial report that jobs are in danger if we proceed with that legislation.  Therefore, it is my intention that the amending legislation would be along the lines that where a company consider that they are unable to apply the terms of the Act and still remain viable and maintain employment, the employer would inform the trade union of the position and enter into negotiations.  If employers and unions negotiate a settlement which modifies the application of the terms of the Act, such settlement shall be certified by the parties and communicated to the Labour Court.  The terms of the negotiated settlement will then be examined by the Labour Court and, if the court are satisfied as to its authenticity, it shall be certified by the court.</P>
    <P>It is provisions such as these that I intend to incorporate in the amending legislation to protect employment in industry.  The Act will come into <Col N="1811" /> operation with these amendments.  As I have said, I do not accept criticism of our efforts in this direction unless it is made in good faith by representatives of the party who, as I said, did nothing when in power and who in Opposition have confined themselves to denunciation of genuine reform such as this Government have effected in this area.</P>
    <P>Next year, the Anti-Discrimination (Employment) Bill will be coming into operation on schedule.  It is true that recession interfered with all our reform plans, but there is quite an amount of reform that this Government can proceed with even in these circumstances.  I will next year proceed with the Young Persons (Protection of Employment) Bill, the anti-discrimination legislation&mdash;I would explain to Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, who has just come in, what our amendments in the area of equal pay will be concerned with.  I will proceed with the Unfair Dismissals Bill, with the Bill announced here this morning to even up the position of agricultural workers.  Deputy James Gibbons, a large farmer, sat on these benches for many years as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and ignored a situation where agricultural workers were differentiated against by comparison with industrial workers.</P>
    <P>Here this morning, in the midst of economic recession, we introduced a measure to correct that long standing injustice, and next year, with the help of God, I will bring in that extra legislation to ensure that agricultural workers will no longer be discriminated against in that way.  I hope that also next year I can proceed to implement worker participation in the State industries already selected.</P>

      <P>This year and last year we have been spending more money and training more people than ever before.  I propose to maintain this high performance.  We will be training more people next year because it is extremely important that we ensure our work force is as highly skilled as possible so that when recovery comes we will be in a position to avail of all opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1975 we trained 7,200 persons under the Training Authority compared with 4,500 in 1974, an increase of more than 50 per cent, and only physical capacity prevented us from ensuring the training of a larger number. The cost was £9 million in 1975, and I intend to ensure in our discussions at Government level that this investment will be continued next year.  As well, we will continue our attempts in Europe to ensure that the Social Fund will be adequate.  I know that some of the fatter Deputies behind Deputy Gibbons think that every visit to Brussels is some kind of <Col N="1814" /> compulsive escape from reality.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is aware of these meetings knows that they are long, difficult and tedious and that their outcome is very important in the context of our plans here at home.  I do not intend ever to miss a meeting in Brussels which could lead to improvements at home.  What happens in Europe nowadays is of as much importance as what we do here.  Therefore we must get away from the parochial type of approach, of regarding all Government activity in Brussels as an interruption of serious Government work and, instead, regard it as an integral part of any responsible Government's activity in building the kind of Europe that all of us, officially at any rate, subscribe to.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks I have said that we must maintain our training programme at the highest point possible.  Recently I announced a pilot scheme, under the auspices of the training authority, for a community training programme.  This is because unemployment at its present unacceptably high level affects the youth of the country as much as any other section, so that there are many young people unemployed.  Within a matter of weeks we will have to hand the result of this year's survey of the situation.  In an effort to meet certain of the problems confronting young people I have announced the community youth training programme. This will be concentrated on training unemployed school leavers and on the participation of young persons in community projects.</P>
    <P>One of these programmes is opening this week in Dún Laoghaire and, recently, one opened in Dundalk.  As soon as we can identify the projects we intend drawing the necessary lessons from the pilot scheme and ensuring that the funds required are available for its expansion.  In all cases we wish to be sure that the programme has a worth-while training corps.  There is a social fund in the EEC for the purpose of assisting native resources.  Towards the end of our Presidency last year it was my privilege as President of the Council <Col N="1815" /> of Social Affairs Ministers to take an all-Irish initiative by which we succeeded in getting the assurance that the fund in its training function was available for young school leavers.  There was immediate benefit from that initiative in some of the pilot programme projects that I have announced during the past few weeks. This is only a small illustration of how diligent application to the possibilities of our participation in membership of the EEC can have solid benefits by way of projects for the Irish people.  I am watching this youth training programme very carefully to see what further expansion can be made in it in the coming year. We would hope that increasing numbers of employers would participate in the premium employment programme. This is a programme which has no financial ceiling.  Money can be made available in any place where employers are interested, the objective being to re-employ those who have been disemployed as a result of the present recession.</P>
    <P>All of these schemes are intended to ameliorate a very bad unemployment situation, a situation which, even with recovery in output, will take some time to rectify, and its solving will not be simultaneous with the recovery in output but will lag behind it, as has been the common feature in most countries.  During this period of unemployment, of enforced inactivity on the part of our workforce, we must ensure that they suffer no hardship and also that their skills are improved. The Minister for Social Welfare is looking after them in so far as his Department are concerned and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who will be speaking at the end of this debate, will be redoubling his efforts to ensure export diversification in the coming year, because the kind of recovery that will be of most benefit to us will be one based on a dual strategy of increased exports and a recovery in our home consumption.</P>

      <P>Imports were the big feature in 1975.  In such a situation <Col N="1816" /> one does not have a secure base of recovery, and that is why I say there must be a dual strategy of exports and home market recovery.  One of the big problems we had last year &mdash;and this is observable in other countries&mdash;was that a good deal went, not into the area of consumption, but into savings.  This would seem to suggest that the wisest course is a recovery based on a two dimensional effort&mdash; exports and the home market.  So long as we hold our heads in the coming year, there will be no problem for this country.</P>

      <P>We will make the right decisions.  I am confident that this Government, a national Government in the real sense, one composed of two parties which have within their ranks, farmers, trade unionists, employers and workers, are capable of understanding the problems of running a modern state.  We do not subscribe to the theory that any one party can run this country.  That, though, is the theory of the Opposition; but it is another of the reasons for their remaining in Opposition for some time to come.  It is wise that we do not subscribe to that theory, because between the two parties in Government we can give the people a Government that are truly representative. I do not think the people want ever again to see a return to one-party rule.  They have had enough experience of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody pretends that the present recession is not a bad one&mdash;it is the worst in the history of the State&mdash;but even at such a time the Government are capable of winning by-elections.  I am confident that when the testing time comes&mdash;February or March, 1978 &mdash;our economic situation will be far different from what it is now.  However, I do not know if the decision of the Opposition will be any different.  The ambition will remain, the animosities will retain their vigour, the suspicions will still be green.  Deputy Gibbons has his suspicions about some of his colleagues and what they said in the past and they, in turn, have their suspicions <Col N="1817" /> in regard to Deputy Gibbons.  Presumably, Deputy Colley will not forego his ambition to run that party.  When election time comes the contrast between the Government and the Opposition will be clear.  On the one hand will be a Government who have given leadership and faced up to the difficulties that were encountered while on the other will be a bedraggled Opposition whose lot was confused indecision on the North and on the economy and a simplistic analysis of our difficulties. I leave it to the Opposition to make the best case they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I found it an interesting and amazing experience to listen for the past 40 minutes or so to the Minister for Labour and to marvel at his astonishing detachment from the reality of the day, also his perorations, consisting of spiteful little attacks on Fianna Fáil.  However, it was ordinary commercial political stuff that one would expect from the Labour Party now that they have infected themselves with the Fine Gael propensity for this kind of thing.</P>
      <P>Before he came to that subject the Minister talked of the training of young people and of the status of women in our society.  He was denouncing the role played by my party in these areas. There were occasional references to the recession as if that were some creature from without, some external infection that had entered the body politic.  In his perorations he was contrasting what he regarded as our shortcomings with the united, intelligent, solid and brilliant operation of the National Coalition Government, ignoring completely the unprecedented scale of unemployment and the utter despair of young people leaving school, for whom plans are being made apparently by the Minister for Labour for their training.  One would wonder, training for what? Where are the jobs?  Jobs are being removed; they are being done away with day by day.  There is no country in Europe with an unemployment problem like ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a substantial speech from the Minister for Labour but, instead of telling the House the plans of the Government to provide jobs for <Col N="1818" /> those who require them, he devoted his time to attacking the Opposition. The Government have no plans.  The Minister for Labour attributed the present situation, which is quite unprecedented, to this exterior thing&mdash;the recession.  However, the Taoiseach who spoke earlier in the debate more frankly admitted that the responsibility for the present situation was the responsibility of ourselves, meaning the Government.  He is the leader of the Government and if he accepts responsibility for the present state of affairs that should be sufficient for the Minister for Labour.  We do not pretend there were not external circumstances over which the Government had no control but we say that if the Government had listened to the advice they got consistently and in time from this side of the House, in particular from Deputy Colley, the situation need not have developed as it has done.</P>
    <P>The most striking thing about what the Minister for Labour called this free, modern Government, of which he is a member, is the loss of the sense of scale that all of us must feel.  Some five or ten years ago if there was a rise of 1p or 2p in the price of a gallon of petrol or of a pint of beer there would be a loud outbreak of protest; but in the last few years, under the management of this free, modern Government, prices have been leaping ahead week by week to a degree that we can no longer appreciate the scale of the increases.  Incidentally, the Government undertook solemnly not only to control prices but to reduce them.</P>
    <P>I do not want to devote too much time to the extraordinary performance of the Minister for Labour but it is worth noting the detatchment from reality evinced by the Minister.  It is typical of his colleagues in Government; they simply do not know the score.  They do not seem to be in personal contact with the dimensions of the unemployment problem and the utter hopelessness of young people, especially those leaving school.  There are no jobs for those young people and that is the plain fact of the matter, irrespective of whatever the Minister says about training schemes, about pie in the sky next year or the year after. <Col N="1819" /> There are no jobs for anyone except for the few chosen party hacks brought into the public service by all the Ministers when they took office.  I understand that in the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce 40 such people, party hacks of one kind or another, are now on the Government payroll.</P>

      <P>This is what the Minister himself told me some time ago in answer to a parliamentary question.  This ghastly, small-time nepotism has gone on throughout the entire fabric of the public service; there are brothers in big public service jobs and widows of ex-Ministers are shoved into jobs.  This is going on from the top to the bottom at the present time.  The Minister for Labour calls it free, modern government. In the business of running the country there has never been such a debacle as the debacle that is taking place under the presidency of the man who, in the election posters, was said to put the nation first&mdash;I am referring to the Taoiseach, Deputy Cosgrave.  When the history of this period is written the squalor of his lust for power at any price will be seen in its reality, but the damage caused by the Taoiseach and his Government may be so great that it may prove irreparable.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to come to grips with and to appreciate the enormity of the burden of debt that is being hung around the working people of Ireland.  There is nobody else to pay back that debt which is being saddled on the country except the working people.  They are diminishing in number weekly because every week more people are being put out of work.  It is they who will have to pay the annual interest rates of £234 million although there are only about one million such people.  It is the people who will come after them who will have to pay the rake's progress of the National Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is beyond question or doubt that all enterprise is being kicked.  Capital <Col N="1820" /> is being driven out of the country by the £100 million and that capital is being replaced by the pawnshop tactics of the present Government.  The whole future of this country is being pawned by the Government to keep the show on the road for another couple of months.  They are frantically papering over all the cracks that are getting more numerous and bigger every day.  They know very well they will not see much of the coming year out before the situation is completely out of control.</P>
    <P>There are people in the country at the present time who wonder about certain Ministers, considering their political past and the membership they had of subversive political groups.  There are people who wonder whether they do not actually want to create the situation, that they do not actually want to destroy the Irish economy.  If one examines the records of some members of the present Government and the groups with which they were associated, it will be seen to be correct and true to say that they belonged to organisations that wished to subvert democracy in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt whatever that this large class of the Irish nation are being reduced in circumstances.  They are being driven out of business, particularly in the distributive trades.  They are being pushed out by larger combines from outside and they are being taxed out by their own government.  Our prime industry has suffered more in the past three years at the hands of this Government than it has ever suffered since the foundation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recollection of Irish farming goes back quite a long distance.  It is true to say that in March, 1973 when we handed over the government to the National Coalition, as they call themselves, the cattle herds and pig herds of the country were at all time records in numbers, and the sheep flock also.  In the case of cattle there were about 7¼ million in the country and they had increased from a level of 5 million where they had been more or less static for almost 100 years.  The reason why the numbers had gone up so sharply through the 1960s was that the development of the Irish cattle herd had begun under the Ministry of Deputy Paddy Smith and had been carried on by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  As a result of the cattle breeding and the use of the females in <Col N="1822" /> herds for the multiplication of herds we found ourselves in the very fortunate position on entry into the EEC that we had 7¼ million cattle with the graph still rising at an increasing rate of rise.  If we look at the statistics for June this year we find that they had dropped again to 6.9 million, and it is only since June of this year that the mass slaughter of cows in the Irish cattle herd has become really intensive.</P>
    <P>In a community such as the European Economic Community our role must always be very important as a food producing nation, and the prime element in that major effort of the Irish within the Community would be the production of cattle and cattle products.  The herd has been destroyed very fast.  I reckon that if you take the decline in numbers in sheep, cattle and pigs since the coming into office of the present Government the number of animals lost from the herds are worth about £100 million; £100 million worth of livestock has gone completely out of Irish farms and apart from the other losses that farmers have sustained there is that value of livestock less on the land of Ireland now than there was when the present Government took office.</P>
    <P>I was almost amused at the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries recently when he delivered a dissertation at some Fine Gael jamboree urging farmers to plough more in the coming season.  Of course, they will plough more in the coming season because they do not have the cattle in the same numbers as they used to have, and in any case the mishandling of the livestock sector by the present Government is so appalling that there is no security whatever in the business apart from the relative stability of the dairy sector, but in the meat production side of livestock farming there is no security whatever and the Minister feels obliged to exhort farmers to sow more cereal crops.  He does not have to do it.  We will do it ourselves.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very well that there is nobody in the Government to tell the Government collectively what farmers think or what they feel because they have no farmers in their number. There is no Member of the Government, <Col N="1823" /> or the second echelon even, who ever had to face the vicissitudes of a farmer's life and make his living from it.  It is interesting.  Yet they have no hesitation in advising farmers what is good for them.</P>
    <P>We have talked in this House before about the debacle of last year in the area of young cattle.  We saw the spectacle of all the producers of store cattle in this country selling their cattle at about one-fifth of the price that they had made two years previously.  I am talking about people selling young store cattle at £5 a cwt and less.  These same cattle would have made £25 a cwt in 1972.  Simultaneously producers of beef cattle were able to get intervention prices for their finished cattle and the people who were fortunate enough to be in that trade did have the assurance of an intervention price at any rate.  The fact remains that thousands of producers of younger cattle last year will not recover from the very severe and indeed unprecedented blow that their economy got in the last year.</P>
    <P>This party and I personally told the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in good time&mdash;I think it was two years ago&mdash;that he should seek a realistic devaluation of the agricultural £.  The idea was laughed at.  It was not until October of last year that a partial devaluation was got and our party in the European Parliament voted against what was proposed, 11.4 devaluation, because it was not big enough.  The Minister twice since then and belatedly on each occasion and after constant urging from this party has devalued the agricultural £ but on each occasion&mdash;and this is vital&mdash;he refused and in fact pooh-poohed our advice until it was too late and until tens of thousands of farmers have had to sell one way or the other.</P>
    <P>We saw the debacle of the slaughter subsidies and the wholesale racketeering that went on in that area.  About this time 12 months ago I urged the Minister at the price review in Brussels that was coming forward in February to look for a subsidy on calves in order to see if some support could not <Col N="1824" /> be put under the producers of cattle because they are the people on whom the whole cattle trade depends.  I am in the cattle trade.  I know where my own livelihood comes from.  If the cattle are not produced, if the producers are not making the money, the numbers will go down and the cattle will not be there.</P>
    <P>This is the situation that Fianna Fáil, being so strongly rurally based as they are, appreciated and that is why the herd was developing so rapidly, under the beef incentive scheme, the calved heifer subsidy scheme, the creation of a second cattle herd in the country.  The first herd is the dairy herd.  Fianna Fáil, over the passage of a decade or so, built up a very substantial beef suckling herd which was of vital importance to the cattle economy of the country.  It extracted the capacity of all female cows to reproduce themselves and they provided a lucrative market for the dairy men who were selling their calves. Calves being sold from the dairy herds into the suckling herds were making very good money.  When we were in office they were making from £50 to £70 per head until the crash came with the arrival of the Coalition.  That herd has been wiped off the face of the earth.</P>
    <P>About a fortnight ago I questioned the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries regarding cow slaughterings.  He resorted to doddering and said there was only a drop of 4.3 per cent in the size of the herd.  We heard him admitting in Brussels the other day, for the first time, that we had 600,000 cows, 30 per cent of all the cows we have got, slaughtered in 1975.  Their capacity to provide the cattle herd of the future is gone for ever.  They are hanging on hooks.  Anybody who has anything to do with meat factories will tell you that the slaughterings of in-calf cows and heifers during the past six months was quite unprecedented.  I do not know how these cattle will be replaced under the management of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>With a wave of his hand the other day the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries dismissed the idea that this was a serious matter.  I was not at liberty to question the Minister further because the Chair would not allow me.  I am not referring to the <Col N="1825" /> Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Chair adopted a very protective attitude to the Ministers, especially the Fine Gael Ministers.  The loss is so enormous that even the Minister could not keep up the bluff any longer.  Far from the loss in the size of the cow herd being 4.3 per cent, as he said a forthnight ago, it is 30 per cent of all the cows in the country.  The Government should be ashamed of themselves.</P>
    <P>I want to revert for a moment to the question of the calf subsidy. When I asked him to introduce it he thought it was a ridiculous idea.  He said he did not think it suited our production pattern.  The Italians thought it was a good idea and they get a subsidy, paid in two parts, of £25 per head.  The first part is paid on the birth of the calf and the second at the end of 12 months.  The Italians come over here and buy the cream of our calf stock.  The Minister says the figure is 75,000 calves but I suspect the real figure&mdash;I do not accuse the Minister of saying what is untrue but I think there may be the question of the definition of what a calf is&mdash;for the export of very young cattle, those under six months, would approach 250,000.  It would certainly be 200,000.  It is beyond question that the cream of the calf herd is being removed to Italy and the EEC subsidy that we ought to be getting is being paid on the Irish calves to the Italians.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to try again this year.  We have to develop the rearing and production of calves because if we do not the herd will go down.  It will go down inevitably because the cows are gone in such vast numbers but this idiot rake's progress, this destruction of the calf herd, that is presided over by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and his colleagues, none of whom have anything to do with the land, none of whom is a farmer, is a little bit too much to take.  The incompetence and the inertia of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in this area and his shamelessness and failure to grasp what is going on is quite in a class of its own.  I have never seen anything like it.</P>
    <P>I had some questions down to the <Col N="1826" /> Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries a fortnight ago about prosecutions for the use of unlicensed bulls.  His Parliamentary Secretary resorted to a snide suggestion that there were no prosecutions for using unlicensed bulls in 1972.  This is so because in that year with a prospect of producing a 70 or 75 lb calf nobody would be such a fool as to use an unlicensed bull of inferior quality.  Inseminations from the cattle breeding stations in the last year have dropped to 50 per cent of what they were in Fianna Fáil's administration.  Unlicensed bulls of very low quality are being used in their place throughout the country. The quality of the remaining cattle herd has been prejudiced years and years in advance.  Anybody involved in the Mayo by-election who attended any of the cattle fairs, as I did, could not but be depressed by the poor quality of a great number of the cattle to be seen there.</P>
    <P>Cattle breeding varies throughout the country.  There is high quality breeding in Munster and largely in Leinster as well, but it is not nearly as good in parts of the west.  The north-eastern cattle breeding stations have been doing excellent work and improving very rapidly the quality of the cattle in that area.  I am afraid, because of the drop down to half in the use of their excellent services, because of the uncertainty and the loss of confidence which followed the operations of the Coalition Government, they are just resorting to the use of worthless breeding stock.</P>
    <P>There has been a similar drop in the size of the sheep flock from about 4.3 million in our last year in office to under 4 million now, about 300,000 to 400,000 less sheep in the national flock. Since the Coalition Government took office, with bands playing and banners flying and all the silly tributes to the brillance of the people, we have been looking for a common organisation for sheep marketing in Europe.  The Minister's general conduct in this affair must be condemned, principally because of the incompetence that was plainly visible behind his approach, the incoherent, bad-tempered attack on the French, as if they were expected to renounce the protection of their own <Col N="1827" /> national market in the absence of any common organisation and the total failure to recognise that the real source of the trouble in the sheep market in Europe is the importation of sheep meat by the British, which is permitted under Protocol 18 of the Treaty of Accession, which was extended at the Summit meeting in Dublin Castle, presided over by the Taoiseach, for a further period.  This entitles the British Government to import anything up to about 220,000 tons of sheep meat every year.  In turn they exported British produced lamb to the tune of about 20,000 tons or so each year to the French market.  The total import capacity of the French market would be about 40,000 tons.  The Irish want to sell only about 5,000 or 6,000 tons but it is only now and again that we can get in under the type of mechanism the French operate.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister tried bi-partisan agreements with the French which plainly could not work, as any sensible sheep farmer could have told the Minister.  I think a tripartite agreement between the United Kingdom, France and ourselves was essayed also and, predictably, it was a waste of time. There is a proposal before the European Parliament at present&mdash;it has already got the agreement of the agriculture committee&mdash;rejecting the Commission's proposal for a transitional organisation of the sheep market on the grounds that it provides no protection for sheep producers nor does it apply itself in any way to the real source of the problem, the regulation of the permitted imports from third countries which the UK have.  Therefore, I have proposed to the Commission and to the European Parliament that a minimum import price be arranged between the producers supplying the British market in third countries and the Community itself.</P>
    <P>I shall be seeking a common organisation similar to the organisation in other commodities such as beef and wine and cereals and the existing ones and free movement of this commodity, sheep meat, in all Community member States, to be achieved over a transitional period and the abolition of national price support measures in <Col N="1828" /> all countries because it is unfair that the Irish Government should be expected to ante-up with national measures, as is the case with the disadvantaged areas scheme against wealthy countries like Germany, Belgium, Holland and even the UK. We cannot do it.  Therefore we are seeking the abolition of national measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister did me the courtesy today, in common with other members of the European Parliament, of circulating to me a document which outlines his general stance on the question of the common organisation of the sheep meat market.  Even today there is not the slightest glimmer of a constructive idea from the Minister in the document he circulated; it is simply a complaint that what is there already is no good.  We all know that but you must make alternative proposals. Our medium for putting our proposals is limited and confined to the use which we make of our membership of the European Parliament. Making use of that resource I have put my proposals to the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament and they have been accepted. Tomorrow, please God, I shall get them accepted by the European Parliament.  If I do, the Minister's hand will be very greatly strengthened. He can then demand that the organisation of the sheep meat market be proceeded with without further delay.</P>
    <P>I have talked about the depletion of our cattle herd and our sheep flocks. The same sad story obtains in the case of pigs.  When we were leaving office there were 1.1 million pigs in the country.  This year the number is down to 840,000 with no indication from the Government of the prospects for the future.  It is worth recalling the well recognised three-year cycle with pigs had come to its nadir when we were leaving office.  In spite of that we had 1.1 million pigs and the number should have been on the upswing but, I regret to say, that there is a serious depletion of the pig herd at present with no indication from the Government or any member of it of what they will do for the development of pig production, something on which the survival of western <Col N="1829" /> farming especially depends, concentration on the development of pig rearing and production on the smaller farms.</P>
    <P>There are only two ways for smaller farmers to survive and they make up a large sector of our farming people: you must base their economy on the production of milk and the production of pigs.  There are specialists who produce vegetables, potatoes and so on, some with very notable success.  A good deal of waffle has been talked about saving the west by every party but there is no more potent way of doing it, in my opinion, in the case of the rural people of the west than by the development of pig and dairy production. Of the two, it is far easier to develop pig production.  We had the Minister for the Gaeltacht recently with great pomp and circumstance announcing the setting up of some kind of western development board. I think this is a paper exercise, a bit of ballyhoo.  It would be very constructive of him if he would get hold of the thought that if you are to keep the people on the land in the west of Ireland you will have to give special assistance for the development of pigs. But the hand of the Coalition is on them also and the number of pigs, like the sheep and cattle, are dropping very seriously.</P>
    <P>For the past six months and more animal disease eradication has ceased in the two great disease eradication spheres of brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis. There is a dispute between the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the veterinary profession over the employment of lay staff.  It is my opinion that especially in the case of brucellosis lay staff will have to be employed.  The Minister is quite right in saying that the use of lay staff will have to be considered by the veterinary profession&mdash;but only in the context of a major attack on the brucellosis scourge. The Minister is keeping quiet the fact that it will be illegal to sell untested cattle in the European Community after the middle of 1978.  It would have been the beginning of 1978 but the Commission rather grudgingly acceded to an extension of our time by six months.  There is no hope of the present arrangement, even supposing it was <Col N="1830" /> working, of having the heartland of brucellosis in Munster and County Kilkenny cleaned up by 1978.  If we are to have any chance it would have to be undertaken by a special task force and what I am recommending to the veterinary profession and to the Minister is that certain lay staff be employed in such a way as to ensure that veterinary surgeons' expenses and valuable time are not wasted running about fields rounding up herds, work which should ideally be done by lay staff.</P>
    <P>I suggest that certain lay staff be enlisted, that certain of them be assigned to vets within the scheme and that the lay staff thereafter operate under the supervision of a particular vet.  Each vet would have a number of herds in his practice and the allocation of lay staff to that particular vet would depend on the size and nature of his practice.  I do not think there is any serious threat to the position of vets as professional people and I think this is their main anxiety.  I would remind the Minister that he is dealing with a strong highly organised group of professional people and that the losers in the present impasse are the herd owners of the country.  The Government are gainers in the short term in that reactors are not being sought out except those reactors that are identified by the Department's own staff vets.  When I asserted that the disease eradication scheme had ceased completely the Minister denied it and said that testing was still going on.  A tiny fraction of it is still going on, being carried out by the Department's staff vets, but the massive eradication scheme has ceased and there is no use in pretending that it has not.  Open cases of clinical TB are being identified in herds in areas that have long been identified as attested areas.  There appears to be just an abandonment of the eradication of brucellosis. This is intolerable because both those diseases are highly transmissible to the human species as well and there is in fact a high incidence of human brucellosis.  The Government, I suspect, are just sitting this one out and contemplating all the millions of pounds they do not have to <Col N="1831" /> spend on the payment of vets' fees and on the payment of farmers for the removal of reactors.  If that is their attitude it must be the ultimate in irresponsibility.</P>
    <P>What astonishes me greatly is that during all this running down of agriculture the amount of protest from the Irish Farmers' Association has been practically nil.  I feel entitled to make this complaint because, like every other farmer in the country, whatever commodity I sell, whether it is barley, sugar beet, cattle, sheep or anything else, some of my money is taken from me and given to the IFA and theoretically the IFA represent me.  I am not consulted about membership and I do not have voting rights.  The only thing I have is the compulsory reduction in the price I get for the goods I sell.  Since my money is taken I feel entitled to say that the change in attitude in the IFA since the assumption of office by the present Government has been remarked on all over the country.  There are no mass protests in the streets now although, as sure as the IFA have their headquarters out in Bluebell, there was never a greater need for mass protests, that is if mass protests are any good anyway.  A veil of silence hangs over them.  There is not a squeak out of them.  I wonder where their eloquence has gone.  We would like to know what the IFA feel about the depletion of our herds and flocks and the drop in living standards of farmers.  Possibly my observations may evoke some rejoinder from them.  I hope they do.  I should like to hear what they have to say.</P>
    <P>I doubt if there ever has been a period in the history of farming since the Fianna Fáil Government first assumed office in 1932&mdash;and my recollection goes back just about to that&mdash; when things were so depressed and in a state of such decline in agriculture as they are now.  The statistics back this up.  The observations of the Agricultural Institute in the last week or so on the depletion of the cattle herd simply confirm what this party have been trying to deal with in the House and telling the people generally for the past two years.  The worst feature of it all is that there is not the remotest glimmer of any conception of a plan, <Col N="1832" /> an organised, concerted plan, on the part of the Government.  Where there were plans they distrupted them and left nothing in their place.  In particular I want to refer to the disruption in the pattern that the Fianna Fáil Government left behind in the matter of rationalisation of the dairy industry.  It had been proposed and agreed that 12 or 13 creamery societies in east Limerick combine with the milk producers in Clare and establish themselves around a new group based at the existing Landsdowne plant which belongs to the Dairy Disposal Company and that a new milk drying plant be established in Cratloe.</P>
    <P>The very future of the farmers in west Clare was bound up in this. This proposal, which had been accepted, would guarantee the future employment of the workers in Lansdowne and would guarantee the future in particular of the milk producers of west Clare where the smaller producers live.  It could also replace the inadequate market for the farmers themselves of the 12 or 14 co-ops in east Limerick.  It did not meet the wishes of a small pressure group which began to operate on the new Government when they took over.  The plan was abandoned.  Some of the machinery was sold and some of it, I think, wasted.  Now what we have is complete chaos.  The east Limerick creameries have gone in four directions.  Some of them have gone to Mitchelstown, some to Bally-clough, some to Charleville and some of them to the new group at Nenagh. I wish the new group at Nenagh success, but unless I am wrong they are anticipating an intake of about 20,000,000 gallons and that is very low; it is near the viability danger point.  I very much regret that the only sensible organisation tactic which was ready to roll the machinery was actually at the docks in Cork, abandoned for sheer, stupid, political reasons and that the people who will pay the piper in the end are the milk producers, particularly in west Clare and also possibly some of those farmers in the smaller groups about whose survival I would be worried.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude with this request:</P>
    <P>I would ask the Member of the Government <Col N="1833" /> who will be replying to this debate to state in consideration of the undeniable destruction of the herds and flocks of this country, the undeniable depletion of farm incomes and the widening of the gap between farm incomes and others, whether the Government have any proposals of any description to offer our people. If they do not have any there is only one thing that we can ask them to do and that is: Let us try; we know how to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I sat in for the last half hour of Deputy Gibbons's comments. A thought always comes to me when I listen, particularly to former Government Ministers, that if they were as wise when they were here as they are now it would be a great country. I suppose I cannot blame them, though I do, because I know when I was in the Opposition benches I had no experience of Government&mdash;for that I suppose I can be forgiven&mdash;I knew instant solutions to everything, at least in regard to most things discussed I knew much better how to do them than did the Minister and I had no hesitation in saying so.  It was only when I came across here I found that very many of the things I suggested were not as easily solved as they appeared from the Opposition benches.  As a backbencher for a long time perhaps I could be forgiven for not knowing.  But I think ex-Ministers should be able to give an explanation of why they did not make better use of their time when they were here. However, apart from that, Deputy Gibbons's comments were interesting. At least he gave them as his views on certain things and afforded other people an opportunity to answer those views.</P>
      <P>This debate allows an opportunity to deal with a number of matters. While it is an-end-of-term debate, if you like, some people will cover very wide fields and others will stick to their own.  With the permission of the Chair, I will try to stick fairly closely to my own Department because local government is a very important part of the life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In financial terms the total of local <Col N="1834" /> government expenditure this year amounts to almost £368 million.  The £125 million capital expenditure contained in that figure accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the public capital programme. In staffing terms local authorities are now the employers of something over 33,000.  In political terms, some 1,500 elected representatives participate in the business of local government and their efforts are an indispensable preparation for and complement to politics at national level.  Indeed, I should like to add there lest I be misunderstood that a large number of local authorities now discuss matters at local level completely clear of politics. On the election of their chairmen they are political.  For the rest of the year they work hard to represent the people who elect them.  This is the way it should be and I am glad to see it going along in this way.  Occasionally a maverick comes in and he or she wants to say or do things which are not acceptable to the great majority.  They are very soon found out not alone by their fellow councillors but by the public as well.</P>
    <P>As far as the man in the street is concerned, local government is responsible for a wide range of basic services, the absence of which would seriously disrupt his ordinary living. As Minister, I have general responsibility for the working of the local government system.  It would be a misunderstanding of what local government is about to imagine that my supervision extends directly to all that local authorities do.  This is a mistake often made by individuals throughout the country.  There is, for instance, the old lady who writes to me to say that the county council did not put in the window the way she wanted and she wants me to go along and have a look at it because she feels she should have it repaired.  She is usually right, the local authority will have slipped up and she feels she should go directly to the top.  These are things in which it is not possible for a Minister to interfere except, perhaps, to draw the attention of the local authority to the fact that they might have a look at it and see what should be done.  My responsibility consists primarily in ensuring an effective framework in terms of policies, <Col N="1835" /> structures and laws for the activities of local authorities.  In order to clarify this, it might be better to describe the relationship between any Minister for Local Government and local authorities as one of partnership.  I depend on the commitment of local authorities to get things done.  They depend on me for guidance and support as an intermediary with the central government. This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of local government reorganisation, the discussion document I issued on this subject was not a blueprint aimed at liquidating local authorities but an exercise in consultation.  The views on the discussion document submitted to me by local authorities have confirmed me in my commitment to retain all existing local authorities but, at the same time, achieve a more flexible situation where joint action between local authorities will be more easily realised than at present.  We have an example of it between the three Dublin local authorities and, indeed, two Cork local authorities who, I understand, are now co-operating in a way they were not prepared to do previously.  This is all to the good.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the concept of local government reform is by no means confined to the issues mentioned in the discussion document. Many other policy decisions which I have implemented have had a revitalising effect on the local government system.  For instance, the phased transfer of health and housing charges from the rates and the delegation to local authorities of several schemes previously administered centrally are all elements in a gradual but substantial reform of local government.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of the important things as far as local government and their members are concerned, and to a certain extent, because of it, to this House, is the question of electoral matters.  An effective electoral system is fundamental to democratic government. Since there seems to be from time to time a question mark as to what, if anything, has been done it would be only fair that I should recount <Col N="1836" /> briefly changes, perhaps small changes, which have been made but which I consider to be vitally important as far as the local government of this country is concerned.  Although the previous Government had a referendum to find out if it was felt that votes should be given at age 18&mdash; and that referendum was carried by a big majority in favour of so doing&mdash; no action was taken by that Government to implement it.  In fact, the next general election was fought on the over-21s when it could have been fought on the over-18s.  The first Bill I brought before the House was the reduction of the voting age at local elections and the minimum age for membership of local authorities from 21 to 18 years.  There was also the reduction of the voting age at elections of university members of the Seanad from 21 to 18.  There was also the provision of a statutory procedure for questioning the results of a local election by petition in the Circuit Court because, believe it or not, although it had been found many years ago there was no way in which a decision could be questioned, no effort was made to remedy that position until I had it done after taking office.  I removed the disqualification from membership of local authorities in the case of aliens, persons in Holy Orders, Ministers of religion and persons holding office under a local authority up to a certain point. It is an extraordinary thing to find that many people who, if they wanted to, could make a very good contribution to local affairs, were disqualified, for no apparent reason. Apparently, it was in an old British Act and, although the British themselves had removed it, we never got round to doing so.</P>
    <P>I also increased the safeguards governing the secrecy of the ballot at local elections and improvements in procedures.  I introduced a system of postal voting and, although it has been claimed by many that this was abused, and I am prepared to accept there was a certain amount of abuse, that does not mean we should drop the whole idea.  I believe it is right that those who are entitled to vote and are genuinely unable to be present should, as far as <Col N="1837" /> possible, be facilitated and I propose to improve the situation so that the postal voting system will continue in such a way that there will be many more safeguards.  I propose to introduce that system for general and presidential elections also.</P>
    <P>Revision of local electoral areas in consultation with the local authority concerned with a view to achieving reasonable equality of representation on a population basis within each local authority: it is rather extraordinary that I had representations made to me by many local authorities and by individuals, by members of all political parties and people who were not in politics at all, and all of these representations were taken into consideration. One of the things I could not do was ensure an equal number of local representatives elected to represent a certain number in the population because, if I did that, one local authority would have about seven members and another would have about 80 and neither would be a local authority which could carry on reasonably.  What I did, therefore, was to level off the number in each particular local authority so that the electoral area in each local authority would have as far as possible the same representation.  I think this has worked reasonably well.  For instance, in Clare I was attempting to make around Shannon a new local authority and I had representations from all the people in Clare who asked me not to do so and gave me good reasons for not doing it.  I was amused later when one member of the deputation attacked me in the local paper explaining to his local cumann that he thought I was wrong not to leave the new Shannon electoral area there.  That was quite a good act.  Talk about riding two horses at the same time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It must have been in Cork.  He had learned it anyway and it was very interesting.  I had the revision then of Dáil constituencies with a view to increasing membership to the maximum permitted number of 148 to bring about equality of representation as required by the Constitution. I do not want to go into <Col N="1838" /> that long and acrimonious debate but I want to put on record the fact that the people will always elect those whom they want to elect and anyone who suggests you can put a government in or keep a government out by changing constituency boundaries is talking through his hat.</P>
      <P>One of the things I am recognised for as Minister&mdash;it is something of which I am proud&mdash;is my association with housing.  I have no hesitation in saying that in two-and-a-half years of Coalition Government the standard of housing has improved and the prospects for those seeking housing are better than they ever were.  Shortly after I took office I was invited to open a number of housing schemes.  This is something the contractor, the local authority and people generally like and I went around the country to a number of housing schemes.  What used to annoy me most was the fact that, if the houses had been occupied for a short time, one invariably had to take out a notebook and go from house to house with the occupant waiting at the door with a list of complaints and asking me to look at all the things that were wrong.  The houses had only recently been occupied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of this I decided to have a look at the system.  Everybody was prepared to start off by blaming the contractor, then the local authority and then the architect and the last person they would think of blaming was the Minister.  He was in the Custom House and he had not very much to do with housing in theory but, in fact, the whole trouble started in the Custom House because the houses were being built to a design approved by the Minister.  The houses were designed by the architect. He designed what he was told to design and the contractor built what he was told to build.  Possibly in some cases supervision might have been better than it was but, whatever it was, the houses were cheap and many were badly built.  There were odd exceptions. There were some quite good houses but, in general, the majority were very bad and no credit to anybody and many a decent contractor lost his reputation because he was <Col N="1839" /> associated with the building of these houses.  The NBA, as their name suggests, are merely an agency and they have no authority to change the designs and could not be held responsible for bad design, but they were blamed and they too got a very bad name indeed.  I decided we would have to change this and we did change it.  I said I would set up a housing programme to build houses that would stand four square with any grant aided house in the country and I am proud of the fact that this is the position now.  Even Members of the Opposition whom I have met at various functions opening houses have agreed, and I think Deputy Fitzgerald would be the first to agree, that the houses being built now are fine houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to ask the Minister where are the grant aided houses being built?  It just does not seem to be happening any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to them.  One of the things I found amusing was that in the first six months I was here the Opposition did not say a word about houses.  In the next two years they started to clamour about houses not being built and, coming towards the end of the first financial year, they found they had their noses out of joint and they stayed quiet for a couple of months.  Then they started yelling again.  The same thing happened in the second year.  They are being wise this year and they do not say much.  In fact, Deputy Fitzgerald's comment now is the first I have heard of houses not being built this year.  The plain fact is that as against an average of 14,600 houses built in the last year in which the former Government were in office and with a total of 21,500 houses in that last year we have consistently built 25,365 and 26,630 and, this year, we will be up again over the 25,000 figure.  For anybody in his sober senses to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anyway we built 25,000 houses.  Deputy Fitzgerald says there is a drop.  There may be a drop on the previous year, but we are away over the best we thought we could do.  We may come back to something closer to the target this year.  Deputy Fitzgerald need not be too disappointed.  We have in three years built over 76,000 houses and the best Fianna Fáil could do in any three years, not including their last year, was 42,000 or 43,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I suggest the question can be asked later by Deputy Fitzgerald when he makes his own contribution.  As far as housing is concerned, local authority houses are a credit to the Government, to the designers, to the local authorities and will be a joy to those who are living in them.  But it did not start at that with regard to local authority houses. We found on taking office that the rent being paid by local authority tenants was a lot more than they should be asked to bear.  Numerous people complained to me that they had to cut back on food in order to ensure they would be able to pay the rent.  I felt it was about time something was done and something was done.  The result was that the strike which was in progress was settled and we introduced a reasonable rent arrangement so that people who did not have much money paid a small amount and those with a good deal more paid more.  This is an acceptable way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also arranged a reasonable sales scheme which was availed of pretty widely.  In my view the so called claw-back arrangement in that scheme is a fair proposal.  The proposal was made to me by the National Association of Tenants Organisations and others.  That claw-back means that one-third of the profit, the difference between the price the tenant pays <Col N="1841" /> for his house and the price he gets for it if he sells it within five years of purchase, goes to the local authority. Until a few years ago the tenant of a county council cottage in the country, under a law which I opposed but which was passed by the Fianna Fáil Government, if he sold his house and did not have the last instalment paid on it&mdash;irrespective of the number of years he was in occupation&mdash;had to pay one-third of the price back to the local authority.  He was not given any remission for rates or grants.  This being so I believe the Fianna Fáil Members who are condemning the decision taken about this claw-back do so with their tongue in their cheek.</P>
    <P>At our annual conference I had occasion to refer to NBA houses and to Deputy Tunney.  Deputy Tunney, a fairly decent Deputy who makes a great effort to put the facts before the public as he sees them, made a slight mistake when he made a reference to these houses before he checked to see if they were built under the previous administration or under mine.  It transpired that they were part of the low cost deal arranged by the previous Government.  It is true that they were built during my time as Minister and if we wanted to change those one-door houses the scheme would have been held up indefinitely and I was not prepared to do this.  I was not aware that the one-door houses were being erected but if I was aware it would have been unfair to hold the scheme up.  It is proposed now to put a second door in these houses.  They were some of the reasonably good houses built under that arrangement.  Deputy Tunney felt I was having a go at him but I was just pointing out that he should have checked his facts before he mentioned them.  Had he done so it is possible he would not have mentioned them at all.</P>
    <P>The question of SDA loans has been mentioned often in this House.  I was asked to consider whether a person with an income higher than £2,350 should qualify for a higher amount.  I have an open mind on this but there are two issues which must affect this. Firstly, at the income limit in operation more people are applying for <Col N="1842" /> SDA loans than there is money available for them.  Secondly, I should like to point out that if the amount which is given, £4,500, was not useful there would not be so many applicants for those loans.  While I would like to see a higher sum being made available, as long as there are more people seeking loans than there is money to give we are entitled to keep it at the level it is.  The question of the shortage of money, which we all know about, is bound to have an effect on the position.  Even if it was considered too little there would be a good reason for not jumping the amount available.</P>
    <P>There is a third issue involved.  I find it odd that some local authorities who under the regulation refused a loan to somebody anxious to build his own house because his income is more than £2,350 would put the same person on the housing list and build a local authority house for him.  There is something peculiar about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why can the Minister not see his way to increase that limit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just given the reasons.  I would prefer if the Deputy would make his case later.  I would be prepared to consider an arrangement which would help those on the housing list, irrespective of their income, to build their own houses, I am sure Deputy Fitzgerald and his colleagues would not be opposed to that.  It is not as easy as it looks but it may be possible to help such people.  I cannot understand how somebody with £100 per week going into their house can qualify for a local authority dwelling while a person with more than £47.50 per week cannot qualify for a loan to build his own house.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The SDA loans are helping to produce a big number of houses. The building societies are also making a big contribution.  It is expected that this year the societies will loan in the region of £60 million while the banks have agreed to put up, over a two-year period, £40 million.  I understand a lot of the first £20 million has been bespoke but the amount they have paid out so far is not very big, about £5 million.  In addition the insurance companies have come back in a big way in financing house building and I hope this will continue.  In spite of the shouts up to a couple of months ago that we had no money for housing the houses are being built, are being bought and paid for.  The fact that the necessary money is being made available for this means that building should continue at a fairly high level.</P>
      <P>Anybody who would hazard a guess as to what is likely to happen in 1976 in regard to housing would be brave. My guess is that in spite of all the tightening of the belt we should be able to produce something close to our target of 25,000 in 1976.  In spite of redundancies, and the number of people unemployed and on short time, there appears to be a considerable amount of money around.  Investment in housing is perhaps the best way to hold on to the value of money.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries about allowing the societies to increase their interest rates.  Building society interest rates are still much lower than bank or other rates, and SDA rates are even lower.  While I have great sympathy with people who purchased houses with loans they got a few years ago from building societies and now find themselves paying new higher rates, at the same time the value of their properties has increased and their incomes have increased substantially. Some of them have even told me they are in a much better position to pay now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course sympathy is of very little use to them, and I should like to assist them if I were able to do so.  Take people in Dublin city and country who were not able to get SDA loans during the period of office of the last Government.  The result was that the local authorities guaranteed them to <Col N="1844" /> building societies and they borrowed money.  They were people on very low incomes who could easily have qualified for SDA loans and they now find themselves in dire straits.  I should very much like to assist them but it is not easy to pick out a particular group and say &ldquo;You are special cases, we will deal with you&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing generally, we have built more than 25,000.  Even in the year I took over, the outgoing Administration had plans for providing only 1,500 the following year when the need was for 30,000 houses.  I got a special programme going of 10,000 over a five-year period with the co-operation of the National Building Agency.  This supplemented local authority housing which in itself has increased enormously.  The best Fianna Fáil could do with regard to local authority houses was an average of 4,800 per year.  Up to 31st March last we built 7,331 local authority houses.</P>

      <P>The Deputy would agree if I said local authorities have a good deal of land on hands for sites and it therefore appears to be a foolish thing to invest the money they had for building houses in buying more land, leaving them without money to build houses.  Local authorities could buy the whole side of a county and then not be able to build houses.  Some local authorities were becoming ranchers rather than housing authorities, and I suggested to them that a better idea would be for them to have a reasonable land bank and to build houses on it rather than have all their money tied up in land. They were becoming nearly as bad as the speculators around this city who bought far more land than they were able to dispose of at the type of money they thought they would get and got into serious difficulties.</P>

      <P>The position about private housing in the year ended 31st <Col N="1845" /> March last was that more than 19,000 were completed, compared with an average of 10,800 up to 31st March, 1973.  It is only right that I should put that on record in juxtaposition with local authority housing.  Deputy Fitzgerald asked where the houses were being built, and I refer him to the Department's Quarterly Bulletin up to 30th September, 1975&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Capital for local authority loan schemes has been increased from £9.9 million to £46.5 million this year.  One can talk about inflation or anything else, but that is definite evidence of the desire of the Coalition Government to keep housing going. I am sure all would agree that we are doing what we said we would. Deputy Fitzgerald wants to know about private housing.  In the nine months he referred to, 1,228 houses were built in Cork as against 1,079 in the 12 months of 1972-73, not a bad show at all, not a bad sign that the people of Cork appreciate a good Government as well as anybody else.</P>

      <P>We will be happy to accept their support and we know we will get it.  In regard to building societies, a Bill has been moved in the Seanad and has been circulated.  It is 103 years since the last such Bill was passed, and this one will modernise the whole code.  Perhaps some people will not like what is in it, but reasonable people will agree that the Building Societies Bill will do a good job to ensure that such societies will operate in a much better way in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall go from housing to sanitary <Col N="1846" /> services, water and sewerage.  Houses could not be built in a vacuum, and the outstanding achievement of our first two years was the provision of 52,000 new dwellings, and this has meant that investment in other things like sewerage, water, schools, has had to be increased dramatically.  I am not very happy about what happened in the last 20 or 30 years in regard to the provision of sanitary services. We appeared never to have had enough money for them, and it appears to me that the previous Government did not appreciate the serious situation in this regard when they were giving a mere £5.8 million in 1972-73.  Spread all over the country, this was of very little use.  The amount of capital provided in 1975 for the financing of such schemes by local authorities has been £16.73 million. I am sorry, the figure for 1972-73 was £8.23 million.</P>
    <P>I imagine that if proper attention had been given to these services over the years we would now be in a much better position.  I am appalled at not alone villages but sizeable towns where it was considered that the proper way to dispose of sewage effluent was into the nearest rivers.  Some of them are still doing it, but in the next few years, because of finances, it will not be possible to remedy this altogether.  It is too bad that we should be in this position. While I am prepared to take my share of the blame in that I am not able to get as much money as I would like, a major part of the blame must rest with those people who for so many years made practically nothing available for water and sewerage schemes apart from an allocation here or there for one or two big schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">

      <P>Is the Minister not lucky that we got him into Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>So far Europe has not given us very much under this heading. Sixteen years ago Fianna Fáil in office did not dream of Europe but despite the fact that they could not have expected anything from that source, they made no effort to find the necessary money from their own resources for these schemes.  This was a bad mistake. <Col N="1847" /> In the intervening period there was a Coalition Government and they could at least have made a start as we have done in an effort to ensure that we build up a reasonable amount of money.</P>
      <P>We hear much about conservation and about the pollution of some rivers and lakes.  It will take many years to rectify the damage that has been done in this sphere because of lack of money for sanitary services but unless we are able to rectify the damage, we will not be able to beat pollution.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a good road system is vital to our economic and social development because without good roads it is not possible to move passengers and goods within the country.  Some years ago when the previous Government closed down the railways they promised in many cases to replace them with a good road system.  However, they did not fulfil that promise and the result is that many thousand tons of goods are being carried daily on the roads which should be carried on a rail system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since this Government took office there has been a considerable increase in the road funds both from central and local resources, for example, in 1973-74 the grants increased to £18.9 million compared with £14.4 million in the previous year.  In the nine-month period for 1974 the grants were increased further to £21 million and have been maintained at this level for the current year.  The total expenditure on roads this year will be more than £40 million compared with £26 million a couple of years ago.  When determining the level of the road fund grant for the coming year my primary objective was to ensure that the large capital investment in roads is protected fully and to ensure also that as far as possible employment is not affected adversely.  Accordingly, I have provided for substantial increases in the grants for maintenance works and have directed the road authority that priority should be given whereever possible to labour-intensive schemes.  In the interest of safety and traffic I have retained a reasonable balance of grant allocation as between rural <Col N="1848" /> and urban roads and have made available a number of special grants towards the provision of relief roads and other works in specific towns. Also, I have increased substantially the block grants for the improvement of roads in the smaller urban areas and have made provision for a programme of large-scale bridge works.</P>
    <P>Until this Government took office there was in operation a system whereby national primary roads got 100 per cent both for construction and maintenance, while national secondary roads got 100 per cent for construction and 50 per cent for maintenance and the county roads were separate.  I have allotted 100 per cent in respect of maintenance of national and secondary roads and have given a block grant which the local authorities are entitled to use where they think it is needed most. I am considering seriously the question of whether it would not be possible for a limited period&mdash;a year or two&mdash;to divert some of the construction money for national primary and secondary roads to county roads because&mdash;and in this regard a number of county engineers with whom I have discussed this matter agreed with me &mdash;in many cases there are heavily-trafficked county roads which, by reason of there not being enough money available to carry out the necessary work, are in a very bad condition.  This is a matter which must be given serious consideration.  Investment in this sort of work would yield big dividends as well as guaranteeing much more employment.  I am not and never have been in favour of a local authority employing four or five huge machines to do work which might be done in a relatively short time&mdash;but, perhaps, twice the time the machines would take&mdash;with a large volume of manpower.  That is why I think this type of effort is worth considering and I hope to have more to say about it early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>The question of environment and planning is raised frequently.  In this area we seem to have more experts than has any other country.  I would remind the House that a planning Bill has been before the House for a very long time.</P>

      <P>I am glad to say that I was taken up on that by a number of Deputies and that about 100 amendments have come in.  I could follow the example of some of my predecessors and say simply that I am not prepared to accept these amendments and could bulldoze the Bill through the House but I did not do that.  We have discussed each amendment in detail and I hope early in the New Year to have the Bill before the Seanad where I am sure it will be given a speedy passage.  There is no point in talking about the length of time the Bill has taken if we do not understand the reasons for the delay.  A Bill of this kind should not be taken for an hour or so one day as a fill-in.  It must be debated fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What riles me more than anything else is the practice of some people who, on seeing, say, a four-line notice in an evening paper regarding a planning decision but knowing nothing about the subject, write a long letter, usually to <i>The Irish Times,</i> giving their opinion as to why a decision was right or wrong and, more often than not it is wrong in their opinion.  Some of these people have written articles on the subject of planning decisions and, consequently, have made money from their efforts but they are so busy doing this that they have not time to ascertain the details of what was involved or even to read the conditions under which the planning permission was given.  This is bad enough in so far as private houses are concerned but it is simply not good enough in respect of industry.  Some people recently have talked of being threatened because of their support for an industry which was almost chased out of the country.  When one considers the unemployment situation one realises how wrong it is for somebody to talk <Col N="1850" /> of taking a case against me in the High Court in relation to a decision. The threat is not directed at me personally but is made in order to frighten the industrialist concerned and to prevent him from setting up here.</P>
    <P>The quicker we get this new Planning Bill, a Bill that will deal in a reasonable way with most matters such as these, the better for all concerned. Anybody is entitled to make representations in regard to any planning application but it is entirely wrong that somebody should wait until a decision is given before producing what he considers to be evidence in support of his criticism of the decision. Destructive criticism is something we have too much of.  This city in particular is full of &ldquo;knockers&rdquo;. I have no objection to people making a genuine case for or against planning but I object to those who, after the decision is given, endeavour to belittle the efforts of those who have gone to so much trouble.</P>
    <P>There are experts in my Department and they will report to me before the decision is given.  In many cases my experts may be the first to go to the trouble of looking at it&mdash;it may not have been looked at before that.  So far as I am concerned, any planning decision given is granted on the merits of the case and I am prepared to stand over it.</P>

      <P>I am not at all clear about what the Deputy has in mind but I assume that he is referring to the data communications system used in the airline industry in connection with flight reservations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any question of the introduction of such a system by CIE would be entirely a matter for the board.  I understand, however, that CIE do not envisage that, in so far as road and rail transport is concerned, there would be any need for the sophisticated system used by the airlines.  Nevertheless, the board are examining the question of data communications in the field of transmission of basic information about the board's activities, for example, automatic vehicle monitoring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if his Department will publish a leaflet advising consumers on the economics of various types of energy including solid fuel, gas, oil, off-peak electricity, full rate electricity and central heating; if he will indicate the present position regarding the different fuels; and if there are any comparisons as between this country and England and Northern Ireland regarding them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The relative efficiency of various fuels and the assessment of comparable costs is a highly complex area and this is reflected in differences of opinions among experts who have conducted studies in this area.  Difficulties arise even in reaching agreement on a definition of energy efficiency, which can depend on a number of variable factors including the particular context in which the energy is used and the system involved.  Energy efficiency may refer to the energy input per unit output, but while this definition may be suitable for comparing equipment performing a similar function and using the same type of fuel, it may not be appropriate when comparing equipment using different fuels.  Even if one were to take technical efficiency of fuel utilisation as a starting point, there are, I understand, a wide choice of definitions and there are problems in agreeing on the energy content of a fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards comparisons between Ireland and elsewhere, it is difficult <Col N="1855" /> to make useful comparisons because of the differing patterns of energy use in different countries.  I would say, however, in respect of the industrial sector that, since a large proportion of our factories use modern equipment, they are likely to be relatively efficient in the use of energy and should compare favourably with factories elsewhere.</P>
    <P>My Department have been concerned with the promotion of energy conservation through the rational use of energy, that is, by the more efficient use of equipment and also by the elimination of waste.  The conservation campaign involves the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to firms, grants for re-equipment to achieve economies in energy use, grants for research and development projects in the same area and the issue of guidance material for domestic, commercial and industrial users.  A new phase of the campaign has recently been initiated urging domestic users to save through attic insulation, draught proofing and lagging of hot water cylinders.</P>

      <P>Of course, I am very concerned that anything that can be done to conserve our use of energy should be done.  We are one of the three countries in Europe operating &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; at the moment, but there is a proposal by the French Government that there should be uniform &ldquo;summer time&rdquo; brought in throughout the Community in the future, and this will be discussed at the next council meeting of energy ministers which, presumably, will not take place until the new year.  We should wait to see what is decided there before we start readjusting.  It is uniform in Britain and Ireland but Italy operates a different system.  If we can get uniformity throughout the nine European countries, we should aim at that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The formulation of plans for the development of Drogheda Port at Mornington is a matter for the Drogheda Harbour Commissioners who are statutorily obliged to take proper steps for the management, control and operation of their harbour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> As I informed the House last December, the Harbour Commissioners have proposals for development works at Mornington.  They have made application for State assistance for the proposed works which are intended to cater for ore traffic from the Tara Mines.  Fuller consideration of the application must await a definite commitment by Tara Mines or some other major user.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will do what he can to ensure that Tara export through the Port of Drogheda, that he would be in favour of decentralisation, as we all are. Would the Minister agree that if the Drogheda port were developed as per the plans at present before him or, at least, the plans the Harbour Commissioners have, the likelihood of Tara Mines using that port would be much greater?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that.  I do not know.  Tara Mines had come to an arrangement with Drogheda Harbour Commissioners to use the new port being built at Mornington. That agreement seemed to have been reached when I was down there 18 months ago but they have changed their minds now.  I suppose one of the advantages for Tara in using the Port of Dublin is the fact that the rail link exists, that the facilities are already there and they only have to pay the normal harbour dues, whereas if they use Mornington they will be asked for special harbour dues because of the fact that these new installations have been put in and also there is the question of the erection of a rail link between the mines and Mornington. It is a commercial decision on the part of Tara Mines, and they will approach it on the basis of what is the cheapest way for them to export their ore.</P>

      <P>Could I further ask the Minister if it is a fact that some time ago he stated that money could be made available for the development of the port if a major industry were interested?  Would he also agree that the problem is that the major industry very often is awaiting the development of a port before they will make a decision and in these circumstances would the Minister not agree that if he were to make a commitment now to provide the finance for the development of the Port of Drogheda at Mornington it would encourage Tara Mines who have not, as the Minister said, made their final decision yet, to make a decision in favour of exporting through the Port of Drogheda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he proposes to make further moneys available to Drogheda Harbour Commissioners for the resurfacing of roads and quays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Drogheda Harbour Commissioners have recently carried out under contract major quay repair and reconstruction work including resurfacing of quays and quay roads.  State aid in the form of a loan of £60,000 from the local loans fund was made available to the commissioners towards the cost of resurfacing. The commissioners, however, contracted for more extensive road and other repair works than originally planned and now find that they have not the resources to pay for them. They have applied to me for further State assistance and I am having the whole matter investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister favourably consider the application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to look at it again.  The commissioners applied to my Department for permission to do certain work in Drogheda.  They were given that permission and the method of financing was arranged through the local loans fund.  The commissioners, without coming back to my Department, went further than they were given permission to go and now find they have not the money to pay for these further works for which they did not receive approval.  We have asked them for their up-to-date financial position.  They supplied that in the last couple of weeks but it was, from the point of view of my officials, inadequate as regards what we were looking for.  We have written to them in the last few days asking for additional information.  When I get that I will examine the whole position again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the commissioners were placed in a rather embarrassing situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that if he gave the money to the harbour commissioners nobody would be in an embarrassing position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, but we made the money available to the harbour commissioners who then spent <Col N="1864" /> further sums and came back looking for that money.  If every local authority or harbour commission in the country were to spend money and then apply for permission afterwards to spend it on the basis that if the Department did not supply it to them they would go bankrupt it would be impossible to run any Department.</P>

      <P>It is hard to understand, when we talk about collective responsibility by the Government and Ministers of the Cabinet, that the Minister is not aware whether or not this was submitted to the regional fund.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On joining the European Economic Community, Ireland accepted all legislation already adopted by the Community institutions.</P>
      <P>Since accession, a number of Council regulations and directives relating to road transport have been adopted by the EEC and a number of proposals are at present under discussion.  It is normal practice for my Department to consult the Irish Road Haulage Association, the Road Transport Organisation and other interested bodies about any EEC proposals falling within the scope of my Department and their views are taken into consideration when formulating an Irish view on the proposals.</P>
      <P>I should explain to the Deputy that EEC social legislation relating to road transport falls within the ambit of the Minister for Labour, while proposals relating to such matters as commercial vehicles taxation, driving licences, weights and dimensions and minimum standards of training for drivers are dealt with by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Labour made a belated attempt last week to have this matter rectified.  Is the Minister aware that the eight hour limit the EEC are <Col N="1869" /> seeking to impose will possibly cause serious unemployment and rapid increases in costs so far as Irish road haulage is concerned?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>One second, if it was thought that it was unsuitable for this country to have this regulation, that should have been said at the time of accession in 1971 and 1972 when the Treaty was negotiated, because when we joined the Community it was already part of the Treaty of Rome and we were bound by all these regulations when we joined.  What the Minister for Labour did originally at a Council meeting during the autumn was to give notice of his intention to ask for a deferment of this regulation for two years.  The Commission said that legally they could not do this because we had accepted the regulation when we joined; and we were not in Government when we joined the EEC.  The Minister for Labour is now seeking a postponement and the Commission are sympathetic to our point of view but find themselves in a sort of legal dilemma about how they can get around the position and allow deferment for some reasonable time.  The Minister appreciates the situation because he has had consultation with everybody involved including the FUE and the trade unions.  He realises that there is necessity for the postponement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

Is he aware that there is much speculation as to whether the Lough Swilly Railway Company will phase itself out, whether CIE will take over all transport, road and rail, and that there is also speculation that some Northern Ireland-based company may take over?

      <P>and <b>Mr. Gallagher</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider amending the provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, in order that those who were made redundant by CIE at that time can have their payments increased to compensate for the increased cost of living; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a basic difference between normal retirement pension and redundancy compensation. The former is normally earned by the completion of 40 years' service while the latter is given to compensate the redundant employee for loss of employment and is intended to cushion the effects of what is hoped will be only temporary unemployment.</P>
      <P>The compensation provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, were very generous, the maximum amount of compensation being an annual sum equivalent to two-thirds of pay at the time of redundancy, and were not to my knowledge equalled in any other country. The compensation continues for life, is subject to abatement only in certain limited circumstances or at age 65, and is not affected by the receipt of social welfare benefits to which the recipient may otherwise be entitled. It is far more generous than that provided for under the national redundancy compensation scheme.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances I consider that an amendment of the provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, as proposed, would not be justified.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say if the CIE pension fund is very <Col N="1872" /> much in credit and is expanding and that further benefits could be paid out of it without threatening the fund itself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that payments fixed in 1958 which he describes as very generous are now completely inadequate because of the fall in the value of money?  Would he not further agree that the number of people involved is very small and that if they were a united body with a loud voice, they would probably be listened to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It does not matter to us how small the body is; if its claim is just it will be met. The date of the Act is 1958 but the beneficiaries under the Act can go right up to 1964.  The position under that 1958 Act was such that if a man had been working for five years under it he could have a pension for the rest of his life.  That is an extraordinarily generous scheme, far more so than the Redundancy Act which came in some years later and under which all new employees in CIE must now join. A new employee cannot benefit from the 1958 Act; he must join the redundancy scheme under the 1967 Act.</P>

      <P>EEC Directives require member states to adopt such laws, regulations, or administrative provisions as may be appropriate in order to maintain at all times their stocks of petroleum products at a minimum of 90 days average daily internal consumption in the previous year.  The International Energy Agency at present requires member states to hold 60 days' reserves.</P>
      <P>Under regulations made by me in accordance with the European Communities Act, 1972, oil importers of 5,000 tonnes or more a year and large oil consumers of 20,000 tonnes or more a year are required to hold reserves of not less than 55 days' supply.  In addition, under an agreement with Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd., a reserve of not less than 135,000 tonnes of crude oil is held at Whiddy Island.  For the purposes of compliance with the EEC directive, crude oil reserves may be regarded as constituting oil product reserves in accordance with formulae set out in the directives.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the reserves held by or on behalf of oil importers and consumers here and abroad and the 135,000 tonnes of crude oil held at Whiddy, the returns made to the EEC show this country as having the following oil reserves as at 1st November, 1975:</P>

    <P>The overall weighted average comes to approximately 82 days, which is higher than the current requirement of the International Energy Agency but below the level of the EEC requirement. The Commission of the EEC has requested information and observation from a number of member states, including Ireland, about the application of the directives and we are in correspondence with the Commission in the matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1876" /> I am, of course, concerned to have a higher level of reserve stocks.  Among the measures which I propose to adopt in the near future is to increase the minimum stock requirement for oil importers and consumers by an additional five days and to bring consumers using 15,000 tonnes or more a year within the scope of the requirement. The possible arrangements by which we can further improve our emergency reserve position are under continuing examination in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of adequate bus services in Dublin is the responsibility of CIE who continuously endeavour to provide at all times a regular and reliable bus service. Traffic conditions, however, make it <Col N="1879" /> difficult to provide a satisfactory level of service but despite these problems, the introduction of modern control systems has helped to minimise delays.</P>
      <P>I am informed by CIE that during the summer and autumn of 1975 they experienced difficulties in the manning of buses due to an inordinately high level of illness coinciding with the peak annual leave period for busmen. This situation has since improved.</P>
      <P>Long term improvements in the level of service is dependent on the solution of traffic congestion problems which are primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned.</P>

A contributing factor is that CIE have not recruited bus crews to man their existing bus services.  There is also a lack of maintenance of buses which is also depriving the public of the service to which they are entitled.  There is the question also of their not coping with the expanding city and a general feeling of dissatisfaction and frustration among the general public who use buses, which includes myself.  I have had experience of waiting for a bus from 30 to 40 minutes.</P>

      <P>I appreciate, of course, that the public are frustrated and frequently annoyed by the standard of services provided by CIE in Dublin. But CIE hold that because of their more up-to-date allocation of buses and new telephone system they have improved their service gradually but continuously over the last five years. There are a number of other factors that have to be taken into account besides CIE when one speaks about an inadequate bus service in Dublin city. There is congestion, parking.  The Garda would have to be brought in. Dublin Corporation and a number of other bodies would be involved.</P>

      <P>When one gets into a &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; situation with traffic in Dublin in which the worse the traffic becomes, the more delayed the buses become, the less inclined people are to use them but to use their own cars instead.  Again this makes the traffic worse, which means that the buses become less used than they might be otherwise.  It is a very big problem.  It warrants a lot of study.  The Dublin transportation study outlined many of the problems and, perhaps, their solution.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt familiar with the protocol attached to our Accession Treaty.  As far as I see it, the future is this.  On the basis of our costs, structures and skills, we have a real future on the condition that we get a volume larger than that directed at our home market.  In other words, firms like Ford which are able to reach a volume that encompasses exports and, perhaps, other firms as well have a firm future.  The other sector where there is a firm future is in components and, as I think the Deputy knows, we are vigorously diversifying in that direction.  But firms doing a very small number of cars for the Irish market have unit costs so enormous that, after the ending of our special period, they would not be viable.  That is as I see it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is familiar with the fact that I have recognised the needs of the Birr area. I am familiar with this firm but I have to say that putting public money into a sector where there is already surplus capacity endangers the safety <Col N="1885" /> of all other jobs in all the other firms. I would think it prudent in everybody's interest to use any available grant moneys we have to get growth in sectors where there is not surplus capacity because I do not believe it is prudent to endanger the health of a whole sector by stimulating extra investment where there is already sufficient or sometimes too much.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal very briefly with a few matters on which I have not touched.  With regard to speed limits, I get letters from people all over the country who want to know what I am doing about speed limits in their areas.  This is one of the responsibilities I have passed to local authorities and it is they who now decide, in conjunction with the Garda Síochána, when and where speed limits are to be imposed.  It is better that someone at local level should make the decision rather than have people from the Custom House going around the country to find out whether or not speed limits should be imposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently there was some publicity about accidents on the Naas Road and it was suggested I was holding up the sanctioning of traffic lights at a point where at least seven people had been killed over a period.  A proposal for public lighting on the Naas Road was received by me in October last and the council were told that the proposals were not satisfactory.  There were discussions between the council engineers and officials of my Department and revised proposals were received in the Department this morning.  The <Col N="1901" /> allocation of money in 1975 has not held up lighting improvements on the Naas Road.  A substantial sum was allocated to Kildare County Council for this purpose and the responsibility is the council's and not mine.  Having made that comment, it is only fair to say that I consider county councils are doing an excellent job.  Occasionally I do not agree with what they do but they are entitled to do what they think is best.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the members of local authorities are the salt of the earth, in the main unpaid men and women who spend their time looking after the interests of those who elected them and, indeed, of those too who would not elect them in 100 years.  They leave political and other views completely out of their considerations.  I do not think they get the credit they deserve.  Were they not so dedicated they would not do their work so well.  The officials are also dedicated people who carry out the regulations and the instructions given to them in a way which is a credit to all concerned.  This is not the position in some other countries and it is something of which we should all be proud.</P>
    <P>With regard to itinerants, or travelling people, as they are now called, I have made the point again and again that I consider travelling people are not being treated the way they should be.  There are two different types involved. There is the type better known as dealers, usually fairly wealthy people who make a damn nuisance of themselves wherever they go and who have no hesitation in putting their expensive cars and caravans on the side of the road irrespective of how busy that road is.  They have no regard for traffic or anything else. They are people for whom I do not have a great deal of sympathy and eventually either the Department of Justice or the Department of Local Government will have to bring in regulations to deal with this menace. They are entitled to make their living and I have no objection to their doing so but they must do it without trampling on the rights of others.  When <Col N="1902" /> they move on they leave an incredible amount of rubbish behind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second category, we are not, I think, as Christian-minded as we claim to be in regard to these.  It saddens me when I find someone objecting to a family being moved into a house.  I am speaking now of people who have very little or nothing at all.  Sometimes complaints come from neighbours and sometimes they come from people a distance away.  Recently arrangements were made with a local committee to have houses built for some of these people in Deputy Faulkner's area and I was surprised to find that people who lived quite a distance away and who tolerated the situation so long as these people were sitting on the side of the road objected strenuously when the local authority proposed building houses for them on practically the same site; the objection was that the houses would interfere with the value of other houses nearly a mile away. This is the kind of thing I am not prepared to accept.  There are people who complain when these people are put into a housing scheme; the complaint is the neighbours do not like it.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat what I said on a number of occasions: perhaps if our neighbours had a choice they would not have us as neighbours.  It cuts both ways.  On the question of travelling people causing trouble, it is true that some of them are guilty in this respect but do not some of the settled community cause trouble, too?  Some local authorities and some groups are making great efforts in regard to itinerant settlement but all of us should be a little more Christian in our approach to this question.</P>
    <P>I have heard much nonsense talked about the rates.  I would like to make it clear that there is definite evidence to show that were it not for the fact that health and housing charges have been transferred to central funds, the rates would be much higher this year. It is estimated that they would be, on average, £4 in the £ greater than they are.  I am not saying that the rates are not high.  They are very high but we have made arrangements to have <Col N="1903" /> this matter dealt with and within the next couple of days we expect to have the report of the committee that have been investigating the matter. Then, we will all have the opportunity of deciding whether it will be possible to devise an alternative way of spreading the burden of local taxation.  However, let us remember that in 1972-73 the average rate in the £ for the whole country was £6.09 and that in 1975 it is £6.60.  Can anybody indicate any charge during the past three years in any part of the western world that has increased by a lesser amount than that?  In addition to removing the health and housing charges from the rates, the Government have removed from them the malicious injuries burden and this resulted in a considerable saving to ratepayers in a number of counties.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration, 1975 has been a good year in so far as local government is concerned. There has been good employment in local authorities and the housing programme has been much better than most people predicted.  In regard to roads there has been a greater amount spent than in any previous year.  Although money is tight we hope to be able to keep as close as we can to our targets in respect of the various aspects of the Department in 1976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was the third contributor to this debate from the Government side.  So far one can only express disappointment at the content of the contributions from that side.  What we have had so far is detailed itemisation of what has been done by various people and what is being promised to be done but little reference to the prime needs of our economy.  This is the reference one would have hoped for at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The apparent gravity with which the Taoiseach delivered his speech last week left the people stunned.  It appeared that for the first time the Government realised the state into which they had allowed the economy to slip during almost three years of <Col N="1904" /> ineffective, inefficient and incompetent government, a Government which had their priorities wrong from the beginning, wrong in the sense that propaganda and publicity got the number one spot at the expense of employment in industry, in agriculture, in building and so on.  Not once during his entire contribution did the Minister for Local Government refer to the 10,000 additional people who are idle in the building industry compared with this period last year.</P>
    <P>When we adjourned for Christmas two years ago&mdash;the first Christmas of this Coalition&mdash;our unemployment figure was 64,622.  Now, as a result of the bungling and mismanagement of the economy, because of the failure of the Government to produce any economic plan, the unemployment figure has reached 109,286, an increase during that three-year period of 44,664 or almost 70 per cent.  This figure does not include the 7,000 school leavers who are desperately but unsuccessfully seeking jobs.  The seriousness of this situation cannot be over-emphasised.  There is no need for me to go into detail to explain the serious problems for the future in so far as our young people are concerned. Thanks to the social conscience of a Fianna Fáil Minister and Government many young people are now educated to a certain standard but at the end of their schooldays they find that there are no opportunities for employment.  This situation must have a frustrating and shattering effect on them and, in my opinion, will lead eventually to social discontent and this must be the biggest problem facing us for the future.</P>
    <P>What steps are being taken to try to provide opportunities for the school leavers of next year and of 1977 and later?  We are told that the number leaving school each year is between 50,000 and 52,000.  Some of these go on to further education but we can assume that in each year there will be about 30,000 coming on the labour market.  This gives us a labour force that is increasing, perhaps, by between 25,000 and 30,000 a year while at the same time we have a diminishing figure for people at work.  The real <Col N="1905" /> cancer is the growing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Our service sector is already large by international standards.  This means that most of the new jobs we need must be provided in manufacturing industry. Therefore, let us look at the situation in that industry.  We find that employment has decreased by more than 15,000 jobs in the past year and that the downward trend is continuing. Since June, 1974 the number of people employed in manufacturing industry has decreased by an estimated 18,000.  This wipes out all the gains we had achieved in the seven years prior to the last election so that we are back to something like the 1967 situation.  The population has been increasing during that time.  Since the middle of last year industrial output has fallen by 8 per cent.  Obviously, this is the most serious part of our unemployment situation.  Taking this into consideration with the situation in the service industry and in building, we realise how serious is our position. The unemployment figure in manufacturing industry is about 13 per cent.  It is a serious figure but no positive effort has been made to rectify the matter.  I know members of the Government might like to interrupt me and say they introduced measures regarding the employment premium.  I will come to that matter later and will explain why it has failed.</P>
    <P>The 13 per cent in manufacturing industry is a very significant and frightening figure.  In the ten months up to October, 1975, the volume of our manufactured exports was 4 per cent below the 1974 figure.  The real fall in GNP for 1975 will be in the region of 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent. We are now in a position that even if the growth rates in output and employment of the earlier part of the decade were resumed immediately it would take about five years to get back to last year's level of employment in manufacturing industry and that was proportionately only half that of our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>Having regard to those trends and the delay by the Government to arrest the inflationary situation in a positive way, there is no way that the unemployment <Col N="1906" /> figure will not soar to 140,000 and possibly 150,000 people. That is the stark reality of the situation and it cannot be prevented unless the Government finally realise that their policies have been wrong, that their plans have been non-existent and that, as a result, so many people have lost their jobs.  This causes upsets and social problems in the home despite any cushioning that may be provided from other sources.  The average Irishman is anxious to work but the Government have not done their duty. They have failed miserably in this area.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the situation in the private sector where approximately 100,000 workers have not yet received any phase of the present national wage agreement because of the genuine inability of a large sector of the industry to meet such payments. This is where I must lay the blame fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government because they created the climate that has brought about that situation.  There is no other sector that can accept the responsibility in the same way; the Government are to blame and they must face up to it.  This morning the Minister for Labour again told us that the problems were caused by outside factors and by influences from abroad.  The Government were told long ago that their inflationary policies would have the effect of creating unemployment.</P>
    <P>The climate they have created has inhibited the private sector in three ways.  There is an inconsistent kind of price control in operation; there is an escalating wage bill caused by the inflationary measures of the Government; there is increased taxation.  The first result is that 100,000 people in the private sector have not got the benefits of the national wage agreement that have been obtained by the public sector and by other sections of the community. Thus, there is the problem of some people falling behind and all I will say to the men who said they would eliminate proverty, are we not creating hardship for very many families?</P>
    <P>The other result is an even more <Col N="1907" /> serious one in the long-term.  It means that this sector is no longer generating profits.  I want to make clear that I am not interested in profits just for the sake of profits but I realise that they are necessary in industry if we are to have reinvestment. If this does not happen it is not possible for a company to create more jobs, to re-equip, to modernise and to improve productivity.  In addition, we will not be competitive in world markets and this is a point we have heard much about recently.  Let me emphasise that the profits I speak about are profits that the country needs.  It is not to line anyone's pockets but it is to help industry to equip itself, to provide jobs and to compete in the world markets.</P>
    <P>It is a vicious circle where there is a climate created by the Government that is having the effect of throwing many people out of work and keeping back many others in the battle against the cost of living.  It is amazing how silent so many people have become on the way costs have increased generally. I can assure the Minister for Local Government that many local authorities are facing a disastrous financial year in 1976&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should love to believe that.  I notice the Minister made the comment just before he left the House.  Obviously he was not going to wait for the answer; I do not <Col N="1908" /> blame him because I realise it is an embarrassment to him and his colleagues in Government.  The people in the private sector have not been able to obtain benefits under the national wage agreement because of the genuine inability of firms to pay such increases but, at the same time, people in the public sector have been able to avail of all the benefits.  Yet, when the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Labour Party made their threatening statements recently that the worker would have to tighten his belt they did not differentiate between those who got the increases and those who lost out in that race.  Of course, this is typical of a Government who have floated around like a rudderless ship, with no leadership or guidance, with a complete lack of positive approach. They have failed miserably to help the Irish workers.</P>
      <P>Again, I ask, what are the prospects for future school leavers over the next five years.  We have to provide for them and the sooner the better.  There are a number of ideas that I will put forward later.  The social dangers that the present situation can cause can have serious consequences and will guarantee that never again in the history of this country will there be a coalition government composed of either Fine Gael or Labour or both, simply because the people concerned will forever remember the way their careers were thwarted in the infamous period from 1973, hopefully for not very long, of Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Let us consider the Taoiseach's speech last week and the frightening way he portrayed the situation on the television screen.  Let us go back to the summer of 1974.  The warning signs were there long before then.  There was a warning that the policies were dangerous and could only have long term serious results for us.  I quote from the Central Bank's comment in July, 1974:</P>
      <P>The growing extent to which this rising volume of public expenditure has to be financed by external borrowing is a special cause for concern. At the end of March 1974 about £165 million&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1909" /> Is it not small by comparison with the present day?</P>
    <P>&mdash;of external government debt was outstanding as against only £55 million five years before and the indications are that this figure will be in the order of £300 million at least by the end of March, 1975 while that of State bodies will probably have reached some £200 million by the same date.</P>
    <P>That was one of the warning signs to the Coalition Government that was completely ignored by them.  Another comment made in the autumn of 1974 was:</P>
    <P>The economy has been subjected to a series of adverse events.  The escalation of food and commodity prices throughout 1973 was followed by the oil crisis with its wide ranging implications for prices, demand and the external deficit and the conclusion of an inflationary third national pay agreement and by a budget in April last&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, a budget in April 1974.</P>
    <P>which, containing no positive measures to reduce inflation, relied heavily on borrowing to expand domestic activity at ever rising levels of cost.</P>
    <P>That, one could say in retrospect, warned the Government of the effect their lack of initiative and lack of courageous action would have on the economy and on the living standards of our people.</P>
    <P>The results are there now.  The Taoiseach's speech last week was indicative of the concern he now has.  If that concern had been evident in the summer of 1974 and the spring of 1975 it would have been more effecttive and would have provided the necessary stimulus to get the wheels of industry moving and to get people back into employment.</P>
    <P>It was in the late autumn of 1974 that the Government first spoke of this national partnership.  I see nothing wrong with the concept of a national partnership if I thought it represented genuine concern but, from experience, I have become suspicious of this Government, as most Irish <Col N="1910" /> people have.  One is inclined to associate with the Government publicity, dramatics and a great deal of propaganda. The Taoiseach says now that we are in the worst situation that peace-time Ireland has ever been in. On this side of the House there is one of the most responsible Taoisigh of recent times, our Leader.  If the Government or the Taoiseach were sincere in their approach to a national partnership and if they believed that the economy was in a serious condition, it would be very understandable if they approached this responsible former Taoiseach, discussed the situation with him and asked him for his advice, for his support if necessary and the support of his party.  No.  For publicity reasons, for reasons best known to the Government, this course was not followed.</P>
    <P>Belt-tightening has been threatened. On whom?  On the ordinary people of Ireland.  I want to refer to a few specific items.  I understand the Minister for Industry and Commerce will reply to the debate tomorrow evening. I would ask him to intercede in the case of the Cork Shoe Company, Cork who have particular problems at the present time.  The important aspect is that that company employs 200 people.  There are 200 homes dependent on the future of the company. By a decision last week of a Government agency, Fóir Teoranta, that company is doomed as from 9th January.  I would appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask Fóir Teoranta to reverse that decision and to consider the financial and social implications.</P>
    <P>The financial implications could be favourable in the context of the national economy having regard to what it would cost the State if those 200 people lose their jobs on 9th January.  There is a very strong social case to be made for the continuation of this company.  After the appointment of a receiver in May, 1975 the employees showed loyalty, interest, co-operation and dedication by improving production in that period. For that reason I make a very strong plea to the Minister&mdash;I am sure there are others who will join with me in making that plea&mdash;to involve himself <Col N="1911" /> and to intercede for the 200 employees who have decided that they will work free, gratis and for nothing to finish the production in hand and to use the stock remaining on closing date.  This is an indication as to the type of people they are.  The request is made for a period of six months and I would ask the Minister to give it very sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There is one matter that concerns me.  I have always believed in the policy of buy Irish.  It has always been my view that there is no greater patriotism than to buy Irish not only in time of recession but at all times. One must doubt the sincerity of the Government and the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is leading the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign when one sees the areas in which Government and State companies particularly are purchasing outside the State.  The effect of that is reduction in employment because State companies should be stopped from buying outside this State.  I accept that the budget may be allocated to them at the commencement of a particular year and they might see where £5,000 or £6,000 could be saved by purchasing outside the State.  Still, being a State company propped up by the Irish taxpayer, if the overall economic situation were examined in relation to that saving it would be seen very clearly that the saving in the contract placed outside the State could well be a loss to the economy generally.  It could also be seen that if this contract was placed with an Irish company, creating more jobs or guaranteeing existing jobs, it would be very beneficial.  Can one be blamed for doubting the sincerity of this campaign when we have seen in recent times such a gross breach of this slogan by State companies responsible to the Government?</P>
    <P>I will mention a few of those companies, some of which are in my constituency or near it and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle as well. We had the issue of the Japanese ships.  I want to specifically reply to a point made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he contributed to that debate.  I did not have <Col N="1912" /> the opportunity of replying after him. He charged me with being emotive. I believe I was constructive.  The Minister said that the type of boats being ordered by Irish Shipping were sardine tins.  There was a comment from that yard that they now want a consignment of tin openers to open the sardine tins.  He was referring to the bulk carriers.  I accept the point he made that there was not as much employment content in them as there would be in a ferry boat.  This would be fine if Verolme Dockyard knew they were getting some type of order, if there were consultations with them and also if they knew the date of the placing of any further orders.  The confidence of the workers then would not have been eroded.  That is the first point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the Minister has interrupted in a flippant way, like all his colleagues this morning. I believe he and his colleagues are becoming more irresponsible daily and less concerned with the problems facing us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has interrupted, I will dwell a few minutes longer on his propaganda outside the gates of Verolme Dockyard during the by-election campaign about 14 months ago.  He was encouraged by the officers of Haul-bowline, that he spent long enough with, and then he came to the Verolme Dockyard and promised them this fishery protection vessel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister let me finish?  This was subsequently promised by the Taoiseach. It was kicked around at that stage and it was promised again by the Taoiseach and by a Fine Gael Deputy from north-east Cork.  Possibly, as a result of discussions this morning the <Col N="1913" /> Minister may have an announcement to make about it.  I will welcome it. I will forgive him for interrupting me if he says positively in the House that he has decided to give Verolme the order for the fishery protection vessel. If the Minister puts a date on it on this occasion, I will be happy and he will not hear from me again about it.</P>
      <P>I am also concerned about the large quantities of steel imported in some of our major contracts.  Some of them are private developments in many parts of the country but others are State developments.  We have a steel mills in Cork harbour.  The importance of this is that it is Irish.  It is strange to me that again we have a State company importing steel.  While Irish Shipping went to Japan with their £11 million these people have gone to one of the continental countries to get some of the steel for the new Nítrigin Éireann factory.  If this is the case the Government should be rapped on the knuckles for not preventing it because the jobs of Irish workers in Irish Steel Holdings are at stake.  In fact, 500 jobs are about to be lost in that firm.</P>
      <P>We had a motion on the Order Paper last week stating that a number of companies would be examined by a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas. It included a long list of companies. One of the notable absentees was Irish Life, more than 90 per cent of which is owned by the Minister for Finance. I am surprised that Irish Life are not included in this list.  If the rumours circulating are true, it appears to me that Irish Life should have been on this list and somebody would know what is happening in that company. Irish Life are engaged on a major complex in this city and we are told that approximately 3,000 people will be employed in that, although not all by Irish Life.  That employment content is larger than the population of many of our Irish towns.  Therefore, it seems strange that that company is omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now being told that the furniture for that complex is being purchased outside the State.  Where is our &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign?  What about the jobs of Irish workers?  What <Col N="1914" /> is wrong with our chairs, desks and office furniture?  If they are slightly dearer in the long term we should consider which is cheaper for our economy.  I have mentioned three or four areas because of the unemployment situation and in each of them, with the possible exception of the first I mentioned, which is a slightly different situation, they are all State bodies buying outside the country.  This is harming continuity of employment and shattering the confidence of many of our workers.  If a ship, a chair, a press or whatever else it might be can be bought out of the budget of a State company it should be purchased within the country.  This would be a positive example to people to buy Irish and support the campaign which the Government are half-heartedly trying to promote.  I cannot see how that campaign can succeed if State companies are allowed to continue with this policy, which is harmful to the employment situation.</P>
    <P>The premium employment programme was introduced in the House last summer to aid manufacturing industry.  After one of our amendments was accepted it was extended to aid agricultural industry.  At that time I pointed out to the Minister that in any area where the Government were using their imagination they would have our full support.  I complained then and I complain bitterly now that the narrow limits of that scheme&mdash;I said it was imaginative and merited support&mdash;meant it could never get off the ground properly. Six months later the scheme is obviously a failure in that only approximately 3,000 jobs have been created by it.  The Minister told us that 10,000 was the target.  I said that I hoped 10,000 was only the first stage and that that figure would be far exceeded.  Last week, the day after I had asked a question here about it, the Minister extended the scheme to the processing industry but&mdash;something I can never understand particularly in the present climate&mdash;he left out the building sector and the service industry sector.</P>
    <P>The economics of the situation are that if a man is taken off the live register there is an immediate saving <Col N="1915" /> to the Exchequer in not having to pay his social welfare benefit.  The £12 premium is being paid from State funds but the State get back the stamp contribution plus any income tax he may be paying in his new job.  At all times the State will get back at least 50 per cent and in some cases much more of the pay out.  They are making a big saving overall.  That is why I cannot understand the Government not covering the building sector and the service industries when any job created or provided is a bonus for the economy.  Even at this late stage I appeal to the Government to cover those areas.  The building industry is going through its worst depression since the 1956-57 period when the Coalition Government ran out of office as this Government will do in the not-too-distant future when the Exchequer is empty and every State Department run down.  This is an area where employment could be aided.</P>
    <P>Aids to industry must be strengthened. The type of aid I mentioned in connection with the Cork Shoe Company is the type of aid that must be given in the existing climate.  There is no way in which the Minister can refuse to aid that industry to carry on for a further period.  Possibly as a long-term solution in the future we must look at the grant payments structure of the IDA.  While all industry is welcome, irrespective of its labour content, we must have a greater welcome for and set our sights more on labour intensive industries. The IDA grant structure will have to be directed towards attracting industry giving big employment rather than a high capital industry that does not give as much employment even though it is very welcome in itself. To help not only our industrial employment problem but to create jobs for school leavers of last year and this year as well as the unemployed and the school leavers of future years the emphasis must be on labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>We appealed here to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to protect our shoe and leather and our <Col N="1916" /> textile industries before it was too late.  He paid little heed and said it was impossible.  He set up a monitoring system some months ago but monitoring means little.  Why must we be the good boys of Europe?  We are within the European Community but it appears to me&mdash;I suspect that perhaps some of our Ministers are too committed to Europe&mdash;that our priority must be Ireland and the Irish people.  I read in the papers today that Britain is now imposing tariffs on shoes and leather and textile goods to protect her economy.  There is no comparison between the size of the British home market and our home market.  Our numbers are small in the world market.  Our loss to some of these nations would not be great at all especially if they are made realise that at present we are twice as bad as regards unemployment as any other country in Europe.  Recently we had a tenth country added to the Community in a reply by the Parliamentary Secretary so that we had ten countries there rather than nine in an effort to say that there was somebody worse than ourselves.  We are worse than Europe and, in my opinion, positive barriers should be created to aid those two labour intensive industries. I am sure the Minister is concerned about those in his own constituency. In my constituency we have lost textile industries and these labour intensive industries have been lost in many areas.</P>
    <P>The Government should look completely across the board, look at all Europe and look at all the areas where we could aid our home-based industries and stop State companies importing.  I do not expect they can tell the private sector not to buy outside but at least some barrier can be created to make it less attractive for them to buy outside and encourage labour intensive industries at home.</P>
    <P>We must realise that we are no longer an international creditor nation.  At 30th September this year the foreign indebtedness of the Government and the State bodies plus the net external liability of the banking system amounted to £802 million. Against this we had official foreign <Col N="1917" /> reserves of £572 million.  That makes us now an international debtor rather than a creditor nation.  The Government speak much too readily and act too tardily.  They have done nothing positive to curb our inflationary trend which is undoubtedly the kernel of our present economic problems.  They have given no indication of any positive concerted action in the fact of inflation.  Everybody is now satisfied that the Government have been the chief contributor to the situation.  The record is patently obvious; instead of giving a positive lead the Government have been content to lead from behind. As Nye Bevan said of an English Government in the thirties: &ldquo;We have had enough of your stupidity in smooth accents.&rdquo;  I make the same allegation against the present Government here this evening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the easiest way to deal with the remarks of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald in relation to Verolme and the building of a fishery protection vessel would be to deal with them first.  The position in relation to the fishery protection vessel was that because that vessel carried a gun it was defined as a warship and that placed this country in a very advantageous position as far as having the work done in Verolme was concerned.  If it had not been a warship it would be necessary to include all the shipbuilding companies in the EEC in those asked to tender, and then a decision would have to be made.  If preference were given to an Irish company we would have to substantiate the reasons for that preference under EEC rules.  In the case of the fishery protection vessel we had that advantage so that we could offer the work to Verolme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious, however, that when you are in the position of offering work to one preferred client the question of payment arises.  If you cannot have tenders from five, six, seven or 17 different companies then you must make sure that the people's money is expended properly and that the maker of the ship does not get too much.  That was one of the things that <Col N="1918" /> held up the building of the vessel.  There has been in my Department very detailed consultation with Mr. Van Der Paol and the top executives of Verolme after Irish Shipping had acted as agents for us in the definition of the various changes from the first fishery protection vessel that were necessary and again argued for us on price.  I am glad to tell the House that because of these consultations the price has been satisfactorily reduced and I can now say quite specifically that the ship will be built in Verolme.  Deputy Fitzgerald is quite obviously fishing for information in that neck of the woods and asks when.  If there is anybody, in my considered opinion, who may have been sinned against in relation to the building of this second fishery protection vessel it is the fishermen, not Verolme.  In fact the second vessel has been, to some extent, tailored in time to suit the needs of Verolme workers so that the building that is going on at Verolme will be immediately followed by the building of the second fishery protection vessel.  The main work, as those of us who know something about the thing, and occasionally did get our feet wet, which I do not think Deputy Fitzgerald ever did, in this particular type of manufacturing is in the fabrication.</P>

      <P>We want to see the people of Verolme follow the work they are on at the present moment with the fishery protection vessel.  As well as that there is the question of the stage payments in relation to this vessel.  These have all to be fixed to get the most advantageous bargain for the Government, to get the best chance of work, at the time they want it, for the Verolme people.  The Government must then see to it that no Verolme worker is disemployed at that stage and the Government will do so.  I could not stand up here two or three months ago, when negotiations were at a certain stage in relation to price, and create a situation which might cost the people of this country £100,000, £200,000 or a half million pounds.

      <P>The Cork people will know now what the situation is and how politically nefarious the Deputy is.  That was the position. Negotiations had to be carried on with one firm and one firm only.  I am happy that negotiations have reached the stage where I can say that everything is safe, that we will build it there, that the people will not be knocked off because it has not arrived.  I say, not as a fact but as an opinion, that the people of Verolme were suited well by our seeing to it <Col N="1920" /> that that boat would arrive at the propitious time.  If anybody could make a charge against me or the Government it would be the fishermen who might say that to suit the workers of Verolme the boat was delayed for three or four months.  That is the exact, truthful position and the behaviour in Cork was despicable and irresponsible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I hope is that those people who read what I have said this evening will appraise Deputy Fitzgerald politically.</P>
      <P>The Government, on 7th February, 1973, produced a document known as the statement of intent.  This was a statement of intent by the parties forming the National Coalition of what would be their efforts in Government. As we will be three years in government in March next I think it is time to examine just how far the Government have got in relation to the statement of intent.  The Government are not God Almighty and the Government in those years have fallen on evil times and good times.  Good times in certain facets of our economy, evil times in others.  The people must judge whether or not that statement of intent was faithfully adhered to and whether it produced results.  The statement of intent read:</P>
      <P>There has not been a change of Government in this country for 16 years.  In the last general election Fianna Fáil were returned to power with one of the biggest majorities ever.  Since then the Taoiseach has lost his majority through successive sackings and resignations from his Cabinet and expulsions from his party.  It is entirely his fault that he no longer has the mandate to govern and that he has rushed the country into a General Election in such haste as to deprive young people of their newly given right to vote.  There is no reason to believe that he would be any more successful if granted a further mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In these circumstances, the only <Col N="1921" /> guarantee of strong, stable government capable of dealing with the nation's problems is a National Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>It was true at that time, and I suppose remains true today, that the likelihood of Fine Gael producing an overall majority or of Labour producing an overall majority was small indeed.  Therefore, the punchline in the last sentence of that paragraph that the only alternative was a National Coalition was a true alternative and the blemish which is called to mind by the preceding sentence, the successive sackings and resignations from the Cabinet, from his party, by Deputy Lynch and the hierarchy of Fianna Fáil drew attention to their ineptitude and their quite impossible right to rule, their failure to produce a credible situation on the right to rule.</P>
    <P>Of course, Fianna Fáil must be one of the finest political parties in Europe in many ways.  We must admit that.  Any other party, from the sackings of 1970, who would have continued until 1973 must be, as far as binding together and Tammany Hall politics are concerned, a marvellous party.  They must be to have stayed together over that period.  But, just as we must face the hustings in a year or a year-and-a-half, there came the day when they had to face the hustings and the first paragraph of that statement of intent tells why they were not re-elected.  It placed on us an absolute responsibility first to see to the security aspect, and we saw to it.</P>
    <P>Security is a progressive thing.  I made a speech on Monday last at the opening of the new billet block at Dundalk Barracks which brought the numbers there, all ranks, to 330. Today I hope we will take over the new barracks in Monaghan, all ranks, 205.  We may face the fact that, as far as security was concerned, we were left barefoot.  The expenditure there has been, in my view, paralleled only by the absolute integrity and loyalty of the security forces.  I said on Monday and I repeat now in this House that a nation is as a nation wills, that if everybody stopped playing boy scouts and girl guides, if we had every citizen <Col N="1922" /> backing the security forces&mdash;Gardaí and Army&mdash;to the utmost in their information, their voice and their very demeanour, then immediately, and I have no doubt about this, the cancer of subversion would end.  But there was no agency of Government, no political party or parties, no agency that could get a majority in Dáil Éireann that had the wish and the will to make that effort over the three years.  There was no other such agency except the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition has, among its Members, Ministers, for instance, who are known to be violently antisubversive, publicly known to be such, in fact who have been attacked in various places all over the country because of their views in this regard.  My colleague, Deputy Cooney, is totally and absolutely committed in that regard.  I was committed in that respect also as long ago as 1957 when the funerals&mdash;God rest their souls&mdash;of Mr. South and Mr. O'Hanlon who had been killed in a raid on Rossleigh Barracks in County Fermanagh were passing through the town of Dundalk.  I was attending a county council meeting there.  There was a precedent existing in Louth County Council whereby only next-of-kin of officials or members were the recipients of a vote of sympathy; otherwise we would have been passing votes of sympathy all day.  On that occasion there were 26 members present.  I said: &ldquo;No, had two boys been killed in a motor accident outside the door of this building as I walked in this morning, there would be no vote of sympathy.  Therefore, are we to pass a vote of sympathy to let these armchair generals, these middle-aged geniuses, send young men to their deaths and encourage them to send more?&rdquo; Mind you, a double think arises here.  There are all sorts of views about that sort of thing.  Six weeks later I lost my seat at the next general election but it was worth it because it is true today that if the citizens decide that this subversion shall end, then it shall end.  The Government's job, first of all, is to lead citizens along that path and, secondly, to provide, in the forefront the Gardaí and Army who will see to it that this is done.  They are in the forefront and <Col N="1923" /> it is our job to follow them.</P>
    <P>I was asked also by a television interviewer on Monday was I satisfied with security.  How could I be satisfied with security when there are, as is reported every week, two dead this week, one dead the next week, eight dead the following week?  One finds an average over months that adds, perhaps, to something of the order of less than one death per day.  I give little thought to whether these deaths occur in Sandy Row or the Falls Road.  They are people with families and many of them are fathers and mothers of families.  The grief occasioned in that regard is bad but just as bad is the situation of the factories that did not come here because of subversion.</P>
    <P>The only sheet anchor this nation has&mdash;if they want a political sheet anchor, and they must go to a political sheet anchor because this House is where it all starts and finishes in that regard&mdash;is the National Coalition Government.  There is nobody else who does not bear the blemish of 1970. There is nobody else to whom they can turn and they are entitled to criticise, perhaps to say that our efforts are not sufficient.  But also, in fair play, they are entitled to accept the commitment of the Ministers involved, of the Government and the absolute desire of everybody in the two parties concerned to see to it that there shall be peace.</P>
    <P>The statement of intent of 7th February, 1973, then drew attention to the question of protecting the individual. The parties involved asserted, as a first responsibility, the need to protect the liberty and safety of the individual citizen and to uphold the democratic institutions of the State. What I have just been saying would indicate that we are adhering to that promise and that statement of intent.</P>
    <P>We then said peace through justice. We recognise a particular duty to promote a peaceful solution in the North which would bring an end to bloodshed, injustice and sectarian divisions.  Accordingly, we pledge ourselves to endeavour to secure both those objectives.  That we have been doing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> We pledged ourselves to do our very best in relation to prices and that we have done.  The National Prices Commission produces reports regularly. Action has been taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in every case where he could do so.  I am fully aware that the woman out shopping in the morning with her basket finds prices going up far more than she would wish.  That is so all over the world but surveillance of prices has been stepped up.  Indeed, the work of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this regard must be lauded by all.  It is not his fault if the sheikhs of Arabia make certain decisions.  It is not his fault if commodity prices rise all over the world, as they have done. He is doing his job.  He has got an independent body in the National Prices Commission, the personnel of that body being selected by the Government, a personnel of the greatest integrity and with the greatest desire to protect the consumer.  I would venture to say that we did not in any way take any step that would have increased commodity prices one penny.</P>
    <P>The first thing we did, as an earnest of our commitment before the election, was to remove value-added tax from food.  It is wise that that should not be forgotten.  We said then that the Government would regard the control of price inflation as indispensable and the continuance of national wage agreements. The two parties are convinced that voluntary wage agreements reached at a national level are the best bases for economic development, stability and growth of jobs.  Against all the odds we succeeded in having national wage agreements.  It has been difficult but they have been produced. In a time of roaring inflation it is true that the results could be almost described&mdash;when one takes prices, national wage agreements, the whole economic structure&mdash;as possibly less bad than they would have been had these steps not been taken.  But it was a statement of intent and it was the adherence to that statement of intent by the National Coalition Government which has brought about a lesser adverse effect than there might otherwise have been.  It is right that we should be examined by the people on <Col N="1925" /> our statement of intent of 7th February, 1973.  In regard to social reform we said:</P>
    <P>The elimination of poverty and the ending of social injustice will be a major priority in the next government's programme.  It is conservatively estimated that under Fianna Fáil a quarter of our people lived in poverty.  The social policy of the new government will bring immediate assistance to those in need and lay the foundations of long term policy that will root out the causes of low incomes, bad housing and poor educational facilities. Special legislation will be passed to deal with the plight of the aged, deprived children, the widowed, orphaned and deserted and the physically and mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The money saved as a result of EEC membership will be applied by the new Government to a radical improvement of pensions and social benefits such as the payment of old age pensions at an earlier age without a means test to both men and women.</P>
    <P>A central feature of this social policy will be a complete reform of the system of financing social services through the introduction of a comprehensive social security system covering all citizens.</P>
    <P>We have progressively lowered the old age pension age from 70 to 67 and it is our intention to lower it progressively to 65.  Social welfare recipients in general have had a real increase in their living standards.  In my own bailiwick the Old IRA pensions were increased by 14 per cent in 1973, by a further 9 per cent in 1974 and a further 29 per cent in 1975.  Special allowances paid to persons who served the nation and who are not as well blessed with this world's goods as others are were increased by £23 in 1973, by £16 in 1974 and by £56 a year in 1975.  Public service pensions are now brought up annually to the rates in force on 1st July and all pensioners, therefore, enjoy parity with those who have just resigned.  It is true that during the year there is erosion and these pensioners are on parity only <Col N="1926" /> from 1st July but, even if that is the case, they are still exactly one year better than their counterparts in Britain.  We have kept faith there also.</P>
    <P>It is only right to put on record increases in social welfare benefits.  In 1973 the old age contributory pension for a married couple was increased to £12.35 per week.  In 1974 it was increased to £15 a week and, in 1975, because of the erosion, two increases were given&mdash;the ordinary increase in April and a cost-of-living increase in October.  In the good old Fianna Fáil days&mdash;perhaps I should say bad old Fianna Fáil days&mdash;pensioners waited until 1st October for any increase.  The old age contributory pension for a married couple was £12.35 in 1973, £15 in 1974 and £18.40 a week in 1975.  It was £19.35 in October.  The qualifying age has been reduced&mdash;69 in 1973, 68 in 1974 and 67 in 1975&mdash; and it is our intention to go on reducing the age until the normal retirement age of 65 applies not only to the managing director but also to the unfortunate person on social welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil kept it at 70 for years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I reduced the contributory pension to 65.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The means test for the old age contributory pension has been gradually reduced.  Free travel is available to all over 67 years of age. Pay-related benefits were introduced to lessen the impact of unemployment. These are just a few examples that must be borne in mind.  They show that social justice has always been in the forefront where this Government are concerned.  We played fair and, if there are those who say we did not play fair, to them I <Col N="1927" /> say this is a democracy and that is their democratic right.  However, I am waiting for anyone to contradict anything I have yet stated in relation to our statement of intent.</P>
      <P>The next item in that statement was &ldquo;Housing Emergency&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>The declaration of a housing emergency will be made immediately by the National Coalition Government.  Housing output will be increased to 25,000 a year.  The Fianna Fáil created shortage of dwellings will also be tackled by providing incentives to secure the fuller utilisation of existing houses. Speculation in building land will be ended in order to lower the cost of houses.</P>
      <P>In this period of recession we have managed to build the 25,000 houses a year.  Whether or not we will succeed in reaching that figure next year I do not know, but we will certainly strive to achieve it or even do better.  The most pleasurable thing about this Government in my constituency is seeing the houses being built in my constituency because, if the houses are there and the people are there, the jobs will follow.  If you take tenants out of bad housing conditions and put them into good housing conditions, not alone will you improve family life but you will improve a great deal else.  Prospective employers will follow the houses with factories in which employment will be created because willing and good workers will be available.</P>
      <P>The next item in the statement of intent referred to rent, rates and taxes and the first sentence under this heading reads:</P>
      <P>The unjust aspects of differential rents will be removed and a fair national system of tenant purchase will be introduced.</P>
      <P>During his first six months in office the Minister for Local Government changed the various schemes of tenant purchase and there was a fair system introduced which nobody could object to.  In respect of the houses we have built the differential rents have been applied fairly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1928" />
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was not the promise to remove them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We said we would remove the unjust aspects of the system.  Nobody said anything about differential rents being removed.  It is clear that this system is a good one because if, for instance, a man has several children but happens to be unemployed for a period, it is only right that he be on a lower rent than others more fortunate than he.  One may disagree with the application of differential rents in specific instances but the concept is right.</P>
      <P>We went on to say in our programme that:</P>
      <P>Rates will be reduced drastically by transferring health charges and housing subsidies to central taxation and will be replaced progressively by a form of taxation related to the ability of persons to pay.</P>
      <P>We have proceeded to remove health charges and housing subsidies from local rates.  Had we not done this it is estimated that this year there would have been further increases in the rates of about £1.15, £1.20 and £2.50 in the £.  When Fianna Fáil found themselves without their cloak in the week prior to the general election they said that if returned to office they would remove rates in respect of private houses.  This created something of a dutch auction in so far as the election was concerned but the people did not fall for it because Fianna Fáil did not say how they proposed replacing those rates.</P>
      <P>In regard to death duties we said:</P>
      <P>With a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers, the National Coalition Government will abolish estate duties on property passing on death to widows and their children and replace them with taxation confined to the really wealthy and to property passing on death outside the immediate family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Death duties were abolished on 1st April, 1975 and since then we have not had the application of the taxation designed to replace them&mdash;the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill&mdash;the <Col N="1929" /> purpose of which is to enable a man to pass to his son or daughter property to the value of £150,000 without it being liable to tax.  However, Fianna Fáil have impeded the passage of that Bill through the House.  The death duty system left many families, particularly good farming families, in penury not for years but for decades. Its abolition is one of the great successes of this Government and, again, is another area of the 14-point programme in respect of which we have kept faith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Stopping the Price Rise&rdquo; we said:</P>
      <P>The tragic events in the North have clouded the fact that the economy is in serious trouble because of the indecisiveness of a government distracted by its own internal difficulties.</P>
      <P>I did not read that originally.  I was kind.  The statement continues:</P>
      <P>The immediate economic aims of the new Government will be to stabilise prices, halt redundancies and reduce unemployment under a programme of planned economic development. It is essential to control prices if these important economic aims are to be realised.  The government will, therefore, immediately introduce strict price control.  As an earnest of its good faith in regard to the control of prices the Government will remove VAT from food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1930" /> The Government will regard the control of price inflation as indispensable to the continuance of the National Wage Agreements.  The two Parties are convinced that voluntary wage agreements reached on a national level are the best basis for economic development, stability and growth in jobs.</P>
    <P>As an integral part of its economic and industrial relations policy the new Government will introduce worker participation in State enterprises and the election of worker representatives to State Boards.</P>
    <P>I was remiss in not pointing out that we have produced worker participation on boards of State companies.</P>
    <P>Under the heading &ldquo;Farmers and Fishermen&rdquo; we said:</P>
    <P>Small farmers will be helped by curbing non-farmer speculation in agricultural land, a vigorous land reclamation programme, encouragement of long-term leasing of land and low interest loans.</P>
    <P>The long-term leasing of land is part of the policy of the Minister for Lands and a scheme in this respect has been started.  We said, under the same heading, that:</P>
    <P>The government will plan greater investment in harbours and fisheries in order that our fishermen will get the maximum advantage out of the opportunities offered in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being applied to these projects has increased spectacularly.  Before we came to office Fianna Fáil intended abolishing various bodies in local democracies. In this regard we said in our document that:</P>
    <P>The National Coalition Government will hold it as a priority at all times that power must be vested in the people and that local government must be made truly democratic and relevant to their needs. This is particularly necessary in the field of planning.  Socially harmful property speculation and development will be ended by setting up independent machinery to deal with planning applications and appeals.</P>
    <P>The only reason why the planning Bill has not been passed is that Fianna <Col N="1931" /> Fáil have obstructed it as they have obstructed every piece of legislation introduced by us so far.  They have continued to talk nonsense for no reason other than to impede the Government's implementation of the 14-point programme.  We continue to have a situation in which the Minister for Local Government must rule on planning appeals.  He does not wish this task to be his but he must undertake it for so long as Fianna Fáil continue to hold up deliberately the machinery for changing the system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Which is it better to be a legislator or an agitator?  The entire Fianna Fáil Party have delivered themselves as a bunch of lowly political agitators and they can see no good in any word of a Bill produced by the Government.  To get back to our programme on education we said:</P>
      <P>In education genuine consultation with parents, school authorities, teachers and students will be introduced.  Authority for examinations and courses will be transferred to an independent educational body. The policy of selective compulsion that has proved so disastrous for the Irish language over the last fifty years will be replaced by a genuine policy based on respect for and promotion of the Irish language and culture.</P>
      <P>We have our parents' committees and we have scrubbed compulsory Irish but double marks are allowed for the subject in the leaving certificate. No longer will there be a pass or fail in the leaving certificate but the appropriate markings will be indicated in respect of any student sitting for the examination and on that basis he can be judged by a potential employer.  We have stirred education in a way that it has never been stirred before.</P>
      <P>On the question of the status of women we said that:</P>
      <P>Legislation will be introduced to end all forms of discrimination against women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> How long it will take for the removal of all such discrimination is a matter that is in the lap of the gods.  Last week I was given the duty of putting through the Seanad, on behalf of the Minister for Labour, the measure relating to the pay of bank officials.  I found so far as bank clerks were concerned that discrimination against women will end on 31st December, 1975 and the last instalment of the differential will be paid at the end of the year.  I understand that this is happening in many large and wealthy companies in the private sector although I realise there are other concerns who cannot afford to make the necessary changes.  Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the footwear industry; there are many operatives who are employed in that industry who live in my constituency and I know that the industry cannot afford to take those steps.  I realise that there are problems but the Government have kept faith with their promise.  There are a great number of women who can now claim that discrimination is not being shown against them.</P>
    <P>The 14-point programme also referred to the review of the television and broadcasting services.  It was stated it would be speeded up and that a special examination would be made, as a matter of urgency, of such items as a second TV channel.  It also referred to local radio, the provision of piped television and the relationship of the RTE Authority with the Government.  Have all these things been done, or have they not?</P>
    <P>The programme also referred to tourism and it stated that the Government would carry out a new, dynamic development programme to enable the industry to overcome its present difficulties and get back on the road to progress.  There is one thing stopping us on the road to advancement in tourism and that is subversion. The other side of the House let the dog off the leash in 1970.  If things were peaceful here tomorrow morning it would be years before people in Bradford, Manchester or somewhere else would decide to take their holiday in Ireland rather than in the south of France, in Devon or Cornwall.  Recently I met a man who <Col N="1933" /> spends three days each week in Belfast and he told me that it does not worry him to go to that city and that, in any event, he has to go there on business.  He told me that formerly he brought his wife and children there on occasions and that they visited various seaside places but now he does not do that because he does not have to.  That is what tourism means; a person is not obliged to go to any place if he does not want to.  He can stay at home or go anywhere he chooses.  We are trying to get tourists to come here.  The main reasons for the loss in tourism is first, that the dog was let off the leash in 1970 and, secondly, subversion which we will inexorably, perhaps slowly but deliberately, crush.  That is in the mind of every member of the Government and those who support them in the division lobbies.</P>
    <P>The 14-point programme also referred to the European Communities.  It said that the National Coalition Government will pledge themselves to maximising Ireland's influence within the European Community, to democratising its institutions and to the policy that will assist Irish agriculture and our western and other neglected underdeveloped regions.  We have schemes to aid the underprivileged areas, we have the farm modernisation schemes, the scheme relating to the disadvantaged areas and we have the scheme with regard to headage grants. We would be remiss if we did not note that the greatest impact ever made by any Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs was made by the present Minister Deputy FitzGerald.  He worked in co-operation with every other Minister, perhaps with me in a very minor way because I do not have that much to do with matters relating to his Department. He worked with the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to a greater extent.  With the other Ministers he has worked for the benefit of Ireland.  When one has to deal with a large institution such as the EEC in a period of a few years it is not all plain sailing and one does not score a goal every time a boot is put to the ball.  However, any fair-minded person must agree that our record in <Col N="1934" /> relation to what we said in February, 1973, is good.</P>
    <P>The 14-point programme also had a heading entitled &ldquo;A New Beginning&rdquo;. The programme stated that the two parties recognised that these policy priorities constitute the basis of the legislative programme of the National Coalition Government and that the implementation of these proposals will transform Ireland into a modern, progressive society based on social justice. We have played fair on all of this.</P>
    <P>In the last three years we have had our good times and our bad times.  On many occasions farmers went to the fair and, while they might not have got the best price for their animals, at least they did the best they could. We were prepared at a time when there was a falling market to fight for the best for the people and, when things were good and the market was rising, we were prepared to take full advantage of that.  Before I became Minister I remember nothing the price of ground North African phosphate which is the basis of all phosphatic fertiliser in the country and it was marked at $15 per ton but some months ago it was $79 a ton.  That raised the price of the more common type of fertiliser from £30 per ton to £100 per ton.  At the same time there was a disastrous drop in the price of cattle.</P>
    <P>The current President of the IFA has been drawing conclusions on the basis of farm income in 1973 and 1975. I agree with him on this because 1974 was such a disastrous year, especially with regard to the drop in beef prices abroad, that it would be totally unfair to compare prices in 1974 with those in 1975.  To do that he would be putting himself at a grave disadvantage. To show what farmers had to put up with because of the drop in prices in 1974, I quote from the report of the Development Division of the Department of Agriculture with regard to statistical indicators.  It stated that with regard to seven to eight cwt. cattle, from 1973 to 1974 the price dropped 22.5 per cent.  In December of that year it dropped from £16.24 a cwt. to £11.7 a cwt.  The heavier cattle, those from nine to ten cwt., in 1973 to 1974 dropped by 13.5 per cent.  There were <Col N="1935" /> drops recorded in October of 24.4 per cent and in September of 22.7 per cent. That is the kind of climate in which the Government had to operate, that is the situation in which they had to implement their 14-point programme to which I have referred.  The result was that for the first time since 1953 there was a drop in agricultural prices of 3.7 per cent from October, 1973, to October, 1974.</P>
    <P>One of the things the Irish farmer does in which he is not often wise is that he lives off his own fat.  He may have lost confidence because of this international situation, which was nobody's fault, and which was aggravated by the increase in the price of animal feeding stuffs of 31.3 per cent at the time when there was the drop I have indicated in the price of cattle, in the year 1973-74.  That was the most disastrous year for farming it could be possible to have within the EEC, remembering that we have not full powers as yet and will not until July 12 months.  The result was that farmers did not have the sort of confidence one would expect them to have and they did not do the sowings and the ploughings, did not keep the extra heifer and the extra cow and did not make the effort that it would have been wise for them personally to make in the year 1975.</P>
    <P>While I realise and have drawn attention to the fact at a recent agricultural meeting that the reference in Brussels a few days ago to an increase of 7½ per cent is a reference to an increase in price and not in net income, I would advise every farmer to make every effort in the spring to grow more. If one wants to go back to James Dillon one could say the farmer should have one more sow, one more cow, one more acre under the plough.</P>
    <P>It is possible on a farm to have a greater amount of grain and to have the same number of cattle and to make a better effort.  The Russians are short of grain.  They have bought large quantities in the world markets. That must have an effect on the world price of grain.  Therefore, I say, grow more grain this year and keep more cattle this year.  I see a bad situation <Col N="1936" /> inasmuch as we have had as many as 400,000 to 500,000 cows slaughtered this year.  I am advised that some of those cows were not milch cows, that they were cows used for single suckling and may have reached the end of their period.  Also, of course, single suckling is not paying.</P>
    <P>It would be completely wrong if the cattle population were to drop and the farmer had not the wherewithal to cash in on the situation which will develop because beef prices will remain up.  With all these economic indicators set fair, there should be a big expansion in the volume of agricultural production.  The farmer who increases production will do a good job for himself and for his country. It seems to have been forgotten, particularly in this House, that 1974 was a very bad farming year.  The President of the IFA, Mr. Maher, is perfectly right to compare 1973 as a normal year with 1975 and to disregard 1974.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is still the sheet anchor and it has an important part to play in the creation of employment.  If agriculture is prosperous, there are more industrial goods purchased. Agricultural goods are processed by Irish labour and sold abroad.  Irish agriculture employs more than any other industry.  The net export of Irish agriculture per £ sterling is greater than that of any other industry.  If we import raw materials to manufacture cloth or for the manufacture of industrial goods for re-export we are largely exporting the product of our people's labour.  When we export a bullock, 90 per cent of the money received for that bullock represents net income for the country to be set against our balance of payments and it is money that can be spent at home in a Buy Irish campaign.  This sets the cycle in motion again.</P>
    <P>Our industrial exports were to some extent affected by the world recession. In 1972 industrial exports were 57.7 per cent of total exports; in 1973, 59 per cent; in the bad year 1974, 63 per cent and in January-June, 1975, 61.1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Wage costs per unit of output did increase.  That may be because there may be industrialists who are not <Col N="1937" /> modernising or it may be that workers are not producing as much as they should.  In 1973 wage costs per unit of output increased by 10.9 per cent. That is bad.  In 1974 wage costs per unit of output increased by 15.8 per cent.  That is worse.  When you compare the first half of 1975 with the first half of 1974 you get an increase of 28.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>The answer is in the present policy of the Government.  Nobody is being asked to make great sacrifices. Everybody is being asked to make haste slowly&mdash;<i>festina lente</i>&mdash; for a little while.  If we do that, the best economic advice we have is that we will emerge from 1976 ready to meet all competition.  We have, by whatever agency, certainly not the Government, created for ourselves a situation where wage costs per unit of output have been rising.  If we can halt that and create the situation where we will be competitive once again at the end of 1976, then there is nothing to stop us.  There is the codicil that we have got to kill this subversion as well.  If we can succeed in these twin aims the Government will have done well.  The Government will work hard towards the achievement of those twin aims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has taken an interesting turn in that on the Government side time has been taken up talking about irrelevant matters.  Even the Taoiseach, in the absence of any record of achievement, came into the House and gave a recitation of chores which the Government are paid to carry out, things which would happen if no Government were there at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing this Christmas season a situation in Ireland such as was never experienced before.  It is in that context that we are anxious to hear particularly from the other side of the House what under heaven are we going to do to get out of it.  The Taoiseach went on television recently and left us all trembling in regard to what the future holds.  He made some serious statements. He gave us a frightening figure.  He pointed out that the country was in deficit to the tune of £980 million.  It is in that context <Col N="1938" /> that we asked for an Adjournment debate, not to hear Ministers coming in here reciting things that happen in the normal life of a government, like collecting dog licences, looking after the sale of stamps in the post office.  The Minister for Local Government mentioned speed limits. We are on the verge of a complete breakdown in the national economy. We have borrowed, we have taxed, we have allowed prices to run amok, we have now reached the point of no return and we are asking the workers to tighten their belts.  Despite this the Minister, who has just spoken, had the audacity to say that there is prosperity around the corner.</P>
    <P>I am not being personal when I refer to the political gyrations of the Minister for Finance.  He recently promised that he would have a plan before Christmas but he did not say which Christmas.  Like the Minister for Defence, he comes into the House and puts his mouth into gear before his brain is switched on.  We are apt to get statements which are not founded on fact or supported by any logic that would lead us to believe them.  The Minister for Defence spent the time allotted to him in the House by reading over what he called a statement of intent but which is nothing other than the famous 14-point programme introduced in February, 1973.  He glossed over the two most important points in that programme.  He read those points quickly but the points which were effectively telling, so far as anybody gave credence to them at the time, were the solemn pledge by the Coalition to stabilise prices, bring down the cost of living, stop redundancies, reduce unemployment and reduce the local rates.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in referring to this complete fraud which was perpetrated on the Irish people as it does not serve much purpose now.  We have mentioned it time after time.  It is now water under the bridge.  It has to do with the credibility of the people who made the promises and it is up to them to wriggle out of it whatever way they can.</P>
    <P>We should be discussing the serious <Col N="1939" /> situation the economy is in at the present time.  What has gone wrong? Where did the Coalition go wrong? Why did they not take action?  Those questions are on the lips of every citizen at the present time.  If I was asked to give an opinion about where they went wrong, I would say they did not go wrong because they never were right.  The panic action we are now being asked to take in a time of crisis is one which could have been obviated if the correct fiscal and monetary policy was pursued in the budgets we have had since the Coalition Government came into power.  I have yet to hear an economist who will deny that that is not where things went wrong.  Why did the Coalition Government take the advice of the Central Bank now when they did not take it three years ago, when they got the same warning as we got before we left office?</P>
    <P>Why is there no economic programme? Why are there no projections to guide the people and give some indication where we are going? Why did the Minister for Finance come in here a few months ago and promise there would be a plan?  I spoke at a number of public meetings when I referred to the fact that those involved in the economy were like shepherds in the mist with no indication as to what government thinking was for the future, because they have no plan whatever.  A few days after the Minister made the public statement that there would be a plan before Christmas he elaborated in the House, in the course of a discussion, and said that it would be different from Fianna Fáil programmes, that it would give an indication how the set target would be achieved.</P>
    <P>The only reference to a plan by the Minister for Labour when he spoke this morning was to ridicule the plans which Fianna Fáil had in the past, the first, second and third programmes for economic expansion. He said they were of little use when they did not in many cases reach the targets set.  This was a stupid statement. Everybody is agreed that any economy in any developed or developing country today must have a plan, <Col N="1940" /> must have projections and must have a coherent programme.  They must have something to aim at if the economy is to make any progress.  I do not for a moment hold myself up as an economist but I went to the trouble of looking at the opinions of others regarding this question of planning.</P>
    <P>I want to refer particularly to an Adjournment debate in the House on the 14th December, 1972.  The motion was by a leading member of the Fine Gael Party and of the Coalition Government on the question of planning. In addition to Deputy Bruton, who raised the matter on the Adjournment, Deputy FitzGerald also spoke eloquently on it.  They were seriously worried that the Fianna Fáil programme was due to terminate at the end of December and they were worried why another one was not produced to replace it.  They pointed to the dangers inherent in the lack of foresight by Fianna Fáil.  As usual Deputy FitzGerald was eloquent in support of the need for a programme and for a plan if the economy was to be guided in any particular direction.  I will not delay the House by reading the entire debate but will refer to column 1749 of the Official Report of 14th December, 1972.  Deputy FitzGerald spoke in support of the various programmes about which he wrote quite a bit in the course of his career before he became involved in Fine Gael politics.</P>
    <P>I admit, that to a large degree most of the programmes have been objective, but the most objective programme necessarily favours the Government in power when it is published...</P>
    <P>That was the theme of his speech and the only criticism he had of our programmes at that time was that they were an advantage to the Government. Deputy Bruton and himself pointed out the seriousness of facing the New Year without the new programme having been announced.  If as he agreed then, a programme and a plan were necessary and of advantage to the Government in power, what has seriously prevented the present Government from <Col N="1941" /> coming up with any type of programme?</P>
    <P>In &ldquo;Economic Development and Planning&rdquo; there is an article by Dr. FitzGerald in praise mainly of Fianna Fáil programmes.  There are articles by most of our leading economists at the time all supporting programming and planning in any economy.  They rightly point out that irrespective of whether the targets are reached or not, whether what is set out in the programme is achieved within the time set out, it is still of great importance in that it guides the entire economy in the direction the Government want to go.  Targets may not be reached or may be surpassed but the important thing is that everybody, particularly potential investors and those who have invested, should know what the Government projections are and the direction in which to go so that all involved in promoting industrial expansion can plan and work accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is particularly important to those whose duty it is to safeguard the integrity of our currency and in that respect I quote from what the Central Bank said in their report covering 1974.  On page 10 they said:</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that credit policy, being part of general economic policy, should be aligned with the basic economic objectives of the Government.</P>
    <P>That is an important statement and they are being very kind.  What they are saying is that it is disastrous when the Government operate a policy which is diametrically opposed to what the Central Bank knows is the correct one.  It is a most significant statement and its relevance and truth are very apparent to the people tonight.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank have only a limited capacity to safeguard the integrity of our currency in the sense of maintaining domestic purchasing power as distinct from its exchange value in relation to sterling.  I quote again, from page 8:</P>
    <P>Some hold the belief, which tends to paralyse action, that the Irish rate of inflation is automatically determined by external factors because of our open economy and the <Col N="1942" /> fixed parity relationship of the Irish pound to the pound sterling.</P>
    <P>Whether our Government held that belief or not action was paralysed. Would any speaker on the Government side during this debate tell the people why the action that has become necessary now as a panic measure was not taken two-and-a-half years ago when the dangers of inflation and the action necessary to curb it were as well known as now?  Were they content with the appearance of doing things in the belief that the marriage in the National Coalition would not last as long as it did?  Why were day-to-day measures taken which actually fuelled the flames of inflation? One of the 14 points that the Minister read for us just now deals specifically with prices and to deal with prices would get to the root of the entire problem because removing the cause of price increases would really be dealing with inflation in the way that some attempt is now being made to deal with it.</P>
    <P>What effort was made?  First, the same machinery that we had was relied on in spite of the fact that a prior announcement was made that some drastic action would be taken. Many items were released from the control of the National Prices Commission. Then the Government themselves got in on the act and, as employers, they contributed to price increases directly on at least five different occasions, not to mention the serious effect of their tax impositions which could only have disastrous effects on the inflationary spiral at the time.  Then we found it necessary to borrow money wherever we could and shovel it into the furnace that was consuming the base of our economy and the potential and capacity from which we should now be rebuilding and taking advantage of the fact that import prices are falling and the devaluation of the Irish £ abroad should give us an advantage in selling abroad.</P>
    <P>We have so eroded our competitiveness in the foreign market that even with reduced import prices and the advantage of a devalued Irish £ production is going down.  For the first time in the economic history of this or, perhaps, any economy, a reduction <Col N="1943" /> in imports is a sign of decay and a stagnant economy rather than the usual good omen it would be at a time like this.  It is only an indication that we have been living out of the larder. We have gone farther.  We have now eaten the seed that should be germinating to enable us take advantage of conditions of which other countries are taking advantage to restock.</P>
    <P>That is the position we have reached and in that serious situation the Leader of the Government goes on television to tell us that the only thing we can do, apart from praying, is to tighten our belts and make no demands for increases.  We have been informed, by innuendo at least this evening, that we will have other legislation which will impose restrictions on increases in different sectors of the economy but there is no suggestion that we will have any plan to guide either the people who are in charge of our credit policy, if there is one, or those who might be thinking of investing in the economy here at some stages.  They are left wondering what might happen from one day to another.</P>
    <P>The basis of any economy and particularly ours for any expansion and any movement towards full employment must be manufacturing industry. The number of people employed in manufacturing industry here is relatively small but it is the one sector on which we must rely for any reduction in unemployment figures.  It is estimated that 19 per cent of those at work are in manufacturing industry and I think that includes the processing industry.  It is estimated that 18,000 of those have lost their jobs in recent times.  Those are factual figures and this is what we have to cope with.  That industry has been established on a sound basis and it has a market of 220 million people to which to export.  Although our industrial base was only established in recent years it was well established but it has been clubbed into insensibility on a few occasions in the last two-and-a-half years.  If we are concerned about expansion and the provision of opportunities for our young people, apart from the 110,000 <Col N="1944" /> who are unemployed, we must pay serious attention to the economic base from which we must expand.  The services industry is a spin-off from manufacturing industry and it is estimated that every job created in manufacturing makes for another job in the services industry.</P>
    <P>What have we done with regard to manufacturing industry?  At a time when it needed to be underpinned we took every action to ensure that it was undermined.  We raised our costs at every opportunity.  We raised ESB charges, postal charges, rates on properties. We created new taxes.  We raised the wages of employees which drove them out of employment and brought many firms to liquidation or at least caused them to have liquidity problems which they may not overcome. Whether we have speed limits or not is not terribly relevant if we are to go to the wall due to downright and culpable negligence.</P>
    <P>There have been 18,000 people put out of productive employment in manufacturing industry.  It is reliably estimated by economists that to provide 20,000 extra jobs per annum requires an investment per annum of £400 million.  We were told today that the work force is increasing by about 30,000 per year.  We have 110,000 unemployed and an unknown number of school leavers.  The Minister recently told us it is much easier now to get one's leaving certificate but after they get the leaving certificate people can get nothing but the boat and there is no work abroad for them either.  Where are we to get £400 million to invest in the expansion of the economy at a time when the existing industries cannot find enough money to keep going?  How are we to create 20,000 new jobs per year when we are borrowing to pay for shortfalls in estimates in relation to every Department of State?  The money we should have available to us to take advantage of the improved situation in the other European countries is being absorbed in the servicing of debts, the repayment and servicing of the most extravagant borrowing that any country has ever indulged in in the history of democracy.</P>
    <P>That is the situation in which we <Col N="1945" /> find ourselves and about which we will hear nothing from the other side of the House.  Where do we go from here?  Those other countries that took the necessary action to curb inflation and hold it to the minimum are now in a position to move ahead and while they are so doing we will be lagging behind with a permanent scar as a result of our lack of action or of the wrong action we have been taking all along.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have to say with regard to the crisis in which we find ourselves when he comes to speak.  Probably he will do as other Ministers have done, refer to all the things his Department have been doing during the year.  In other words, they were moving; they were not dead and things happened.  We have been getting a recitation of this from everybody who comes in here to speak from the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>We have been hearing a lot about the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign.  The last speaker faithfully made reference to it on a number of occasions.  How we can justify asking our people to buy Irish when we buy our boats from Japan is beyond me.  There is no excuse that anybody can make in this House that will justify that action at a time when the economy, metaphorically, is on its knees, with our people wondering where we will turn to get out of the recession into which we have been plunged up to the neck. That is only one of a number of instances that have been covered by other speakers here.  How can we expect people to go out and buy Irish-made Christmas cards when £500,000 worth of steel for which a Dublin firm have tendered for NET in Cork is handed over to a foreign firm at no more a competitive price, with the displacement of a number of young men working in a factory in this city?  How can a Government justify those things if there is something slipping unknown to them?  At least it is an indication that they are not seriously bending themselves to the gigantic task inevitably facing them and everybody in the country in the crisis we are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House cannot <Col N="1946" /> be blamed for not making known, on every possible occasion, what was likely to happen.  The last speaker referred to us as a lot of agitators instead of legislators.  There is not much more we can do other than agitate.  When we see about to happen what we know will cripple the country in the years ahead, the least we can do is agitate.  But an obstinate Government, without a plan, programme or policy, will go merrily along, let things happen and borrow when it is not possible to get the money by any other means, with no regard for the base from which our prosperity must spring the base from which our expansion must be derived, the launching pad from which we take advantage of the improved conditions in the world.  We find ourselves now literally mortgaging the future for many years during which we shall be struggling when other countries have regained their feet, have got back on the road to prosperity and overcome the effects of what was referred to as a recession.  Every country must deal with inflation in its own way.  We were sick and tired listening to the Government telling us that this was due to factors beyond our control.  That cliché became sickening.  The Central Bank, in the most diplomatic language they could use, frequently harped on the fact that the main factor of inflation was domestically produced, that we were contributing to it here more than could any import prices through culpable negligence in one way, by deliberately creating taxes in another, allowing prices to get out of hand and not having proper control over wage demands and incomes policies.</P>
    <P>At present&mdash;and everybody in this country knows it to be a fact&mdash;certain commodities do not come under the control of the National Prices Commission. When one goes into a store to purchase something it is almost a question of thinking of a number.  When one sees an article displayed which one thinks might cost £1, frequently one finds that it costs £5.  No attempt is being made to have any price control, nor is there any attempt being made to have an incomes policy.  There is no economic planning, no direction as to how we are to progress in the future and no guidance for those who should <Col N="1947" /> be investing.  Without investment no country can have expansion.  It is fine to get up and talk for an hour about social welfare, the amount each individual can get and the attendant conditions. What about the source from which the money must emanate that will be redistributed to our people who, through no fault of theirs, cannot find employment?  Are they of no consequence? Was not private enterprise and the enterpreneur-type of individual almost ridiculed in this House when the Government took office? We were being told then how we could not quickly enough get at the abundance of wealth that had to be redistributed.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were accused of not taking sufficient and proper action to ensure that the affluent society, as it was being named, would not be made immediately pay everything that could be taken from them with no regard as to how they would recoup themselves and continue to produce wealth for the country.  No socialist, no economist, no Government, or member of it, has yet found means of distributing wealth without first creating the means of producing it.  Having created the base from which wealth will spring, that base must be carefully nurtured.  In a recession it must not be undermined, it must be underpinned and obstacles must not be put in the way to prevent the continuing generation of wealth.</P>
    <P>That is where this Government have failed hopelessly and why they are in their present serious position.  Perhaps some of them have a vested interest in ensuring that there is an economic crisis.  It is well known that socialists have learned that revolution springs from economic crisis.  Certainly, the climate has been created for that sort of thing at present.  I do not know if our people are fully conscious of the serious position in which we find ourselves. Ministers have come in here one by one and, instead of re-echoing what the Taoiseach said the other evening&mdash;and I take it what he said was correct&mdash;confirming the warning he issued, they have continued, like the last speaker, to give the impression that everything was all right, that prosperity was just around the corner <Col N="1948" /> and there was nothing to worry about. The last speaker said the Government had a tremendous record.  Why did the Government not take action at the right time?  Why did they not produce a plan?  They were very interested in plans before they came into power.  In their 14-point programme they said expansion would take place and unemployment would be reduced in a planned economy.  These 14 points were just political cosmetics designed only to catch votes.</P>
    <P>I am responsible for the preparation and co-ordination of Fianna Fáil policy and planning&mdash;I would not attempt to say for its production&mdash;but I have learned sufficient in the course of the preparation of that policy to know there are two ways of producing a policy.  One is to sit down for ten minutes and write out a list of pious aspirations and the other is to have recourse to the resources available and to the capacity of our people and, on those, to base a possible forecast as to what the future is likely to be in the international field, taking all the relevant factors into consideration and aiming at a policy which will provide a higher standard of living for a growing population.  That policy cannot be produced in a night.  Policy must be carefully considered.  Policy is nothing like the 14-point programme of February, 1973, when everybody knew inflation had the world in its grip.  Prices were rising but, remember, in February, 1973, we were holding inflation to a modest 3 per cent per annum.  The parties opposite came together in coalition and inside half an hour produced their 14-point programme in which they undertook to reduce prices, stabilise the economy, increase employment and thereby reduce redundancy. They knew perfectly well they could not do these things. Neither had they any intention of doing them.</P>
    <P>Now they come in here and present themselves as a credible Government.  The Taoiseach announced a national deficit running at £980 million.  Things could not have been much worse in the last two-and-a-half years had there been no <Col N="1949" /> government at all.  Things would have been better had the Government listened to the expert advice available to them.  The Central Bank reports used the most diplomatic language possible and, in that language, pointed out the blunders that were made.  Couched in ordinary language, the Central Bank report asked: Why the hell did the Government not act before the national wage agreement was negotiated?  Why did they not put their cards on the table and have an agreement of the kind that would take the measures being attempted now instead of locking the stable door when the horse had bolted?</P>
    <P>These are the things we want explained instead of the irrelevancies to which we have been listening from Ministers up to now.  We have had a recitation of what has happened in the last two-and-a-half years.  Tell us first of all why action was not taken when it should have been taken before we reached a crisis.  Why were prices and wages deliberately allowed to increase when the opposite should have been happening to save the economy, protect jobs and create the basis on which we could now be preparing to move ahead?  That is what we want explained.</P>
    <P>We also want to know what action will be taken now.  Will there be a plan?  Will credit policy be such as to give an impetus to productive development, with no barriers in the way of those who generate wealth so that they will be able to compete in foreign markets at a time when import prices are no longer rising and the Irish £ should put our exports in a favourable position on foreign markets?  We do not seem to be in a position to take advantage of these things.  I doubt if we have ever had a greater demonstration of incompetence and inability. The Government are compounded of elements which will not mix.  The ingredients which would engender agreement are missing.  They continue hoping, Micawber-like, that something will turn up to prevent the worst happening, that the Government £ will not bounce and that, in the last analysis, is the outcome of a serious <Col N="1950" /> situation of the type we are in now. In January we will be faced with a budget which will impose increased taxation on the old reliables.  We have been told that there is already a curb on the drawing from bond of cigarettes, tobacco and spirits.  In other words, it is known what items are to be taxed further in six week's time. These old reliables must be reaching the stage of diminishing returns.  They could not produce sufficient revenue to balance the country's housekeeping account for the year ahead.  No doubt many other items will be taxed further also and there will be serious curtailment of some of the most important programmes.  This was obvious from what was said by the last speaker in relation to building when he said that we shall have to wait and see what the coming year will bring in this regard.</P>
    <P>From where will the money come for productive development or for the creation of the incentive necessary to enable the cattle stocks, which have declined seriously in recent times, to be built up again?  What money will we have to ensure that industrialists will expand their plants and that new industries will be established?  Where will we find the money for the creation of the necessary protection of those on whom we depend for the expansion of our economy in the years ahead?  When the slate has been cleared in those other countries that have looked after their domestic housekeeping properly by keeping their inflationary spirals to a minimum, we will be left with a permanent scar.  These are the questions which need answering during this debate.</P>
    <P>The reports I have quoted from all indicate that the Government are negligent in their duty and have taken the wrong course.  Such reports as that produced by the OECD are based on calculations made by people who have the necessary expertise for the proper examination of the economic system of this or any other country but that was not needed to let us know the situation we are in.  During the debate on the first budget introduced by the National Coalition I said that a budget of that type at a time when <Col N="1951" /> the inflationary spiral was getting out of hand was wrong.  I predicted that if that type of policy were pursued, under the guise of an expansionary policy, it would lead ultimately to further unemployment and eventually to a crisis stage which would necessitate real action having to be taken. In the sixties we had an inflation rate of 3 per cent.  We all know that a certain amount of inflation can be good and can result in putting money into the hands of people who otherwise would not have money, that it creates a circulation of money and stimulates purchasing power.  It can help a developing country but when it gets out of control and reaches a stage where it endangers employment and the possibility of expansion, it is very serious.  For so long as the Government continue to take so much money from the people they must bear the responsibility of manipulating the economy.</P>
    <P>Whether it came from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or anywhere else we have had too much of the attitude of taking credit for what is good but denying responsibility for what is bad.  The electorate are sufficiently intelligent to know when politics are being played. I would say to those who would like to see democracy destroyed and find revolution in an economic crisis that they will be disappointed because democracy is sound and the people are the last court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to part of Deputy Lynch's speech, the thesis of which was to the effect that the present situation is totally the fault of this Government.  Having listened, too, to Deputy Brennan, I ask myself whether it could have been possible that these two gentlemen were in the recent past office holders in government, especially when one has regard to their approach to the substance of this debate which deals primarily with matters economic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe that is the reason why they are in opposition.  Deputy Lynch devoted a good deal of his speech to referring to the OECD economic survery of November, 1975 and Deputy <Col N="1952" /> Brennan has admitted that he is the co-relater of such policy or programmes as Fianna Fáil may have and he hardly referred at all to this document.  His contribution was made, one would imagine, without any knowledge of what appeared in that report.</P>
    <P>If we are going to pass judgment or make a contribution in this debate, a little constructive thinking is necessary. If the present circumstances are the fault of Government policy one would imagine that in between all the verbiage and the hours of speech-making of the Opposition some small, constructive contribution or an alternative suggestion would be made.  We have had nothing of that nature from the Opposition so far.</P>
    <P>It would be well to remind the Deputies on the Opposition benches that the Government came to power shortly after our accession to the EEC.  It is right to say that it was freely admitted by members of Fianna Fáil that they were somewhat unprepared for the advent of EEC.  They were responsible for the public service and it was very apparent at the time of our accession to government that very little preparation had been made to prepare the public service for our entry into the EEC.</P>
    <P>One cannot consider the present circumstances without taking an overall view of what occurred both prior to and since the Government took up office.  One must have regard to the general nature of our economy, the way we produce our goods, the way we export them and the reasons for our imports.  I have not heard any reference made to the fact that we are primarily an agricultural exporting country and that basically our imports are of some raw materials but that there is a large percentage of what might be called finished products.  It seems to have been lost sight of that virtually a price boom increase in import costs of commodity products hit this country in 1973.  We are a country that is highly dependent on external trade, both exports and imports, and if there is an adverse swing in world commodity prices a small country like Ireland <Col N="1953" /> will be hit much harder than our fellow members in the EEC.  This has become very apparent in view of the recent international trade recession.  It has gravely affected Irish exports but I will deal with that and other aspects later in my contribution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made the point that during 1975 there was a moderation in world commodity prices but he did not refer to the situation concerning oil.  It has been said in some quarters that there is now on average approximately a 30 per cent lower price in world commodity markets than there was in 1974.  However, that is not the full story.  Just because commodity prices may decrease in part, that does not necessarily translate itself into the price of the finished product we import. There is some time before these matters take effect.</P>
    <P>In 1974 there was a relatively poor market for Irish agricultural products, both from the point of view of price and of market.  Basically we were relying on intervention and it is part of the past history of economic thinking here where there was no forward thinking in the marketing of Irish products.  This combination of factors &mdash;I have only mentioned a few&mdash;has had very serious repercussions on our internal price levels.  If commodity prices go up it is bound to give rise to a demand for increased wages to allow people to pay for the goods they previously bought so that they can maintain their standard of living.  It is a natural reaction by the working and salaried population.</P>
    <P>It is said quite freely that our inflation rate is possibly in danger of getting out of step with the European inflation rates.  For myself I do not think this is a fair or full judgment of the situation because one must look at the economic relativity of Ireland <i>vis-á-vis</i> our EEC partners.  We were not in the EEC prior to 1973.  All of us are aware that when we entered the Community prices rose considerably and very fast and that our prices, which previously had been protected behind tariff barriers, had to equate themselves with already existing European prices.  If one talks about inflation during the years one <Col N="1954" /> must be careful about passing judgment on the real inflation in Irish terms because there was a large element of compensating for a different situation that existed prior to 1973.</P>
    <P>There was certainly nothing to be read or heard from Government Ministers in 1972 about preparing ourselves for entry into the EEC.  If the Government of the day cannot give the lead it is natural enough that the rest of society will be caught out or will not be prepared for what is coming.  There was no excuse for the Government of that day not to warn the public about what they had to face.  At that time there was a complete failure to warn the industrial sector of the importance of costings. There was a failure to provide for updating and modernisation, a failure to prepare for European marketing. What we are suffering from now is largely the fruit of those sins of omission by the Government in 1972.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is natural enough that the Government in 1972 may not have been able to deal with national problems, not to talk about external problems.  They seemed to be primarily oriented to dealing with their own domestic problems in their party and this was freely recognised by the public, as was proved by the results in the last general election.  It is interesting to note that the trend of voting to support the present Government in their work has been one of approbation, if one is to judge by the votes in the by-elections that have occurred since February, 1973.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the spokesmen, particularly on labour and industry, on the Opposition benches that at the time of the EEC referendum it was freely said off platforms that there was a likelihood of 20 to 25 per cent of Irish businesses going to the wall under EEC conditions because they would not be able to compete, that they would not be able to stand up in an area of free trade and competition.  Those statements have in part proved right though one must admire the resilience of Irish business and Irish labour to stand up to the difficulties that we experienced when we went into the <Col N="1955" /> EEC and it was only virtually since the oil crisis that the real damage started.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that there are certain business or parts of the Irish industrial structure that have suffered more than others.  I believe that the difficulties being postponed can be related to the traditional conservatism of Irish business and the way they had of husbanding their resources.  This traditional conservatism probably helped initially and had the effect of retaining unused resources and these unused resources have since been applied to keep continuity in business. Probably not wise economic decisions; they carried on as they were before without making the necessary adjustments to face foreign competition.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note, if I am correct in this approach, that production and employment have been specially affected in the older industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and furniture and that the more modern industries, for instance, chemicals, have fared far better.  Indeed, employment in the chemical industry increased in 1974, contrary to the trend in other businesses.</P>
    <P>I believe that in the past and even into the present we were possibly not paying sufficient attention to industries that can be linked to agricultural production. The by-products of agriculture hold for this country the best prospect for the future.  We have seen that despite difficult economic circumstances the agricultural sector appears to have stood up to the storm of international recession far better than other sectors of production.  If we could create more industry allied to the raw materials from agricultural production we would have a very good future.  In that development lies the best prospect of dealing with the increased number of persons who will be available for employment in future years.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous multiplier effect of channelling resources in that direction.  It would give greatly increased employment; it would certainly assist our balance of payments; it would certainly improve export figures and it would have a continuity that other forms of production do not <Col N="1956" /> always have in periods of recession. Because people must eat, there will always be a demand for food.  Europe is fast creating a situation where all the countries will have to look carefully at their ability to provide food for their own people.</P>
    <P>Might I in passing refer to a matter I have already referred to in this House?  It is a matter of pride that in the fish processing industry we are actually exporting a product to Norway and the product that we export to Norway is better than the Norwegians, with all their modern technology, can produce from their own fish.  It is a small industry that is doing it but there is, I understand, more or less unlimited demand for this product.  Furthermore, the product we are exporting is not a fully-finished product.  The processing goes only part of the way to the ultimate finished product.  Even at that level we are well ahead of anything that any other fishing nation can produce.  This is proved by the fact that Norway will take all that we can produce of that type of material.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that for far too long we have been satisfied to export unprocessed agricultural and fishery products and have allowed other countries to reap the full benefit and profit of the great employment potential plus the finished product price which is greatly in excess of the price the raw material will fetch.  I believe we can produce the finished product and that we should channel our resources and any available capital in that direction.</P>
    <P>Times change very quickly and there have been very rapid changes in all spheres of Government activity and Government Departments in the last two years.  If we are to get the best results from our nation's potential in productivity and native raw materials and so on we must have a careful look at the education of those people who are going into industry.  We will have to reassess our educational and training priorities.  We have, through AnCO, made very positive steps in that direction. It is interesting to note that the OECD Economic Survey of November, 1975, at page 30, says:</P>
    <P>Manpower training has expanded <Col N="1957" /> rapidly in recent years and it is considered desirable that this momentum be sustained.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Brennan said, experts have made out that report.  They have the ability to compare the Irish circumstances with the circumstances of other countries of the OECD.  If they make a statement like that there must be something behind it.  It shows that the Government have not been lacking in their endeavours in that direction.</P>
    <P>There may have been an undue emphasis on the study of Arts by school leavers.  Constituents and parents have said to me that they realise that sometimes they have made a mistake in regard to the lines of higher education to which they have directed their children.  They come back to the obvious remark: &ldquo;What did we know about it?&rdquo; That is fair enough because a lot of parents have children with higher and better education than they got in their time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that there were rapid price adjustments made in 1973 to allow for parity with EEC prices. This had the effect of driving up wage demands.  It is well to note that the average earnings in industry rose by 19 per cent in 1974 and also that the production from industry did not rise by that amount.  Naturally, as inflation had an effect on prices, when allowed with what I have already said concerning adjustment in prices, there was a slightly vicious circle which contributed to the inflationary price push.  This, unfortunately, has had the effect of eroding our competitive margins and has left us with less room for manoeuvre.</P>
    <P>It is stated that the volume of consumer spending decreased in 1975 but the actual quantity of cash value does not appear to have done so.  A lot of the retailers in family business are not complaining despite the recession effects on people out of industry because we have underpinned the situation by a proper social welfare policy. After all, when one is talking about economics and prices one is also talking about human beings. Economics exist for the benefit of human beings.  There is not much use <Col N="1958" /> in having a wealthy country if large sectors of the people go in want and do not get the necessities of life. There is certainly a very strong plank for the Government to see that government is for all the people and not for any particular sector.</P>
    <P>As a result of recession there is possibly a fairly substantial unused capacity in industry.  People point to this as one of the reasons for a lack of investment or a fall in investment. I have not seen anybody carry out any exercise to define the particular area of investment.  When I first came into this House a tremendous amount of money was made available for speculative property investment. This was not investment which was for the good of the nation.  Investment, which was required and should have been provided in 1972 and prior to that to lay down the infrastructure for the EEC and our entry into that Community, was not channelled into productive spheres, to machinery, factories and know-how.  That was apparently a little page that was omitted from the Fianna Fáil programme. We are now paying for that.</P>
    <P>One must remember that 1972 was a boom year.  It was a good year for business in every part of the world but we failed to take advantage of it due to the inner difficulties of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Every Tom, Dick and Harry was jumping on the speculative bandwagon of property buying and selling in 1972.  There was not a bank manager in the country who was not belaboured for money for speculative purposes.  That type of speculation and investment was no use to the nation and it is well it has disappeared.  It was self-defeating.  It denied the use of available resources for banks because it was already tied up with these developments.  I have heard whispers that certain financial institutions found themselves in serious difficulties as a result of the amount of money they handed out to these speculators.  I believe a lot of these financial institutions have now managed partly to rectify their difficulties.</P>
    <P>That type of situation is not of any assistance to the economy.  Farmers were refused money whilst property <Col N="1959" /> developers got it in any quantity they required.  The well is not bottomless. Every nation has only a certain amount of cash resources.  The money was being buried in this.  Some attacks have been made on the taxation policy of the Government but when the profits were made by those speculators that money was not put back into Ireland.  It went outside the country.  One would think that some of the Fianna Fáil spokesmen were like ostriches who have just taken their heads out of the sand after two-and-a-half years because they do not seem to be aware of the cold and difficult air currents that have blown across the economic spectrum of the world.</P>
    <P>There is another facet of membership of the EEC.  There is bound to be a large proportion of novel products coming into the country from the EEC.  There is always a certain initial novelty attraction and people out of curiosity will buy products they have not seen before.  All one has to do is to go into a fashionable ladies boutique and see the names on the garments.  When they are shown to women one finds they will opt for some French or Italian name rather than an Irish one.  This has a certain false attractiveness.  That sort of thing is likely to subside in time because there are many Irish products which are equally good and up to any standard that a continental house can produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan waxed very eloquent that we were supposed to have known all this two-and-a-half years ago, that the signs were there. Did he ever bother to read the pronouncements of the Taoiseach since he came into office?  Perhaps Deputy Brennan was out of the country when they were delivered or perhaps the think-tank of the Fianna Fáil Party does not allow the reading of such things.  There has been repeated and ample warning given by the Taoiseach in respect of the dangers and difficulties the economy must face up to.  The Government are being very careful.  In every economic decision they have made they have consulted the parties who are involved in <Col N="1960" /> the productive process, the agricultural industry and the unions.  Every sector has been consulted.  Anybody who reads the reports of the Prices Commission will see that there has been very careful consultation with the interested parties.  One would think, listening to the speeches across the House, that the Government were bone headed and just charged ahead in isolation without regard to advice or consultation with the interested sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>I will deal with a matter to which Deputy Brennan referred but he twisted it and tried to use it to show that the fact that we had a depreciated currency should assist us in the export market.  I do not know what think-tank he consulted when he compounded that canard.  If your currency is depreciating, the price of raw material goes up; your costs go up: and to say that a depreciating currency will assist your exports is to consider only a very small part of the picture.  You must first get your raw materials and manufacture them before you get to the stage of export.  Deputy Brennan also seemed to forget that export prices for agricultural products moved against Irish interests.  That is one of the reasons why we have the adjustments in the green £&mdash;to make some compensation in that regard.  These matters are glibly ignored by the Opposition. They wail away about their troubles and when they cannot understand them they say: &ldquo;It must be the fault of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I notice from reading newspapers circulating outside Dublin that obviously a speech sheet has been handed out to Fianna Fáil Deputies to spread the gospel&mdash;repeat it and hand it in to the Press; get the message across as often as you can; if you say it often enough somebody is bound to believe it.  One of the great things at the moment is the analysis of the unemployment situation&mdash;we are running the country into bankruptcy; unemployment is rising and it is the fault of the Government alone.  Many people like to say that the rate of unemployment here is the highest in the EEC. Let us return to relative comparisons and let us go back over the year. <Col N="1961" /> Taking certain figures issued recently&mdash; I do not have to give them; they are printed and available&mdash;one would think that we had the worst record of unemployment in the last two years in the EEC.  In actual fact, we came out second best; the only country that did better in the unemployment situation as between 1974 and 1975 was Holland. We were better than Germany; our percentage increase was less than that in Germany, far less than England's and far less than in all the other EEC partners.  The only country to do better than we did in containing the unemployment surge rampant in Europe was Holland.</P>
    <P>At this stage in our history we are not indulging in the export of human beings at the rate, approximately, of 30,000 per year which is more or less the steady figure that prevailed under Fianna Fáil Governments.  When talking of the rate of unemployment one must look at what was the pre-existing unemployment situation.  Take 30,000 off the present figures and you are around the average Fianna Fáil figure over the years.  That takes in good years, much better years than we have this year when there was international depression, no industrial unemployment, no failure of markets and no oil crisis.  These were also years when a great number of people were not deemed eligible for the unemployment register under Fianna Fáil.  The categories of those who qualified have been increased.</P>
    <P>There has been references to the effect of the budget but it is well to remember that if it were not for the June budget and the adjustments then made to ease the situation, unemployment would have been higher by 15,000 to 20,000.  That is no mean achievement for a government plus being able to reduce inflation and actually increase exports over the import figure for the first time since 1945.  That has been done in a bad and difficult year as anybody, no matter what his political prejudice may be, must admit.  There are records that Opposition spokesmen might well bear in mind when rushing into criticism.  I know they must do their job and throw as much flak as possible but if they come in to knock <Col N="1962" /> something what will they put in its place?  It is no use being completely destructive.  Also, the present Government are carrying a security Bill of £120 million per annum to keep law and order.  Fianna Fáil never had that bill to meet.  We hear glib spokesmen opposite criticising; let us hear what they can say constructively.  Then we can have some sort of debate if they are not a bunch of Annie Oakleys seeing who can knock harder than anybody else.</P>
    <P>We are, relatively speaking, in the EEC context a poor and only marginally developed country, partly due to our history and partly to economic circumstances and, perhaps, partly to political circumstances internal and external. It seems to me that there is a slight failure on the part of EEC thinkers to realise how necessary the regional development programme is for Ireland and a failure by them properly to appreciate this fact means that Ireland has to borrow to make up the deficiency.  It is not of her own making; it is an international situation that has given rise to this necessity and the failure of the EEC properly to appreciate what a regional fund is for, how it should be utilised, where it should be allocated and in what circumstances. We now seem to be fast approaching a situation where money made available from the EEC will be lent and that the grants and subventions are disappearing.  This seems to be in complete contradiction of the principles of the EEC and will have serious repercussions on the weaker nations.  If a person is prepared to sign on the dotted line as we were, I do not think that is the proper way to deal with weaker nations because they will always have this difficulty in regard to our situation in hard times.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that there is only a certain amount of work that any Irish Government can do to assist this country in hard times.  It is fairly clearly stated by implication in this OECD economic survey report on page 28 under the heading: Outlook in 1976:</P>
    <P>Developments in the economy in 1976 seem likely to depend to a considerable extent on the strength <Col N="1963" /> of external demand.</P>
    <P>In other words, they are excluding much assistance by the EEC in our predicament as one of the poor relations. This has also given rise to considerable difficulties.  We are a country that is struggling to provide as much employment as possible.  We will not have the resources to control inflation to the same extent.  We must bear in mind the fact that we have been linked to the pound sterling and a large part of our export market is in England.  If England takes off at a high rate of inflation and her inflation rate is higher than ours by at least two points we are bound to be affected.  We are bound to suffer. This, in fact, has happened.  Our link with sterling and close ties with the British market, both export and import, has not been a help and this has partly contributed to increased wage demands and increased commodity prices.  Admittedly, we were able to do something in this regard in the June budget.  That budget has also given us some time to stop and think and look at our national housekeeping and the present difficult circumstances and it has brought home to many people, who did not appreciate it previously, that circumstances are difficult and that people will have to contain their demands and take a more realistic attitude to price increases.</P>
    <P>We are faced with another difficulty and it is that the recent curbs introduced in England are likely to adversely affect Irish exports to England.  In other words, we are getting the worst of the English situation both ways.  The weakness of the British economy and, in particular, its exceptional rate of inflation has reacted on the Irish economy with special gravity.  The counter inflation programme being implemented by the British Government, if successful, will probably mean that money incomes in Britain will rise considerably more slowly than their prices over the coming year.  It is calculated that this will be approximately half the inflation rate.  It will mean that consumption and investment in Britain are likely to be affected adversely as a result. This will mean that the British steps <Col N="1964" /> taken to improve their situation will bite deeply into our export market there and will very adversely affect us in the short term but in the long term, if their measures are successful, it will be to our benefit.  We had to suffer enough from British inflation and its effects on our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said that the Government were contributing to inflation and he referred to prices.  We reduced the price of food by taking off VAT in June.  He said we increased taxes. We have not, so far as essentials are concerned.  The wages have been a reflection of increased prices, basically 90 per cent of which, up to a year ago, were reflected by world prices.</P>
    <P>People may talk about taxes as being an inhibiting factor to production in the welfare society.  I am told it is not popular politically to refer to strikes but I have no inhibition about referring to them and about condemning out of hand unofficial strikes.  I would like to see the Irish Congress of Trade Unions taking stronger and more severe steps with members that are affiliated to them who go on unofficial strikes.  It is well to remember that there is a thing called sanctity of contract and if you agree to something you try to hold to your bargain and honour it.  That does not permit people without any reason or without fair cause or fair notice to withdraw labour and cause unemployment in other sectors of society.  It is a selfish attitude.  It does nobody any good and it has the effect of imposing an increased tax on the business or enterprise in which the strike takes place.  I am not against the right to strike but I am against unofficial strikes, particularly where there is immunity under the Trade Disputes Act for people who strike.  It would be well for certain people not to abuse this democratic right that they have.  It is an exceptional right, an exceptional privilege, and should not be abused.  I am afraid it has been abused all too often in recent times and the figures, when one compares unofficial with official strikes, show an unduly high proportion of unofficial strikes.  This means that there is some control going wrong in the trade union world that needs careful looking at.  A small <Col N="1965" /> country like ours cannot afford the luxury of strikes.  When we compare our strike record with that of Japan or Germany it makes very poor reading.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the financial facilities for the farming community.  I believe the banking fraternity and the financial fraternity are not giving a fair and proper service to the agricultural community.  There is no regard to the particular situation existing in agriculture be it today, tomorrow or yesterday.  When a farmer borrows he is not able to repay with the same facility as a business.  His turnover is far more restricted and usually money being borrowed for agriculture has so many legal strings and expenses attached to it that to borrow money for agricultural enterprise is a great deal more expensive than to borrow money for industry.  We are an agricultural country and I would appeal to the banking world to have a more realistic attitude to the lending of money to the Irish farmer.  Basically, the Irish farmer is a conservative financial animal.  He is prepared to take a far smaller profit than his compatriot in industry or in the labour market.  This should be realised and appreciated by the banking fraternity. I see very little evidence that it is at present.  There is no comparison between what the average Irish bank offers to the Irish farmer and the facilities offered by the financial institutions on the Continent.  Provision of finance for agriculture should be a matter that is possible to arrange in the private sector by private clients going to their bank manager and getting fair treatment.</P>
    <P>The land of Ireland is ample security.  It will never lose its value. But one would think that in obtaining money of any substance from Irish banks&mdash;I am talking about the amount being borrowed&mdash;there is frightful difficulty.  One cannot progress unless one has the necessary finance to expand and it is badly needed in Irish agriculture.  We have plenty of evidence of what the Irish farmer can do for the nation when we are under pressure.  This last year has provided ample evidence that, despite their phenomenally increased costings, they stood by the nation, increased <Col N="1966" /> their productivity and exports and provided the necessary moneys to give us a favourable balance of trade. It is not right that other sectors of the economy can sit back and criticise.  It is time the banking fraternity realised that Irish agriculture has been under considerable pressure in the last few years, due to costings, and that a more reasonable approach should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I do not have very much more to say except that if there is any change in taxation law, one should bear in mind the sad mistake made by the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in 1952 when he miscalculated the elasticity of demand in applying the tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this very important debate I should like to point out, first of all, that this is a period of stocktaking.  We had some contributions from Government backbenchers as to what we should do. Surely this is a period in which we should assess the progress the Government have made.  In that regard, in the industrial field, the Government are guilty of national sabotage.  In relation to prices they have been guilty of deliberately misleading our people.</P>

    <P>I want to deal with the question of prices first.  I am concerned about the Dublin housewife and, indeed, with every housewife in the country. There was no mention of the housewife by any Government spokesman. Probably they do not feel she is worthy of mention.  I took time off today to go into a supermarket to examine the situation in relation to the housewife's problems, how she is faced with ever-growing demands for more cash at the counter.  I found that five pounds of potatoes cost 35p, which is the equivalent of £156.80 per ton.  That is what the Dublin housewife pays for potatoes.  Surely there is something wrong here.  I found that turnips cost 3½p per 1b, cabbage 12p per head, lettuce 11p per head, cauliflower 23p a head and steak 70p to 90p per 1b.  I often wondered why potatoes had different names.  The ones I saw today were called Golden Wonders.  Now I know <Col N="1967" /> why they are so called.  The humble spud will certainly be a luxury in a short space of time if these price increases continue.</P>
    <P>In the 14-point plan of the Government about which we have heard so much we were promised that every effort would be made to ensure that prices were maintained at a reasonable level.  Nobody can say that farm produce produced at home is at a reasonable level.  The Government have failed miserably in their responsibility to the families of this nation on that, their first promise.  There has been no price stability over the last three years almost since they assumed office.  Then we were told they have honoured their 14-point plan.  I would ask any reasonable Minister to tell me that they have maintained the prices structure over the last three years.  No such effort has been made and the housewives of this country suffer day after day from the ever-increasing spiral in the price of foodstuffs.  One could understand increases in imported materials to a substantial degree.  But, when it comes to farm produce&mdash;when I am positive the farmer is not getting a fair return for his money and the housewife is being bled white&mdash;the middlemen who sit in offices up to their knees in carpets milking this country dry are profiting while the Government sit idly by.  It is about time the Government woke up and endeavoured to honour their promises in relation to the commodities basic to the table of the average family. Perhaps Ministers are too far removed from our people.  Perhaps their concern is not for the housewives of this city.  Perhaps it is because of their ability to pay they do not feel the draught felt by many families at present. Remember that was one of the points contained in that 14-point plan they produced prior to the last general election and on which they grossly misled the nation.  Many housewives fell for that plan because they believed they were honest men who would implement their promises of price restrictions and the maintenance of price stability.  In this single instance we can see how they have misled our people, deliberately lied to them on other occasions, with no intention <Col N="1968" /> whatsoever of honouring the pledge they solemnly gave.  Had they any honour, they would vacate their seats now and ask the public to decide, because the public have been grossly misled, misinformed and the Government have been complete failures.  The Minister for Rising Prices has raised the price of every single commodity in his just three short years in office. Recently it was butter, petrol, bread, flour, every single item, so much so that some people refer to him as selfraising Justin.  Everything he did constituted an increase imposed on some section of the community, the man given the job of maintaining price stability.</P>
    <P>I heard a housewife say recently that, going to a supermarket now, she would need to bring a wheelbarrowful of £ notes.  She said if she went inside and there was a thief outside, he would probably steal the wheelbarrow and leave the £ notes there because they were of no value.  That about sums up the situation.  We must have regard for the housewife, family food and, indeed, for the children of this nation.  We must ensure they get the necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>Some people have been fooled by the increases inadequate as they are in social services feeling that with them they would be able to maintain a certain standard of living but, within days of those increases the price spiral recommenced.</P>
    <P>We have the pathetic situation now where the promises and the word of Government Ministers is no longer accepted because of the succession of broken promises.  I am dealing now only with farm produce in this country.  Again, neither the farmer nor the housewife gets a fair crack of the whip.  Recently the Government had meetings with the trade unions, the farmers and the captains of industry as they call them.  They did not call in the Opposition.  They have a job to do and they must either do that job or get out.  The first item in the famous 14-point plan was the maintenance of a reasonable price structure.  That has not been honoured and they have no intention of honouring it now or in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1969" /> There has been sabotage of industry. This is not the first occasion a Coalition Government have been guilty of national sabotage.  On previous occasions they were also guilty of the same offence.  On the first occasion they were guilty in regard to the chassis factory at Inchicore, the short wave station and in relation to a variety of projects which had been under way.  They sold the Constellations Aer Lingus had purchased for the trans-Atlantic routes and they thereby deprived Aer Lingus of substantial routes that were not available at a later stage.  We do not forget that.  The trade unionists do not forget the national sabotage.  On the last occasion they deserted the nation in the middle of the night leaving behind 100,000 unemployed.  On this occasion they have excelled themselves.  They have not yet deserted their posts but there are 109,000 unemployed and 3,500 on short time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity of speaking, if he takes it.  I want now to deal with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Recently we had a manufacturing concern, the Creation Group, who had been State aided by the IDA, forced out of production because <Col N="1973" /> of taxation imposed by the Revenue Commissioners.  In circumstances such as these the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who is a member of the Labour Party sent labels to Britain to be printed.  That is an indication of the concern of the Labour Party for the jobs of Irish workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should table a question to the Minister who will deal competently with it and who, no doubt, will tear the Deputy to shreds in the same way as he dealt with Deputy Colley last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have questioned the Minister already on this issue and he has admitted that labels were sent to Britain for printing.  We have the parrots and pigeons of the Labour Party quacking at Government meetings but disregarding the people who put them into office.  Deputy Coughlan is aware that in his area there are substantial factories which are the result of Fianna Fáil effort. He knows, too, that the industrial estate at Shannon as well as industrial estates in other parts of the country are the result of Fianna Fáil effort.  We have never shirked responsibility or deserted the Irish workers.</P>
      <P>The printing of the labels for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was not the only Government order to go to Britain.  There was, too, the NET contract.  The firm which tendered for this £600 contract and which was regarded by the then advisers to NET, Kelloggs, to be worthy of submitting a tender were told by a director of NET that they had been successful but later it was decided to give the contract to a British firm without regard to the 110,000 people who are out of work.  Is there any excuse for this sabotage?  Is it an effort to drive Irish industry to the ground?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason given for the change in the decision on the contract was that the firm had not done this type of job previously.  From this we may conclude that the oil rigs which will be built in the future cannot be built by an Irish firm because no Irish firm <Col N="1974" /> would have carried out this type of work before.  I know that Irish workers, engineers and technicians are capable of reading any blueprint. They are sought the world over.  Their ability is evident in such bodies as Bord na Móna, the ESB and elsewhere.</P>

We are told that they have made arrangements to purchase furniture in England although there are hundreds of Irish workers from the furniture manufacturing industry on the dole queues.  Surely the Government should exercise some control in <Col N="1975" /> this sort of situation.  I urge the trade unions to wake up, to throw off the shackles of the Labour Party, to forget about standing ovations at Labour Party conferences and thereby ensure that there will be jobs for their children and their grandchildren. While the present mob are in power there can be no future for our people. We are told by reliable sources that unemployment figures will increase by another 20,000 or 30,000 but there is no indication from the Government of any effort to solve this problem. Ministers have told us that until such time as they know the full extent of the problem, they cannot produce a plan.  In other words, there is no hope for the unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>A terrible tragedy is facing the country.  We heard a lot about industrial disputes.  Let us look at the situation in relation to industrial disputes during the period when we heard so much about industrial relations and about Ministers working overtime to ensure we had better industrial relations.  In 1973 approximately 270,000 man-days were lost as a result of strikes but in 1974 when we had the great Minister for Labour and when other members of the Labour Party were in Government 552,000 man-days were lost as a result of strikes.  This shows quite clearly that industrial relations were bad and that the Government did not solve that problem.</P>
      <P>In the manufacturing industry, which is the important industry at the moment, in 1974 there were 122 disputes involving 26,500 workers and a loss of 172,000 man-days.  In 1973 when Fianna Fáil were leaving office there were only 85 disputes and a total of 71,000 man-days lost.  It will be clear from this that in the area of industrial relations, as in the area of housing and in other spheres, the record of the Government is not good.</P>
      <P>What is the Government's solution to these problems?  It is to set up a committee, a special committee, a research committee, to have a survey team or a working party investigate the matter.  I do not know if those bodies all mean the same thing because it is rather confusing.  When the Government want to change the image they change the title of the body they set up.  They have set up more committees, sub-committees, working parties, research committees and survey teams than the previous seven Governments.  They have achieved nothing.  All we have are enormous price increases and the present critical state of industry.</P>
      <P>Recently the Minister for Labour introduced a statutory wage agreement for the banks.  The Taoiseach mentioned this in his speech but it was difficult to understand what he meant.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear now that it is the intention of the Government, <Col N="1977" /> if agreement on a pause is reached, to introduce legislation providing for restraint in non-pay income, including dividends, directors' fees and rents similar to that which would apply to pay under the present agreement and the pause.</P>
    <P>Apparently, if there is no agreement nothing will be done but I will point out that there are areas other than the banks that must be concerned. Housewives are anxious to ensure that there will be a price freeze.  There has been a statutory wage freeze imposed by the Minister for Labour even though he spoke against it on many occasions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were the first to introduce a wage freeze at a time when there was no price freeze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to explain exactly what he means by that statement.  His attitude and that of the Minister for Labour and other Ministers has been to control the people.  In other countries the people are told when to get up, what to do and when to go to bed and that may happen here.  That mentality is present in some sections of the Government. When freedom is taken from people the Government move towards controlling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present situation was mishandled by the Government.  By fraud they misled trade unionists, the honourable men who endeavoured to negotiate on behalf of workers.  They were grossly misled because after substantial negotiation between the workers and employers they were told a different situation now existed, that the economy was about to collapse. All the time the Government had this knowledge but it was not conveyed to those who were making the agreement. This deceit is one reason why they will never be trusted again by honourable trade unionists who are endeavouring to do a good job for the workers.  If the true position had been revealed prior to the agreement the position would have been much different. The Government would not have come into the House with legislation <Col N="1978" /> that had to be rushed through in a matter of hours in order to ensure that there would be a statutory wage freeze.  It is deplorable that an honourable section has been hoodwinked by the Taoiseach and his Ministers and supported by the yes-men on the back benches.</P>
    <P>We were told about the amount of legislation put through this House recently and the Bill relating to anti-discrimination was mentioned.  Before that Bill was introduced the trumpets were sounded for months but when it was introduced it was found to be a farce and to be completely defective, with a bias against a person who applied for equal pay.  Even though amendments were accepted from this side, the main amendment was not accepted and the result was a defective Bill.  The Minister now is unable to honour the commitment in relation to equal pay for work of equal value. In his speech the Taoiseach made the following comment:</P>
    <P>The Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, provides for equal pay by the 31st December, 1975.  The Minister for Labour was presented with a report by the Labour Court yesterday which finds that the obligation to pay equal pay on the due date could result in a significant loss of jobs.  The Government have, therefore, decided that amendments to the Act are necessary with effect from 1st January, 1976.</P>
    <P>All the assurances given to women workers that they would get equal pay as from 1st January, 1976, have been blown sky-high.  I suggest the Minister never had any intention of implementing the Bill.  It was introduced as a device so that if there had been an election in the meantime the Government could point to the Bill as a token of their sincerity in giving equal pay. However, we now see that this will not happen.  The Bill introduced by the Minister is of no value and it discriminates against the person who puts forward a claim for equal pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was purely a holding device in case an election came in the meantime.  They thought possibly that some people who professed to have guts and courage might do what they said they would do on previous occasions and did not do.  They come into the House to interrupt and have not the courage to do what they said they would do on previous occasions.</P>

    <P>We were told by the Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, on numerous occasions, about the great free health scheme that people would get.  The trumpets were brought out time and again.  Handouts from the Government Information Services were flowing freely in relation to this health scheme.  As the information was pumped into the media the media swallowed it as they swallowed the anti-discrimination pay Bill and as they swallow all Government Information Services handouts.  We knew it was a fake.  We knew that this would happen.  There has been no free health service.  A free health service was promised. When they came to the House and looked for the necessary legislation they got it but they did nothing about it.  Again, it was a device to fool <Col N="1980" /> the people.  If the Government want to test the situation they should go back to the people.  A banks Bill recently went through the House.  We know the effect of that and what it really means. The bank porter can be jailed and the cleaner can be jailed but the banker is immune from jail as a result of a section of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with another Labour Minister, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  I have already explained the situation facing industry and recently there was an offer by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to hand over portion of our airwaves to the foreigner.  We are told from reliable sources in RTE that this would mean 600 jobs.  Again, we have a Labour Minister who is not concerned about the employment of Irish people, who would ensure, if he had his way, that a further 600 persons would be in the dole queue.  I want to put this question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is going to speak: Is it the intention of the Government to ensure that the unemployment figure will rise to 170,000 or 180,000 in order to cure the situation? This is one school of economic thought that was mentioned by a Government Minister on a previous occasion, that as unemployment increases the tension lessens in relation to inflation.  If that is the course they are pursuing, fair enough, they are doing a good job in meeting that target but they are doing a very bad job in relation to the people who are in the dole queue.</P>
      <P>It appears to me that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who sends his labels to be printed in England is not concerned about 600 jobs for Irish workers, is not concerned for Irish men or Irish women.  This man is not doing his work or he would know that there are people unemployed.  It would appear to me that the only time this man goes into his office is when he wants to raise the price of stamps or the television licence or to get himself on television and that when he comes into this House he feels it beneath him to answer questions.  The only substantial contribution he has made is to increase postal, telephone, telegram and television licence charges.</P>

      <P>I want to deal with the question of housing where we have another Labour Minister, Deputy Tully. There are 30,000 fewer persons employed in the building industry than there were when the Government went into office.  The timber yards are full of timber.  The cement factory has not made cement available in the quantity that it made it available on previous occasions.  The cement company say there are hundreds of thousands of tons of cement that have not been used.  The timber merchants' stores are chock-a-block with timber and there are 30,000 fewer employed. The Minister for Local Government tells us that he is building more houses than ever before.  He must be building them without cement, without timber, without sand, without men.  We would like to know where the houses are so that we could see them.</P>

      <P>Where are the houses?  You cannot build houses without labour, without cement, without sand, without timber.  Where are the houses the Minister is building? Is he using the figures?  Is he faking the figures, the starts one year, the completions another year, using the completions or the starts in a particular form to present a particular <Col N="1983" /> picture?  Let me say this, and our Leader, Deputy Jack Lynch, mentioned it this morning, there has been a change in outlook on the part of the Minister for Local Government in relation to local authority accommodation. Local authority accommodation has been built up in one aspect.  We wanted to ensure that the greatest possible number of people would have a stake in this community by owning their homes.  I want to quote from a booklet produced by the IDA in relation to private housing which states:</P>
      <P>About 70 per cent of all dwellings in Ireland are owner-occupied&mdash;one of the highest owner-occupation rates in Europe.  The diagram below shows the percentage of total national housing stock which was owner-occupied at a recent census date in a number of European countries.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that we have more people with a stake in the community and we have more people who own their homes.  That is a good thing. Assistance should be given to people to ensure that they can have their own homes, that they should not have to go into flats.  This proves that Irish men and women are prepared, if the facilities are available, to own their own homes.  The percentage of Irish people who own their own homes, is 68.8.  The diagram in that booklet gives the following:</P>

    <P>This is a creditable record in relation to home ownership.  The drift has been away from home ownership in recent times and there are a number of reasons for this.  There are a number of reasons why a Labour <Col N="1984" /> Minister does not want people to own their own homes because they have found in other countries, where people have purchased their own homes, where they had a stake in the community, they no longer supported the bullyboys who make all the noise, like Deputy Coughlan has been making here.  From 1973 onwards we know the position.  The Minister has been pressed on numerous occasions about increasing the loans for house purchase.  Again, he has reneged on the people that he made a solemn promise to that the opportunities would be there.</P>

There is an undesirable diversion from the promise given that people would own their own homes. In 1973 70 per cent of the people were willing to take that stake in the community.  This is an insurance policy in itself.  We wanted to ensure that people would have the opportunity to own their own homes.  Until such time as the Minister for Local Government wakes up and the back benchers in his party tell him what the people want we will not have an improvement in the situation.</P>

I want to give some indication of the situation in the city, how <Col N="1985" /> the position has gone out of hand and how the Government and the Attorney General failed to act in relation to people on the housing list or the people who are in rent arrears. In April, 1972, rent arrears in Dublin Corporation amounted to £300,000 but the position in August, 1975, after almost three years of Coalition Government, is that the figure is now £1,554,000.  This abnormal jump shows clearly that there is a problem in relation to rent arrears.  The highest arrears case is £1,600 for a corporation tenant.  There are also others of £1,394 and £1,330.  Dublin Corporation are not very concerned about this.</P>

The reason for this is that the Minister for Local Government told them they had two years to pay so nobody paid during the two years.  We have the situation where people who are willing and able to pay and want a home are deprived of one while old age pensioners, widows and orphans will be forced to pay out additional taxation to meet this arrears situation.  We are told in a report from the principal officer of the housing department that the Attorney General advised they were not to proceed under the Forcible Entry Act but were to proceed under another Act.  The Garda will not act now.  We see the small number of court proceedings that are taken and we see the terrible problem of people on the waiting list who are entitled to and want homes but who get no support from the Government.</P>

I refer to the corporation collectively, the Deputy and I and other members.  It is another matter, whether or not the Deputy was there but, collectively, the council decided that the squatting situation must be terminated. What happened?  We were told by the Attorney General that we could not proceed in that way&mdash;that those people must be left where they are, in other words.  We have a serious situation, both in relation to squatting and rent arrears and it has caused unrest and problems for the families entitled to accommodation.

      <P>I have a lot to say but I have only one minute left and I want to speak about the recent increase in the cost of fuel for central heating.  Deputy Tunney made an effort to raise the matter the other day on the Adjournment and he was denied the opportunity.  We want to know why supplies were held back for two weeks.  The normal delay when one orders central heating fuel is two or three days.  One person who ordered fuel on 1st December had it delivered on 13th December, the day after the price increase and had to pay the new rate.  We ask the Minister to find out in how many cases were fuel orders filled prior to 13th December and how many after that.  It appears to us that fuel supplies were delayed and that substantial profits have found their way into the pockets of the oil companies.  We ask the Minister to find out how many fuel deliveries were made on the Saturday morning when the new price became effective, how many were made in the preceding days and how many were made on the following Monday and Tuesday, how long the orders were outstanding and how much injustice was done to housewives of this city who were endeavouring to ensure that they would have a source of heat available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose in this debate to speak generally about foreign affairs although there are many things one could usefully discuss about the role this country played in the past year.  Instead, I propose to confine my remarks to the situation in Northern Ireland and to what Deputy Dowling in a masterpiece of understatement referred to as &ldquo;the disturbance&rdquo; in that part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1988" /> The Taoiseach today, in opening this debate, said that we cannot look with disinterest at the plight of our fellow countrymen.  We cannot remain indifferent to the pattern of the last six years in part of this island of killings and bombings and tortures, proliferation of protection rackets, the growth of sectarian killings and the suffering in purely human terms to which they contribute.  I think that when we speak about this suffering here the dominant consideration in our minds and in the way we express ourselves should be concern for our fellow Irishmen in that part of the country, people who are part of us, who are not external to us or outside us but who are Irish people like ourselves in this island and who are suffering from the violence and the results of the violence over the last six years.</P>
    <P>In examining this problem I think what we should try to do is not merely look at its superficial manifestations, not merely try to see what solutions we can find in the immediate and short term.  If we are serious about it and want to achieve any real, lasting results we must seek to identify the causes of the problem and seek to eradicate them.  The causes of the problem are basically fear and what we might call counter-fear.  In what we say we should have regard to this. Nothing we say in this House or outside it should be calculated to raise the temperature in Northern Ireland or to arouse fears already so near the surface.  As the Leader of the Opposition said, speaking on 24th October: &ldquo;When the situation is one where careless words can lead to death just as certainly as calculated acts, then it is a duty on every responsible politician and citizen to resist the temptation to resort to rhetoric or flamboyant oratory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The ultimate source of the problem is the fear of the Unionist million in Northern Ireland, their fear as a minority in this island, and it is this fear which led them to break away from the Unionists of this island as a whole, resisting home rule and to seek a separate solution, separate from the Unionists of those days in this part of <Col N="1989" /> the country.  As a result of the policy they then adopted decisions were taken in 1920 and in 1921 which have led to the present political division of Ireland. I think one can say with certainty about that division, and say it in a nonpartisan way, that it did not eradicate the fear of this million people as perhaps they had hoped and expected it would.  Instead, that fear remained and manifested itself in the way in which fear does manifest itself when people who are in a state of fear are in a position to exercise control over others whom they fear.  It manifested itself in discrimination and in repressive measures against those who had thus become the minority in Northern Ireland.  The minority suffered accordingly for over 50 years.  They have suffered since through the violence of the past six years and at times I think that the Unionist majority in Northern Ireland take insufficient account of the scale of the suffering of the Nationalist minority there in this latter period.  I think that opinion down here is often insufficiently alert, too insensitive to these sufferings.  During the last six years they have, at different times, suffered from violence and threats of violence from three different sources, from the Provisional IRA, from the Protestant para-militaries and, at certain periods it must be said also, from the security forces, who in their attempt to control the situation have acted in a manner which, from the point of view of the minority, was certainly repressive.</P>
    <P>They suffered from the threat of murder and knee-capping at the hands of the Provisional IRA and other associated, or perhaps I should say, dissociated groups, as they constantly split from each other to murder each other and others as well.  They suffered through the sectarian murders of the para-military bodies who still continue to be a cause of fear and it must be said of scandal because of the freedom with which they claim what they call credit for the most appalling atrocities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry. <Col N="1990" /> Thank you, Deputy.  They suffered also from the actions of the security forces at various times and at times they must not have known where to look, seeing violence coming at them from every angle.  But the majority are also suffering, not merely from the mindless violence of the Provisional IRA and other similar groups, the indiscriminate violence of the bomb and the all too discriminating violence of individual murders of members of the Protestant majority by the IRA but they also suffer from other psychological factors. They are suffering from the loss of such sense of security as they did have &mdash;they had some sense of security though not sufficient to drive out fear&mdash; during the 50 years of their dominance from 1920 onwards.  They have lost that sense of security.  They are also suffering from something even more fundamental, a loss of their sense of identity.</P>
      <P>The situation that existed for 50 years was one that allowed them, perhaps, to delude themselves that there was some correspondence between their determination to hang on to control of that area and their loyalty, as they saw it and spoke of it, to Great Britain. However, the events of the last six years have destroyed these illusions and for many of the unionist majority in Northern Ireland there is now a situation where they are not clear where they stand or where they belong.  They have not found, in the reactions of Britain, the kind of reactions they hoped and expected to find.  They have managed to live throughout those 50 years in the delusion that Britain stood where she stood not merely in the 19th century but in the 17th century.  They believe their own myths about the Protestant settlement in late 20th century Britain.  The discovery that these are myths has shaken them deeply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far they have not been able to find a new sense of identity and this has reinforced the basic fear and sense of insecurity from which they suffer.  I freely admit that trying to understand these phenomena as I know Deputy Brugha has tried to do in the many contacts he has had with people of all different political views in Northern Ireland, does not resolve the problem. <Col N="1991" /> But not understanding it and showing that one does not understand it, as I am afraid has happened too often in this part of the country, makes its resolution virtually impossible.  Every speech made in this House, or outside it, by a political speaker which does not show an understanding of the fears that underlie the problem of Northern Ireland enhances their sense of separateness from us, their sense of isolation. This is true of both sections of the community.  Both of them must feel as they read some strange statements emanating from here that they are isolated and separate; they must feel that Partition has eaten deeply into the soul of the south, the south is so unable to understand the North which up to 55 years ago was politically united to it.</P>
    <P>Not understanding the problem, therefore, is certainly fatal to a solution and any solution must be based on a true understanding of it. I am afraid that the Opposition have not shown themselves capable of the full understanding that would yield sensitive policies that would be helpful to a good outcome in Northern Ireland, and I speak in, I hope, measured terms.  There is a curious paradox that the party of men like Frank Aiken and Seán MacEntee have become so divorced from the North, so unable to understand what is going on there, have become such a southern party.  That is not true of all members of the party.  I pay ready tribute to Deputy Brugha and his understanding of the problem and of the need to keep in touch with people of all political views and to try to appreciate the problems as they see them.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that the Fianna Fáil statement published some time ago does not show the kind of understanding of the problem which would help to resolve it.  There is, as far as I am aware, no evidence that, as is implied in the policy statement of Fianna Fáil, sufficient calm and rationality exists in Northern Ireland for a statement of intent to withdraw on the part of Great Britain to produce any positive result or, indeed, to produce anything but a negative result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1992" /> It is interesting to note that in all that has been said by Opposition speakers at the time the statement was issued, and since, at no point has any attempt been made to produce evidence to this effect.  The nearest thing to an attempt to justify the Fianna Fáil policy in these terms was a bare statement by the Leader of the Opposition on 20th November, a bare assertion not backed up by any attempt at argument.  The Leader of the Opposition said that if the British declared their interest in uniting the Irish people then he believed the intransigence would begin to disappear. In dealing with a situation as dangerous to the lives of Irish people as that in Northern Ireland it is not sufficient merely to state such a belief and leave it at that.  If one is going to base a policy on an unsubstantiated belief in respect of which not an ounce of evidence has been produced, a belief so clearly against all the evidence of our eyes and ears, then one certainly is taking grave risks with Irish lives.</P>
    <P>It must be said that even if there was evidence to back up this belief that a statement of intent would lead to the disappearance of intransigence that one could deduce, one would need to be slow in relying on it when reliance upon it, should it prove illfounded, would have such disastrous consequences.  Let us have no illusions about what the consequences would be.  All the probabilities are that if the British Government stated their intention to withdraw, even in a phased way, that statement would unleash a completely new situation in Northern Ireland; it would unleash a race to control what would be left behind when Britain left.  To stop this it would not be sufficient that the withdrawal should be not precipitated but phased.  Much of the defence of the Fianna Fáil statement by Fianna Fáil speakers, such as it has been, has consisted of a denial that they ever proposed a precipitate withdrawal.  As I am not aware that anybody ever accused them of proposing a precipitate withdrawal there is not much point in denying what has never been asserted.</P>
    <P>We all know that the proposal is <Col N="1993" /> that there should be a statement of intent to withdraw in a phased manner. The problem is that that would create immediately a different situation and it requires great confidence in the rationality, calmness and restraint of political forces in Northern Ireland to think that faced with that statement to withdraw in a phased manner none of the political forces would react by seeking to preempt the consequences of that withdrawal and to ensure their own control when the withdrawal took place. No attempt has been made by any speaker on behalf of Fianna Fáil in any speech I read in the papers to validate this assumption that the statement of intent would in this way have this beneficial effect of leading to the disappearance of intransigence and would not have the effect of precipitating a lethal race to power, lethal above all, to the minority.</P>
    <P>We owe it to the Opposition to try to understand what their policy is and what it is they are trying to get at although at times I feel they do not understand it very well themselves. They have tried to argue that part of what is involved is that they want to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement, and so do we all.  In the second statement, if the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8th November gives a correct rendering, as I am sure it does, these words were placed in italics; presumably not just by <i>The Irish Times</i> but by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The statement was:</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the Fianna Fáil statement called, in the first place, on the British Government to <i>encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement.</i></P>
    <P>That is something to which we can all subscribe.  The only puzzling thing is, if I may say so, that the statement ignores the fact that such an indication of attitude by the British Government was given at Sunningdale in December, 1973, was secured in that negotiation by our Government.  The British Government said:</P>
    <P>If in the future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become <Col N="1994" /> part of a united Ireland, the British Government would support that wish.</P>
    <P>In reading the Fianna Fáil exegesis of their statement, there is a total denial, without any suggestion or hint, that unity should be secured by force.  There is an emphasis throughout these statements that unity can only come by consent.  Therefore, Fianna Fáil's statement about &ldquo;encouraging the unity of Ireland by agreement&rdquo;&mdash;they say they want the unity of Ireland by agreement, that they want the British Government to do this&mdash;cannot mean anything different from what the British Government did in September, 1973, when they said they would support any wish by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland to become part of a united Ireland.  If there is no other basis on which we or the Opposition, if I understand them correctly, would wish reunification to come about other than by agreement and consent, then there are no other terms in which we could speak validly about the British Government's indication of their support for Irish reunification.  We have their statement of support for the only kind of reunification we have been thinking about.  Then, two years later, to make it the issue that Fianna Fáil want the British Government &ldquo;to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement&rdquo;, when they have already agreed to support unity, is to make a dead issue a non-existent issue.  If the only problem was to get Britain to say they support the unity of Ireland, the whole problem would have been solved long ago, and it certainly would have been solved at Sunningdale.  Unfortunately, there is more to the problem than that.</P>
    <P>I also find on reading the initial statement and the supplementary statement on 7th November a curious difference of wording which at best is careless and dangerous and at worst is sinister.  I do not think I believe the worst about it.  Let us take the initial statement, the relevant phrase is:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil calls on the British Government to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement in independence and in harmonious relationship between the two islands, and to this end to declare Britain's commit- <Col N="1995" /> ment to implement an ordered withdrawal from her involvement in the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is quite clear.  However, that is not what was said on 7th November. What was said on 7th November is curiously different.  I will read it, including the words I have already read, continuing the rest of the paragraph:</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the Fianna Fáil statement calls in the first place on the British Government to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement.  When the British Government has done this, our statement went on to call on them to implement it by an ordered withdrawal from involvement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>  It was not to implement an ordered withdrawal, as in the first statement, but &ldquo;implement it&rdquo;.  This grammatically can only mean Irish unity.  Therefore, it is not a question of declaring a commitment to implement an ordered withdrawal or to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement.  That is only a first step, to be followed by the British Government implementing unity by an ordered withdrawal.  I do not understand the reason for the difference.  I hope it is carelessness, but it is a dangerous kind of carelessness because is suggests the aim is not merely that the British should withdraw and allow some mystical process of agreement to emerge without any violence or dissension in the optimistic scenario of the first Fianna Fáil statement, but that Britain herself should implement unity by this withdrawal &mdash;not that it be left to Irish people to do it but that Britain should do it. This suggests a considerable confusion of thought on the part of the Opposition in an area in which it is terribly important, as Deputy Lynch said, that anything that is said is in terms which are not oratorical and that do not arouse fear.</P>
    <P>I think it should be clear, and is clear from the reactions that took place following the Fianna Fáil statement, that the statement further overheated the atmosphere.  These indeed <Col N="1996" /> are the words Deputy Brugha used on 9th December when he said that such a declaration&mdash;that is, a British declaration of intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland&mdash;he would see as &ldquo;even further overheating the atmosphere&rdquo;, and he added:</P>
    <P>The situation is too grave for ordinary people, for anybody in my position, to be making that kind of statement.</P>
    <P>The problem is not to overheat the situation but to cool it.  Of course, cooling the atmosphere does not bring headlines, does not bring any adrenalin to the veins.  It is not a policy which you can shout from the housetops. It is, however, the only policy morally justifiable.</P>
    <P>When we come to look at the situation within Northern Ireland we will find that there is agreement among all parties on one thing&mdash;I will suggest in a few moments that there is agreement on a number of things&mdash;but there is agreement among all that devolution is needed.  I do not think anybody in Northern Ireland likes the idea of direct rule, and I can see why. Indeed, I do not think the Ministers who have the job of ruling Northern Ireland directly like it either.  There is no doubt that the problems of Northern Ireland are very different from any problems that exist in Britain.  The people there have their own way of looking at their problems, and direct rule from London even by Ministers who spend most of their time in Belfast cannot be a satisfactory solution in anything but the short term.</P>
    <P>But devolution from which the consent of one section is withheld is unworkable. We know this from experience of 50 years, and above all of the end of the sixties and the early seventies.  Therefore, the aim must be, with all necessary patience, to seek to create conditions in which self-government on a basis acceptable to the majority of both sections will emerge and in which the Executive or Government thus emerging in Northern Ireland and the Government here can work together in the common interests of the people of both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> Of course, if such a solution is delayed&mdash;it has been and it may yet be still further&mdash;there is always the temptation to look elsewhere for an answer; there is a natural human tendency to assume that to every problem there is here and now an answer. It is a very dangerous human tendency which sometimes leads people, when they see that certain solutions that have been tried are failing, to look elsewhere on the basis that if solutions A and B fail, there must be some other one that will succeed, and to choose solution C which may be much worse.  Sometimes there is not even a solution to a problem in the long term.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a solution will be found soon to this problem of providing self-government in Northern Ireland.  I hope so, the Government hope so and I know that the House hopes so.  The Government will do all that is possible to facilitate it.  We must be willing to facilitate such a solution should it in any way seem to be beginning to emerge.  We must be willing to facilitate it by looking at any proposal that comes from both sections of the community in Northern Ireland.  You may say that to expect any proposal to come from both sections is unduly optimistic, and perhaps it is, but let us not overlook the fact that different sections of the community in Northern Ireland have succeeded in agreeing on certain things.  They have agreed, as I have said already, on the need for devolution. None of them likes direct rule.  All of them feel there should be a Parliament, an Executive of some kind in Northern Ireland, consisting of Northern Ireland people, responsive to the needs of Northern Ireland and to the people of Northern Ireland.  They have agreed on more than that; the politicians of all parties elected to the Convention have agreed&mdash;and I shall not dwell on it&mdash; on the deficiencies of the Fianna Fáil statement.  They have agreed most recently on the desirability of retaining the offices of a chief constable which others, apparently, do not wish to retain.  They are agreed too on the economic and social policies needed in Northern Ireland.  That is something which has been common ground amongst them.  Therefore, let us not assume that it is impossible for the two <Col N="1998" /> sections of the community in Northern Ireland to agree on something.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that if they do at any stage show signs of being able to agree on a solution, if they turn to us and ask us here to help them implement that solution and to do things down here that would help towards that end, then I think we must be willing to help even if the things they ask are things that run counter to past positions which we, individually or as parties, have adopted; even if they run against fondly-held Southern beliefs or against local shibboleths in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I believe&mdash;and I am sure it is the view of most people in this House&mdash; that if there were the lineaments of a solution to be found, if one could see it emerging, that nothing here should stand in the way, that we should be willing to make any changes, legal or constitutional, changes in our way of thought and outlook, that may be necessary to help that solution be put into effect.</P>
    <P>Of course, all this may take time. We hope that it may be possible for the politicians who have been tackling this problem in recent months, looking at it again to find a way through the dilemmas that face them, to find a solution in the months ahead.  But it may take longer.  However long it takes several things are desirable in the interim: first, that direct rule, whether it lasts for months or, as could be necessary, for several years, be as sensitive as possible to the needs of Northern Ireland, that it be open to the views of elected politicians and that political activity should continue at provincial level.  There should never be allowed a vacuum in politics in Northern Ireland because, if there were to be a political vacuum&mdash;and 12 MPs, or even 20 in Westminster would not fill that vacuum&mdash;then it could only be filled by the forces of violence.  Direct rule, therefore, whether in the short or long term, must be made sensitive, as sensitive as it can be, to the needs of Northern Ireland and to the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Secondly, whether the solution takes a short time or a long time to find, in the meantime, it is essential <Col N="1999" /> that security measures be taken, North and South, to safeguard lives. As far as I am concerned, a British life is as valuable as an Irish life.  But if there are any in this House who think otherwise and who distinguish between lives according to the nationality of those who own them, let me point out that over 95 per cent of the lives lost in Northern Ireland this year have been Irish lives.  It is not good enough, I feel, that in this Parliament so little of the thrust of Opposition questions is about, as it should be, what more we can do to save lives in Northern Ireland.  That is the kind of pressure this Government should be under.  Not that we are not loyally endeavouring to fulfil our obligations in this respect but because this should be the conscientious wish of everyone in this House there should be pressure on us all the time to do better, but that is not always the kind of pressure we get.</P>
    <P>We get indignation, indignation which we all share on both sides of the House, about crossings of the Border, sometimes accidentally, perhaps sometimes not, by security forces in the North.  But the indignation is selective because, however much we may resent and object to, and however right we are to protest against such incursions when they occur, there is no equivalence between such an incursion and the murder of people in Northern Ireland. Yet the protests are loud in this House if a British patrol strays into the Republic, and I make my protest, certainly, to the British Government to endeavour to prevent such occurrences which, from any point of view, are undesirable.  But there is no equivalent volume of indignation against the constant toll of murder in Northern Ireland, no equivalent pressure on us to take more action on this front, to do more to try to prevent a further toll of deaths there.</P>
    <P>We, and the Government of the United Kingdom, have an absolute duty to do all in our power to hinder the para-militaries of whatever persuasion, these men who, whether Protestant or Catholic&mdash;though how one can apply religious names to them <Col N="2000" /> defies understanding&mdash;arrogate to themselves the right to murder.  There can be no dealings with such people in any civilised, democratic community. Both Governments must do all in their power to apprehend and put out of the way of doing harm members of these organisations.  As between the security forces in Northern Ireland&mdash;whatever the problems there have been with them over the last six years&mdash;and the para-militaries of either brand, there can be no question of a choice for us, no double standards.  There must be, and there is, full co-operation between the police forces of the two parts of this country to track down the para-militaries, whether they be UVF or UDA men coming to murder in Dublin or IRA men crossing the Border to murder in Northern Ireland.  I make no apology to any Irishman for saying that.</P>
    <P>However, I should like to say one brief word on the question of fugitive offenders, brief because the matter has been thoroughly thrashed out in a previous debate.  There is one point I should like to make which I think is not sufficiently appreciated in Northern Ireland or in Great Britain.  For two years now, almost to this day, the crime of murder and of being an accessory to murder, wherever that murder is carried out, is a crime in our law.  If any person commits a murder, or is an accessory to a murder in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland and he comes into this territory, he can be arrested here, tried here, convicted here and sent to prison here.  The scope of that provision will be widened when the Bill recently before this House is enacted.  But, even without enacting that Bill, that is the law and has been the law for two years.  I think I am entitled to make the point.  It is a point which I wish were understood better in Northern Ireland, that in two years we have received no requests from the authorities in Northern Ireland or in Britain to arrest any person on a charge of murder or accessory to murder, a murder committed within those two years.</P>
    <P>If there are such people in this part of the country, and if there is evidence against them in the hands of the <Col N="2001" /> authorities in Great Britain or Northern Ireland, they merely have to produce that evidence and, without going through any abortive procedure of extradition, these people can be tried here.  I must say that the fact that we have received no such request, that no such evidence has been submitted to us, seems to me to indicate that there cannot be very many of these murderers in this part of the country, for the very good reason that they are well aware, if they come down here, what can happen them.  But I think it is important that this point should be made and should be understood in Great Britain and in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would ask that, when we discuss this problem&mdash;whether in this or in another debate&mdash;there should be honesty in the discussion; there should be an avoidance of double standards.  A life is a life whether it is a Protestant or a Catholic life, a British life or an Irish life.  Above all, in everything we say and everything we do, we should show our concern for the people of Northern Ireland, whether Catholic or Protestant, who suffered so deeply and who have not always had the kind of deep understanding and sympathy from their fellow Irishmen here which, if the word &ldquo;Irishman&rdquo; means anything, they should have had.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister for Foreign Affairs drawing comparisons between the call recently made by the Fianna Fáil Party and the declaration in the Sunningdale Agreement, making it seem that what appeared in that declaration measured up to the requirement of the recent call from Fianna Fáil absolutely amazed me.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs quoted from our policy document and drew attention to the fact that the document had called on the British Government to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement and he went on to say that commitment by Britain was already written into the Sunningdale Agreement and, by way of comparison, quoted that if the majority of the Irish people wanted unity the British Government would support it.</P>

      <P>If the majority of the people in the North sought unity the British Government would support it. I think the Minister is drawing the long bow if he thinks that commitment and that statement measure up to the requirements of our policy document. Calling on the British Government to encourage the unity of Ireland by agreement and, following that declaration of encouragement, calling on the British Government to declare itself committed to an orderly withdrawal is a completely different thing.</P>

      <P>The Minister, as is his wont, plays with words.  I find it rather remarkable that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the man who appeared regularly on television, the man who contributed regularly to the newspapers, the one man who, in Opposition, had a solution for everything, should say here tonight that there is a dangerous human belief that there is always a solution to a problem.</P>

      <P>That was actually a dangerous human belief I had come to start believing, having been brainwashed by Deputy FitzGerald when he was in Opposition.  The Minister interjected to correct me; he said &ldquo;in the short term&rdquo;.  As a matter of fact, the Minister had the instant solution for everything.  Any problem that came up the Minister for Foreign Affairs went on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme and, &ldquo;Bob's your uncle&rdquo;, the problem was resolved before the programme was over.  All that was needed was an intelligent Minister in a particular Department.  After <Col N="2003" /> two-and-a-half years he now admits what the Leader of this party accused the Government of here today, of doing nothing, of coming up with no suggestion even of a solution.  The Government now, through their Minister for Foreign Affairs, frankly admit that, as they see it, there is no solution.</P>

      <P>They get their publicity material to condemn Fianna Fáil when they suggest a form of solution. We have it on the record now that, so far as the Government are concerned, they have absolutely no solution and we have the unfortunate Taoiseach coming in here this morning talking about a low profile. Mark you, if there is no solution to a problem it is the most natural thing in the world to present a low profile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government came into office a little over two-and-a-half years ago they had outlined a short few weeks previously what is now mistakenly known as the 14-point programme.  In that manifesto the Coalition parties were specific in their promises regarding jobs, prices, redundancies, rents, rates, social reform, taxes, housing, education, agriculture&mdash;in fact, the works.  Again the solution to all these problems. The Minister for Finance signed his name to that document, the document which specifically said the immediate aim of the new Government would be to stabilise prices. This programme was quoted at length here this afternoon by the Minister for Defence.  He unashamedly spelled it out and went on to say they were doing a brilliant job effectively stabilising prices, halting redundancies and reducing unemployment under their programme of planned economic development.  The Minister is obviously fully taken up with the work of his Department and it seems to me he is flying so high, literally and metaphorically, he does not know <Col N="2004" /> what is going on.  He is so out of touch he actually thought the Government had done something in regard to the stabilisation of prices.</P>
    <P>I am in a position to talk about this because it was I, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, who set up the National Prices Commission.  There had been increases in prices and the Coalition parties said they would stop increases in prices.  The hands of the National Prices Commission have not been strengthened in any way.  They are following exactly the same formula with one exception.  The reports submitted in my time were laid before the House.  We were told the amount of the increases recommended and sanctioned subsequently by the Minister, but now there is not so much publicity of the amount sanctioned and, when it is sanctioned, it is sanctioned by the National Prices Commission because the great Marxist could not have it suggested that he allowed prices to increase.  On top of that we have the special chapter every month in the National Prices Commission report showing how much the NPC have saved the people by not conceding all the increases sought.  We get, too, the monthly statement from the GIS showing how many millions the public would have had to pay over the 12-month period had the full amount sought been conceded.  The National Prices Commission were set up at the request of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and at the request of the Confederation of Irish Industry.  Both bodies felt that the Minister and the officials in charge of the prices section were not diligent enough in pruning the demands of industrialists and manufacturers for increased prices.</P>
    <P>Before the NPC were set up I was subjected continuously to complaints from industrialists who accused the prices section of the Department of being too strict in relation to the granting of what they considered legitimate price increases.  This view was often supported by the trade unions in cases where management said that their inability to secure a price increase would lead to loss of jobs.</P>
    <P>I agreed to set up the National Prices Commission and they have been <Col N="2005" /> doing a good job since.  However, it would be well to put on the record that before the commission were set up the relevant officials in the Department had been saving the consumers quite an amount of money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Defence talked about how successfully the NPC have effected the stabilisation of prices.  I do not think anybody but the Minister can believe that.  Today the Taoiseach talked about the cost-of-living index and the manner in which it had become controlled and corrected within the past six months.  Generally the Government are congratulating themselves in this regard.  Since mid-November they have upped the percentage increase compared with the last quarter to 2.8 per cent but I would draw the attention of the House to the fact that the index based on 100 in mid-November, 1968 is 219.9.  That means that our cost-of-living index is now more than 100 per cent higher than it was in 1968.  This does not surprise anybody.</P>
      <P>At the time of the last general election, mid-February, 1973, the consumer price index read 144.7.  That meant that the cost of living had increased by 44.7 per cent between mid-November, 1968, and mid-February, 1973.  Let us look at the situation since.  The Fianna Fáil Government were criticised for the increase of 44.7 per cent during that four-and-a-half-year period but the situation now is that after two-and-a-half years of Coalition Government there has been an increase in the cost of living of 52 per cent.  This represents a much greater increase in half the time.  Yet, the Minister for Defence who at one time had pretensions to being Minister for Industry and Commerce, has the audacity to tell the House that the Government have honoured their commitment to stabilise prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is getting back to the slick question.  Here he is again with his short-term solutions.  I am talking of an increase during a two-and-a-half-year period which included a three-month period during which there was a drop of 0.8.  This indicates how bad is the situation, a situation that has come about because of the failure of the Government to take action sooner, action which 12 months earlier we had advised them to take.  It was a case of the glamour boys being in Dublin now and the attitude was: &ldquo;Why should we believe poor George Colley; did not Deputy Garrett FitzGerald do him down on television in 1973?  What would our supporters think if we were to take the advice of such a man? How could such an apparently brilliant person as Deputy FitzGerald who, it was thought, was more fit for Finance than the man fancied for that office, stoop so low as to take advice from the greatest failure of all, Deputy Colley?&rdquo; However, 12 months later the Government realised their mistake and knew that they would have to accept the advice that had been offered by Deputy Colley.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs said at the Government meeting concerned that there was no solution to the problem in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the extended period of euphoria which followed the coming into power of this Government the country was damaged economically to such an extent that it will take an extraordinarily long time to correct the situation.  The Government have neither the capacity nor the ability to create a climate of recovery.  The unemployment figure is frightening. This brings me to the second major point in the Coalition's manifesto, the one relating to the halting of redundancies and of reducing unemployment. On 1st December, 1972&mdash;the last December that we were in power &mdash;there were 69,900 persons on the live register.  I use that date in order to make a comparison with the figure <Col N="2007" /> for the 5th December, 1975.  Not even the most optimistic of the Government speakers would say that the number has fallen in the 12 days since then.</P>
    <P>During 1973 I listened to wonderful speeches even from back benchers on the Government side telling us how they were tackling the unemployment problem.  It was a period of euphoria when they were spending the money we had so diligently saved up.  In comparison with the 69,000 people unemployed on 1st December, 1972, when we were in office, there were only 64,000 people unemployed on 7th December, 1973.  However, when the Government were living on their own fat in the following year the number of unemployed on 6th December, 1974, was 83,534, an increase of 19,000 on the figure for the previous December.  The public were still being reasonable; unfortunately, they are still being extremely reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course there are the glib speakers and I will concede that to the Parliamentary Secretary.  We now have the &ldquo;whiz kids&rdquo;.  There were 24 or 25 jet-propelled, or State-propelled, front bench spokesmen whizzing around West Mayo.  I am a democrat and I accept the decision of the people but that does not prevent me from trying to educate them, from trying to get the message across to them.  I am sorry the Minister for Foreign Affairs has left the House because I had a little puzzle for him &mdash;it is one of those things that he can do so very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation with regard to unemployment continued to deteriorate and on 5th December, 1975, the number of unemployed jumped from 83,534 to 109,208 and it is still rising. There was an increase of almost 20,000 from December, 1973, to December, 1974, and the Christmas present the Coalition Government have for the people this year will be an unemployment figure of 113,000.  That means that about one person in ten is registered as being out of work and I <Col N="2008" /> am not including school leavers.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister for Local Government is not present.  I am sure he knows the situation but he certainly is hiding the facts.  When Fianna Fáil left office in February, 1973, there were 13,697 people on the live register out of the building, contracting and construction works industries. However, with the amount of work and money Fianna Fáil had left on hand the number on the live register who were involved in the building industry dropped to 11,259 by mid-July, 1973&mdash;a drop of 2,400.  The Minister for Local Government found that because we had exercised prudence and balanced the budget that Fianna Fáil had a planned programme and he was able to introduce his crash programme.</P>
    <P>When we were in government I remember Deputy O'Connell regularly looked for a debate on what he called &ldquo;the building crisis&rdquo;.  The Minister for Local Government resolved that crisis by creating another.  He spent the money in that period and employed an additional 2,400 people. However, according to the latest statistics issued on 17th October, 1975, the number on the live register from the building, contracting and construction works industries was 22,050&mdash;double the figure of July, 1973.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give the figure for October, 1972?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not that information. I thought the appropriate figure was the one on the date we left office.  I should imagine the number would be less in October because generally the months of January, February and March are the worst periods for unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 14-point programme of the Coalition was all about employment. We were told we had some of the greatest geniuses ever to appear on the political scene.  Even I half believed the &ldquo;whiz kids&rdquo; would stabilise prices, halt redundancies and reduce unemployment.  They had been telling me for so long how to do it and they convinced more than half the people that they had the <Col N="2009" /> capacity to do the job.  I should like to quote from the report of the Confederation of Irish Industry in their Economic Review, autumn 1975. Under the heading of &ldquo;Building Materials Sector and Production&rdquo; they stated with regard to housing:</P>
    <P>The bulk of this fall has been in the private sector.  It is noteworthy that allocations from the public capital programme to the private sector have declined by almost 4 per cent in real terms over the period 1973-74 to 1975, despite a 50 per cent increase in current terms.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Local Government tells us we are getting more for our money but we are getting much less. The report also stated that, &ldquo;another useful indicator of building activity are domestic cement sales&rdquo;.  Deputy Dowling tried to get this message across to Deputy Coughlan some time ago but he had some difficulty.  The report further stated:</P>
    <P>The cement sales show a decrease of approximately 10 per cent for the first nine months of 1975 over the corresponding period for 1974, and are almost 14 per cent down on the same period in 1973.</P>
    <P>Fewer people are working and less cement and timber are being used. Still, the Minister for Local Government who projects himself regularly as the one man in the House who has been proved to be honest and to have told the truth says he is telling the truth when he tells us that more houses are being built.</P>
    <P>I quote the CII report again:</P>
    <P>By far the largest single industry to be hit by unemployment in the 12 months up to the middle of last September&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that is, September, 1975</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;has been the building and construction industry and in that period the industry was forced to shed some 8,152 workers.</P>
    <P>This confirms the figures I gave.  They go on to say:</P>
    <P>Of these, 7,251 were employed in general building, construction and <Col N="2010" /> repair work.  These figures take no account of reduced overtime and short time working.</P>
    <P>That is a very important factor.  On page 12, under the heading &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo;, they say:</P>
    <P>The present Government has tended to adopt an unyielding attitude to the construction industry, rarely acknowledging that the industry was experiencing difficulties.</P>
    <P>I shall not develop that except to say that the Confederation of Irish Industry in their written report in the Economic Review, August 1975, believe as I do that the Minister for Local Government is not coming clean.  They have spelt out that the construction industry has been the largest single industry that has been hit.  Unemployment in the manufacturing industry at 13 per cent is extremely alarming.</P>
    <P>Since January, 1974, the number employed in manufacturing industry has dropped by an estimated 18,000 persons.  That has wiped out all the gains we had been making over the last seven years.  Industrial output has fallen by 8 per cent since the middle of last year and the position is that even if the growth rates in output and employment achieved in the earlier part of the decade were to be resumed immediately it would take about five years to get back to last year's level of employment in manufacturing industry which was only half of that of our main trading partners.</P>
    <P>The changes that have occurred over the last 18 months have highlighted the fundamental weaknesses in the structure of our economy which must now be rectified.  First, direct manufacturing costs have risen much more rapidly here than elsewhere. This has obvious implications when we are operating in a large free trade area during a period of recession such as we are going through.  Secondly, the cost of overheads services continues to rise rapidly during a period when industry has to cut back output because of falling demand. Thirdly, new commitments for industrial development have slowed considerably because of the rapid decline <Col N="2011" /> in profitability and lack of confidence on the part of industrialists.  This lack of confidence is one of the major things from which we are suffering at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the 40,000 school leavers.  There is no provision for them.  The national work force is probably increasing at the rate of about 30,000 per annum.  On the other hand, employment in manufacturing industry has declined by over 15,000 in the last year and this downward trend is continuing and there does not seem to be any sign of a halt to that downward trend.</P>
    <P>We are certainly going to reach a figure much greater than 110,000 unemployed. A big problem is that retained earnings in industry are probably down by at least 75 per cent in real terms on 1974.</P>
    <P>I do not see how the Government can pull themselves up through the format they are at present adopting in this regard.  The published data over the first two quarters of this year in relation to production rates in manufacturing industry show an extremely alarming situation.  In the first quarter of this year the volume of manufacturing output was 9½ per cent lower than in the corresponding period in 1964 at a stage when we wanted increased output.  In the second quarter there was a similar graph with the volume of manufacturing output at 8.5 per cent lower than in the corresponding period of 1974.</P>
    <P>There was one extraordinary feature about the Taoiseach's contribution this morning.  I was handed a copy of the Taoiseach's speech this morning.  On page 3 of the original version there was to be a statement by the Taoiseach that seasonally adjusted data for output in manufacturing and mining showed that the level of production in the first quarter of 1975 was maintained in the second quarter.  That proposed statement, after the words had been printed on page 3, had to be wiped out by his officials on the basis of somebody checking it through before he came into the House and saying, &ldquo;You cannot <Col N="2012" /> say that because you cannot stand over it.&rdquo;  It is a good thing that we have one man in the Government who arranges with his officials to cross out something that he cannot stand over. I wish we could say the same for all of them.  That was crossed out.  It had to be done this morning and I suppose the time factor precluded the printing of a new page.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record that the reason why the Taoiseach could not make that statement this morning is that the figure was 8.5 per cent lower than in the corresponding period in 1974.  I hope the figures for the third and fourth quarters will not show a similar trend.  I am fearful that they will.</P>
    <P>There is the shocking situation that almost every firm in the country&mdash; there may be a few that are going reasonably well&mdash;can report spare production capacity.  The clothing, footwear, textile, wood and furniture sectors continue to show alarming increases in unemployment and are being joined in that situation by the metal and engineering sectors which had been hanging on reasonably well up to now.</P>
    <P>Against this background the IDA have been struggling to create jobs and to prevent the number of unemployed from increasing disastrously.  I have had experience of the work of the IDA and of CTT.  I know how dedicated the officials of these bodies are, particularly the overseas representatives who work night and day to attract industry here in order that we will have exports. On the export side a number of firms are succeeding despite the competition that is generated by the inflation from which we are suffering.</P>
    <P>A very short time ago when I stood on the other side of the House as Minister for Industry and Commerce and talked in terms of grants and capital development and tried to defend the expenditure of anything from £2,000 to £3,000 on the creation of a job, the knowledgeable people who at that time were on this side of the House could not understand why I could not create jobs at a lesser figure.  I am not making any reflection on the Parliamentary Secretary sitting opposite me.  I regret that the mathematical genius, the Minister <Col N="2013" /> for Foreign Affairs, has left because I wanted him to do this sum. The Taoiseach, this morning, in dealing with the Industrial Development Authority, said:</P>
    <P>In the sphere of manufacturing industry, the promotion campaign of the Industrial Development Authority continues to be successful. The job potential of new projects approved this year will be about 17,000 and the total investment involved will amount to about £320 million.</P>
    <P>Later on he spoke about having to borrow £700 million to keep the country going.  I do not want to go on record as criticising the IDA but I wonder where we are going.  I did this quick sum and that is why I was anxious to have the mathematical genius to help me.  When I divided £17,000 into £320 million I was frightened at the answer.  I got £18,823. The Taoiseach comes into the House, claps himself on the back, compliments the IDA and I presume will compliment the Minister for Industry and Commerce because that part of the Taoiseach's script would have been prepared by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce is another man who only wanted to get across the House to pull it out of the depths into which the Fianna Fáil fellows put it.  The ordinary man down the country wonders how the country can survive with 110,000 unproductive people getting the dole.  On the other hand, the Government are borrowing from the Arabs, the Germans or whereever the Minister for Finance can traipse with his valise.  We are borrowing large sums in order to spend £18,823 on creating an IDA job. After doing that sum I found later in the Taoiseach's speech what he described as another encouraging feature:</P>
    <P>Another encouraging feature of the 1975 performance, despite the recession, is the remarkable level of industrial investment by existing domestic industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour said earlier today that there were some well-off <Col N="2014" /> firms who would be paying equal pay to women workers on the 1st January. Obviously he knows all the well-off firms.  The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>In the first eight months of this year the IDA have approved proposals from domestic industry involving a total fixed asset investment of £127 million and a job potential of £5,500.</P>
    <P>I again found myself doing my sums. We know from tradition that the poor Irish investor is never as fairly dealt with as the foreign one.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputies, county councillors and even men with proposals to start making concrete blocks, some metal work products or something else used come to me and say: &ldquo;How is it that it is so hard to get a grant from the Government? If it was a German who was looking for a grant he would only have to walk in and he would be asked how much he wanted.&rdquo; I know that has changed but we are creating 5,500 jobs at a cost of £127 million.  After doing my sum I found that while the previous one worked out at £18,823 this worked out at £23,090 to create a job.  I hope the Minister for Industry and Commerce will contribute to this debate and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will convey my query to him.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach opens this debate. I always thought he should reply to it but for some reason or other he does not.  I hope, if it is the Minister for Finance who is replying, if he has returned from one of his borrowing expeditions, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that this issue can be cleared up. The traditional accepted thing was that it cost £2,000 to £3,000 to create an industrial job in this country.  We now find that it costs the figure I just quoted.  I am sure the Taoiseach's speech was checked to make sure there was no mistake. This was let through, so it must be the truth.  We should be told it is recognised as official policy to spend £23,000 on the creation of an industrial job.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> I am fully satisfied that if that type of money was invested in agriculture it would produce a great many more jobs for a lot less money properly invested.  The Government should look seriously at this.  There is a sympathetic note floating around, which is capitalised on by the Government, that Ireland's economic difficulties have been caused by outside interests. This was an often repeated statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce until the Taoiseach thought so much of it that he came into the House and said the direct opposite.  The apparent legitimacy of this notion, apart from what the Taoiseach said, must fall when we consider that while other European countries have successfully overcome most of their economic difficulties Ireland has gone further and further along the road to economic decline.  The dependence that has been displayed by this Government on international governments to do the work this Government were elected to do is now clearly seen to be spineless and a red herring course they have been following.</P>
    <P>This evening we had the Minister for Defence blaming the sheiks for having created problems in this regard.  The Government are still playing the old game.  The Taoiseach, in his report on the Rome Summit meeting, said in the House on the 4th December, 1975:</P>
    <P>It is particularly noteworthy that the rate of inflation in Germany in the year to November, 1975 was of the order of 5 or 6 per cent.  Our figure is more than three times that level.  I cannot emphasise strongly enough the conclusions, reinforced by the discussions in Rome, that we will have no prospect of being able to benefit by the upturn in world trade if we cannot sell what we produce; and this we will most certainly be unable to do unless we can make our prices competitive. Growth, employment and the prosperity of our country depends on this.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach on that day, taken away for once from the euphoria to which I have already referred, of <Col N="2016" /> being persuaded at his Cabinet table how well things have gone and how well the Minister for Defence, as he said today, had seen prices stabilise and redundancies and unemployment halted, had to go to Rome to learn that the other countries had come to grips with the situation but that we were away down the line.  He had to appear since on television and we had his speech today again reiterating this demand.  He found himself today in the position of having to say:</P>
    <P>At all events, it seems likely that we may not be able to draw a great deal of benefit from the international recovery until towards the end of next year.  It is going to be a tough year and we have to face up to that.  We are balanced on the knife edge between even greater depression or&mdash;if we act sensibly&mdash; recovery.</P>
    <P>He goes on to talk in terms of the manner in which they want to act sensibly.  He ends with the same old jazz of appeal, appeal, appeal.  When will this Government recognise their responsibility and try to put this country back on its feet?  Before he went into the appeal he said that the prospective deficit on the current budget is now almost £280 million, more than twice the budgeted figure of £125 million, and the total Government borrowing at home and abroad will be in the order of £700 million as against the £450 million originally intended. The &ldquo;whiz kids&rdquo; budgeted for a debt. The Minister for Finance came here last year and pooh-poohed the idea that anybody could be more factual; he was budgeting for a deficit of £450 million and by the end of this year we would be back on an even keel and at the head of the league because we had the Minister for Industry and Commerce regularly saying, every time a question was asked on employment, production or exports: &ldquo;You must remember that when we took over in March, 1973 the Irish were at the bottom of the table and we are now two or three from the top.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were being blinded by a most efficient propaganda machine of Government Ministers with very efficient Government Information Services. <Col N="2017" /> Now the Taoiseach tells us that unless we do something and pull up our socks, the economy of the country next year&mdash;unless something extraordinary happens&mdash;will cost £1,300 million.  Yesterday we had headlines in the newspapers about a £100 million loan, one-thirteenth part of the bill.  We have the doubtful consolation&mdash;I think it may be a disaster &mdash;that it is people in Europe who are now telling us how we must spend that money.  As a member of a former Government and a prospective member of a future one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am very serious.  When we were entering Europe I heard Deputy Oliver Flanagan, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government, who opposed entry to the EEC, telling us that if we entered Europe Europeans would be telling us what to do and that we would have to play ball with them because this would only be a kind of county council.  We declared that was not so, that we would be our own bosses.  The country has now gone so much into pawn as a result of the operations of an inefficient Government that the EEC, even though we boasted so much about our presidency for a six-month period, the people who are our guarantors in Europe in respect of the £100 million that we are borrowing have so little faith in the Coalition Government that part of the specific requirements as regards our getting this loan is that they tell us how to spend it.  They know the Government are incapable of spending it properly in the national interest themselves. This is a disaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to repeat that, as our spokesman Deputy Colley has consistently said about the Government's economic approach, this is a crazy paradox.  We are borrowing money from the Arabs; we are desperately in need of investment but we steer wealth away with our wealth tax.  We need initiative but we frown <Col N="2018" /> on enterprise and introduce a capital gains tax.  We never needed more productivity so badly and we tax the producers out of existence.  I have been studying the working of the Government over the past three years. We had faults but the brazenness of the Government still insisting that they are making a good job of running the country in a situation when their Taoiseach had to say here this morning: &ldquo;We would need to borrow £1,300 million to keep the country going over the next 12 months&rdquo;&mdash; is hard to beat.  I think that is the greatest castigation the Government could ever get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain admiration for Deputy Lalor's fort-rightness and his honesty about the defects in the previous Government. I think he would agree that perhaps the greatest defect was that they were in power too long.  Any Government that are in power for 16 years in a democratic society are in power too long.  I hope that the present Government will not repeat that performance and be in power for 16 years: I would not like to see it.  If the public were smart enough they would almost alternate Governments and get the best of all worlds by having one party competing with another.</P>
      <P>At present we have an opportunity of reviewing the performance of the Government over the past year, a sad year and a bad year for the country. The country faces a very serious economic situation and there must be agonising moments for the Government, faced with the gloomy prospect of increasing unemployment, decreased production and increasing debt and no real sign of an upturn in the economy.  I can appreciate the difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard and read speeches by the Opposition and I confess to a certain feeling of despondency at some of the speeches because it is not good enough that any Opposition party should merely categorise the mistakes made and engage in destructive criticism. I expected&mdash;I was sadly disillusioned that the Leader of the Opposition and his spokesmen did not <Col N="2019" /> offer&mdash;constructive proposals.  When we were in Opposition we did offer such proposals.  We pointed out what was wrong and showed where the Government were making mistakes or were oblivious of problems and we followed that up with constructive proposals which I may say the Government then accepted.</P>
    <P>I was saddened by not hearing constructive criticism from the Opposition today.  It is bad for the country that we have an ineffective Opposition &mdash;and I am casting no slur on individual members of the Opposition.  It is also bad for a Government that there is ineffective Opposition.  A Government become very arrogant if they do not have an effective Opposition telling them what to do and unfortunately this is sadly lacking at present.  I should like more constructive <Col N="2020" /> proposals: if the Government are not doing something the Opposition should let the country see that they could do it.  That is the only way to make a Government conscious of the need to govern in the best interests of all.  I have criticised the Government and I have been branded for criticising them but on each occasion I put forward constructive proposals. I am not afraid to criticise and to condemn them when I feel they are doing wrong.  I always legitimise that by offering constructive proposals over and over again because that is the only way we can get them to meet the needs of the people.</P>
